Mr. President, this morning the Senate will conduct a \nperiod of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each. The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for the \nweekly party conferences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate go back into morning business \nbeginning at 2:15 p.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. At least one rollcall vote will occur during today's \nsession between 4 and 5 p.m.\n  It is my intention to take up the railroad retirement bill today. We \nwill make a motion to proceed to the bill shortly. After we dispose of \nthe railroad retirement bill, my hope is that we can take up the farm \nbill. We are going to be taking both of these bills up, waiting for the \nDefense appropriations bill to be sent here from the House. We are not \nsure yet when that will be. My hope is it will be sometime before the \nend of this week.\n  Appropriations Committee chairman Senator Byrd has made it clear it \nis his intention to take up the bill in committee as quickly as \npossible, and then we will be prepared to take up the Defense \nappropriations bill as soon as or shortly after the Appropriations \nCommittee has acted.N O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2002, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $422 per year or $211 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $5.00 per copy.

DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S12018]]\n\n  In addition to that, our hope is to take up the economic stimulus \npackage. That is very important legislation that we hope we can finish \ncertainly before the end of this session. The conference reports on \nappropriations--there are four conference reports still outstanding. We \nwill want to address those as quickly as possible.\n  I also inform my colleagues that the Judiciary Committee is prepared \nto report out, as I understand, nine judicial nominees, including one \ncircuit court nominee, this week. We will be taking up those nominees \nas soon as the committee has reported them out, in addition to other \nnominations.\n\n  I have not mentioned the terrorist insurance bill, the port security \nbill, counterterrorism, or bioterrorism legislation. There is a lot of \nwork left to be done. My hope is we can complete our work on all of \nthose pieces of legislation prior to the time we depart for the \nChristmas holidays.\n  Once again, the issue of energy has come up on a number of occasions. \nFor good reason, it is a very important piece of legislation. The House \nhas acted on an energy bill. We need to act as well. I have indicated \nit was my plan to take it up as soon as many of the issues relating to \nthe response to the terrorist attack of September 11 could be resolved. \nOf course, we are still dealing with many of those issues right now.\n  We also are continuing to deal with what I think most Senators would \nagree is must-pass legislation; that is, the array of appropriations \nbills that have yet to be completed.\n  It is for that reason I don't know that we will have an opportunity \nto complete our work on an energy bill before the end of this session. \nI am prepared to commit to taking up the energy bill prior to the \nFounders Day recess; that is, during that first work period, between \nJanuary 22 and the time we break for the Founders Day recess.\n  We ought to recognize that this bill is important. It is \ncomprehensive, but it is also controversial. We are going to have to \nleave some time for debate on the legislation. It is my intention--and \nI intend to be more clear as I know what remains of this session when \nwe come back--regardless of whatever additional legislation may be \nrequired to be considered in that first block of time, my \ndetermination, my commitment will be that we raise this issue, debate \nit, and have a good opportunity to consider energy legislation prior to \nthe Founders Day break.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask Senator Daschle, is he through?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am not through. I have a statement I will be making \nabout further issues to be considered and raised. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I would like to \nask some questions about the anticipated schedule he just outlined \ntoday.\n  One thing he didn't mention was the Education conference report. I \nunderstood that some progress had been made in that area. It is one we \nhave been working on all year. Certainly, trying to make a Federal \ncommitment to improving education throughout America with more \naccountability and better education in general is something we all want \nto work toward. Did the Senator intend to indicate, by not mentioning \nit, that it is not likely to happen, or does he have any information on \nwhat we might anticipate on the Education conference report?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I had a good conversation with the chairman of the \nEducation Committee last night. He has given me a progress report. \nClearly, if the conference completes its work, I want to bring up the \neducation bill. Clearly, that is an issue of great import, as the \nSenator has noted. It is one that deserves the attention and priority \nof Congress and would be reflected in the schedule.\n  I did not list it simply because the conference has not completed its \nwork, but if it completes its work, I will certainly be interested in \npursuing an opportunity to take it up on the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, if that work is \nnot completed, the majority leader does not anticipate that would \ninterfere with the ability of the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations \nconference committee to complete its work?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. We have to complete the work of \nthe appropriations process. Certainly that is an issue that has to be \nresolved.\n  Mr. LOTT. With regard to the Defense appropriations bill, that is the \nonly appropriations bill that has not been considered on the floor of \nthe House or the Senate while the other four conferences are continuing \nto work. I want to clarify when it is the Senator's intention to bring \nup the Defense appropriations bill.\n  I assume the House is going to begin work on it today and maybe \ncomplete action on it by tomorrow. We would then be able to go to it, I \npresume, Thursday or Friday. What is the majority leader's thinking on \nthe Defense appropriations bill? Obviously, that is a very important \nbill because it provides the funds that are needed for the defense of \nour country at a time when, obviously, that is very important. It is \nbeing used in that very important engagement in Afghanistan, and it \nalso contains the final $20 billion for aid as a result of the \nSeptember 11 events.\n  I am just concerned if we do not go to it as soon as is possible, \nthat is the one of two things that will delay our ability to complete \nour work at least for this session of Congress.\n  Can the majority leader clarify more for the Senators what we might \nexpect on the Defense appropriations bill?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The distinguished Senator is absolutely correct. This is \na critical piece of legislation. We have been waiting for the House to \nproduce a bill on which we can begin working. They have had some \ndifficulty in arriving at a consensus.\n  As I understand it, as the Senator has noted, the House now does plan \nto make another effort at reaching a consensus this week. Just as soon \nas the bill is sent here, I am quite sure the Appropriations Committee \nwill take it up in their committee, and then at some point shortly \nafter that, whenever that time may be, it would be my intention to \nbring it to the Senate floor for debate and passage.\n  Since we do not know exactly when the House will be able to send us a \nbill, it is not as clear to me when we can move on the Senate side, but \njust as soon as we have a bill, we will move.\n  Mr. LOTT. I had hoped Senator Murkowski would be able to be here--I \nunderstand he is actually on the way in to the Capitol at this time--\nand other members of the Energy Committee who have been very concerned \nthat we have not taken up national energy policy legislation before \neven now.\n  From what the majority leader is saying, it is his intent not to have \nan energy bill considered this year--at least he is not going to call \none up--but he indicated he would call a bill up after we come into \nsession, presumably January 22, in that 3-week period before the \nFounders Day recess period. Mr. President, is that what the Senator is \nsaying at this point? He is not making any kind of commitment as to \ngetting a product--I did not hear him indicate what product that might \nbe because the Energy Committee, I do not believe, has actually \ncompleted work on the bill.\n\n  I guess the majority leader's intent would be to rule XIV some bill \nand call it to the floor under that procedure. Is that what his \nthinking is? I just want to clarify that as much as possible.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely correct. We intend to bring up \nfor purposes of debate and amendments and consideration a bill we will \nintroduce next week. It will be rule XIV'd. It will be brought to the \nfloor.\n  As the Senator knows, not just the Energy Committee, but the Finance \nCommittee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, and I think even the Armed Services Committee have \nall played a role in the creation of this comprehensive, multifaceted \nenergy policy. Because it is so multifaceted and multijurisdictional, \nwe chose to put a proposal together that will allow the Senate to work \nits will on energy policy during that period of time.\n  That bill will be, as I say, introduced next week, available to all \nSenators for the period we are not in session. It would be my \nexpectation we would take the bill up--not only my expectation, but my \ncommitment that we will take the bill up during that first work period.\n\n[[Page S12019]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. It is of great concern to me and a number of Senators that \nwe are not going to be able to consider an energy policy for our \ncountry before the end of the year, especially in view of the fact we \nsee now continuing uncertainty about what is going to be done by the \nOPEC countries.\n  I have a great deal of concern that we are dependent on Iraqi oil and \neven Russian oil, although Russia clearly has been helpful in this \ninstance in not cutting the supply which would drive up the prices at a \ncritical time.\n  I think we should have already done an energy bill, and we should do \none before we go out. I believe once we actually get on to an energy \nbill, many portions of it can be handled rather expeditiously. Clearly, \nthere is a disagreement about oil production in ANWR, and we will have \nto work through that with a vote or votes just to see what happens.\n  While we are being told we are not going to do an energy bill, I \nunderstand the majority leader's intent now is to call up the railroad \nretirement bill which has not been reported from the Finance Committee \nand clearly is not an emergency, even though it does have support on \nboth sides of the aisle. It is your intention to try to call up the \nrailroad retirement bill today; is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. The railroad retirement bill has \n74 cosponsors. It is overwhelmingly supported on both sides of the \naisle. I do not recall the exact vote in the House, but it passed \noverwhelmingly in the House. I know well over 300 House Members voted \nfor it.\n  This is a matter of great concern to a lot of railroad retirees. We \nwere hoping that while we wait for the Defense appropriations bill, we \ncould take up a couple of pieces of legislation that deserve \nconsideration, and that certainly is one of them.\n  Mr. LOTT. And the other one is Agriculture, even though the \nagricultural law for the country does not expire until next year. This \nbill came out of committee. Even though it was reported on a voice \nvote, I think the critical vote was pretty much a party-line vote.\n  There are a lot of problems with this legislation. I do not see that \nit could be handled quickly with all the different problems that are in \nthis bill. So the majority leader's intent would be to try to go to \nrailroad retirement today and then Agriculture after that, and then go \nto the Department of Defense appropriations bill after those two?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. All of that is building up to one critical question: Where \nis the stimulus bill? If we really want to help the unemployed in this \ncountry with their unemployment benefits and health benefits and to \nstimulate the economy with some provision that would give a quick jump-\nstart to the economy, including possibly this idea that Senator \nDomenici has been proposing, which would be a payroll holiday during \nDecember which would have a tremendous immediate impact for employees \nand employers and come at a critical time of the season--it sounds to \nme as if the Senator's intent is just to shuttle the stimulus bill off \nto the side with no indication as to when it may come back and, as a \nmatter of fact, if you try to go to railroad retirement and do not get \nconsent, I presume the majority leader would file a motion to proceed. \nThat would be fully debatable. You would file cloture, and there would \nbe a vote on it on Thursday, I presume. Then we would be off the \nstimulus bill. So the stimulus bill would be not only moved off to the \nside, it would be completely brushed aside.\n  It looks as if, to me, for the defense of our country and to help the \neconomy of this country, the two bills we ought to be focusing on are, \nobviously, Defense appropriations, which the Senator has indicated we \nwant to try to do, and the stimulus bill ahead of anything else.\n  I wish to express my concern we should not be doing anything else \nuntil we get an agreement worked out on the stimulus bill. I still am \nan optimist that we can come to an agreement on the stimulus bill that \nwould help the unemployed and help those who need health benefits in \nthis country and provide a boost to the economy in a quick fashion that \nwould provide positive, immediate benefits without long-term negative \neffects and would actually encourage growth in the economy.\n  So I wanted to express my concern about that, and I hope as the day \nprogresses and we go over into tomorrow we will continue to work to \nfind a way to get that done.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could respond to the Senator from Mississippi \nbefore he leaves, I will ask him a question. He asks: Where is the \nstimulus bill? I remind him, prior to the Thanksgiving recess, the \nRepublicans defeated cloture on the stimulus bill. They are \nfilibustering the stimulus bill as we speak.\n  There is one way to break that filibuster and to get on with ensuring \nwe can get a stimulus package even this week. I ask the Senator from \nMississippi if he would sit down with me and with our Republican and \nDemocratic colleagues in the House and negotiate a package that \naddresses homeland security and revenue tax reduction, and do it this \nafternoon. If he is willing to agree to a meeting of that kind--which \nthey have not been willing to agree to so far--we can get to work and \nget an agreement certainly before the end of the week.\n  Will the Senator from Mississippi agree to do that?\n  Mr. LOTT. I certainly would be more than delighted to sit down with \nthe members of the Finance Committee in the Senate and the Finance \nCommittee in the House to work on a stimulus package that would provide \nimmediate growth in the economy.\n  As the Senator knows, unfortunately the bill that came out of the \nFinance Committee came out on a straight party-line vote, and when the \nbill came to the Senate, an additional $15 billion in spending--I \nbelieve that is the right number--had been added for homeland security, \nwhich I think is certainly a debatable issue as far as its stimulative \neffect is concerned.\n  It might be argued some of those funds might be needed at some point, \nalthough those funds have not been requested by the administration. \nThere have been no committee hearings, that I know of, that have \njustified that expenditure. Therefore, to have a negotiation on \nappropriations is not the way to proceed. We should proceed on the bill \nthat came out of the Finance Committee.\n  There was not a cloture vote. The vote was on a point of order, as I \nunderstand it, which does require 60 votes, because this bill in its \npresent form clearly exceeds the budget.\n  I made several efforts, and so has the Senator from South Dakota, I \nbelieve, before the recess to see if we could get the negotiations \nstarted immediately between the House and the Senate. For a variety of \nreasons, I guess, that did not happen, partially because it was a \ncontinuing demand to have negotiations on this additional $15 billion, \nwhich can be added to other bills. I understand it may be offered as an \namendment, either in committee or on the floor, to the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could clarify, because I think the Senator has put \nhis finger on exactly the issue. The Democratic position on economic \nstimulus is--and the economists have all verified this--there are two \nways to stimulate the economy. One is through spending, and our \nhomeland security package would provide spending for bioterrorism, for \nlaw enforcement, for an array of very specific needs. In fact, the \nDirector of Homeland Security said there is a specific array of needs \nhe should have, and he would like to have them sometime next year. What \nwe are saying is if they are important next year, they ought to be \nimportant this year. We are saying that is part of it.\n\n  The other is tax reduction. Is the distinguished Republican leader \nsaying that as long as homeland security is part of our package, they \nwill refuse to have the meeting to find some resolution to this issue?\n  Mr. LOTT. The principles I thought we were proceeding on were: We \nwanted to have a stimulus package that would have an immediate effect, \nnot one that would have an effect 6 months or 1 year from now; also, it \nwould not have negative long-term effects, such as driving up the \ndeficit significantly and therefore eventually affecting interest \nrates; and it would have an immediate stimulative effect.\n\n[[Page S12020]]\n\n  We believe adding $15 billion on top of the additional expenditures \nthat were added in the Finance Committee--and I am not sure what the \ntotal amount of money was that was added in spending in the Finance \nCommittee, but it probably would put it in the range of $20 billion to \n$25 billion in additional expenditures, which is not the way to \nstimulate the economy. Again, it may be argued that at some point it \nshould be considered separately.\n  The President has indicated that when they need additional funds, \nthey will ask for additional funds. The President has specifically said \nthey do not need these additional funds at this time. As I noted a \nwhile ago, there have been no hearings on this, but as long as there is \nan effort to turn this into another major spending bill, that is a \nproblem. We should sit down and negotiate on the bill that came out of \nthe Finance Committee and work out an agreement. That is the way to go, \nand that is what we are going to insist on. We are ready to do that at \nany time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I know there are a lot of Senators who wish to speak, \nbut the Republican position is that so long as Democrats hold a view \nthat in addition to tax cuts and whatever can be generated \nlegislatively from the Finance Committee, that there is a very \nlegitimate need for immediate additional commitment to homeland \nsecurity, fighting bioterrorism, fighting the array of challenges we \nface in defending our infrastructure, making sure people have adequate \nlaw enforcement to deal with the array of challenges we face even at \nthe local law enforcement level--so long as that is part of our \neconomic stimulus package, the Republican caucus is refusing to meet. \nThat is the issue.\n  So far, they have also refused to even deliberate on a bill that \nallows consideration of that, given their points of order or whatever \nother choices of parliamentary devices are available to them. So that \nis the issue.\n  I have offered three alternatives. Let us have a good debate. Let us \ndecide what we are going to do in the Senate. Let us have a meeting to \nsee if we can resolve both the spending and the revenue side. That was \nunacceptable.\n  I suggested then let us have separate meetings, one for \nappropriations. If their position is it ought to be zero and our \nposition is it ought to be $15 billion, perhaps if there is a real \ndesire to compromise and work this out to resolve our differences, we \nought to be able to find some middle ground between zero and fifteen. \nThe Republicans are saying, no, we do not even want to meet so long as \nthat is an issue. So they are not willing to agree to separate meetings \nto talk about revenue and appropriations.\n\n  Finally, I suggested, if we take it up as an amendment to the Defense \nappropriations bill once it comes to the Senate and have a good debate \nabout that, can we be guaranteed the Republicans will not use whatever \nparliamentary device may be chosen to deny the majority the opportunity \nto pass that? Again, they could not provide us with that assurance.\n  I know the distinguished Republican leader's suggestions are sincere \nand heartfelt. We have had many private conversations about the belief \nthat he and I could probably work something out. He has a caucus to \nwork with, and so do I. We do our best to try to represent our \ncaucuses, but the Republican caucus has made it quite clear they are in \nno hurry to pass economic stimulus so long as economic stimulus is \ndefined as, at least in part, an investment in homeland security. Never \nmind that it was reported in the Washington Post last week that the \nadministration has $127 billion of homeland security needs that are \nunattended right now. Never mind that the Director of Homeland Security \nsaid we have to have a lot more money, a lot more resources in homeland \nsecurity than what we have right now.\n  He said, I am going to propose a supplemental next year. We are \nsaying that if it is needed next year, and if the serious recognition \nof the need for homeland security is evident to him now, why do we wait \nuntil next year to deal with something we ought to do now? Especially \nwhen it involves improving the confidence level of the American people \nso they will lead their lives normally and restore this economic \nvitality that was so much a part of the last 8 years.\n  I will work with the Republican leader to try to find a way to \nresolve this impasse. As I said, we are willing to sit down anytime, \nunder any circumstances, and meet, so long as both pieces are on the \ntable. That is the Democratic caucus position. To my knowledge, it is \nshared by virtually every member of our caucus. So we will continue to \ntry to work through that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield for a comment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I remember when the majority leader was minority leader \nand also trying to protect President Clinton. He did an outstanding job \nin so many ways. Well, President Bush has already said he did not want \nadditional spending this year; he would consider the spending next \nyear. Some of us will work to protect that. We think we have the votes \nto do that.\n\n  I also urge the majority leader to stay on the stimulus package. That \nis the regular order. That is the bill pending. I think the majority \nleader's request, to move off of that and pass railroad retirement, \nwill not happen easily. There is strenuous opposition. There may be a \nlot of cosponsors but maybe not everyone read the bill. Maybe the bill \nnever had a hearing in the Senate. In fact, it has never had a hearing \nin the Senate. It is a $15 billion giveaway. It cuts taxes for a few \nfirms for a few billion dollars and raises benefits and in 10 years has \na heck of a problem. We will spend a lot of time on that bill.\n  I urge that the Senate stay on the stimulus package. There are \nchallenges facing the Agriculture bill, which will not pass in a day or \ntwo. That bill has significant problems. Let's stay on the stimulus \nbill; let's work together to see if we cannot resolve some of the \nproblems and actually help the economy. That is my request and my \nurging of the majority leader.\n  I want him to know at least a couple of the bills he was talking \nabout taking up, which imply these can pass in a couple of days, will \nnot happen. I give friendly advice to my friend and colleague, that \nwill not happen.\n  I would like to have a fruitful, productive 2 or 3 weeks, whatever we \nwill have to finish out this year to have some success in the \nappropriations and on the stimulus package. I was hoping we would do an \nenergy package. The President has requested we do the energy package. \nThe House passed it months ago. We have yet to consider it. I \nunderstand your priorities are different. I make those thoughts known \nto the majority leader that there will be strenuous objection to the \nrailroad retirement bill, using procedural devices that are available \nto all Members so people can become familiar with this bill. So it will \nnot pass quickly.\n  I urge staying on the stimulus bill and have unlimited meetings to \nget the stimulus bill completed this week or next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Majority Leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could respond briefly to the Senator from Oklahoma, \nI appreciate, as always, his honesty and forthrightness in telling his \ncolleagues of his intentions on the railroad retirement bill.\n  He mentioned one of the reasons we ought to stay on the economic \nstimulus bill is the House has passed it and we ought to pass it. The \nHouse, many, many months ago, passed the railroad retirement bill. The \nHouse several months ago passed the farm bill. If that is the criteria \nby which we decide what ought to be taken up, I would think there is a \nstrong argument both railroad retirement, as well as the Agriculture \nbill, ought to be addressed.\n  The distinguished Republican leader was asking a similar question, \nWhat is the hurry in bringing up the farm bill? He noted the farm bill \nexpires next year. That is the answer: The farm bill expires next year. \nMore than a dozen national farm organizations wrote a letter yesterday \npleading with the Congress, pleading especially with the Senate, to \ntake up the bill, unencumbered, to pass it cleanly, to get on to \nconference and resolve our outstanding differences with the House and \nget this legislation passed this year. Farmers need to know what the \ncircumstances are going to be next year when the current farm \nlegislation expires. They need to have time to plan.\n\n[[Page S12021]]\n\n  The Department of Agriculture needs time to adjust to the array of \nchanges that will occur in public policy once this takes effect. That \ncannot be done overnight. If we don't do it now, it will encumber and \nperhaps impede in very serious ways the Department's ability to provide \ncontinuity in farm policy next year. This is very clearly a must-pass \npiece of legislation.\n  The Republican leader also made mention of the fact we had agreed in \nearlier bipartisan meetings about making sure the stimulus package is \nimmediate and cost contained. He is not here, and I will not belabor \nthis point because he is not here, but I certainly urge the Republican \nleader to go back and look at his own bill. If he is concerned about \nthat, my guess is he will vote against the Republican bill in the \nSenate Finance Committee. It is twice the size of the Democratic plan. \nIt is $175 billion. We agreed it would only be a $75 billion package \noverall. The House Republicans are proposing a $175 billion package, \nand most--I emphasis ``most''--of the provisions do not take effect \nthis year. Most of them take effect in the outyears. There is almost no \nstimulus effect and it is twice the cost of the agreed-upon amount of \nstimulus we were going to provide this year.\n  I urge our Republican leader to look closely at his bill. I am sure \nhe will come to the same conclusions I have with regard to his \nlegislation if, indeed, those criteria are important to him as well.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask a question of the majority leader, this \nhas been a very curious exchange because those who cast votes to knock \nthe stimulus bill off the floor of the Senate are now inquiring of its \nwhereabouts. This is not exactly a ``where is Waldo'' exercise. We know \nwhere the stimulus package has been and we know where it is.\n  It came to the floor of the Senate and a point of order was raised \nagainst that stimulus package. That same point of order would exist \nagainst the Republican substitute. The same point of order would exist \nagainst the House stimulus bill, but the point of order was raised \nagainst the bill that the majority leader brought to the floor of the \nSenate. That knocked the stimulus bill off the floor of the Senate.\n  Now the inquiry this morning, by those who voted that way, is, Where \nis the stimulus bill?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I retain the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the majority leader, is it not the case that the \nstimulus bill was brought to the floor of the Senate by action of the \nmajority leader and that it was subsequently taken off the floor by a \nvote of those who now inquire of its whereabouts?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. Technically, it is not \ntaken off the floor, but it is still pending. A point of order was \nraised and Republicans supported the point of order, as you know, and \nthis is an important point. The identical point of order could have \nbeen made against the House Republican bill. We chose not to do that. \nOur view is if we are going to try to create a bipartisan resolution \nhere, we don't need a partisan conflict about the way we ought to \nproceed to getting to that resolution. That is exactly what has now \nbeen done by the actions taken by our Senate Republican colleagues. The \nvery same point of order could have been raised against the House bill. \nAgain, we chose not to do that.\n  I appreciate the Senator's comments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will allow me to inquire a further time, \nis it not the case that the only way we are going to get this stimulus \npackage completed is to have all of the parties negotiate this? After \nall, we are only a couple of weeks prior to the end of the legislative \nsession. It is urgent we pass some kind of package to provide economic \nrecovery and provide lift to this economy.\n  All of the parties involved--the House, the Senate, and the \nPresident--proclaim we want to have some kind of stimulus package. Is \nit not the case that the best, most effective and perhaps quickest way \nto resolve this issue would be to have the affected parties begin to \nnegotiate and begin to develop a compromise so the American people can \nget the feeling we are going to get this done; wouldn't that be the \nmost effective way to proceed?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. I have not participated \nin a negotiation where the price of admission was lopping off at least \na third of the entire package before you even sit down to negotiate the \nfirst sentence. That is the price of admission on the part of our \nRepublican colleagues today. I have never participated in something \nsuch as that.\n  What makes it all the more ironic, reading from the New York Times, \nNovember 22:\n\n       Tom Ridge, the Director of Homeland Security, said today he \n     would seek substantial new spending in President Bush's next \n     budget, placing a priority on more agents and equipment for \n     strapped federal law enforcement agencies and urgent \n     improvements in public health facilities.\n\n  I repeat: Strapped Federal law enforcement agencies and urgent \nimprovements in public health facilities. This is not something that \nsays they are going to be strapped. These are not urgent needs next \nyear. These are urgent needs right now. He has identified them.\n\n  The question is, If we are going to deal truly with economic security \nand vitality, if we are going to try economic stimulus, what is wrong \nwith an immediate stimulation into those areas where we need it the \nmost--law enforcement and the health agencies that need help right now, \nas identified by this administration?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Again, I think the Senator is absolutely right. But, \nagain, we are willing to negotiate all this. We are willing to sit down \nwith our Republican colleagues. We were willing to debate it until they \nmade the point of order. They said: No, we are not going to debate it \nbecause we don't like it. No, we are not going to meet with you because \nwe don't like it. But then they come to the floor and say: Where is it?\n  I think the Senator is absolutely right, this is an exercise in \ncurious judgment about the need for economic stimulus if that is the \napproach taken by Republican colleagues.\n  Mr. NICKELS. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield in a moment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to make sure I understand the \ncontext. The bill we on the Democratic side support would not only have \ntax breaks for working Americans and for those who have been \nunemployed, to give them some assistance, it would also provide \nbusiness incentives for depreciation, for example, and for capital \ninvestment. But the stimulus plan, the recovery plan we are supporting, \nalso makes an expenditure for homeland security.\n  I would like to ask the majority leader if he has run into the same \nthing I have run into. My Republican Governor in my State has come to \nme and said that our State of Illinois needs $20 million for a \nstatewide communications network for police and firefighters to deal \nwith crises and emergencies. My State, as most States, is running short \nof revenue in this recession. He has asked for help from Washington.\n  Is it my understanding that the spending stimulus package the \nDemocrats support would provide assistance for that kind of law \nenforcement, firefighting, and first response capability. Is that what \nwe are asking for, which was denied us in this point of order that was \nraised on the floor?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. I recall \nhaving several bipartisan meetings with economists. They said there \nwere three things you really ought to do if you are going to stimulate \nthe economy: First, it has to be immediate; second, it has to be \ntemporary; and third, to the extent possible, you have to raise the \nlevel of confidence among the American people. That is exactly what \nthis homeland security package does.\n  It is immediate. It is temporary--it provides a one-time opportunity \nfor us to assist the law enforcement officials to whom I am talking as \nwell. And it will raise confidence among the American people. People \nare not confident today, and they will not be confident until they know \ntheir security is much more palpable, much more evident than it is \nright now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the majority leader as well, in the \nspending\n\n[[Page S12022]]\n\nside of our stimulus package, does not the issue of public health \nbecome an important consideration? I know people across America are \nconcerned about bioterrorism and public health. It is my understanding \nwhat we are trying to do is provide additional money for public health \nagencies across America to protect our families and communities against \nthe threat of bioterrorism. That is part of our economic stimulus \npackage, which the Democrats support, which the Republicans stopped \nwith their point of order.\n\n  I heard a statistic which I think really tells the story about \npriorities. It is my understanding the Bush administration has asked \nfor $300 million nationwide to help local and State public health \nagencies, while the House Republican stimulus bill has $1.4 billion in \ntax relief for one company, one corporation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, is the Senator from Illinois asking a \nquestion or making a statement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader, does the \nstimulus package which we want to make part of this effort in the \nSenate, the Democratic stimulus package stopped by the Republicans, \nalso include provisions for more resources for public health to protect \ncommunities across America?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will respond to the Senator from Illinois. I know \nthere are other Senators waiting. I do not want to monopolize the \nfloor. But let me say this. The answer is yes. I guess I would ask my \nRepublican colleagues, which part of the homeland security bill do you \noppose: The bioterrorism and food safety bill that allows for $3.3 \nbillion to ensure that we can recognize the pathogens and treat victims \nof all of the array of bioterrorist possibilities that are out there? \nImproved State and local communication systems? Accelerating the \npurchase of smallpox vaccine? Is that the part you are opposed to? How \nabout law enforcement?\n  This bill includes $4.6 billion to provide additional help to law \nenforcement so they can deal with the tremendous challenges they are \ncurrently facing, and for which there is no funding.\n  How about transportation security? This provides for $3.2 billion to \nensure that there is protection, given the tremendous vulnerability \nthat there is in our infrastructure right now. Is that the part they \nare opposed to? Would they oppose transportation security?\n  Finally, providing some help to our mail and our Federal computer \nsystems? We provide for Federal facilities to ensure that we can better \nscreen the mail. No one is more sensitive to screening mail right now \nthan I am. But there is an array of very specific investments in \nhomeland security to protect our mail and to make our computer systems \nmore efficient. We have some of the most archaic computer systems, in \nmany of our Federal agencies, that you can find in the country. We have \nto update them if we are serious about homeland security. Is that the \npart they are opposed to?\n  Which part of this do they not like? That is a really serious \nquestion.\n  I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will try to make it a question. I think the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is making a good point; I think we are entitled to \nask questions. I don't think we are entitled to make statements.\n  You asked several questions. Which part of this don't we like? If you \nread Director Ridge's statement, he said ``in next year's budget.'' \nSome of us do believe in budgets. Some of us do believe we had a deal \nwith President Bush that said $686 billion on October 5, plus $40 \nbillion. We have not even finished spending the $40 billion. Many of \nthe things you suggested might well be in that $40 billion and are good \ncauses. And ``budget'' is a key word.\n\n  President Bush has said he believes there is ample money in the $686 \nbillion and the $40 billion to meet the needs, things that are needed \nnow. The items the Senator listed were not requested by Director Ridge. \nThey might be in next year's budget, and they may have offsets from \nother spending to pay for those needed items. The budget is a key item. \nWe should have a budget.\n  We agreed to $686 billion, and then we added $40 billion on top of \nthat, and then we did $15 billion for airline security. We did untold \nbillions in victims' compensation. No one knows how much that will \ncost. So some of us are saying, wait a minute, let's slow down just a \nminute on the spending. Let's at least request it be requested by the \nPresident.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague. You defended your President very \nwell--President Clinton. Some of us want to defend President Bush, \ntrying to make sure we do not go too far, too fast on spending.\n  Again, many of those items you have mentioned may well be in the \nsecond $20 billion that we have yet to allocate and appropriate. So \nthat is part of the reason some of us are saying let's be reasonable; \nlet's have a stimulus package that still can go for stimulus. Most of \nthe stimulus package--just to make the comment--a lot of us believe \nshould stimulate the economy, not be another excuse for spending.\n  I wish to answer my colleague's question. You are saying, which one \nof these items are we against? We are not saying we are against any of \nthose. We think they can be accommodated in the $40 billion that is yet \nto be totally allocated by this Congress.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer of the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma. Let me just say, though, every \neconomist I have talked to has said you can stimulate the economy with \nspending or with tax cuts. What I find always intriguing, and somewhat \namusing, is our Republican colleagues say spending ought to count, tax \ncuts don't count; we ought to spend as much as we want to with tax \ncuts, and they don't count; we are going to oppose totally the first \ndollar of additional homeland security investment; that is, spending; \nbut we are going to propose $175 billion in tax cuts because that is \nnot spending.\n  We had an agreement, they said, on $686 billion in appropriations. \nWell, we also had an agreement on a tax cut that a lot of people did \nnot like but now have reconciled to because it is law. It passed. It \nwasn't my part of the agreement, but it passed.\n  Now the President says: Oh, wait a minute, we want another $175 \nbillion of additional tax cuts over the $1.8 trillion we passed last \nspring because we don't have enough yet. We want to stimulate the \neconomy a little bit more with $175 billion, drawing down the Treasury, \ndrawing down Medicare, drawing down Social Security, drawing down all \nthe retirement funds to pay for this tax cut, a tax cut that largely \ndoesn't take effect until outyears, years after this one. There is \nnothing immediate about it at all. I find that very amusing.\n\n  We will continue to have this debate. But the whole point is simply \nthis: There are understandable positions that both sides will take in \nthese philosophical debates. I believe there is a right and a wrong \nway, and they believe there is a right and wrong way. But the only way \nwe are going to find common ground is to meet. Perhaps the most \nimportant point in answer directly to the Republican leader's question \nabout what we are going to do with economic stimulus is, I say, let's \nmeet. I propose we meet at 11:30. Let's have a meeting with all of \nthose involved. Let's resolve these differences. They are saying not \nuntil you take half of yours off the table. We can't do that. I think \nevery Republican will understand why.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will make it brief, if the majority leader will yield \nfor one question. I know our colleagues are waiting. They certainly \nhave the right to ask a question. I appreciate the majority leader \nallowing me to do that.\n  We just heard a discussion about what we can't afford with respect to \nhomeland security, something that the Senator from South Dakota \nbelieves very strongly ought to be a part of the stimulus package.\n  Is it not the case that some of those same folks who say we can't \nafford to have homeland security spending in the stimulus package \nbelieve that we can afford retroactive tax cuts going back to the 1980s \nto provide up to $1 billion in checks to one company, for example, for \nalternative minimum taxes they paid in the last 12-13 years? The same \npeople say we can afford that. That is OK. It is not stimulus, by the \nway. But we can't afford the investment in homeland security. Isn't it \nthe case that there is a huge contradiction?\n\n[[Page S12023]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is not only a contradiction, it is a sad irony that \nsomehow in the name of economic security we can, according to their \napproach, pay a company $1 billion-plus, but we can't find a way to pay \nfor $1 billion in bioterrorism and food safety. We can't afford that. \nBut we can afford $1 billion retroactive payments to some of the \nlargest corporations in the country. How ironic. How incredibly \nmisguided that is. Yet that is the debate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That totals $23 billion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12023-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12023-S12024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UPON RETURNING FROM THANKSGIVING\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week, as I was celebrating \nThanksgiving with my family, I was reminded of the history of the \nholiday. We often forget that Thanksgiving was not always a feast of \nabundance.\n  The Pilgrim's first Thanksgiving, in 1621, didn't begin with plates \nfull of turkey and vegetables, but with five small kernels of corn at \neach setting. For the Pilgrims, it served as a stark reminder of the \nhardship, struggle, and starvation they had suffered the previous \nwinter.\n  It wasn't until 1863 that we had our first national Thanksgiving. In \nthe autumn of that year--at the height of the Civil War--Abraham \nLincoln proclaimed a national day not to honor abundance, but to \nremember ``all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or \nsufferers.''\n  And so, to me, this Thanksgiving came closer to the original meaning \nof the day: a day to remember, in the midst of hardship, that we have \nso much to for which to be thankful. A day to remember, in the midst of \ncomfort, the many who are suffering.\n  In the last 2 weeks, I have been asked by many people and many of my \ncolleagues what the Senate intends to do before the end of the year.\n  There are a number of things I would like to get done, but I believe \nthat nothing we do here in the Senate is more important than helping \nthose who are suffering, and passing an economic recovery plan.\n  Last month, we saw the largest jump in the unemployment rate in 21 \nyears.\n  Yesterday, a panel of economists announced that our Nation has \nofficially entered a recession.\n  For the more than 7 million Americans who are out of work, this \nThanksgiving was a time of uncertainty.\n  For all Americans, this has been a season of deep concern about \nthreats to our safety.\n  America needs an economic recovery plan that lifts our economy, \nsecures our Nation, and remembers those who are suffering.\n  It is time for us to renew our efforts to pass such a plan.\n  In the weeks following the September 11 attacks, Democrats and \nRepublicans in both the House and the Senate asked the experts: ``What \nare the most effective steps we can take to shore up our economy?''\n  Here is what they told us: Put money into the hands of low- and \nmiddle-income workers; they are the ones who will spend it quickly. \nMake sure that workers who have lost their jobs receive unemployment \nbenefits. And cut taxes for businesses--but limit the tax cuts to those \nbusinesses that actually help create jobs.\n\n  They told us that any plan to stimulate the economy should help \npeople regain the sense of security they need to shop, travel, and \ninvest.\n  Finally, they said our plan must be affordable, and temporary.\n  Based on those conversations, the House and Senate budget committees \nagreed to four principles that should underpin any economic stimulus \nmeasure we pass.\n  With their principles as our foundation, and those discussions as our \nguide, we began negotiations on how best to help our economy recover.\n  Unfortunately, Republican leaders in the House chose to withdraw from \nthat effort.\n  Instead, they pushed through--on a party line vote--a bill that is \nnot a recovery bill at all, but merely another laundry list of tax \ncuts--with the lion's share going to profitable businesses and wealthy \nindividuals.\n  It includes next to nothing for laid-off workers--the very people who \nmost need our help. And, with an exploding price tag, it runs the risk \nof actually hurting our economy in the long term.\n  In the Senate, we sought a better approach. Even after Republicans in \nthe House walked away from the negotiations, Senator Baucus continued \nto call for bipartisan meetings on the Senate side. In the end, he and \nhis staff held nearly a dozen of them.\n  He put together a serious bill that: extends unemployment benefits \nand health care coverage for unemployed workers; cuts taxes for \nfamilies who didn't get a rebate as part of the tax cut passed earlier \nthis year; cuts taxes and for businesses that will invest and create \njobs; and, with provisions authored by our distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, strengthens our homeland \nsecurity with investments in things like infrastructure security and \nbioterrorism preparedness.\n  The Wednesday before Thanksgiving, that bill was killed by a budget \npoint of order--a procedural technicality which said that what we are \nfacing is not an emergency.\n  Republicans said they opposed our economic recovery plan because the \nbill contained too much spending.\n  Democrats feel strongly that homeland security provisions should be a \npart of any economic recovery package.\n  These measures not only make important investments to secure our food \nand water supply, ports, bridges, tunnels, as well as our stockpile of \nantibiotics and vaccines. They also give people the sense of confidence \nthey need to shop, travel, and invest.\n  The past couple of weeks have reminded us again about the importance \nof homeland security. We have seen another anthrax death, this time in \nConnecticut, and the FBI found an anthrax-tainted letter sent to \nSenator Leahy. The President's Director of Homeland Security, Tom \nRidge, has indicated that billions in additional funds are needed to \nmake America safer. In fact, it was reported that, in the wake of \nSeptember 11, Federal agencies have asked the White House for $127 \nbillion more to recover from that assault and beef up security \naccording to David Broder in Sunday's Washington Post.\n  Defending against anthrax, making our infrastructure safer, \nprotecting our water supply--these things are not pork. They are \nnecessary goals, and an important part of any stimulus package.\n  But despite my commitment to the homeland security provisions, I have \nindicated my willingness to negotiate them separately in the name of \nreaching an agreement.\n  That idea was rejected.\n  We also offered to debate only the economic recovery component, if \nRepublicans would allow us an up or down vote on homeland security as \nan amendment to the DOD appropriations bill.\n  That proposal was also rejected. That was 2 weeks ago. And since \nthen, I have heard nothing.\n  We are at the table, ready to negotiate. It is time for Republicans \nto get serious about reaching a compromise, and come join us at the \nnegotiating table. This is not time to play politics with our economy \nand our security.\n  In the meantime, perhaps our Republican colleagues would find it less \nobjectionable if we consider, individually, the components of our plan \non which we are all agreed. I will ask unanimous consent at a later \ntime to bring up just the part of our plan that helps laidoff workers.\n  Extending unemployment insurance is more than the right thing to do, \nit is the smart thing to do. It puts money into the hands of people who \nare most likely to spend it immediately. As Robert Rubin has said, \nunemployment insurance is ``a near-perfect stimulus.''\n  During the first Bush administration, when we were facing a \nrecession, Democrats and Republicans agreed to extend unemployment \ninsurance four times. I believe we can agree to do the same now.\n  Everyone in this body has said that they want to help the workers. \nBut the voices of delay always claim they want to help the workers.\n  If you want to help the workers, you will have an opportunity to do \nso today.\n  In the days ahead, we can continue our work to protect America's \nfamilies from terrorism, and discuss what kinds of tax cuts will be \nmost effective in helping the economy.\n  But when we talk about helping the hardest hit, we need to realize \nthat the\n\n[[Page S12024]]\n\npeople we are talking about don't have unlimited savings. The holidays \nare fast approaching, and this delay is a luxury they literally cannot \nafford.\n  Our Republican colleagues have a new mantra. They say, ``We need \npaychecks, not unemployment checks.''\n  I think they should talk to some laidoff workers. Yes, they need a \npaycheck. And like most hard-working Americans, they don't want the \nGovernment to do anything for them that they can do for themselves.

Mr. President, I ask the majority leader to stay in the \nChamber for just a moment, if he would accord me that courtesy. I have \nsought to raise a procedural inquiry because of what has just happened. \nI have been in the Chamber for a little more than an hour waiting my \nturn. The majority leader took care of very important calendar business \nas we started the process, and then moved on to other important \nmatters. I have been here for 21 years, and I know that who has the \nfloor may yield for a question. There are also artful ways to ask a \nquestion.\n  I have sought a procedural ruling on whether they really were \nquestions because when you make a statement for a protracted period of \ntime and then end it with a question, the Chair may sustain that, \nespecially when the majority leader is involved.\n  But I want to make a point with the majority leader's presence and \none of the other Senators who was asking questions as a matter of our \nfair play and procedure. I don't think Senators have to wait for an \nhour while there are other people who gain recognition where there \nreally aren't questions but speeches.\n  I thank the majority leader for staying to listen to my point because \nit is just possible that this may reoccur sometime in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12024-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12024-S12025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to make a \nsubstantive----\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to ask the majority leader \na question before he leaves the Chamber. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, I will not yield. I have been here for more than an \nhour. There is an issue which I want to raise; that is, a response to \nvery extensive publicity on the cloning issue where there is \ngeneralized agreement, which this Senator concurs, in that there should \nnot be human cloning. There is a confusion. I have sought recognition \nand, as I said, I have waited an hour to note the distinction on what \n``therapeutic'' is and what is frequently used with cloning under the \nname of therapeutic cloning, which is, in fact, not cloning at all.\n  More accurately, it is denominated by the scientists as somatic cell \nnuclear transfer, which, while in the loose jargon is sometimes called \ntherapeutic cloning is, in fact, not cloning at all.\n  Yesterday, the President spoke out against reproductive cloning. I am \nentirely in agreement with that. My distinguished colleague from \nKansas, Mr. Brownback, and I have had a number of discussions on this \nissue. I told Senator Brownback that I was going to come to the floor \nat 10:30 to seek recognition because I wanted him to have the \nopportunity to be present. I am sorry I said 10:30. I should have said \n11:30 to save an hour of time. But I think this is a distinction which \nneeds to be made.\n  What is involved is a technique which involves taking the genetic \nmaterial out of an unfertilized egg and inserting, in its place, the \nDNA of an adult cell. In theory, the egg then uses the genes from the \nadult cell to direct its development to turn an embryo into an exact \ngenetic copy of the donor of the adult cell. This is done for the \npurpose of therapy.\n  If someone has Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, or if someone needs a stem \ncell replacement related to cancer or to heart disease, this procedure \nthen enables that individual to get a stem cell which is consistent \nwith the body which will not have an adverse impact on the person who \nis being treated.\n  Where you talk about the issue of embryos which then produce life, I \nwould never support any approach which took an embryo that was capable \nof producing life or destined to produce life.\n  This issue of stem cell research came upon the scene in November of \n1998. Then the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education took up the issue, which I chaired at the time, \nto take a look at what was involved with embryos being created for in \nvitro fertilization where, customarily, approximately a dozen are \ncreated, and three or four might be used. The rest would be subject to \nbeing discarded.\n  The controversy arose because of legislation that had been inserted \nin an appropriations bill, which originated in our subcommittee, which \nprohibited Federal funding to extract stem cells from the embryos. But \nunder the ruling of the Department of Health and Human Services several \nyears ago, Federal funding could be used on the research of stem cells \nafter they were extracted. There had been considerable sentiment in the \nCongress, including the Senate, to use Federal funding on stem cell \nresearch because of the tremendous funding which is available to the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Therefore, some 64 Senators last spring and summer signed letters in \none form or another saying that they thought there ought to be Federal \nfunding on these stem cell lines. In addition to those 64 Senators, \nsome 12 other Senators had expressed privately to me their view that \nthere should be Federal funding on the stem cells but thought it not \nadvisable, from their own point of view, to put it in writing.\n  A fair sized ground swell was noted in the Senate to that effect--64 \nand 12, 76. The President then, as well known, on August 9 at 9 p.m. \ncame down with the decision that the 64 stem cell lines then in \nexistence would be used with Federal funding for stem cell research, \nand that drew objections from people who thought it went too far on \nFederal funding to utilize the product of embryos, and others thought \nit did not go far enough, questioning whether those 64 stem cell lines \nreally would support the necessary research.\n  What we are dealing with here is stem cells which have the capacity \nto be used for people who have Parkinson's, to replace diseased cells \nand cure Parkinson's or, in Alzheimer's, to replace diseased cells and \ndelay the onset of Alzheimer's, if not to cure it, or who have heart \ndisease, to take these stem cells and inject the cells in place of \ndiseased cells, and the potential to save millions upon millions of \nlives where these embryos were otherwise going to be discarded.\n  For those who have said these embryos have the potential to create \nlife, my response has been to insert in our appropriations bill $1 \nmillion as a starter to promote adoption of these embryos so that if \nthese embryos can be used to produce life, that would be the highest \ncalling, and if they could all be adopted and used to produce life, \nthen there would not be any embryos available for stem cell extraction, \nand that would be the preferable course.\n  If there are to be discarded embryos that are going to be thrown \naway, then it seems to me obvious it would make\n\n[[Page S12025]]\n\nbetter sense to save lives as opposed to discarding.\n  When the appropriations bill came up to the Senate floor, a provision \nwas inserted on my motion that the President of the United States would \nhave the authority to designate the use of Federal funding on existing \nstem cell lines. Now that was precisely what President Bush had done. \nBut I wanted to codify it. He had taken the position, to repeat, on \nAugust 9, that Federal funding could be used on the existing 64 stem \ncell lines, which was a step beyond what the Federal Government had \ndone before and I think, candidly, was in response to the ground swell \nof the 64 Senators who had signed letters and, as I represented, \nanother 12 Senators who thought that medical research ought to be \nundertaken.\n  Senator Brownback, with whom I have had a difference of opinion on a \ncordial senatorial level, on a number of debates in the Chamber and a \nnumber of appearances in the media, objected to that provision because \nsome future President might have a different view. President Bush had \nsaid he was not going to allow Federal funding on stem cell lines \ncreated after August 9, at 9 p.m., which is the time he made his \nspeech. But there might be another President after President Bush's two \nterms who might take a different point of view, which I think was the \nmotivation for the opposition to this codification of what President \nBush had done.\n\n  Senator Brownback then proposed a series of amendments to prohibit \ncloning and also to prohibit somatic cell nuclear transfer--which has \nbeen inappropriately named as therapeutic cloning, which has created a \nconfusion. To repeat, that we are opposed to reproductive cloning to \nmake another human being but if these scientific procedures are to be \nused to create cells which can be accepted by a patient, for example, \nwho has Parkinson's without having an adverse reaction, this was the \nline which I thought and many thought ought to be maintained. And the \nscientific community is up in arms about the prospect of having somatic \ncell nuclear transfer prohibited because there is some mistaken name \ncalling, calling it therapeutic cloning which is mistaken for \nreproductive cloning.\n  So Senator Brownback--and I wanted him here to hear me make this \npresentation--said to me he would withdraw his amendments if I would \ndelete the provision in the bill which codified what President Bush had \ndone. And I decided to agree with that proposal which Senator Brownback \nmade because, as the manager of the bill, it seemed to me it would take \nmany days of additional debate if we were to resolve the issue. Then, \nwith the majority leader and the Republican leader, an agreement was \nworked out--and it is on the record--that we would have a freestanding \nbill in February or March. I wanted it earlier rather than later, but \nthe majority leader would not commit to February but said it would have \nto go to March, and so it was February or March. And then in the \ninterim, our subcommittee has planned a series of three hearings to go \ninto some detail as to what is really involved, to have some public \ndiscussion and public understanding that what is called therapeutic \ncloning is not cloning at all and certainly in no way related to \nreproductive cloning.\n  Then we had the event last weekend----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nexpired. The order reserved 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As I was starting to say, Advanced Cell Technology came \nout with a news release which has received publicity including a U.S. \nNews and World Report cover which has raised concern about human \ncloning and reproductive cloning, and I do not believe that is \nrealistic at this time because we know cloning exists. All of the \nembryos that were created in the Massachusetts experiment by Advanced \nCell Technology died before they even grew to aged cells.\n  I note in the morning's press Senator Brownback at his news \nconference yesterday--and I respect his right to have a news conference \nand respect his position--said he would like to have the debate now, \nwould like to have action before the end of the year.\n  Speaking for myself, it is fine to have the debate now and to have \naction by the Senate before the end of the year. We will not have the \nbenefit of the three planned hearings which we have had, but the Senate \ncan act without additional hearings. But it is not going to be an easy \nmatter.\n  When Senator Brownback and I talked about this several weeks ago when \nthe appropriations bill was in the Chamber, it was obvious to me it \nwould take several days. And as the manager of the bill, if I had been \nin a position other than manager of the bill, Senators who have issues, \nthings they would like to raise, sometimes without too much regard for \nwhat happens to a bill--if it takes a little more time, so be it. But a \nmanager is in a somewhat different position.\n  I have spoken at some length because I think it is very important \nthat there be a public understanding that somatic cell nuclear transfer \ndoes not relate to cloning, and the people who called it therapeutic \ncloning are creating a lot of confusion because it is not cloning at \nall. And it is certainly not reproductive cloning.\n  Scientists are, as I say, up in arms about the prospect of having a \nprohibition of this kind of research which has the potential to cure \nmillions of people who have Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, heart disease, \nor cancer or many other maladies.\n  So the public ought to understand that the opposition to cloning a \nhuman being is not in issue when we talk about somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer. And I am delighted to proceed to debate the issue, to vote on \nit at the earliest possible time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12025-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12025-S12027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2505\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the issue of human \ncloning and the need to address it in this Congress this year. I was \nhopeful of getting the majority leader's attention while he was on the \nfloor; maybe we will get the attention of the Senator from Nevada about \naddressing the issue this year.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania was pointing out, we now have the \nfirst human clone. People are calling it different names. Some are \ncalling it an ``activated egg,'' rather than a human embryo or clone. \nU.S. News and World Report doesn't seem to have a problem with calling \nit the first human clone, as most of the newspapers were calling it. It \nis identical to an embryo. It now exists. It lived for a couple of \ndays, then died. The technology has been used and exercised.\n  It is something about which I have been warning this body for \nmonths--that we should address this issue before we get to the point in \ntime where we are going to see human clones out there. And then we will \nhave to wrestle with the question, Is this person or property? Is this \na person or is it a piece of property that is owned by somebody? What \ndo we do with a clone? This is capable of being implanted into a woman \nand of growing to be a full, identifiable person by anybody's \ndefinition. Now we have the technology being broached.\n  We have at the desk H.R. 2505, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of \n2001 that the House of Representatives passed. The President is calling \nfor this body to act upon that. He is saying we should not be waiting \nlonger for this.\n  It is my intention at the end of my comments to call up H.R. 2505 and \nask unanimous consent that we immediately proceed to its consideration. \nThis is a bill that is here. This is an issue that is right on top of \nus. It needs to be considered. We should deal with it now. We can deal \nwith it. We can limit the amount of debate time that we will have on \nthe bill. We can limit it to a period of 5 hours. We can limit it to \ntwo amendments. We can go all of those routes. If the majority leader \nwould agree to do that, we can get this issue dealt with.\n\n  Short of that, I submit to my colleagues what we can also do is take \nup this bill, only let's have a human cloning moratorium for 6 months, \nsaying we will not allow human cloning of any type under any definition \nfor a period of 6 months so Senator Specter\n\n[[Page S12026]]\n\nand others can hold hearings on this topic. Let's stop now before the \nhorse gets further out of the barn, before we see living human embryos.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 2505, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act \nof 2001.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. May I inquire, and respectfully so, of the Senator \nfrom Nevada, this is an issue that is right on top of us. I have been \nwarning this body for months that this day was going to be here. Now it \nis here. We really should take up this issue. We can limit the amount \nof time. We can limit the amount of amendments to it. I ask why we \ncan't proceed at least to a moratorium, a 6-month moratorium on human \ncloning.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to respond to my friend without his losing the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, this is a very contentious issue. I certainly \nunderscore the sincerity of the Senator from Kansas. Everyone knows how \nhe feels about this issue. He has expressed it publicly. He has \nexpressed it to me privately. I understand the sincerity of Senator \nBrownback on this issue.\n  This is an issue about which other people feel just as strongly on \nthe other side. I have sat through a number of hearings that had been \noriginally led by the Senator from Pennsylvania where this issue first \ncame up, and then we have had hearings since then that have been led by \nthe Senator from Iowa. They have been probing, extremely good hearings, \nbut they have been preliminary in nature in the sense that there is a \nlot more that needs to be done.\n  Just 3 weeks ago on the Senate floor this issue came up. At that time \nit was believed there would be a time certain to take it up. There will \nbe hearings, it is my understanding, in the Appropriations Committee \nheld this Thursday and next Tuesday on this issue. I am sure there will \nbe other hearings that will be held prior to the commitment of the \nmajority leader as to when we would bring up this issue next year.\n  That way we can have a full public debate on the issue with \nlegislation being handled the way it should; that is, have unlimited \namendments. That doesn't mean it would go on forever, but we would have \namendments that would be offered on legislation that would be pending \nin this regard.\n  We just cannot do it. We have a lot of issues that we need to \naddress. We have five conference reports on appropriations bills that \nare not completed. We have not acted on a stimulus package. It took up \nan hour on the floor today. We have railroad retirement. We have an \nAgriculture bill. We have port security, about which Senator Hollings \nbelieves strongly and Senator Graham is waiting in my office to \ndiscuss--along with other issues--right now. There are lots of issues \nwe have to take up.\n\n  I know the Senator from Kansas believes this is the most important \nissue. But without having a better foundation, we are talking about \nwaiting a matter of a couple months anyway.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I do not have the floor, but I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to ask a question.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I have a followup, and then I will be happy to yield \nto the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. In short, I think it would be extremely difficult on an \nexpedited schedule, which is what the Senator wants. This is not an \nissue I believe we can do with two amendments.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could, what about a moratorium? We now have a \nhuman clone out there. We have people using this technology. What about \na period of a moratorium, say a 3-month or 6-month moratorium, until we \ncan get to the issue, saying let's stop this now before we get human \nclones out there? This body has not spoken about it.\n  Mr. REID. I respond as follows: There are people who, as I indicated \nearlier, believe just as fervently on this issue as does the Senator \nfrom Kansas. They believe that therapeutic cloning is something that \nwill lead very quickly to the abolishment of diabetes, Parkinson's \ndisease, and other dread diseases. As strongly as he feels about this, \nthey feel that a moratorium for 6 months, 2 months, or 2 days is \npreventing science from going ahead and working on cures for these \ndiseases. That is how I answer the question. That is the debate we need \nto have.\n  The majority leader, Senator Daschle, has said he will bring this up \nnext year. We could spend a considerable amount of time on the floor \nlistening to the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nboth of whom have strong beliefs in this regard.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from Nevada for responding. If I \ncould reclaim my time briefly, I wish to warn the body, before we take \nthis issue back up, we are going to see more of these things announced. \nWe are going to see people working on putting animal genetic material \ninto the human species. That is going to be announced next. That will \nbe the next announcement sometime a month or two down the road. This \nbody will not have spoken on it.\n  The House has spoken on it. The President has stated: Please give \nthis to me. He has asked that. That is why I respectfully put this \nforward. This technology is rapidly moving forward. It is to the point \nthat most people are very uncomfortable with human cloning. People \nacross the country, 90 percent, are saying: I don't think we ought to \nbe going there.\n  I am saying at this point in time, before this continues moving \nforward, let's hit the pause button and let's say, wait a minute, until \nwe can really thoroughly vet this because, as the Senator from Nevada \nhas rightly said, there are a number of people looking at this from \ndifferent sides, questioning this. This is a very technically involved \nsubject. I respect all of that. I respect that greatly. Why not, for a \nperiod of 3 months or 6 months, say, let's just pause here because we \nare entering a threshold period of time that we have not thoroughly \ncontemplated as a society, as a people. We should say: Let's wait just \na little bit before it leaps upon us.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. The problem with the Senator's \nsuggestion--and I will ask a question--is that he wants to stop \neverything. I say to my friend that we could probably reach agreement \npretty quickly around here because I support legislation to ban human \ncloning. I know most people I have spoken to, if not all, agree. Of \ncourse, that occurs when you use the stem cells and you transfer them \ninto a woman's uterus. We can stop that in a minute, but my friend \nwould like to stop everything, and that is why I so strongly support \nSenator Specter, Senator Harkin, and Senator Kennedy, who have been our \nleaders on this subject.\n\n  What we are saying is, we should allow stem cell research to continue \nto bring our people cures to these diseases that plague them. I do not \nknow about in your State--and I am sure it is reflected in my State--\nbut if you ask people: Who is touched by Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, \nspinal cord injuries, diabetes and juvenile diabetes, who is touched by \nthese diseases, who fears these diseases, one will find it is almost \nevery individual.\n  We all agree to ban human cloning. That is not the problem. But my \nfriend is taking an extreme position which will shut down the applied \nresearch into possible cures for these diseases. Therefore, there is \nstrong opposition to the position of my friend. If he were to march \ndown with us and ban human cloning, the implantation of the nucleus \ninto a woman, then we would walk down the road together. But we think \nstopping everything is unfair.\n  Does my friend understand the debate in that sense? I hope he \nunderstands we are with him on banning human cloning but not stopping \nstem cell research to cure diseases.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I can reclaim my time, I ask unanimous consent for \nan additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will not object but since I have been here \n40 minutes, I would like to get in the queue. I ask unanimous consent \nthat following the remarks of the Senator from Kansas, I be permitted \nmy time in morning business.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to do \nso,\n\n[[Page S12027]]\n\nI would like 1 minute when the Senator from Kansas finishes to make a \ncomment or two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I can respond to my colleague from \nCalifornia, I am happy to work with her on the definition of human \ncloning. I object to her categorization that I am opposed to all \nresearch and just stop. That is not my position. I have strongly \nsupported adult stem cell research. I do not know if you can put a \ndollar amount in the funding line that I would not agree with because I \nthink it is very promising research, and I am strongly supportive of \nthat research.\n  I object as well to the Senator's categorization that you take stem \ncells and put them in a woman's uterus. You do not do that. What I am \ntalking about is an embryo that can be put into a uterus, actually form \na living human being by everybody's definition. The Senator may have a \ndifferent definition of when an embryo is a life.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will go for that definition that you cannot place a \nhumanly cloned embryo into a woman's uterus. I would go for it. I \nunderstand my friend supports in vitro fertilization. I do, too. We \nwould not deal with that. If it is, in fact, a cloned embryo, \nabsolutely I would walk down the aisle with you on that in a moment, in \na heartbeat.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. What about a cloned embryo period, once it is created?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say we would stop it at the implantation stage.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. What about a cloned embryo, period?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would oppose a cloned embryo being implanted so you \nhave a human being at the end of 9 months.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I can reclaim my time--I do not want to be rude--\nherein lies the key, the rub of the issue: Some say you can create a \ncloned embryo and not implant it, with which I agree. I do not think we \nshould implant that embryo.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We agree on that then.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. What about the status of the cloned embryo, that is in \nits genetic material identical to one that is created naturally? \nWhether it is created by man or created by God, they are the same \nentities; they are identical. Therefore, do we say the status of one is \ndifferent from the status of the other? Herein again lies my point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How far back do you want to go?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I can reclaim my time, before we move forward on \nthis, should we not pause at this point in time and say: Let's stop \nhere; let's stop everything here for a few months and see where we are \ngoing with the future of humanity? The next step will be genetic \nmaterial from outside the human species into the human species. That is \ngoing to be one of the next cover stories, and we will still be here \nsaying: I am not sure about this definition; I am not sure about that.\n  Do we want to burst that upon humanity and allow that to take place \nin our country? By our inaction, we will. I plead with my colleagues, \nlet us work on this now and pause the whole issue for a short period of \ntime so we can consider it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think this last brief exchange points \nup the complexity of the issue as to what we are dealing with.\n  When Senator Brownback comments about what may occur next, they are \nmatters of enormous concern. I do not like cloning in any form, and it \nmay be when we have the debate and when we have the hearings, if the \nbill is not going to be called up--I was not prepared to propose \nSenator Brownback call up the bill. I am prepared to debate this, and \nSenator Brownback may persuade me and may persuade others.\n  I do think it is a more orderly process to give the scientific \ncommunity an opportunity to present their case, but if Senator \nBrownback will get the procedures to have a vote now and a debate and \nreally explore the matter--the sole purpose I have made in this \npresentation is to raise a distinction between reproductive cloning and \nwhat others have called therapeutic cloning, which, as I understand it, \nis not cloning at all. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for bringing \nthis important subject before the Senate. It is evident from what we \nhave heard that this subject requires a great deal of further debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12027-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12027-S12029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RELIGIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to change the subject and have printed \nin the Record two articles from the National Review magazine. I ask \nunanimous consent they be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the first of these is written by Kate \nO'Beirne, who always provides very well-researched and well-written \nreports on a very timely topic. As she notes at the beginning of this \narticle:\n\n       The State Department issued the annual report required by \n     the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.\n\n  She goes on to note:\n\n       With shocking regularity, human-rights groups report the \n     death of Christians at the hands of Muslim militants in \n     Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East.\n\n  She goes on to document the very troubling plethora of religiously \nmotivated human rights abuses throughout the world. This is an article \nmy colleagues would be well to review with respect to especially the \ndebate that is ongoing about the sources of terrorism in the world \ntoday.\n  The second article is also from the National Review magazine written \nby Richard Lowry, an article which also, interestingly, quotes Samuel \nHuntington in his very timely and interesting book, ``The Clash of \nCivilizations.'' Lowry quotes Huntington as saying the following:\n\n       The proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass \n     destruction is a central phenomenon of the slow but \n     ineluctable diffusion of power in a multicivilizational \n     world.\n\n  He goes on to note that one of the causes for proliferation is \nWestern naivete, especially in the support of arms control agreements \nas the way to stop this proliferation.\n  He notes that arms control agreements work only so long as no one \nwants to violate them, in which case they simply do not work. He goes \non to provide his prescription of what could be done instead to deal \nwith the issue of proliferation, which I think, again, we would all be \ncommended to review. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to review these two \nitems.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the National Review, Dec. 3, 2001]\n\n                                Martyred\n\n\n              Muslim Murder and mayhem against christians\n\n                           (By Kate O'Beirne)\n\n       President Bush's repeated assertions about the peaceful \n     nature of Islam were briefly interrupted when the State \n     Department issued the annual report required by the \n     International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. This year, as in \n     the past, our Muslim-world partners in the coalition against \n     terrorism were prominently featured among the most violent, \n     most intolerant regimes in the world. Religious minorities \n     are persecuted in over 20 states where Islam is the official \n     or dominant religion. The million Christians who have fled \n     the Muslim world in the past five years were hardly seeking \n     sanctuary from the peaceful face of Islam.\n       With shocking regularity, human-rights groups report the \n     death of Christians at the hands of Muslim militants in \n     Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. In Pakistan, Islam \n     has been the official religion since 1973, and over the \n     years, the State Department has urged our ally to repeal \n     section 295(c) of the penal code. This is the section that \n     stipulates the death penalty or life in prison for \n     blaspheming Mohammed, and the State Department notes that it \n     ``contributes to inter-religious tension, intimidation, fear, \n     and violence.'' A Christian Pakistani, Ayub Masih, was jailed \n     five years ago on a blasphemy charge, and he has now filed \n     his final appeal against the death sentence imposed on him. \n     Masih is alleged to have said, ``If you want to know the \n     truth about Islam, read Salman Rushdie.'' An accusation by a \n     Muslim neighbor was enough to secure the blasphemy \n     conviction. Under Pakistan's ``Hudood ordinances,'' the legal \n     testimony of religious minorities is accorded half the weight \n     of Muslims'. The testimony of a non-Muslim woman is halved \n     again.\n       Most recently, gunmen from the ``Army of Omar'' opened fire \n     on a Protestant congregation worshipping at St. Dominic's \n     Catholic Church in Bahawalpur, killing at least 16. Islamic \n     party leaders in Pakistan immediately\n\n[[Page S12028]]\n\n     claimed that the massacre was a conspiracy to defame Muslims.\n       Then, Saudi Arabia. In a bracing departure from diplospeak, \n     the State Department says, ``Freedom of religion does not \n     exist in Saudi Arabia.'' For many years, Christians have been \n     flogged, imprisoned, and executed by a Saudi government that \n     prohibits non-Muslim worship even in private homes. A Muslim \n     who converts to another religion is subject to the death \n     penalty by beheading.\n       Nigeria is another nightmare. The Center for Religious \n     Freedom, part of Freedom House, maintains a ``New Martyrs \n     List,'' to call attention to the most horrific cases. In one \n     bloody week in May 2000, over 200 people were killed in \n     Kaduna. Among the dead was Rev. Clement Ozi Bello, a 26-year-\n     old former Muslim who had recently been ordained a Catholic \n     priest. The young priest was attacked by a mob that dragged \n     him from his car, tied him up, and gouged out his eyes, \n     before leaving him dead on the side of the road.\n       In October, churches and Christian-owned shops were \n     gasoline-bombed in an area of Kaduna now adorned with \n     pictures of Osama bin Laden. More than 6,000 people have died \n     in religious conflicts in Nigeria since the end of military \n     rule two years ago. ``Our people are being shot, butchered, \n     and roasted,'' says Kaduna bishop Josiah Fearon.\n       The anti-Christian violence in Nigeria has been the direct \n     result of the adoption of Sharia law, the strict Islamic \n     code, by ten of the country's largely Muslim states in the \n     north. Under Sharia, certain crimes are punishable by \n     flogging, amputation, and beheading. The governor of one of \n     these states dismisses the national constitution that \n     proclaims Nigeria a secular country. ``To be good Muslims,'' \n     Ahmed Sani says, ``we have to have Sharia to govern our \n     lives, because God has told us that any Muslim who does not \n     accept Sharia is not a good believer.'' Sani dispatched local \n     officials to Saudi Arabia and Sudan to learn some more about \n     the application of Sharia.\n       In Algeria, the military assumed power a decade ago, to \n     prevent the Islamic Salvation Front from imposing Sharia on \n     the country. Since then, Algeria has been engaged in bloody \n     civil war. In 1994, the Armed Islamic Group pledged to \n     eliminate Jews and Christians from Algeria. The group is \n     deadly serious, having massacred thousands and even hijacking \n     an Air France plane.\n       In the Philippines, an organization called Abu Sayyaf, with \n     ties to al-Qaeda, wants to form an independent Islamic state \n     in the southern islands. In May 2000, a Filipino Catholic \n     priest was murdered along with four others among the 27 \n     hostages kidnapped from two Catholic schools. Before being \n     killed, Rev. Rhoel Gallardo was tortured for refusing to wear \n     Muslim clothing and say Muslim prayers. During negotiations \n     for the hostages' release, Abu Sayyaf demanded that all \n     crosses be removed from churches.\n       Egypt, where the influence of Sharia law is growing, is \n     home to the largest Christian community in the Middle East. \n     The Coptic Orthodox are the targets of both militant Islamic \n     groups and local security forces. Young Christian women are \n     pressured to convert to Islam, while converts from Islam to \n     Christianity have been tortured and imprisoned. Over the past \n     20 years, more than 30 massacres of Coptic Christians have \n     occurred. In January 2000, during several days of rioting by \n     Muslim mobs in Al-Kosheh, more than 100 homes and shops were \n     destroyed, and 21 Christians and one Muslim killed. The \n     Center for Religious Freedom says that the Egyptian \n     government covered up these crimes to avoid the ``politically \n     sensitive'' issue of punishing Muslims for murdering \n     Christians.\n       Eventually 96 people were tried for the massacres in Al-\n     Kosheh. The only four Muslims to be convicted were held \n     responsible for the accidental killing of the Muslim. The \n     longest sentence is being served by a Christian, Surial Gayed \n     Isshak, for allegedly ``publicly insulting Islam.'' Amnesty \n     International has declared Isshak a ``prisoner of \n     conscience'' and called for his release.\n       In Sudan, the Islamic government is carrying out genocide \n     against the Christian population in the south. Secretary of \n     State Powell has labeled Sudan ``the biggest single abuser of \n     human rights on earth.'' Two million people have died since \n     1983 in a civil war that ignited when the Khartoum government \n     tried to impose Sharia on non-Muslims. Christians are \n     slaughtered from the air by bombers, enslaved on the ground, \n     and forced to convert to Islam or starve. Writing in the \n     Winter 2001 issue of The Middle East Quarterly, Prof. Hilal \n     Khashan of the American University of Beirut explains that \n     Khartoum's rulers believe that non-Muslims in the south are \n     their ``lost brothers'' who must be redeemed by Islam. \n     According to Khashan, ``This attitude reflects the fact that \n     Muslims, devout or otherwise, tend to believe that Islam, the \n     ultimate divine truth, is destined to prevail at the expense \n     of other religions.''\n       From reports by government and human-rights groups, a \n     pattern clearly emerges: Predominantly Christian countries \n     generally respect religious freedom, as do buddhist countries \n     (absent Communist domination). The Center for Religious \n     Freedom concludes, ``The religious areas with the largest \n     current restrictions on religious freedom are countries with \n     an Islamic background. This parallels problems with democracy \n     and civil liberties in general, but the negative trend is \n     stronger with respect to religion.''\n       Hilal Khashan points out that religion has been a decisive \n     factor in most civil wars in Arabic-speaking countries, and \n     there have been at least a million deaths (compared with \n     150,000 Arab deaths in combined Arab-Israeli wars since \n     1948). The murderous intentions of the extremist Muslims have \n     clearly overwhelmed the influence of the pacific \n     practitioners continually cited by President Bush. Journalist \n     Amir Taheri noted in the Wall Street Journal recently that 28 \n     of the 30 active conflicts in the world involve Muslim \n     governments or communities.\n       In his oft-cited book The Clash of Civilizations and the \n     Remaking of World Order, Samuel P. Huntington writes, \n     ``Wherever one looks along the perimeter of Islam, Muslims \n     have problems living peaceably with their neighbors. . . . \n     Muslims make up about one-fifth of the world's population but \n     in the 1990s they have been far more involved in intergroup \n     violence than the people of any other civilization.'' \n     Huntington further argues that Islamic militancy is not a \n     heretical strain of Islam. ``The underlying problem for the \n     West is not Islamic fundamentalism. It is Islam, a different \n     civilization whose people are convinced of the superiority of \n     their culture and are obsessed with the inferiority of their \n     power.''\n       While scholars of the Koran debate whether or not its \n     teachings justify violent jihads against non-believers, \n     Christians in dozens of Muslim countries live with the \n     fearful reality that they risk martyrdom at the hands of \n     Islam--as they long have. Again, Huntington (writing in \n     1996): ``Some Westerners, including President Bill Clinton, \n     have argued that the West does not have problems with Islam \n     but only with violent Islamist extremists. Fourteen hundred \n     years of history demonstrate otherwise.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the National Review, Dec. 3, 2001]\n\n                             Delay or Die?\n\n\n                The imperative of counter-proliferation\n\n                           (By Richard Lowry)\n\n       In 1946, U.S. delegate to the U.N. Bernard Baruch had an \n     idea. All nations would be prohibited not just from seeking \n     to develop nuclear weapons, but from building nuclear power \n     plants that might create fissionable material appropriate for \n     a bomb. Instead, an international authority would maintain a \n     monopoly over nuclear activity, and the U.S. would eventually \n     relinquish its weapons. U.N. Security Council permanent \n     members would lose their veto over any action to enforce \n     these restrictions, because, when it comes to nukes, ``to \n     delay may be to die.''\n       Today, with worries about Osama bin Laden or other \n     terrorists gaining access to the tens of thousands of nuclear \n     weapons and the thousands of tons of fissionable material \n     rattling around the world, Baruch's urgency may again seem \n     appropriate. But his prescriptions don't, even as the spirit \n     of them lives on in U.S. policy. The Baruch plan went nowhere \n     in the U.N., but it still can be seen as a sort of high-water \n     mark for post-war arms control. Then, the fantasy of non-\n     proliferation at least still seemed shiny and new. It has \n     been steadily discredited ever since.\n       The Baruch plan was the first shot in what would become an \n     ever more tolerant and open-minded attitude to non-\n     proliferation, pioneered by the Eisenhower administration, \n     enshrined in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and \n     finally brought to its appalling nadir by the Clinton \n     administration. In the Age of Osama, it is time to \n     acknowledge that non-proliferation is mostly a failure. It \n     has restrained some nations--Japan, Ukraine, etc.--from \n     acquiring nuclear weapons, but the overriding lesson of the \n     last half-century is that weapons technology will always get \n     through: through to the state that is willing to lie, cheat, \n     and pay enough to get it.\n       The U.S. should now adopt a tougher, more clear-eyed \n     approach to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n     and missile technology. It should concentrate less on the \n     universalist goal of bringing all states under sweeping arms-\n     control plans on an equal basis, and focus instead on a \n     frankly discriminatory objective: denying weapons to the \n     states--most of them Islamic--that are hostile to the West. \n     This would be more practical than the grander efforts of the \n     past, but it too would be doomed, eventually, to failure \n     (although mere delay has its value). When rogue governments \n     succeed in acquiring these weapons, the U.S. will have to \n     punish or topple them, on the theory that the act of \n     proliferation can't be eliminated but occasionally noxious \n     governments can.\n       There should be no illusion about what is at stake in the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. should \n     oppose it not because these weapons are inherently evil or \n     because we seriously seek a nuclear-free world, but rather \n     because their spread represents a diminution of Western \n     power. As Samuel Huntington puts it in The Clash of \n     Civilizations, ``The proliferation of nuclear and other \n     weapons of mass destruction is a central phenomenon of the \n     slow but ineluctable diffusion of power in a \n     multicivilizational world.''\n       In fact, much of it has occurred with anti-Westernism as \n     its implicit rationale, as China in particular seeks to \n     undercut American dominance. ``Weapons proliferation is where \n     the Confucian-Islamic connection has been most extensive and \n     most concrete, with China playing the central role in the \n     transfer of both conventional and nonconventional weapons to \n     many Muslim states,'' Huntington writes. China and Russia \n     have been\n\n[[Page S12029]]\n\n     the suppliers, with Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea--\n     all terrorist states to one degree or another--the primary \n     recipients. The Pakistani nuclear program, for instance, is \n     almost entirely a Chinese production. And the Russians have \n     been playing the same role in Iran.\n     History of a fantasy\n       Western naivete has, over the years, helped push \n     proliferation along, as Henry Sokolski argues in his book \n     Best of Intentions. Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program \n     spread nuclear reactors around the globe ``to serve the \n     peaceful pursuits of mankind,'' with little thought to the \n     possibility that they might serve the war-making pursuits as \n     well. The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, which \n     sought to maintain the exclusivity of the nuclear club, is \n     similarly starry-eyed. It talks of ``the inalienable right'' \n     of signatories to develop nuclear technology, and urges ``the \n     fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials, and \n     technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear \n     energy.'' Cheating? Don't be silly. Sokolski quotes a Dutch \n     NPT negotiator explaining that for parties to the treaty \n     there should be ``a clear presumption'' that nuclear material \n     and know-how won't be diverted to weapons programs.\n       This remarkable faith in the trustworthiness of every NPT \n     nation is why signing the treaty was Iraq's first step toward \n     acquiring a bomb. According to Khidhir Hamza, an Iraqi \n     scientist who defected, Iraq used the presumption of \n     innocence to acquire the hardware and knowledge for its \n     massive nuclear program, which the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency lending a hand. Hamza writes: ``Few of Iraq's \n     suppliers--or the IAEA itself--ever bothered to ask a simple \n     question: Why would Iraq, with the second-largest oil \n     reserves in the world, want to generate electricity by \n     burning uranium?''\n       IAEA inspectors were easily deceived and manipulated, \n     partly because any particularly aggressive inspector would \n     simply not be invited back. Not just the NPT, but most arms-\n     control agreements--the chemical and biological weapons \n     conventions, for example--rely on inspecting the \n     uninspectable. As Kathleen C. Bailey writes in a paper on \n     bioterrorism for the National Institute for Public Policy, \n     ``Biological weapons facilities can be small, temporary, and \n     without distinguishing features; there is no current means to \n     detect a clandestine biological weapons production \n     capability, absent serendipitous discovery.'' This is the \n     problem with inspections generally: They can be guaranteed \n     success only in the case of a nation not bent of frustrating \n     them.\n       This circularity applies to arms-control agreements more \n     broadly: They work so long as no one wants to violate them, \n     in which case they simply don't work. The danger is \n     forgetting this, and mistaking the sentiments and assurances \n     that come with signing an agreement--which are so comforting \n     and high-minded--with reality. This was a mistake that the \n     Clinton administration inflated almost to a strategic \n     doctrine: Don't verify, if you can trust instead.\n       Non-proliferation agreements are most effective when they \n     are composed of like-minded nations determined to deny \n     technology to a specific enemy, e.g., the Coordinating \n     Committee (CoCom) of Western nations that sought to keep \n     advanced military technology from the Warsaw Pact. The \n     Clinton administration instead wanted to transform such \n     organizations from, as Sokolski puts it, ``like-minded \n     discriminatory organizations to norm-based efforts that \n     increased members' access to technology''--in other words, it \n     sought to include the proliferators in the agreements in the \n     hopes that it would somehow reform them.\n       So, instead of cracking down on Moscow's missile \n     proliferation, for instance, the administration made Russia \n     part of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), even as \n     the Russians were flouting its terms. The EU wanted the \n     Russians in so that they could be a permitted market for \n     European aerospace sales, while the administration argued \n     that their membership would modify their behavior. When \n     Moscow's behavior was resolutely unmodified--it continued to \n     proliferate to Iran and Iraq--the administration rewarded the \n     Russians with various contracts and subsidies anyway.\n       Meanwhile, at the administration's urging, China bulked up \n     on treaties and agreements. It signed the NPT, the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, \n     and it (sort of) joined the MTCR. All these Good Housekeeping \n     seals made it easier for China to acquire Western weapons \n     technology, harder to punish it for any transgressions. And \n     did nothing to stop its proliferating. As an important 1998 \n     Senate report, ``The Proliferation Primer,'' put it, Beijing \n     still managed to be ``the principal supplier of weapons of \n     mass destruction and missile technology to the world.''\n       As with Russia, the Clinton administration not only failed \n     to punish the Chinese for their violations, it often rewarded \n     them. After Beijing sold anti-ship missiles to Iran, Sokolski \n     writes, the White House approved ``hundreds of millions worth \n     of sensitive U.S. missile-related exports to the very Chinese \n     firms known to be proliferating missiles.'' Such was the \n     pattern.\n       Russia and China--even if the Clinton administration \n     mishandled them--are at least major states susceptible to \n     U.S. influence. Now, thanks partly to their handiwork, \n     proliferation is so far advanced that an isolated basket case \n     like North Korea has graduated from weapons consumer to \n     weapons supplier. The North Korean No Dong missile has \n     become, as a result of Pyongyang's salesmanship, the missile \n     of choice in the third World. The Pakistani Ghauri and the \n     Iranian Shahab-3 are both really No Dongs. Iran, in turn, has \n     been able to market missile technology acquired from North \n     Korea to Syria, as the daisy chain moves from rogue to rogue.\n     What can be done\n       Despite this dismaying picture, the U.S. must still do all \n     it can at least to slow proliferation. Instead of ambitious \n     global agreements and conventions, the U.S. should seek to \n     create a CoCom-style regime focused on stopping proliferation \n     to the block of nations that are most likely to use or \n     threaten to use a weapon against the West or leak one to a \n     terrorist: Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, North Korea, and even \n     our rent-an-ally Pakistan. One reason the success of the \n     CoCom wasn't duplicated after the Cold War was that there was \n     no agreement on who the enemy was; now there should be.\n       The effort should spread in concentric rings, beginning \n     with tough export controls here in the U.S. No one--not \n     businessmen, not politicians, not our allies--likes export \n     controls, since they necessarily mean forgoing cash: but some \n     things are just more important. The argument against controls \n     is often that the technology in question is available \n     elsewhere, so why not have American-supplied Libyan poison-\n     gas plants rather than German? But we should lead by showing \n     our own willingness to spurn certain profits. Meanwhile, \n     European allies like Germany and France need to be convinced \n     that joining the war on terrorism means recognizing that some \n     export markets simply aren't worth having. Finally, we should \n     urge nations that are loitering on the outskirts of the \n     civilized world to choose up sides. Russia may choose the \n     right way, China probably won't.\n       But there are limits to what can be done to stop the spread \n     of weapons technology. Non-proliferators are in the position \n     of anti-drug warriors, constantly involved in a futile effort \n     to keep supply from meeting demand. It inevitably will. Then \n     what? When supply-side non-proliferation fails, demand-side \n     counter-proliferation should fill the breach. The best way to \n     end demand for weapons of mass destruction is to seek the \n     end--through diplomatic, economic, and military means--of the \n     governments that want them. Iraq should be the easiest case. \n     After years of flouting U.N. resolutions and international \n     inspections, after stockpiling tons of chemical and \n     biological agents and seeking a nuclear bomb, Saddam's regime \n     should be made into a demonstration of the consequences of \n     seeking weapons of mass destruction: It should be destroyed.\n       This would have an important educational effect. The reason \n     governments seek weapons of mass destruction is that they \n     know these weapons will increase their power. If they are \n     shown that the pursuit of these weapons could also end their \n     power, they might alter their calculations. In this light, \n     aiding the Iranian opposition is a more important act of non-\n     proliferation than getting President Khatami's signature on \n     some agreement. In a similar way, missile defense can change \n     the cost-benefit equation of acquiring missile technology by \n     undermining the utility of ballistic missiles. So, this \n     supposedly dangerously ``unilateral'' initiative--American \n     missile defense--buttresses the cause of non-proliferation. \n     Other unilateral actions, such as preemptive strikes on the \n     model of Israel's take-out of an Iraqi reactor in 1981, or \n     covert operations to sabotage technology shipments, can also \n     repress proliferation in a way that gaudy treaties cannot.\n       None of this will be easy. It will require Western self-\n     confidence, moral clarity, and, above all, military \n     superiority. The cause of keeping our enemies from attaining \n     weapons is achievable only with lots of weapons of our own: \n     an enormous conventional military superiority, a credible \n     nuclear deterrent, and--as a fail-safe--missile defense. But \n     adopting this more muscular, realistic approach to non-\n     proliferation is as urgent as the other kind seemed in 1946. \n     In the words of Bernard Baruch, ``to delay may be to die.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12029-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12029-S12030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I note with some dismay that the majority \nleader now seeks to fill time, given the fact we are not proceeding \nwith the debate on the stimulus package, with other matters, such as \nthe railroad retirement legislation. It seems to me we have a perfect \nopportunity to do what we should be doing in this interregnum, and that \nis to consider all the President's nominees who are languishing. We \nhave the time to debate these nominations and vote on them. Let's do \nit.\n  Case in point: The majority leader talks about bringing up the \nrailroad retirement legislation. This is the European-style, \nGovernment-backed occupational pension scheme. I think we would do \nbetter to complete the filling of the President's Cabinet.\n  Mr. President, as you know, John Walters is the last Cabinet member \nawaiting confirmation.\n  He is awaiting Senate confirmation to serve as Director of the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy, otherwise\n\n[[Page S12030]]\n\nknown as the national drug czar. When did his nomination come to us \nfrom the President of the United States? Way back in June, over 5 \nmonths ago. Finally, on October 10, the Senate Judiciary Committee held \na hearing on John Walters. It lasted over 3 hours. It was very \ncomplete. Following the hearing, Mr. Walters answered over 100 written \nfollowup questions, including questions from Members who were not on \nthe committee itself.\n  Finally, on November 8 the committee reported out John Walters by a \nvote of 14 to 5, but we understand that his nomination cannot be \nbrought up for us to debate and then vote because there are holds being \nplaced on his nomination by unnamed Democratic Senators.\n  I am calling upon the majority leader today to bring this nomination \nto the Senate. If there are objections to its consideration, let those \nwho object stand up and voice their objection and explain to us why \nthey object, even to the consideration of the nomination of an \nindividual who, as I say, has been pending now for over 5 months and is \nthe last person to complete the composition of the President's Cabinet.\n  There is another reason to try to conclude this matter, because the \nOffice of Drug Control Policy is one of the central parts of our \nGovernment that deals with drug trafficking around the world. Drug \ntrafficking is one of the ways in which terrorists who we are fighting \nfinance their terrorist activities. For the life of me, I cannot see \nhow someone would stand in the way of the confirmation of a person who \nis in line to help fight this way of funding terrorism around the \nworld.\n  We are supposed to be pulling out all of the stops to fight \nterrorism. Apparently, it is all except for one thing, and that is \ntheir financing because we have some political problem with confirming \nthe drug czar.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. Afghanistan grossed an estimated \n$180 billion in the drug trade last year. The Taliban generates an \nestimated $50 million in annual revenue from heroin trafficking. The \nTaliban, which of course has been harboring Osama bin Laden, has \noverseen the world's greatest growth in poppy plant cultivation as well \nas heroin production and trafficking.\n  According to the State Department, Afghanistan's poppy plant \ncultivation area has quadrupled since 1990. Just 2 weeks ago, the Wall \nStreet Journal reported that an Italian Government official stated that \nOsama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist network is funded through \ntrafficking.\n  The bottom line is, if we are really going to pull out all the stops \nin fighting terrorism, we have to cut off their financing, and that \nincludes their drug trafficking. One of the best ways of doing that is \nensuring the office we have set up to do that is headed by the \nPresident's nomination; namely, John Walters. Yet we cannot get this \nnomination before the Senate for confirmation.\n  John Walters has over 15 years of experience in drug prevention, \nbeginning in the middle 1980s. He served with the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy for a total of 4 years in the 1989 to 1993 period. \nIn his hearings, he made it very clear he would execute the policies of \nthe President, which have been widely hailed as necessary for us not \nonly to deal with the problems of drug use in the United States but to \ncut off the sources of drugs which, among other things, fund the \nterrorists. So I urge my colleagues, and I urge the majority leader, it \nis time to confirm John Walters as Director of the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy. Let us not delay this any longer. There apparently \nis no excuse in terms of time because the majority leader pointed out \nthis morning we apparently have time to consider other matters. So let \nus finish the confirmation process for the President's Cabinet before \nwe conclude our work in the first full year of the Bush administration. \nIt seems to me that is only fair. It is good policy, and it would help \nus in fighting the war on drugs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Madam President, I came to the Chamber after listening \nto several of my colleagues earlier this morning. The majority leader, \nSenator Daschle, was visiting with Senator Durbin about some of the \nimportant legislation we could be considering in these last couple of \nweeks in the Senate that would really be good for the American people.\n  First they spoke about the railroad retirement reform package, which \nwas mentioned by Senator Kyl. I think it is absolutely essential we \nbring up this issue. Last week, when I was in Arkansas celebrating \nThanksgiving, I was approached by an older woman who said: Why in the \nworld has this not been done?\n  This legislation has passed the House twice by incredibly large \nmargins. The last time it was 384 to 33. There are 75 Members of the \nSenate who are cosponsors of this issue. We have the railroad industry, \nthe union members, the workers in agreement. It is absolutely practical \nand realistic that we should bring up this issue and move it forward \nbecause it is going to benefit everybody, and that is what our job is, \nto bring up legislation that everyone has worked on, that we have come \nto some agreement on, that we have the majority of individuals in both \nbodies excited about and willing to move forward.\n  So I applaud the majority leader for bringing up this issue. I think \nthe time is right. I think the work has been done. The debate has been \nhad. People have worked out this issue, and we should be moving \nforward. We should be productive for the American people and \nparticularly for those in the railroad industry and those who are \nretired. I applaud the majority leader for his efforts, as well as the \nother Members of this body, and encourage him to move forward with it. \nThis is something we can do and something we should do before we leave, \nand I hope we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12030-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12030-S12031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FREEDOM TO FARM\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. One of the other issues that was brought up by my \ncolleagues earlier was the issue of our agricultural policy in this \ncountry, which, in my opinion, in the last 4 years has been less than \nwhat our farmers deserve. It is time now to give them some \npredictability and some understanding of where their Government is \ngoing to be for them.\n  It has been said the only constant is change, and that certainly has \nbeen true with our national farm policy. For the last 4 years or \nbetter, farmers--certainly Arkansas farmers--have harvested their crops \nwithout knowing if they would be able to afford to plant another crop \nin the following growing season. They had no predictability, no \nunderstanding of whether their Government was going to be for them.\n  As they looked at what was happening in the global economy with the \nfact that the European Union was consuming well over 80 percent of \nexport subsidies worldwide, they said they were not competing with \nother farmers across the globe.\n  Our farmers are competing with other governments. Where has their \nGovernment been in terms of a solid agricultural policy they can depend \non, particularly when they go to their financial institutions to get \nthe backing they need to put seed in the ground?\n  Of course, many remember that Congress passed the Freedom to Farm Act\n\n[[Page S12031]]\n\nback in 1996. For farmers in Arkansas, Freedom to Farm has been a \ndisaster because they depended too much on the ability to be able to \nnegotiate trade. We put our farmers in a position where, as we said we \nwere going to ratchet down the Government support and the Government \nsafety net, were they going to have to depend on the market.\n  We gave them flexibility. Flexibility was great, but flexibility \nwithout the backbone in trade does them no good, particularly in a time \nwhen we are seeing record lows in commodity prices.\n  Farmers are getting paid right now the same they were being paid in \nthe early 1940s, and yet their input costs are the highest they have \never been. They are making the same they were in 1940 when a combine \nprobably cost them about $15,000 to $25,000, and now they are paying \nanywhere from $180,000 to $200,000 for a combine.\n  Arkansas farmers and farmers around the country have been in limbo \nyear after year, waiting for Congress to pass emergency spending \nbills. The existing farm policy is absolutely inadequate. A farmer \ncannot just go to the banker and say, I think Congress is going to \nprovide us an emergency spending bill this year so you need to make \nsure you go ahead and give me that loan and maybe wait for another 9 to \n12 months to find out whether or not it will be backed by the \nGovernment.\n\n  As has the senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I have \nworked with my colleagues on that committee to write a bill this year, \nto get out of the Agriculture Committee a good, positive, and \ncomprehensive bill to address the needs of our farmers. I have been \nincreasingly concerned and dismayed as the Senate rushes to complete \nits business by the end of the year that farmers again will be left \nbehind. That is why, again, I was so proud to see the majority leader \ncome to the floor today to say we are going to take up a farm bill on \nthe Senate floor.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee, under the leadership of Chairman \nHarkin, has done its work to come up with a good bill that is \ncomprehensive, that will provide the safety net, as well as far-\nreaching, new, and innovative issues we need in a farm bill. They have \ndone their job. We will bring it up on the floor.\n  The House has done their job in passing a bill. We can compromise on \nthese bills because they have been created in a way that they have many \nsimilarities. We can get a bill to the desk of the President this year \nso our farmers, once again, do not have to go into the new year with \nthe uncertainty and the complete unpredictability of not knowing where \ntheir Government will be.\n  The Senate must pass this bill before we adjourn for the year because \nit is imperative, as the farmers go into this next planting season, \nthey have something they can bank on, one with a solid safety net that \nensures not only the financial viability of our farmers but also the \nviability of local bankers, merchants, seed dealers, fertilizer \ndealers, implement dealers, and rural institutions that depend on the \nstability our farmers provide.\n  The Senate bill also provided much needed funding for rural \ndevelopment and nutrition programs for disadvantaged families to help \nthose parts of our Nation where the needs are the greatest. An \nunbelievable conservation title helps in new and innovative ways, \nplacing the resources and efforts into proven conservation practices \nthat our farmers know they can use to mitigate those marginal lands on \nwhich it is more costly to produce. It includes funding for research \nand development to ensure that America remains a technological and \neconomic powerhouse in the coming century. It provides funding for \nforestry, biofuel development, and credit financing programs to \nguarantee sound farm financing.\n  The economy in this great Nation is in a delicate state. There is \nnothing that we can do here that will guarantee we will not go into a \nrecession. But there is one thing we can do that will absolutely \nguarantee a recession. We have seen it in our history's past. That is \nthat we allow the rural economy to collapse. If that rural economy \ncollapses, we will be assured not only of a recession but much greater \nproblems in our economy in coming years.\n  I applaud the majority leader for bringing up the issues on which we \nhave worked. We have worked out the details. It will be of great \nassistance to the American people, particularly in rural America. As we \nbegin with a farm bill that will be a great stimulus package to rural \nAmerica, we can also work out the details of an economic stimulus \npackage that will be comprehensive in helping workers in transition and \nalso provide the tax relief that industries need, particularly small \nbusinesses, to be able to grow and thrive and increase a growing \neconomy.\n  I hope that in the several days we have ahead of us and the work \nthere is yet to be done we can continue along the road that the \nmajority leader has paved for us in putting out these issues, that we \ncan get some agreement that will be beneficial to the American people, \nand that we can all go home at the end of these 2 weeks to a holiday \nand know we have done our very best. That is what we owe to the people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have listened this morning to the \nconversations on the floor. I think it is appropriate that we have had \nsome discussion about what we are going to do in the remaining time \nbefore us. I hope we can come to a little more of a cooperative \nunderstanding of what our agenda should be in the next 2 weeks. What \nare the things that are most important? What are the things we ought to \nhave as our priorities?\n  Obviously, we have to finish the appropriations, and we have only \nsent about half of those to the White House. So that is something we \nmust do. Obviously, there is difficulty in trying to complete the work \non the Defense appropriations.\n  It seems to me it is also important that we have a stimulus package. \nHowever, having been on the Finance Committee and sat through all the \ntalk about it, we expanded it far beyond where anyone would suggest \nthese were stimulus programs. I suppose you could expect that to \nhappen. We are at the end of a session. We are at a time when, because \nof the terrorist attacks, emergencies have arisen that must be \naddressed. But now we find that everyone who has ever had a thought \nabout where we ought to be spending more money wants to do it. I think \nwe have to be a little more thoughtful about where we are.\n  We started out with a budget that we agreed upon. I think it was \nabout $660-some billion. Then that was changed at the request of the \nPresident some time ago to $686 billion. In addition to that, of \ncourse, we have had another $40 billion, and another $5 billion, and \nagreed to guarantee another $10 billion. So we have spent a great deal \nof money. I think we have ought to give some thought as to what our \npriorities are to be at this point.\n\n  It is my belief we could come up with a stimulus package that would \ndeal with the needs of unemployment and some of the medical needs \nthere. I think we could do something that is rather limited in terms of \naccelerated depreciation that would cause businesses to create jobs, \nwhich is what we want to do. We do not need to spend $120 billion \nsimply because we have an excuse to spend.\n  So I am hopeful that we can get together on a stimulus package. The \nmajority leader said this morning the Republicans refuse to meet. That \nis not the case at all. The Republicans are not willing to have the \nAppropriations Committee be part of that meeting because it is a \nFinance Committee responsibility. That is where we ought to be; there \nis no question about that.\n  I hope we can take a little time now to say what our priorities \nshould be. We need a little vision, just over 2 weeks. It ought not to \nbe too difficult to decide what it is that we need to get done and step \naside from some of these other questions.\n  We are talking about a farm bill. I am on the Agriculture Committee \nand\n\n[[Page S12032]]\n\nwe have not even scored it. We don't know how much it will cost. Yet we \nare here. We want to get it on the floor. We have not had the farm bill \nbefore the committee, not even had a chance to look at it, but we were \nasked to mark it up. That is not the best way to deal with the \nimportant issues there. We can deal with them.\n  I am hopeful we will slow down just a moment, decide what it is that \nis most important for the country that we do in the very little time we \nhave, and not just absolutely think we ought to be spending every dime \nwe can possibly find. That is not necessarily the thing to do at this \npoint.\n  Hopefully, we will be able to do that. I hope we can do at least \nthose two things, the appropriations bills and the stimulus package. \nThese other things ought to have a little more thought. We are going to \nbe back next year, early. We can put a time certain on those and do \nthem at that point.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion of \nthe absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I rise to continue a discussion that began \nin morning business earlier today. That is on the issue of human \ncloning. I had not expected to be talking about this issue during the \nclosing days of this session of Congress. But I feel compelled to do so \nin light of Sunday's announcement. That is indeed very troubling for \neverybody as they seek to understand what this is all about after \nSunday's announcement that a U.S. company is pursuing the purposeful \ncreation of cloned human embryos.\n  I believe all human cloning for scientific reasons, for ethical \nreasons, and for reasons surrounding the health and safety of women \nshould be banned.\n  This whole subject of human cloning was the subject of a lot of \ndiscussion earlier this year. This summer, the House of Representatives \npassed a bill prohibiting the human cloning by a large and overwhelming \nmargin. But in light of the events of September 11, much of the \ndiscussion was put aside. A lot of that changed on Sunday. And now I \nbelieve it is incumbent upon the Senate to address this critical issue \nbefore adjourning for the year.\n  I urge the majority leader to call up the House bill and to allow the \nSenate to work its will on that bill. We don't have the luxury of time \nthat I think many of us thought we had. If we look over the last \nseveral years--really beginning in 1997, when Scottish researchers \nfirst captured the attention of the world after they used the process \ncalled somatic cell nuclear transfer to successfully clone that adult \nsheep by the name of Dolly--since that period of time a lot has \nhappened in this particular body. The portrayal of human cloning has \nintrigued our imagination over the last 4 to 5 years. But we all must \nrecognize that this is serious business. The idea that cloning human \nbeings may be technologically possible challenges our fundamental \nbeliefs--whether they be spiritual, or whether they be moral. Those \npeople who pay attention to science ask if it is really possible. I \nbelieve the answer is yes. But what it really causes us to do is to go \nback and challenge our fundamental beliefs on what the appropriate \nlimits are or should be of human control over nature.\n\n  I tell you, as a scientist and as someone who has thought a lot about \nend-of-life issues or beginning-of-life issues and disease and health, \nit provokes, in me, a lot of concern in terms of the issues of how much \nto intervene, at what point, what is someone's motive, and can that \nmotive be shifted in such a direction that the great promises of \nscience can be used to the abuse of what most people would regard as \ntheir moral sensibilities.\n  After the Dolly announcement, we held a series of hearings in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The first hearing \nfocused on science. We had scientists testify. We looked at all types \nof cloning: Animal cloning, human cellular cloning, and the cloning of \na human embryo, the cloning of human individuals.\n  At the second hearing we had ethicists and theological \nrepresentatives come in. We listened to distinguished individuals \ntestifying from the Christian faith, the Jewish traditions, the Islamic \ntraditions, all relating to human cloning. We also listened to \nphilosophers well schooled in biomedical ethics.\n  The story went on. The National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC), \nat the request of President Clinton, looked at, studied, and made a \nreport on the moral and ethical issues as well as the scientific \nstandpoints. NBAC then reported to the President that reproductive \ncloning was unsafe and should be prohibited by Federal law.\n  About a year after that, Senator Bond and I, based on our hearings, \nand based on that National Bioethics Advisory Committee report, \nintroduced the Human Cloning Prohibition Act along with a number of our \nother colleagues. That bill would have prohibited the use of somatic \ncell nuclear transfer technology to produce a human embryo.\n  At the time--and the time today is very different; again, that was in \n1998--the science of issues such as stem cell research, particularly \nembryonic stem cells, was all hypothetical. It was all theoretical. \nThis whole field of embryonic stem cell research existed, but only as a \nhope of what might be. No research using embryonic stem cells had \nactually been conducted at the time.\n  The overall science of these issues, of cloning and stem cell \nresearch, was relatively undeveloped and even less understood. The bill \ngot caught up in a lot of concerns that it could prevent this whole \nfield of embryonic stem cell research from progressing, and the bill \nreally fell by the wayside.\n  Indeed, almost 2 years would pass between the announcement of Dolly, \nthe sheep, in 1997 and the groundbreaking reports on the successful \nisolation of what are called human pluripotent stem cells. It was 2 \nyears after Dolly.\n  Now, more than 2 additional years past, the field of embryonic stem \ncell research has really made great strides, although it is still in \nits infancy, as we are seeing today. Today there are more than 60 \nestablished embryonic stem cell lines worldwide. The research, I \nbelieve, does show great promise for stem cell research as we look to \nthe future.\n  We have also learned a lot about adult stem cells. Only recently \npeople understood there are two--indeed, there are three--but two main \ntypes of stem cells: One is adult, and one is embryonic. A lot of our \ntraditionally held beliefs about the adult stem cells, the fact that \nthey can only go in one direction, have been modified as we have \nstudied them scientifically. Now we know they are not restricted to one \nfate or one direction.\n\n  This past year, the NIH spent $250 million on stem cell research. \nThat number, I am quite certain, is going to grow in the future because \nof the promise of stem cell research for therapies for a range of \ndiseases. That money will be spent for both adult stem cell and \nembryonic stem cell research.\n  I will say that overall stem cell research is in its very early \nstages and there is a lot to learn. I have just outlined what we have \nlearned in the last 2 years, and in the 2 years prior to that from the \ntime that Dolly was first cloned.\n  But what we can say now, with confidence, I believe, is that a ban on \nhuman cloning--again, we are talking about stem cells and human \ncloning--a ban on human cloning will not be a barrier in any way to the \naggressive pursuit of embryonic or adult stem cell research. I would \nargue that it is just to the contrary of what some people say, that if \nyou ban human cloning in some way it might slow down stem cell \nresearch.\n\n[[Page S12033]]\n\n  Why do I say that? It comes back to a debate we had on this floor 6 \nor 8 months ago when we were talking about stem cells. It is my belief \nthat embryonic stem cell research, which I believe has great promise, \nand adult stem cell research can best be conducted in an environment, a \nframework, where you have ethical considerations, moral considerations, \nand a legal framework defined. That way, the American people can trust \nwhat is being done, what we are investing in, in relation to what the \nscientists are doing.\n  I would argue that that legal framework around stem cell research--to \nallow it to progress--demands, as one of its criteria, that we ban the \ncloning of human beings, that we ban human cloning. That is what is \nbefore us today as we define what America is thinking today. Where do \nthe scientists fit in with all this? You will hear different scientists \nsaying different things. But I think it is also clear that, \nscientifically, embryonic stem cell research can and will be able to \nproceed aggressively without the use of therapeutic cloning.\n  I think it is generally believed that most scientists consider the \nfield of human cloning too immature and unknown if the goal is to \nsafely attempt to clone a human being. Most scientists will agree it is \ntoo early. We do not know enough today.\n  What about therapeutic cloning? You hear these words. You have \nreproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning. And with more time we \nwill probably get more into that. But conceptually there are two \ndifferent types of cloning.\n  Some people say we should ban reproductive cloning but we should \nallow the therapeutic cloning to proceed. I would argue with the \nintent. We have heard people say they want to clone human beings. They \nsaid they are going to go out and do it. Now the technology, as we saw \n3 days ago, is likely to get there. So they are likely to do it.\n  So when you are creating a human embryo, and you say you are going to \nuse it just therapeutically, it is just too easy to take that embryo \nand implant it in the womb, and then it is reproductive cloning. And \nthere will be more opportunity to talk about the differences there.\n  I will say therapeutic cloning is not necessary for rapid scientific \nadvancement. The 60-plus stem cell lines out there are sufficient for \nFederal researchers to aggressively move in the direction of productive \nresearch. Moreover, the idea of therapeutic cloning, intended to combat \nthe danger of autoimmune rejection, something I as a transplant surgeon \nam very aware of, carries with it challenges of its own and does not \nnecessarily solve the problem of autoimmune rejection.\n\n  Let me just shift very quickly to risk. There are real risks to human \ncloning. Even those people who are not repulsed by creating superhuman \nbeings and having people created in their own image and control--this \nwhole field of human cloning is almost godlike--even those people, when \nyou push them, recognize the frightening risks of human cloning.\n  Four years ago, it took about 270 attempts to get Dolly, the sheep. \nWhether it is 200 or 500 or 100, you translate that down to human \nbeings, and that means 270 still births, 270 miscarriages, 270 deformed \nbirths--all because we do not know enough. It is simply not safe.\n  I think we should move quickly to prohibit human cloning no matter \nwhat the stated purpose. We do not act alone. Other nations are also \nstruggling in responding to this issue as well. France and Germany have \ndeveloped legislation to prohibit human cloning, and they have called \nupon the United Nations to take up this matter on the international \nlevel.\n  I believe the creation of human embryos purely for research purposes \nalone is the exploitation of human life. I say it, yes, as a pro-life \nSenator, but I think the idea of creating human embryos for the reason \nof just research is an exploitation that even the National Bioethics \nAdvisory Commission and newspaper editorial pages, including the \nWashington Post have opposed. Why? Because you ultimately have to \ndestroy those embryos.\n  There is also another issue about which I hope we will have the \nopportunity to talk. It is actually in an article from November 25 in \nthe St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The heading of the article says: ``Buying \nand Selling of Women's Eggs Raise Fears of Bidding Wars.'' The first \nsentence states:\n\n       Egg donors needed. Healthy women ages 18-32 willing to help \n     infertile couples.\n\n  In another paragraph it says:\n\n       In California, the increasing demand has resulted in a \n     flourishing egg-donation industry that can reward donors with \n     payments equivalent to a semester's tuition at an Ivy League \n     school. Greater demand also has increased prices on the East \n     Coast by several thousand dollars.\n\n  I mention that because clearly if there are individuals or companies \nout there with what inevitably will be a financial incentive to \nobtaining these eggs, the burden is very likely to fall upon women of \nlow income.\n  The eggs will have to be obtained through a medical procedure. The \nmedical procedure has its own risks as well. There are no safeguards \ntoday for women who would be used as sources of the needed eggs. I \nbelieve that a failure to prohibit human cloning not only poses a real \nrisk to the health and safety of the women but will have the effect of \nturning their bodies into commodities.\n  In closing, because of statements by many people around the world who \nhave said they are going to clone human beings and the recent \nannouncement on Sunday which shows that human cloning is much closer on \nthe horizon unless we act, I encourage my colleagues in this body and \nthe majority leader, to bring up the House bill and allow us to modify \nthat bill, if necessary.\n  The bill has already been passed by the House of Representatives. It \nis very similar to the bill Senator Bond and I introduced along with \nothers 3 years ago. The House has improved it. They expand the \ndefinitions and exclusions from the original bill. The only act \nprohibited in that bill is human cloning.\n  Our challenge is to move quickly and carefully. We need to move \nquickly to achieve the goal of prohibiting human cloning without--it is \nimportant to understand--harming the important biomedical research \nwhich will be allowed to continue. That goal is within our grasp.\n  The majority leader has said we will bring up this bill next spring. \nBecause of recent incidents, I encourage him to do it as soon as we can \nthis year. The risks of delay simply are too great. Our responsibility \nis clear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \narticle I cited be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the St. Louis-Dispatch, Nov. 25, 2001]\n\n     Buying and Selling of Women's Eggs Raise Fears of Bidding Wars\n\n                          (By Michelle Meyer)\n\n       ``Egg donors needed. Healthy women ages 18-32 willing to \n     help infertile couples.''\n       Adrienne Smith spotted the ad submitted by the infertilty \n     and Reproductive Medicine Center at Washington University in \n     the Riverfront Times earlier this year. Having read articles \n     about egg donation, she knew that clinics paid several \n     thousand dollars for young women's eggs.\n       Smith, 24, works as an administrative assistant and is \n     planning on taking classes to become a certified massage \n     therapist. That money could help pay her tution, so she \n     applied to become a donor.\n       The experience went well for Smith. Doctors successfully \n     extracted her eggs and donated them to an infertile couple. \n     Smith will never meet the couple, nor the offspring who might \n     result. But she was paid $2,500 and she also has the \n     satisfaction of knowing that she is helping people who long \n     to become parents.\n       Even so, the buying and selling of women's eggs raise \n     troubling issues. With an estimated 6 million U.S. women \n     suffering from infertility, the demand for transplanted eggs \n     is great. Medical ethicists and reproductive specialists fear \n     a bidding war may be in the offing. And that, in turn, could \n     lure women into the program who are ill-suited or unprepared \n     for the rigors of donating their eggs.\n       In California, the increasing demand has resulted in a \n     flourishing egg-donation industry that can reward donors with \n     payments equivalent to a semester's tuition at any Ivy League \n     school. Greater demand also has increased prices on the East \n     Coast by several thousand dollars.\n       No one can say for sure how many young women are donating \n     eggs in the St. Louis area. What is clear is that sizeable \n     fees paid to donors on the coasts aren't as prevalent in the \n     Midwest.\n       But some are already concerned. ``The higher the amount of \n     money, the more danger there is that a woman might take risks\n\n[[Page S12034]]\n\n     that she might not ordinarily take for the sake of the \n     money,'' says Rebecca Dresser, professor of law and ethics in \n     medicine at Washington University and a member of American \n     Society of Reproductive Medicine. ``The huge financial \n     incentive increases the incentive to conceal health issues \n     both to her own health and that of her offspring.''\n       The business of matching egg donors and infertile couples \n     is largely unregulated with well-established medical \n     institutions--like Washington University--and independent \n     brokers involved. Some solicit and match donors \n     discreetly. Others aren't shy about touting their prices \n     to donors and bragging to infertile couples that their \n     donors are some of the best looking and most intelligent \n     people around.\n       Attracted by the promise of big money, potential donors may \n     be unaware of the demands of egg extraction.\n\n\n                          retrieving the eggs\n\n       For egg donor Smith, that meant injecting herself daily \n     with ovarian stimulation shots, visiting the doctor's office \n     a half dozen times and enduring an uncomfortable bloating of \n     her abdomen that prevented her from wearing her regular \n     clothing. At the end of the process, a doctor administered a \n     mild anesthesia and poked Smith's ovaries with a long needle, \n     extracting the eggs that had ripened inside of her.\n       Awaiting the final procedure, Smith read an article about \n     infertility and began to cry. ``I realized there is no amount \n     of money that can compensate you for what you are doing,'' \n     Smith said. ``I sat there reading about these people who were \n     so excited by the chance to actually have a child. Helping \n     people is very important to me. I hope and pray that a \n     pregnancy came out of it.''\n       The egg retrieval took less than 45 minutes, and within an \n     hour, Smith was awake and ready to go home. Like most women, \n     Smith experienced mild abdominal discomfort and soreness for \n     several days. Immediately following the retrieval, her eggs \n     were fertilized with the recipient husband's sperm and \n     implanted into the wife's womb.\n       ``Egg donors needed. $3,500. Must be 21-34.''\n       Surrogate Parenting Center of Texas placed this simple, \n     straightforward ad on the back page of a recent Riverfront \n     Times. It is representative of many ads targeting readers in \n     that age range. Many appear in college newspapers, including \n     those at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, Washington \n     University and St. Louis University.\n       ``We had a lot of ads (requesting donors) run last year,'' \n     says Nick Bowman, editor of the UMSL's newspaper, The \n     Current. ``But since my regime as editor this year, we \n     haven't seen as many.\n       Many ads appeal to a donor's sense of compassion. Dr. \n     Ronald Wilbois of the Infertility and IVF Center of St. Louis \n     says, ``There is no mention of monetary compensation in our \n     ads, although some people in town have done that. I think you \n     get into this big problem of clinics competing with each \n     other if you do that. Plus, we don't want money to be the big \n     draw. We have found that women who do it for the money are \n     not real reliable as a group.''\n       The IVF Center performs six to eight donor egg retrieval \n     procedures a month, and unlike several clinics in the area, \n     doesn't have a waiting list for eggs, according to Wilbois. \n     But he admits that it can be difficult to find ``good'' \n     donors.\n       Many women do not pass the stringent physical and medical \n     screening required. Donors are required to submit complete \n     medical and family histories, as well as pass various screens \n     for infectious diseases and medical or genetic disorders. \n     About 10 percent find that their eggs are not viable.\n\n\n                        the internet connection\n\n       The Internet has become a resource for couples seeking egg \n     donors. Web sites provide a quick database that has replaced \n     time-consuming paper files. Some sites include photos of \n     young women, as well as personal information such as IQ \n     level, high schook grade point average and physical \n     measurements.\n       Dawn T. Hunt is an egg broker in California who helps to \n     pair infertile couples with donors. Her company, Fertility \n     Alternatives Inc., posts pictures of young women interested \n     in donating, including some from St. Louis. The Web site, \n     www.geocities.com/fertilityalternatives/oocyte.html, \n     classifies some of the women as ``exceptional donors,'' those \n     with above-average intelligence, academic achievements or \n     physical attractiveness.\n       One ``exceptional'' donor, a young woman referred to as \n     Rachel M., is a graduate of Washington University residing in \n     the St. Louis area. Rachel is 23 with short blonde hair and a \n     doll-like round face who scored 1430 on her SAT and earned a \n     3.66 GPA in graduate school. Individuals wanting to make a \n     baby with Rachel's eggs can expect to pay $8,000, although \n     that fee is negotiable. Hunt will get part of that money.\n       ``I found a lot of my people wanted attractive donors with \n     proven intelligence . . . so I gave it to them,'' Hunt said. \n     ``My clientele feels guilty about (placing so much importance \n     on physical attractiveness) but if it were me. I would \n     probably want an attractive donor.''\n       The ethical debate over the sale of human eggs heightened \n     after ``Ron's Angels'' appeared on the Internet in 1999. Ron \n     Harris, a California fashion photographer, posted pictures \n     of models on his site in an effort to create an auction \n     for the eggs of beautiful women. Reportedly, bids for \n     model's eggs soared as high as $42,000.\n       Last year, members of the American Society for Reproductive \n     Medicine suggested that compensation up to $5,000 is \n     appropriate for the donation of eggs but that anything above \n     $10,000 is inappropriate.\n       But those are merely guidelines. Currently, every state \n     except Louisiana allows for the sale of human eggs. And no \n     states have enacted legislation aimed at capping fees or \n     regulating egg donation.\n       Educators worry that students may be ill-prepared to weigh \n     the costs and benefits of selling their eggs.\n       ``I think college students would be vulnerable to this kind \n     of solicitation because of the extreme financial incentive,'' \n     said Judith Gibbons, a professor of psychology at St. Louis \n     University who specializes in issues of early adulthood. \n     ``When I ask college students about their major concerns, \n     financial worries are always on top of the list. But I would \n     never want to take their autonomy away from them because they \n     are adults and can make their own decisions.''\n       Dresser, the Washington University professor, fears that \n     young people may regret their decisions later in life. ``When \n     they are that young they may not fully appreciate that there \n     may be some risks to their future fertility,'' she said. ``Of \n     course, it is only speculation at this point because we don't \n     know if there is a danger to future fertility. Egg donation \n     has only been going on for a few years, so we haven't been \n     able to follow these women over time.''\n       Smith said that while trying to decide whether to become a \n     donor, she wrestled with the idea of possibly having a child \n     in the world and not knowing him or her. Although the thought \n     bothered her, she decided to go ahead anyway.\n       Dr. Sherman Silber of the Infertility Center of St. Louis \n     refuses to solicit donors with ads. ``I felt that was abusive \n     to women. I don't like the idea of targeting a young 19- or \n     20-year-old girl who needs money.''\n       But if all goes well, the process can be fulfilling for \n     everyone involved.\n       Tonya Weisheyer, 23, of Winfield, has donated her eggs \n     twice and is now acting as a surrogate mother. For her first \n     donation, Weisheyer donated to a couple in Boston and flew \n     there for her egg retrieval, although she did not meet the \n     prospective parents. Two weeks after her donation, Weisheyer \n     got a call from the couple's lawyer informing her that the \n     wife was pregnant.\n       After the donation, the couple sent Weisheyer a large \n     bouquet of flowers and gift certificates to Toys `R' Us for \n     Weisheyer's three children, ``I was in tears,'' Weisheyer \n     said. ``Just hearing they were pregnant was enough for me. \n     Just to know that I had helped them to accomplish their \n     dream. I was on cloud nine all day.''\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding a topic that has \nemerged dramatically over the past 7 weeks, a topic that everybody in \nthe United States of America has thought about, a topic that many of us \nin the Senate have been thinking about over the last 3 years. That \ntopic is the use of viruses, bacteria, and other germs as bioterrorist \nweapons.\n  Going back 3 years when the Senate Public Health Subcommittee began \nto look at the issue of bioterrorism, we had a series of hearings to \nstudy in depth the ability of our Nation's public health \ninfrastructure. Those three words--``public health infrastructure''--\nare words about which we hear a lot. People ask me: What is the public \nhealth infrastructure? I will address that question in a few minutes.\n  The public health infrastructure is the basis of our preparedness and \nresponse to such bioterrorist attacks--who we call if something \nhappens, what they do, who does the test, how they communicate with \neach other, and how quickly they respond. When we began addressing the \nissue of bioterrorism, we wanted to look at the local, State, and \nnational level. We wanted to examine how those systems respond to \npublic health threats.\n  We had a series of hearings beginning 3 years ago focused \nspecifically on our preparedness to respond to a bioterrorist attack--\nthe use of viruses, bacteria, and germs with the intent to create \nterror or to kill. The testimony of\n\n[[Page S12035]]\n\nthe witnesses fascinated me because few people were talking about \nbioterrorism. Our intelligence community was looking at it \ninternationally, but people on the street corners, on Main Street, or \nin town squares were not thinking about bioterrorism 3 years ago.\n  After listening to these witnesses, it was very clear that it was no \nlonger a question of ``if'' there would be a bioterrorist attack, but \n``when, where, and how.'' When it did occur, we knew that a \nbioterrorist attack would not only occur on foreign soil but also on \nthe soil of the United States.\n  These hearings also made equally clear to those of us on the \nsubcommittee that the threat, the risk, was increasing and that our \nNation was not fully prepared to meet the potential risk that could \npresent.\n  As legislators do, we listened intently. We talked to the American \npeople. We collected more information, and then we wrote a bill called \nthe Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act. That bill had as its \nmain goal two things--coordination of response and improvement of \npublic health infrastructure. The coordination was two-fold horizontal, \nor coordination of all the different local organizations, entities, \nagencies at the point of the attack; and vertical, or coordination of \nthe Federal, State, and local agencies that would all have a \nresponsibility to respond.\n  The second goal of this crucial legislation was to improve the \nresources to support the public health infrastructure, principally at \nthe State and local level. I encourage my colleagues to consider what \nthey would do if there was a bioterrorist attack at their home or at \ntheir work. Given what occurred in the Hart Building just last month, \nthat consideration should not be too difficult.\n  We passed that bill, and that bill was actually signed into law about \na year ago, long before September 11. It was referred to the floor by \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee through the \nSubcommittee on Public Health. At the time, I chaired that \nsubcommittee, and Senator Kennedy was the ranking member. Both Senator \nKennedy and I have continued our interest in this topic over the last 3 \nyears.\n  In terms of bioterrorism, what did September 11 and the ensuing \nevents around the country do? It took what we thought was low risk and \nhigh vulnerability to a bioterrorist attack and made us realize that \nthere was high risk and high vulnerability. As things appeared in the \nnews and we learned about new inhalation anthrax cases, we realized our \nrisks had increased markedly after September 11, and that our \nvulnerabilities, which we knew were high, were more clearly defined.\n  We know where the gaps are today because we have learned from the \nevents of the past 3 months. We knew that some gaps existed, but the \npublic health infrastructure is so large that it was difficult to \ndetermine exactly where those gaps were without having a specific \nchallenge to the system. I mention that because now is the time to act. \nWe did not have all of the information when we passed the Public Health \nThreats and Emergencies Act, but we had the foundation a framework that \nfocused on prevention, preparedness, and consequence management. That \nsame framework is still valid, and we now know where those defined gaps \nin the public health infrastructure are.\n  We are now aware of our increased risks and defined vulnerabilities \nor gaps in the system. Now is the time to address those gaps before we \nhave another challenge to our system. We have a responsibility to the \nAmerican people, to the people on Main Street, to the people in Alamo, \nTN--people who might not be thinking about what our government should \nbe doing. It is our responsibility as government officials in the \nFederal, State, and local level to fill those gaps.\n  Eighteen people have already been infected with anthrax. Another five \nor so suspicious cases are currently being examined. Five have already \ndied. I have had the opportunity to see firsthand how these few cases \nhave stretched our public health infrastructure, have stressed the \npeople who respond--the medical and laboratory personnel. The number of \nanthrax diagnostic tests have overwhelmed the system for these 18 \ncases.\n  It could have been worse. If the same amount of anthrax had been \ndelivered by aerosolization, it would affected not 10, 15, 20, 30 \npeople but clearly hundreds, indeed, thousands of people.\n  We have to act. We have 2 or 3 weeks before we leave. If we do not \nact, if we do not pass comprehensive legislation that looks at \npreparedness, prevention, and consequence management as well as filling \nthe newly identified gaps, we have not fulfilled our responsibility to \nthe American people.\n  We are learning more about anthrax and bioterrorism every day, and we \nneed to continue to learn from these recent events. We do not know when \nand if there will be any future biological attacks, but we are on an \nalert now.\n  We know terrorists are around the world. We know what terrorists have \nsaid--Osama bin Laden has said that it is his religious duty to obtain \nbiological weapons of mass destruction. We know that the same \nmotivation that sent those airplanes into the World Trade Center and 2 \nmiles from the Capitol at the Pentagon still exists. When that \nmotivation for mass destruction is coupled with the hard evidence that \nOsama bin Laden and other terrorists intend to gain access to bacteria, \nto viruses, to germs, then we must conclude that the risk for \nbioterrorist attacks, whatever it was on September 9 or 10, is larger \nnow and growing.\n  Again, we need to respond. We have already identified some \nvulnerabilities. Now is the time to respond. Because the risk is \nincreasing, we must have a real response.\n  What is our next step? I mentioned that the Public Health Threats and \nEmergencies Act of 2000 passed a year ago. It has the basic framework \nof prevention, preparedness, and consequence management. Now is the \ntime to build on that framework. Now is the time to appropriate the \nfunds for that act. We have not yet put significant money into \nsupporting that public health infrastructure, that crucial link in \nprotecting us from and responding to any future biological attacks. The \nPublic Health Threats and Emergencies Act was never fully funded. I am \nnot pointing the finger at anybody, but now is the time to fund those \nissues.\n  More resources for that infrastructure are needed. I would ask that \nyou call your local public health official and ask that person: How \nstretched are you? How prepared are you if there is an outbreak of \nSalmonella, botulinum toxin, tularemia, smallpox, or anthrax in your \ncommunity? Call them on the phone and see what they say. I know what \nthey will say because I have talked to many of them lately. They will \ntell you that they have a few people working to address the issue, but \nthey do not have the ability to communication with local hospitals, \nclinics, or other health care delivery systems. Your local public \nhealth official will tell you that they cannot rapidly identify those \ngerms.\n  If one thinks of things such as smallpox--and this is not to be \nalarmist because I think the risk of smallpox is tiny--we need people \nto diagnosis it quickly, communicate rapidly, and make sure the \nvaccines get there on time. If the system operates properly, then we \nwould be okay.\n  I mention all this because a week ago Thursday, I, along with Senator \nKennedy and 40 of our colleagues, introduced a bill called the \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001. We entered statements into the \nRecord but did not have time to actually speak on the particular bill. \nI encourage my colleagues to read the bill and its summary. You can \nfind two summaries--a one-page summary and a six-page summary--120-page \nbill on my website.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001 incorporates the \nrecommendations by President Bush to improve the national \npharmaceutical stockpile. It includes authorized funding for the \ndevelopment of additional doses of the smallpox vaccine. It includes \nthe funding to help encourage the development of additional vaccines \nand other bioterrorism countermeasures.\n\n  Given the whole host of germs available for use--tularemia, anthrax, \nsmallpox, botulinum toxins--we cannot concentrate on one virus or \nbacteria or other germ because the terrorists, if they want to, will \nsimply move to another germ once we have developed an appropriate \nresponse. Therefore, a vaccine, although an important part of the\n\n[[Page S12036]]\n\ncomprehensive policy, is not the complete answer to the risk of germ \nbiowarfare.\n  In our bill, we also provide substantial additional funds, over $1 \nbillion to the States and local communities, to improve the public \nhealth infrastructure. If something happens to someone's daughter and/\nor son and they suspect bioterrorism, we call on the public health \ninfrastructure. What we need to do is have them prepared to receive \nthat phone call and to respond in an effective way, and we provide the \nfunds to make sure they are prepared to receive that phone call.\n  In our bill, we look at revitalizing the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention's training initiatives. We look at response \ncapabilities. We look at epidemiologic capacity.\n  We do not disturb the Federal funding established under the Public \nHealth Threats and Emergencies Act that goes into the core facility \nlaboratories, the public health capacities. In fact, we broaden the \nfunding streams and increase the authorization for these capacity-\nbuilding activities.\n  Not only will these additional funds assist us in the event of \nanother biological attack, but the strengthening of the public health \ninfrastructure means that we will also be able to respond to other \ninfectious diseases as well. No matter what infectious disease it is, \nwhether it is a result of a terrorist attack or a natural-occurring \ndisease, we need the same response--quick diagnosis, high surveillance, \ngood communication, and quick treatment.\n  In our bill, there is also a section on food safety protections, \nwhich I hope my colleagues will examine. My number one priority is to \nensure that we address all of the issues laid out in the bill because \nthe bill focuses on the entire system required to respond to any future \nbioterrorist attack--a system dependent upon the public health \ninfrastructure.\n  I close simply by saying we have made tremendous progress. Our \ncolleagues have spent a lot of time looking at the issues in putting \ntogether this bill. I encourage them, once again, to look at what is in \nthis bill and understand the comprehensive framework of prevention, \npreparedness, and consequence management as we move forward. The gaps \nhave been defined in the public health infrastructure. Now is the time \nto respond. The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act gives that framework. I \nencourage my colleagues to support it when it comes to the floor.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING Officer.

I ask unanimous consent the motion be considered as \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be brief I know my colleagues may wish to speak \non this issue. This bill passed with an overwhelming 384 votes in the \nHouse. There is very, very strong bipartisan support in the Senate; 74 \nof our colleagues have cosponsored the bill, including a majority in \nboth the Democratic and Republican caucuses. All the rail unions are \nunited behind this bill, and it is supported by the entire railroad \nindustry. It represents the first time in 25 years that labor, \nmanagement and retirees have agreed on a set of changes to the system.\n  The reason is pretty simple. Most Members recognize we want to give \nrailroad retirees the same opportunity as other retirees in the private \nsector, the opportunity to maximize their investment opportunities for \nretirement purposes. This bill would simply give them as many different \noptions as we already provide to others in the private sector.\n  As a result of increased returns from these investments, it would \nprovide enhanced benefits for railroad retirees and reduce retirement \ntaxes for railroad companies. Among other things, it would expand \nbenefits for surviving spouses, provide a retiree health insurance plan \nand reduce the vesting requirement to five years. These are important \nchanges that should be made.\n  Enactment of this bill is long overdue. It is a good bill. It \ndeserves our support. I am disappointed we are not able to move to it \nthis afternoon. I will schedule a cloture vote on Thursday. We will do \nall we can to ensure that the legislation is considered and passed. It \ndeserves our support, as it was given support in the House. We will do \nall we can to see that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in the 24 years I have served in Congress, \nI have seen many ideas debated; some of them good, some of them bad. I \nguess we are all prone, on the spur of the moment, to overstate things, \nbut I think I can say without any fear of contradiction that of all the \nbills I have ever seen on which cloture has been filed, this comes \nclosest to simply being an overt effort by two established and powerful \nspecial interests to literally pilfer the retirement fund that is \navailable for railroad retirees, and the backing for that retirement \nfund.\n  Part of our problem in debating a bill such as this is that there is \na natural tendency in a partisan body when, in this case railroads and \nrailroad unions get together, everybody sees this as an opportunity to \njump on the bandwagon. I don't know that I would state it as any first \nlaw of political behavior, but normally when business and labor get \ntogether on something, it is generally an effort to reach deeply into \nthe pockets of the American taxpayer. That is what the provision before \nus is, in reality.\n\n[[Page S12037]]\n\n  We have a retirement trust fund which has built up for railroad \nretirement, principally as a result of the action we took when railroad \nretirement was going broke and when Social Security was going broke. My \ncolleagues will remember that we passed a bill changing the retirement \nage, setting up a procedure where the retirement age would rise--in the \ncase of railroad retirement from 60 to 62; in the case of everybody \nelse's retirement, from 65 to 67. We made other changes. In the \nprocess, back in the mid-1980s, we were able to bring some degree of \ntemporary solvency to both these programs.\n  The net result in railroad retirement is that we have built up a \ntrust fund for railroad retirement of $19.2 billion. I remind my \ncolleagues and everybody in the country who is listening to this debate \nthat we talk about Social Security being in deep trouble now because we \nstarted out with 42 workers per retiree, and we are down to 3 workers \nper retiree. And we are heading over the next 30 years to 2 workers per \nretiree.\n  Obviously, when you have two workers supporting one retiree, you are \ntalking about a very heavy burden.\n  In railroad retirement, we have one worker supporting three retirees. \nEvery problem we have in Social Security, multiply it by 9, and you \nhave some index of the problem in railroad retirement. Also, you have \nthe implicit taxpayer guarantee behind that program.\n  What has literally happened? What gave rise to the bill that is now \nbefore us in the form of a cloture motion is that railroads, facing \nsome financial difficulty, got together with the railway unions and \nbasically said: We have built up a base of financial assets--in this \ncase Treasury bonds--of $19.2 billion. So what we should do is take $15 \nbillion of that money out of the retirement program and roughly give \nhalf of it to the railroads and give half of it to the retirees. And, \nin the process, commit the taxpayer to deal with the problem if \ninsolvency is faced in the future.\n  What we have before us is literally an effort by two powerful vested \ninterests to take $15 billion of the $19.2 billion in the railroad \nretirement trust fund and literally divide it up, with roughly half of \nit going to the railroads and roughly half going to the employees of \nthe railroads and the retirees. In fact, the Railroad Retirement Board, \nin their data, in analyzing this proposal, has basically concluded \nthat the net result of this will be that $15 billion will be taken out \nof the retirement trust fund over the next 17 years. So what the \nproposal before us does is pilfer $15 billion.\n\n  Obviously, people have some shame; not much, but they have a little. \nSo rather than saying we are simply going to steal this $15 billion and \nwe are going to get 74 Members of the Senate to applaud when we steal \nit, they came up with a clever ruse. The clever ruse is to say: Look, \nlet's take this $15 billion and invest it. Instead of having it in \nGovernment bonds, we will invest it in stocks and bonds. So as a result \nof this new investment and the new rate of return that we will get, we \nwill be able to do some things to help the railroads and to help the \nemployees.\n  The problem is, before any investment is ever made, they are lowering \nthe retirement age. They are cutting taxes on the employers. They are \nexpanding benefits for employees, and when you add it all up, even with \na higher rate of return that they hope to gain over the next 25 years, \nthe trust fund will be $28.7 billion lower under this new proposal than \nit would be under current law. The $15 billion in question would be \ncompletely pilfered over the next 17 years. These are not my numbers. \nThese are the numbers of the Railroad Retirement Board.\n  What does the bill do? First of all, it immediately cuts taxes on \nrailroads that they are paying in to support these retirement programs. \nIt cuts their tax rate from 16.1 percent to 14.75 percent, and it does \nthat next year. Then it cuts it again in calendar year 2003, to 14.2 \npercent. So the net result is that in very short order, $4 billion from \nthe retirement trust fund is transferred from the trust fund to the \nrailroads.\n  I remind my colleagues that beginning this year, based on the Social \nSecurity solvency bill we passed in the early 1980s, the retirement age \nfor American workers is starting to go up. We are moving from 65 to 67, \nthe age that you have to be to draw full Social Security benefits. We \nare in the process of the largest increase in the retirement age in \nAmerican history beginning this year. But what do you think the bill \nbefore us does for people who work for railroads?\n  At the very instant that we are raising the retirement age for \neverybody else from 65 to 67, remarkably, almost unbelievably, we lower \nthe retirement age for people who work for railroads from 62 to 60.\n  Survivors of railway workers already get substantially better \nbenefits than survivors from Social Security, but we raise those \nbenefits. We change the vesting requirements. The net result is that \nover 17 years, roughly $7.5 billion is taken out of the railroad \nretirement trust fund and is given to the railroads. Roughly $7.5 \nbillion is taken out of railroad retirement and given to beneficiaries \nby lowering the retirement age, by raising survivor benefits, by \nchanging the vesting requirements--in essence, increasing benefits. $15 \nbillion is pilfered over a 17-year period under this bill.\n\n  You might say, well, this is sort of a victimless crime because the \nrailroads are for it, and the railroad retirees are for it. It is their \n$19.2 billion. They are pilfering $15 billion, and it was their money \nto begin with. So where is the victim? In fact, 73 Members of the \nSenate signed on to the bill. It is obvious that has been the question. \nWhere is the victim?\n  The victim, as is usually the case when powerful vested interests get \ntogether, is the taxpayer. The taxpayer stands in line to cover \nshortfalls in the future.\n  It is true that in the future, up to a point, you can raise the tax \non the railroads. There is no provision for requiring employees to give \nback these benefits, or to pay higher taxes.\n  Does anyone here doubt that when $15 billion is pilfered over the \nnext 17 years, when the day of judgment comes and there is no money to \npay railroad retirement benefits, especially if the very optimistic \nprojections that are being made don't turn out to be correct in terms \nof the retirement fund, who is going to be paying the money that has \nbeen pilfered? The taxpayers.\n  I know there are others who want to speak. Let me just say that it is \nnot every day that you have a proposal to pilfer $15 billion from a \nretirement trust fund and have 73 Members of the Senate cosponsor it. \nIt is not every day that you get railroads and railway unions together \nin support of something. But, look, when each one is getting $7.5 \nbillion, that is a lot of incentive.\n  This is about as bad a public policy as you could possibly propose. \nHow in the world can anybody justify that at the very moment when \neverybody else's retirement age is rising to 67, we are going to lower \nthe retirement age for those working for the railroad from 62 to 60? \nHow could anybody stand up in any city or town in America and justify \nraising the retirement age to make Social Security solvent when its \ntrust fund is many times bigger per retiree and bigger in billions of \ndollars than the railroad retirement trust fund? How can anybody \njustify raising the retirement age on the great mass of workers in \nAmerica and lowering it for a privileged few? How can anybody justify, \nwhen you have a retirement program that has one worker for three \nretirees, adding benefits and cutting taxes when everybody knows that \nthe retirement program is potentially insolvent?\n  That is the problem before us. If the bill is in fact brought up, if \ncloture is obtained, then I think there have to be some changes. I do \nnot per se object to investing the money. I think there have to be \nprotections for the railroad worker to be sure the Government doesn't \ndirect the investments to benefit some interests other than the worker. \nThere needs to be some firewall between the investment committee and \nthe Government.\n  Then we need to look at the proceeds of these investments and ask \nourselves: Are they needed to pay benefits in the future? In that case, \nthey should be retained. If they are not needed, giving some of it back \nto the railroads and giving some of it back to the workers, I think, \nyou could justify. But how do you justify giving all of their money \nback until any money is earned?\n  Finally, how in the world can we justify lowering the retirement age \nfor railroad retirement workers at the\n\n[[Page S12038]]\n\nvery moment that we are raising it for everybody else?\n  This is a very bad bill, in my opinion. It is special interest at its \nworst. I know there are relatively few people who are against it. But \npeople who are against it feel very strongly about it. So we intend to \nresist.\n  I hope someone out in the country will take a look at these numbers I \nam talking about. You have to have some pause when the Railroad \nRetirement Board, which oversees the retirement fund, clearly says that \nin 17 years, if this bill is passed, there will be $15 billion less in \nthe trust fund than if the bill is not passed, and $7.5 billion has \ngone to the railroads and $7.5 billion has gone to railroad workers. \nYet the liability and the solemn commitment of the Federal Government \nto these retirees has not changed.\n  So if they have gotten $15 billion richer, and the commitment has not \nchanged, who is $15 billion poorer? The same person is always poorer \nwhen special interests get together to benefit themselves; that is, the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  That is why I am opposed to this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment our colleague from Texas on \nhis statement, and I will add a few comments.\n  I earlier told the majority leader that there would be strong \nobjection to moving forward with this bill. I am disappointed that he \ndid. After the tragedy of September 11, many of us thought it would be \nvery much in our Nation's best interests for us to be working together \nto try to pass legislation that is in our national interest. We passed \nemergency legislation. We passed antiterrorism legislation. We passed \nspending bills, a lot of which, in some cases, we thought were maybe \noverly generous. Yet we wanted to do that in a very bipartisan way.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader is now moving forward with some \nlegislation which, I think we have informed him, leaves a lot to be \ndesired and which doesn't fit into any national criteria as far as a \nnational emergency. It is purely and simply a special interest bill \ndesigned and written by special interests.\n  This bill wasn't written by the Finance Committee. It deals with \ntaxes. I am on the Finance Committee. This bill had no input by the \nFinance Committee. Not one member of the Finance Committee has had any \ninput in this bill. This is a bill written by and for special \ninterests. They did a pretty good job. They benefit themselves by at \nleast $15 billion. They benefit themselves by increasing benefits, \ncutting taxes, and keeping Uncle Sam as the guarantor of the benefit.\n  Senator Daschle said something about wanting to provide the railroad \ncompanies and employees the same opportunity as every other private \npension plan so they can invest their funds in the marketplace and \nenjoy good rates of return. I welcome that but take away the Federal \nguarantee. We can do that. I don't care if they make early retirement \nat age 50. I will be happy to let the employees and the railroads work \nout whatever benefit package they so desire as long as they are liable.\n\n  What they did in this case, as Senator Gramm eloquently pointed out, \ngreatly increases their benefits. They cut the payroll taxes to pay for \nthose benefits, and they say Uncle Sam is still liable. That is what I \ndisagree with. They increase benefits far and above what almost any \nother pension plan in America has.\n  Name another private pension plan that has a 100-percent survivor \nbenefit. Social Security doesn't do that. For Social Security, if you \nare a survivor, you get maybe a 50-percent benefit. Not in this \npackage. For Social Security, you don't get full retirement benefits at \nage 60. You get full retirement at age 65. Senator Gramm mentioned that \nit is going to 67. This bill says you get full benefits at age 60.\n  Again, maybe that is fine, if the railroad companies and employees \nwant to pay for that. But they have asked us to pay for it. We are \nliable. Some say: Wait a minute. They have a scheme in here that says \neven though their payroll taxes go down and their benefits go up, we \nthink maybe it will all work out. But if it doesn't, Uncle Sam is still \nliable. We still have a law on the books saying these benefits are \ngoing to be paid.\n  Why don't we privatize this system and allow the employees and the \nrailroad companies to come up with whatever retirement system they \nwant? God bless them. It would be a generous system. I love the \nrailroad companies. I love the railroad employees. Let them work out \nwhatever they mutually desire to get us off the hook.\n  Why should some poor company in Delaware or Oklahoma or Texas have to \nguarantee benefits that greatly exceed any benefits they provide and \nthey are liable for it as taxpayers? Then somebody said: Wait a minute. \nIsn't this $15 billion that we are transferring to them their money? \nNo, not really. They may claim it is in a trust fund. I have looked it \nup.\n  For the life of the railroad retirement system, the total amount of \nmoney paid out in benefits exceeds all the payroll tax contributions by \nemployees and companies by about $90 billion. That means Uncle Sam has \nbeen putting in and subsidizing a lot of money for the railroad \nretirement system since its inception. Basically, it is a pay-as-you-go \nsystem. It has problems because the number of active workers in \nrelation to retirees has declined. So it has a significant problem, as \nany payroll system, any pension system would have if they were stupid \nenough to go on a pay-go system.\n\n  Private plans do not go pay-go. Private systems have actuaries. They \nwant to have funds, real funds, that are really invested. You could say \nlet's go private. We can do that. The administration has offered to do \nthat. There are many of us who are willing to work with the railroads \nand the employees of the railroads to come up with a truly private \npension system but not a Government guarantee that says: Hey, let's \nincrease benefits, cut payroll taxes, make great big guarantees. \nGovernment, you guarantee it all. And then, oh, incidently, if there is \na problem a few years down the road, Uncle Sam, that is your problem \nbecause it is a benefit stipulated by law of the books. As to this \nproposal, even the railroad's own actuaries think it would be a \nproblem.\n  Looking at the payroll taxes, they reduce payroll taxes significantly \nin the immediate few years, and then they expect that by the years 2020 \nand 2021 the payroll taxes will go up about 69 percent. In other words, \nunder their own scheme, they say: Oh, we are going to have lots of \nproblems. Well, that is somebody else's problem.\n  Wait a minute. Whose problem is it? Right now it would be the Federal \ntaxpayers' problem because the Federal taxpayers would still be liable.\n  So I strongly object to this bill and will work very aggressively to \nsee that this bill does not become law. I will be happy to work with \npeople. The unanimous consent request that was offered said let's move \nthis bill with no amendments. Wait a minute. If we are going to move \nthis bill, we will have lots of amendments. Every Senator is entitled \nto offer amendments. I may want to have an amendment that says, let's \neliminate the Government guarantee. Let's make it purely private. Why \nhave tier 1 benefits that are supposedly the equivalent to Social \nSecurity--that is what everybody says in railroad retirement--but they \noffer benefits much greater than Social Security.\n  In Social Security, the normal retirement age is 65. The normal \nretirement age in the railroad system right now is 62; and they take it \nto 60. But yet we tell all of our constituents, your normal retirement \nage is 65--and now it is going to 67--but just the opposite in this \nbill. All the while we do it by cutting payroll taxes. And there are a \nlot of other benefit enhancements. A survivor benefit of 100 percent? \nThere may be some, but I have not found any private pension plans that \nwill allow survivor benefits of 100 percent. But I am all for it as \nlong as they pay for it. Great. If a private company and their \nemployees have a benefit system that says, here are your benefits for \nyour retirement system--so much on an annuity, so much per month, or \nwhatever--if you pass away, your survivor gets the same amount, fine, \nas long as they pay for it.\n  I think what is wrong is if they start asking us to pay for it, if \nthey ask us to guarantee it. If they want us to make that the law of \nthe land, where the Federal Government is ultimately\n\n[[Page S12039]]\n\nliable for it, then that is wrong. That is what is in the bill before \nus.\n  So I am just amazed. We have asked for hearings on the bill. This \nbill has never had a hearing in the Senate, and a good reason is that \npeople would be embarrassed. People would be embarrassed when you \nstarted asking interesting questions, difficult questions to the CEOs. \nThey do not want to appear before the Finance Committee. The actuaries \ndo not want to appear before the Finance Committee answering why we \nshould guarantee benefits that are far in excess of everybody else's \nprivate pension system.\n\n  Why don't we truly privatize it? Then they can invest 100 percent of \ntheir money in any investment they so desire. I would love for that to \nhappen. Let them invest. I hope they make great returns. But to give \n$15 billion--and they pretend that is their money when, in reality, for \nevery year that the railroad retirement system has been in existence, \nmore money has gone out to beneficiaries than has come in in payroll \ntaxes. That means Uncle Sam has been paying a lot, subsidized the \nsystem a lot, I believe to the tune of about $90 billion since the \n1930s.\n  So to say, oh, we want that $15 billion, that is really ours, so we \ncan go out and invest it just like everybody else does, kind of leaves \na little bit short the idea that Uncle Sam has been subsidizing this \nsystem for a long time. We still underwrite it and guarantee it. It is \nstill part of the law of the land.\n  Let's change that. Let's allow the railroad retirees and the active \nemployees and the railroads to have whatever pension system they want, \ndesire, and can afford, but let's not pass a law that says we will \nincrease your benefits, cut your taxes, and thank you very much; Uncle \nSam will guarantee the outcome now and forevermore. I think that is a \nserious mistake.\n  We have asked other countries, we have encouraged other countries, to \nmove towards a market system, to move towards the private sector, to \nmove to entrepreneurship, and yet, with the railroad companies, we \nmaintain this absurd idea that Government knows best, Government should \ncontrol it, Government should own it, and Government should dictate it.\n  I think we should get out of that. I want to turn them loose. I want \nthe employers and employees to work out whatever is mutually \nadvantageous and affordable and let them pay for it. Those are big \ncompanies. Those are big unions. Those are people with good jobs. Let's \nmake sure they have their own good pension system, and let them pay for \nit and not be asking Uncle Sam to be guaranteeing it now and \nforevermore.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm and Senator Nickles \nfor their comments and for their knowledge of the legislation. They are \non the Finance Commitee, which has jurisdiction in this area. They know \nthe details of what is in the bill. A lot of us have not had the time \nor are not on the committee of jurisdiction to study it as closely as \nthey have.\n  It is interesting to note that this legislation has been around for \nat least a year. The Finance Committee could have had hearings and \ncould have marked it up.\n  I think some of the major problems that have been pointed out by the \ntwo Senators who just spoke could have been worked out through an \namendment process in the Finance Committee.\n  But lo and behold, to the surprise of a lot of people, we are being \ntold now that the Democrats want to set aside the stimulus package and \nmove over to railroad retirement. Where is the emergency? We are at war \nand we are in a recession. We ought to be working on the Defense \nappropriations bill and an economic stimulus package. And yet we are \ngoing to delay one until--it appears, I guess, the Defense \nappropriations bill will not come up before next week. If we move over \nto this railroad retirement legislation, which many Senators support in \nconcept, it will put the stimulus package on a sidetrack, on the back \nburner.\n  I think the timing is just not right. We have been through 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths of difficult times. We have dealt with it in a bipartisan, \nnonpartisan way. It has not been easy, but we found a way to come \ntogether, and yet now, when we get to the point of discussing, How do \nwe provide an instant, positive impact on the economy, how do we pass a \nstimulative package that will have economic growth effects and job \ncreation, we cannot come together.\n  The House acted in a way in which, obviously, many in the Senate do \nnot agree. But the Finance Committee, instead of doing as we have \nalways done in the past, coming together in a bill that has bipartisan \nvotes, overwhelmingly, as we did earlier this year in the tax package, \nhad a totally partisan vote, right down partisan lines, on a package \nthat I guess is around $60 to $65 billion and is $51 billion in \nexpenditures as it is offered.\n  So the Finance Committee reported out a partisan bill and then added \n$15 billion for so-called homeland security that has not been requested \nby the President or his administration. There have not been hearings on \nit. Just voila, it was added to this package. And to make matters \nworse, now we are being told we should get off this and go to a bill \nthat is clearly not going to help us in the war effort or in \nstimulating the economy--a railroad retirement bill. Then, after that, \nwe are going to go to an agriculture bill. Supposedly, the Democratic \nleader will try to do that. And there are going to be objections to \nthat. There are all kinds of problems in that bill. It will take quite \nsome time. And then, and only then, would we go to the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill? And what happened to the stimulus package?\n  To further the effort to see if we can't come together, I have just \nbeen talking about some compromises we could work out. Everybody agrees \nwe need additional unemployment compensation. Nobody wants to block \nthat. The President has recommended and we are prepared to go with 13 \nweeks of unemployment compensation on top of the 26 weeks that is \nalready in the law. We recognize that for people who have lost their \njobs who had insurance coverage but who may have lost their insurance \ncoverage, we have to find a way for them to get that coverage. We are \nprepared to do that.\n  We are prepared to add to the national emergency grant fund $5 \nbillion for the States to use to provide health insurance coverage or \nother related assistance. If in fact we have a State where there has \nnot been a significant increase in unemployment, they could use it for \nother health-related issues. The Governors and the States would like \nthat very much.\n  One of the ways to make sure we have an immediate impact on the \neconomy--next month, not in the next 6 months or a year--is to take a \nserious look at a proposal by Senator Domenici and Senator Bond and \nothers--an approach that has even been talked about favorably by the \nranking Democrat in the House, Congressman Rangel--to have a payroll \ntax holiday. Say for the next month employees and employers would not \nhave to pay the payroll tax. Substitute that for the rebate checks and \nfor the alternative minimum tax retroactive features. It is about an \nequal amount of money. It would have an immediate impact on money that \nworkers would have in their pockets and that employers could benefit \nfrom, the 6.2 percent they have to pay. It would have an effect next \nmonth at Christmastime.\n  If we are really serious, we can come up with alternatives that will \nstimulate the economy. I challenge Senator Daschle and our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, let's look for some attractive \nalternatives. I prefer we have a 30-percent bonus for depreciation, but \nwe could compromise at 20 percent if it is there for multiple years--3 \nyears.\n  There is the art of getting this done. After 2\\1/2\\ months of finding \na way to make it happen in case after case, counterterrorism, \nassistance for cleanup and disaster assistance, with aviation security, \nwhile they may not have been perfect at all, we accomplished them and \nthe American people had a very positive reaction.\n  Now, right before Christmas, we are going to start drifting toward \nnot being able to come to a conclusion on an economic growth package. \nThis would be a mistake.\n\n[[Page S12040]]\n\n  While I clearly have a long history of being supportive of the \nrailroad industry, the workers in the railroad industry--I support \ntrying to have a viable railroad industry in this country; I have been \nsupportive of Amtrak even to the criticism of some of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle--I think if we start moving into this area in \nthe way that is being suggested, if we try to bring this bill up and \nbasically just push the stimulus off the table, that will be a mistake. \nI oppose that.\n  I would be willing to work in the Finance Committee to come up with a \nbill that would get the job done properly, but not this bill and not in \nthis way, and not at the expense of the stimulus package and completing \nour work in the appropriations area, particularly the Department of \nDefense. We are at war. We have an economic slowdown bordering at least \non a recession. That is what we should focus on. Help our troops in the \nfield and help our workers in their jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to compliment the Republican \nleader. I am speaking in terms of what I see him doing today. The \nRepublican leader has concluded that for some reason the Democratic \nleader wants to take the economic stimulus package away from the \nSenate.\n  Instead of continuing with it, if it is as important as everyone \nsays, we have a whole new piece of legislation requiring very lengthy \ndebate when, as a matter of fact, whether you are for it or against it, \nit can be done in due course. It need not be done today or the day \nafter tomorrow or next week. As a matter of fact, it could be done as \nthe first or second item of business next year, and it would make no \ndifference whatsoever.\n  Instead, what will make a difference, in addition to taking care of \nour troops--and our military in every respect will soon get an \nappropriations bill; if nothing else happens, that will happen; that \nissue is going to be taken care of, that big commitment--the second and \nequally as important commitment is to stimulate the American economy so \nthat the working men and women who are unemployed can look out there at \nAmerica and say: They are hiring people back. We were just reading the \nnew statistics and instead of 800,000 jobs lost, we have an increased \n250,000 or 300,000. We are on the way up, so that everyone who \nparticipates in this economy, from the smallest equity owner and the \nsmallest employee in the American free enterprise system to a highly \npaid high-tech employee--so that they can all receive encouragement \nfrom their Government to spend, to buy things they might need.\n  A very simple way to do it, along with the wonderful ideas that have \nbeen worked out heretofore by Senators on both sides of the aisle--I \nwill speak for the way you get money into the hands and pockets of \nAmerican working men and women and their employers. That is called the \npayroll tax holiday. Perhaps it would be fairer to call that the \nDomenici piece and say that is what my amendment was trying to do.\n  The other items our distinguished minority leader brought forward are \npart of the various stimulus packages that have been discussed. Some \nare in the centrist package wherein one of the leaders was Olympia \nSnowe coming up with some of these great ideas. They are hers. They are \ncentrist Senators. Some of them--not too many--are in the Democratic \nbill that is pending that would be replaced. But there are not very \nmany that are comparable; there are a few.\n  It is absolutely imperative that we ask honestly and forthrightly of \nthose who know the American economy what will do the most good to put \nAmerica back to work.\n  The best social program in the world remains even today a good, solid \njob. There is no social welfare program in America that comes anywhere \nclose to that. People who get good jobs, steady jobs, steady paychecks, \nfor the most part have health insurance and the like.\n  So what is the best thing for American working men and women with \nchildren and families and who want to buy a car so they can start going \nto the mountains or taking their children out camping, whatever it may \nbe? For them to have confidence in the economy and have money to spend; \nyou can't beat those two in America. If you can find confidence in the \nAmerican people and money in their pockets, you have a vibrant American \neconomy.\n  You can't have everybody employed because that does not work in our \nsystem. But we were down to 3.9 percent unemployment for a significant \nperiod of time. Everybody was very thrilled.\n  Yesterday we received an economic evaluation from a very powerful \ngroup that said this economic downturn has been of long duration. I \nmyself have spoken in the Chamber monthly or every 6 weeks or so; I \nsaid the economy started coming down 13 months ago. That is now \nverified by experts. It started then.\n  I also kept saying, don't argue about the word ``recession'' or is it \nthere yet; it is not good. And if it isn't there yet, it will be there \nin a couple months. Why don't we get on with doing something to help \nthe economy.\n  Yesterday that same very powerful economic group said we have been in \na recession since March. We don't have to argue anymore; we are in a \nrecession. Whether we stay there for a few more months or 6 months or a \nyear is very important. The sooner we can start coming out of it and \nget closer to neutral, where we are not growing and not going up or \ndown, then we will break out of that and start down the positive track \nof recovery, which means more jobs, more opportunity, more confidence, \nand more money in the pockets of our people.\n  Our distinguished Republican leader said to a group of us, we ought \nto talk about the fact that we don't need to go on to another bill; we \nought to stay hitched to the economic recovery plan, the stimulus \npackage, and get it done.\n  I will send to the desk the principal components of the proposal he \nand I and others have put forth today. It is called ``Amendment to \nHouse Stimulus Bill.'' It is there for people to read and puruse.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Amendment to House Stimulus Bill, November 26, 2001\n\n       A. Stimulus proposal for rewarding work:\n       1. Marginal Rate Cuts: Accelerate into 2002 reduction of \n     the 28% tax bracket to 25%.\n       B. Stimulus for encouraging investment:\n       1. Bonus Expensing: Enhance expensing of capital \n     expenditure with 20% bonus depreciation (3-year sunset).\n       2. AMT Repeal: Repeal corporate alternative minimum tax on \n     a prospective basis.\n       C. Relief for low and middle-income Americans:\n       1. Payroll Tax Holiday: Offer workers one-month (December) \n     holiday from Federal payroll taxes while holding federal \n     trust funds harmless.\n       D. Expand the safety net for working Americans:\n       1. Extended Unemployment Benefits. Provide additional 13 \n     weeks of unemployment benefits to worker who exhaust their \n     standard benefits after September 11.\n       2. Additional National Emergency Grants. Provide governors \n     with additional $5 billion in Emergency Block Grants for \n     health insurance coverage and other related assistance.\n       Total first year stimulus and assistance: $100 Billion.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this would be a $100 billion stimulus in \nthe first year, and if we include the holiday for 1 month, when the \nAmerican people will begin to see hope, when the paychecks go up, even \nif it is only for 1 month, and when their employers get to keep 6.2 \npercent in their treasury to use for other things, what could be \nbetter?\n  I urge our Democratic friends to take a look at it. This Senator has \ntalked to many Democrats prior to today about this proposal, maybe as \nmany as 15. As a general matter, most of them thought it was an \nexciting idea. I will not go beyond that because far be it appropriate \nfor me to characterize it beyond saying they certainly gave me \nencouragement.\n  I do not believe people are free today to go to meetings and speak \ntheir piece because they are all tied up in entanglements of \ncommitments. They have commitments to the old package, to the new \npackage, to the centrist package, to the Democratic package that came \nout of committee. Unless you can get on board the group that supports \none of those, you cannot get a package for America.\n  The lines established for those various groupings in the Senate \nshould\n\n[[Page S12041]]\n\ndisappear, and those who lead them should go to a meeting, be it with \nthe Democratic leader or both leaders, and say: Let's ask the Finance \nCommittee to put forth a bipartisan effort for the next few days. Here \nare all the issues. They are all boiled down to five or six issues. The \nrest is detail.\n  I believe if they went there with the right spirit--that we really \nneed to do this, that it is far more important than anything else other \nthan to make sure we appropriate the money needed for our military \naround the world and at home--we will not let the American people down.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of \nthis legislation, a bill to substantially revise and modernize the \nrailroad retirement system, a system that was established in the dark \ndays of the Great Depression. I also commend our leadership for \nbringing this important matter before the Senate in the closing days of \nthis session. The fact that this body is willing to take the time to \nconsider this measure during these critical days highlights the \nimportance of this issue to both rail labor and management. Swift \npassage of the bill is essential to the continued vitality of our rail \nindustry, and I urge the Senate to act on it without delay.\n  Two of the giants of our Nation's rail industry have roots in my \nState of Nebraska. The headquarters of the Union Pacific Railroad is \nlocated in Omaha. And the Burlington Northern maintains a major \npresence in the State, with over 8,500 employees in Nebraska alone. One \nstretch of Burlington's line located in Nebraska is the busiest rail \nsegment in the world; coal unit trains traverse Nebraska constantly, \nproviding energy to meet the Nation's needs.\n  In this case, management and labor of the Union Pacific Railroad and \nthe Burlington Northern have worked cooperatively over a period of \nseveral years to develop this legislation and to build wide support for \nit here in Congress. The House has acted on it overwhelmingly, in three \nseparate votes, and it is now time for the Senate to move it forward. \nIt enjoys strong bipartisan support in both Chambers, and we simply \ncannot afford to delay the bill when we all know it will pass easily, \nespecially when we have so much other important work to do, and so \nlittle time in which to do it. It is time for the Senate to act.\n  This bill introduces tried and true investment techniques into the \nrailroad retirement system. It represents a way to make better use of \nthe resources built up by the contributions of rail employees and \nemployers to the system. Approximately $17 billion in retirement funds \nwill, for the first time, be invested as normal, modern pension plans \nare, diversified among different types of investments, instead of \nlocked into safe but low-yield Federal bonds. This simple change will \npermit the opportunity for better benefits and lower contributions for \nour rail workers, and give the industry the opportunity to take more \nresponsibility for its own pension system.\n  For the first time, the law will now automatically regulate the \namount of contributions going into the system in response to the \nactuary's estimate of the amount of reserves in the system. Under \npresent law, if reserves falter, the Congress must step in and create \nnew legislation to either reduce benefits or raise taxes, or both--a \ncumbersome mechanism to accomplish an unpopular task. This bill \nprovides a much more streamlined means of dealing with such a \ncontingency, without Government involvement. Industry and labor both \nsupport this automatic provision, because they know that the investment \nmarkets, in the long run, will be more productive for the system than a \nsteady diet of only Federal bonds.\n  One of the most compelling arguments for this legislation is that it \nwill improve the lot of widows and widowers of retired railroad \nemployees. Under current law, they watch their monthly compensation \ndecline by two-thirds once their spouse passes away. This is not only \nantiquated, it is an unbearable burden on some of our elderly. It is a \nthrowback to a time when the system was in difficult straits and could \nnot afford more. Today the system can afford to do better than this, if \nrailroad retirement reform is enacted. The bill will provide the \nsurviving spouse 100 percent of what the deceased former rail employee \nwas entitled to in his or her own right. There are 50,000 retirees \naffected in one way or another by this one provision.\n  There is one other important element of the bill. The industry will \nnow be permitted to reduce the very heavy payroll tax burden it now \ncarries to provide benefits under the system through a 3-percentage-\npoint drop in contributions, phased in over three years. This aspect of \nthe bill will remove a real disincentive to hire new employees or to \nreplace those who retire. It will free up capital for other worthwhile \nexpenditures. And as we continue to strive to reach agreement on an \neconomic stimulus package, we all can recognize that this benefit is \nespecially important during this time of economic downturn.\n  I do not intend to go into all the improvements and the modernization \nthat has been written into this bill at this time. There will be \nadequate time for a full explanation of the bill as debate progresses. \nBut I want to once again stress the need for the Senate to move this \nmeasure forward. The Nation's railroad retirees and their families need \nus to act. The Nation's rail industry can help our economic recovery if \nwe act. And the Nation's citizens expect us to act.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to make these important points today, \nand I urge the Senate to act as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I had the privilege of presiding over the \nSenate during the last hour and listening to debate on two measures, \nincluding the measure the Senator from Nebraska has raised, the change \nin the railroad retirement system. We had considerable discussion on \nthe economic stimulus package which has been debated in the Senate and \npassed in the House. I will take a few minutes and share a word about \neach of these.\n  The Senator from Nebraska was a Governor and a former insurance \ncommissioner of his State. In my previous life, I served as Governor of \nmy State and also State treasurer. During that period of time we \nestablished the first cash management system for the State of Delaware. \nWe had good, sound, progressive policymaking with respect to pension \ninvestments. We took a pension system that was not funded, a pay-as-\nyou-go system, fully amortized it and strengthened the State's \nfinancial condition considerably. Basically, the State had money in \naccounts that did not earn much at all, the equivalent in some cases of \nTreasury rates, and we ended up developing a policy that enabled us to \ninvest those moneys at market rates in things other than U.S. Treasurys \nor CDs of the bank.\n  Part of what is proposed in this railroad retirement plan is: Take \nthe money that has been set aside, paid into by the railroads \nthemselves and by the railroad employees; that can only be invested in \nU.S. Treasury obligations. Let's give them the opportunity--not \nimprudently, but under the kinds of safeguards we have in Delaware, \nNebraska, and South Dakota, as well, for State pension moneys--to \ninvest those moneys on behalf of railroad employees, pensioners, and \ntheir survivors, in something other than U.S. Treasury obligations.\n  If you look at the performance of mutual funds, the stock market, the \ncorporate bond market, over time they will outperform Treasurys. Under \nthat plan, given a prudent investment policy, we will be able to see a \nhigher rate of return from those investments than currently realized in \nthe investments under the current railroad retirement plan.\n  We could have a good debate, and we ought to, about some other \naspects of\n\n[[Page S12042]]\n\nthis bill--which I cosponsored and I very much want to see come to the \nfloor for debate and discussion. Some of our colleagues have raised \nconcerns about reducing the retirement age for those under the railroad \nretirement plan from 62 to 60.\n  We could have a legitimate discussion over whether that reduction \nshould be a graduated reduction to see if the money in the pension fund \nholds up. We could have a good discussion and debate about that. We \nought to. We could have a good discussion about the issue of whether or \nnot we ought to reduce all at once the payroll tax paid by the \nemployers by the railroads. Maybe that is a reduction that should be \nphased in over a longer period of time. Again, this is a perfect issue \nto debate and seek middle ground. We should have a debate over whether \nor not the survivor benefits should go immediately to 100 percent of \nthe benefit of the deceased railroad retiree or whether that, again, \nshould be phased up over time.\n  Railroad retirement is not Social Security. It is not the same as \nSocial Security. I don't believe it was ever intended to be. Railroad \nretirement predates Social Security and has been around longer than \nSocial Security. There are two aspects of railroad retirement, one \ncalled tier 1, which is comparable to Social Security.\n  But another aspect is called tier 2, which provides, if you will, \nmore of a private sector dimension. What we have in railroad retirement \nis a hybrid of Social Security and a private pension plan.\n  People say we cannot make some of the changes that are envisioned \nhere with the railroad pension plan because they are not consistent \nwith what we are doing in Social Security. A lot of private retirement \nplans let people retire at age 60. A lot of private retirement plans \nallow employees to retire with benefits after 30 years of service. A \nlot of them provide that benefit at age 60 with 30 years of service, \nand that is what is being proposed here.\n  We can, I guess, debate for some time whether or not this is the \nright time to bring this issue up. It is not a partisan issue. It has \nbeen suggested it is partisan and divisive. It is not a partisan issue. \nI believe 380 Members of the House voted for this bill earlier this \nyear. There are 74 cosponsors to the measure in the Senate. The \ncosponsors come from both sides of the aisle. This is not a partisan \nissue. This is a bipartisan issue which seems to enjoy pretty good \nsupport in both Houses of the Congress, and also has the \nattractiveness, at least to me, that both rail labor and the railroads \nthemselves support this bill.\n  Enough on this measure. We are going to have a vote on cloture. We \nwill have an opportunity to vote whether or not to move to the bill. I \nhope we do, and I hope when we do we will have an opportunity to \nactually discuss and debate some of the issues that our Republican \nfriends have raised earlier this afternoon. I think we can find some \nmiddle ground that augurs well for those who are working in the \nrailroad industry, those who are retired from the railroad industry and \nfor their survivors, and one that is not unfair to the taxpayers of \nthis country.\n  Let me mention one other thing before I yield my time and that is on \nthe economic stimulus package. This is a debate and an issue which \ncries out for a reasonable compromise. Several of the elements of a \nreasonable compromise have been suggested today. I want to go back to \nthem, if I may.\n  Senator Domenici, along with Senator Corzine and others, has come \nforward with I think a perfectly reasonable proposal on a payroll tax \nholiday whereby for 1 month neither employers nor employees would pay \nthe Social Security payroll tax. The employees would keep that money in \ntheir paychecks. It would help people who are poor and also people who \nare not poor, but it would disproportionately help people at the lower \nend of the income spectrum. In addition, the employers would not pay \ntheir share of the payroll tax. It would help those businesses that are \nsmall and those that are not so small. I think disproportionately it \nmight help those that are small more than those that are large. That \nidea, the idea of a payroll tax holiday for 1 month, if it were offered \nin lieu of the proposal to provide additional payroll tax rebate \nchecks, in lieu of an expedited reduction in the 27 percent rate, and \nin lieu of an expedited expansion of the 10-percent bracket--that idea \ncould be a very good compromise to bring Republicans and Democrats \ntogether.\n  The payroll tax holiday has the added virtue, frankly, of helping \nStates. Like other employers, States pay payroll taxes for their State \nemployees. If they had a 1-month holiday, it would help most States. My \nState is not hurting as badly as others. The unemployment rate is well \nbelow average, but we are hurting too, and my guess is so is South \nDakota and others. A payroll tax holiday would also provide money in \nthe pockets of people who are very likely to spend it, and we need some \nof that stimulus.\n\n  Another of the elements I want to mention today to provide a bridge \nbetween Democrats and Republicans on economic stimulus deals with what \nis called bonus depreciation, accelerated depreciation for capital \ninvestments that are made over the next 1, 2, or 3 years. Several \nprinciples were outlined for us in an agreement adopted earlier this \nfall by Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate \nBudget Committee. Among those principles that were agreed to are these: \nthe economic stimulus package should have an immediate impact; it \nshould not have a long-term adverse consequence for a balanced budget; \nand it should be temporary in nature. The leaders of the budget \ncommittees agreed that all measures in the stimulus package should \nsunset in one year, to the extent practicable. If we take those three \ncriteria and look at this notion of accelerated depreciation in order \nto stimulate capital investment, I think a compromise lies between what \nthe House has agreed to and what the Senate is contemplating.\n  If you look at the history of the last 12 months or so in this \ncountry as our economy has wound down, one of the things that has \nhappened is we have seen a drying up of capital investment. There is a \nproposal offered by our Republican friends that says let's provide a \n30-percent writeoff, 30-percent bonus depreciation for investments made \nover a 3-year period for companies that make those kinds of \ninvestments.\n  Senator Baucus, in his proposal, said we should provide a 10-percent \ndepreciation bonus over a 12-month period of time. There is plenty of \nroom to compromise between 10 percent and 30 percent, and I suggest 20 \npercent might be that compromise for accelerated depreciation, bonus \ndepreciation if you would. As for the time period, we should stay true \nto the 1-year figure, as Senator Baucus has proposed and as the budget \ncommittee leadership suggested.\n  The third measure I have to offer as a compromise between Democrats \nand Republicans deals with a proposal I heard from Senator Collins of \nMaine and Senator Lieberman of Connecticut that we adopted in the \nCongress before I got here, in 1993. It is a proposal to encourage \ninvestment in small cap companies, those whose capitalization is $50 \nmillion or less. Those who hold investments in these companies--\nsecurities issued by those companies, issued for 5 years--the 1993 law \npromised a reduction by one-half in the capital gains tax. As it turns \nout, because of the alternative minimum tax that is in place, the \npractical effect of the incentive offered by the 1993 law is for the \nmost part moot. There is just not much of an incentive anymore, \nespecially when the capital gains rate is taken down to 20 percent.\n  I offer this. Look at a proposal offered by Senator Collins, \ncosponsored by Senator Lieberman, to make the 1993 law work. That \nproposal says let's make the 1993 law work by taking away the effect of \nthe alternative minimum tax for those who make investments in \naccordance with the 1993 law.\n  Those are three potential compromises which I think might bring us a \nlittle closer together as we try to work out some compromises. I hope \nwe can get to work on this Railroad Retirement Act and hammer something \nout on that as well.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nDelaware. I agree it is something on which we need to move forward.\n\n[[Page S12043]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12036-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12036-S12043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMPREHENSIVE RETIREMENT SECURITY AND PENSION REFORM ACT OF 2001--\n                           MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

There is very, very strong bipartisan support in the Senate; 74 \nof our colleagues have cosponsored the bill, including a majority in \nboth the Democratic and Republican caucuses. All the rail unions are \nunited behind this bill, and it is supported by the entire railroad \nindustry. It represents the first time in 25 years that labor, \nmanagement and retirees have agreed on a set of changes to the system.\n  The reason is pretty simple. Most Members recognize we want to give \nrailroad retirees the same opportunity as other retirees in the private \nsector, the opportunity to maximize their investment opportunities for \nretirement purposes. This bill would simply give them as many different \noptions as we already provide to others in the private sector.\n  As a result of increased returns from these investments, it would \nprovide enhanced benefits for railroad retirees and reduce retirement \ntaxes for railroad companies. Among other things, it would expand \nbenefits for surviving spouses, provide a retiree health insurance plan \nand reduce the vesting requirement to five years. These are important \nchanges that should be made.\n  Enactment of this bill is long overdue. It is a good bill. It \ndeserves our support. I am disappointed we are not able to move to it \nthis afternoon. I will schedule a cloture vote on Thursday. We will do \nall we can to ensure that the legislation is considered and passed. It \ndeserves our support, as it was given support in the House. We will do \nall we can to see that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in the 24 years I have served in Congress, \nI have seen many ideas debated; some of them good, some of them bad. I \nguess we are all prone, on the spur of the moment, to overstate things, \nbut I think I can say without any fear of contradiction that of all the \nbills I have ever seen on which cloture has been filed, this comes \nclosest to simply being an overt effort by two established and powerful \nspecial interests to literally pilfer the retirement fund that is \navailable for railroad retirees, and the backing for that retirement \nfund.\n  Part of our problem in debating a bill such as this is that there is \na natural tendency in a partisan body when, in this case railroads and \nrailroad unions get together, everybody sees this as an opportunity to \njump on the bandwagon. I don't know that I would state it as any first \nlaw of political behavior, but normally when business and labor get \ntogether on something, it is generally an effort to reach deeply into \nthe pockets of the American taxpayer. That is what the provision before \nus is, in reality.\n\n[[Page S12037]]\n\n  We have a retirement trust fund which has built up for railroad \nretirement, principally as a result of the action we took when railroad \nretirement was going broke and when Social Security was going broke. My \ncolleagues will remember that we passed a bill changing the retirement \nage, setting up a procedure where the retirement age would rise--in the \ncase of railroad retirement from 60 to 62; in the case of everybody \nelse's retirement, from 65 to 67. We made other changes. In the \nprocess, back in the mid-1980s, we were able to bring some degree of \ntemporary solvency to both these programs.\n  The net result in railroad retirement is that we have built up a \ntrust fund for railroad retirement of $19.2 billion. I remind my \ncolleagues and everybody in the country who is listening to this debate \nthat we talk about Social Security being in deep trouble now because we \nstarted out with 42 workers per retiree, and we are down to 3 workers \nper retiree. And we are heading over the next 30 years to 2 workers per \nretiree.\n  Obviously, when you have two workers supporting one retiree, you are \ntalking about a very heavy burden.\n  In railroad retirement, we have one worker supporting three retirees. \nEvery problem we have in Social Security, multiply it by 9, and you \nhave some index of the problem in railroad retirement. Also, you have \nthe implicit taxpayer guarantee behind that program.\n  What has literally happened? What gave rise to the bill that is now \nbefore us in the form of a cloture motion is that railroads, facing \nsome financial difficulty, got together with the railway unions and \nbasically said: We have built up a base of financial assets--in this \ncase Treasury bonds--of $19.2 billion. So what we should do is take $15 \nbillion of that money out of the retirement program and roughly give \nhalf of it to the railroads and give half of it to the retirees. And, \nin the process, commit the taxpayer to deal with the problem if \ninsolvency is faced in the future.\n  What we have before us is literally an effort by two powerful vested \ninterests to take $15 billion of the $19.2 billion in the railroad \nretirement trust fund and literally divide it up, with roughly half of \nit going to the railroads and roughly half going to the employees of \nthe railroads and the retirees. In fact, the Railroad Retirement Board, \nin their data, in analyzing this proposal, has basically concluded \nthat the net result of this will be that $15 billion will be taken out \nof the retirement trust fund over the next 17 years. So what the \nproposal before us does is pilfer $15 billion.\n\n  Obviously, people have some shame; not much, but they have a little. \nSo rather than saying we are simply going to steal this $15 billion and \nwe are going to get 74 Members of the Senate to applaud when we steal \nit, they came up with a clever ruse. The clever ruse is to say: Look, \nlet's take this $15 billion and invest it. Instead of having it in \nGovernment bonds, we will invest it in stocks and bonds. So as a result \nof this new investment and the new rate of return that we will get, we \nwill be able to do some things to help the railroads and to help the \nemployees.\n  The problem is, before any investment is ever made, they are lowering \nthe retirement age. They are cutting taxes on the employers. They are \nexpanding benefits for employees, and when you add it all up, even with \na higher rate of return that they hope to gain over the next 25 years, \nthe trust fund will be $28.7 billion lower under this new proposal than \nit would be under current law. The $15 billion in question would be \ncompletely pilfered over the next 17 years. These are not my numbers. \nThese are the numbers of the Railroad Retirement Board.\n  What does the bill do? First of all, it immediately cuts taxes on \nrailroads that they are paying in to support these retirement programs. \nIt cuts their tax rate from 16.1 percent to 14.75 percent, and it does \nthat next year. Then it cuts it again in calendar year 2003, to 14.2 \npercent. So the net result is that in very short order, $4 billion from \nthe retirement trust fund is transferred from the trust fund to the \nrailroads.\n  I remind my colleagues that beginning this year, based on the Social \nSecurity solvency bill we passed in the early 1980s, the retirement age \nfor American workers is starting to go up. We are moving from 65 to 67, \nthe age that you have to be to draw full Social Security benefits. We \nare in the process of the largest increase in the retirement age in \nAmerican history beginning this year. But what do you think the bill \nbefore us does for people who work for railroads?\n  At the very instant that we are raising the retirement age for \neverybody else from 65 to 67, remarkably, almost unbelievably, we lower \nthe retirement age for people who work for railroads from 62 to 60.\n  Survivors of railway workers already get substantially better \nbenefits than survivors from Social Security, but we raise those \nbenefits. We change the vesting requirements. The net result is that \nover 17 years, roughly $7.5 billion is taken out of the railroad \nretirement trust fund and is given to the railroads. Roughly $7.5 \nbillion is taken out of railroad retirement and given to beneficiaries \nby lowering the retirement age, by raising survivor benefits, by \nchanging the vesting requirements--in essence, increasing benefits. $15 \nbillion is pilfered over a 17-year period under this bill.\n\n  You might say, well, this is sort of a victimless crime because the \nrailroads are for it, and the railroad retirees are for it. It is their \n$19.2 billion. They are pilfering $15 billion, and it was their money \nto begin with. So where is the victim? In fact, 73 Members of the \nSenate signed on to the bill. It is obvious that has been the question. \nWhere is the victim?\n  The victim, as is usually the case when powerful vested interests get \ntogether, is the taxpayer. The taxpayer stands in line to cover \nshortfalls in the future.\n  It is true that in the future, up to a point, you can raise the tax \non the railroads. There is no provision for requiring employees to give \nback these benefits, or to pay higher taxes.\n  Does anyone here doubt that when $15 billion is pilfered over the \nnext 17 years, when the day of judgment comes and there is no money to \npay railroad retirement benefits, especially if the very optimistic \nprojections that are being made don't turn out to be correct in terms \nof the retirement fund, who is going to be paying the money that has \nbeen pilfered? The taxpayers.\n  I know there are others who want to speak. Let me just say that it is \nnot every day that you have a proposal to pilfer $15 billion from a \nretirement trust fund and have 73 Members of the Senate cosponsor it. \nIt is not every day that you get railroads and railway unions together \nin support of something. But, look, when each one is getting $7.5 \nbillion, that is a lot of incentive.\n  This is about as bad a public policy as you could possibly propose. \nHow in the world can anybody justify that at the very moment when \neverybody else's retirement age is rising to 67, we are going to lower \nthe retirement age for those working for the railroad from 62 to 60? \nHow could anybody stand up in any city or town in America and justify \nraising the retirement age to make Social Security solvent when its \ntrust fund is many times bigger per retiree and bigger in billions of \ndollars than the railroad retirement trust fund? How can anybody \njustify raising the retirement age on the great mass of workers in \nAmerica and lowering it for a privileged few? How can anybody justify, \nwhen you have a retirement program that has one worker for three \nretirees, adding benefits and cutting taxes when everybody knows that \nthe retirement program is potentially insolvent?\n  That is the problem before us. If the bill is in fact brought up, if \ncloture is obtained, then I think there have to be some changes. I do \nnot per se object to investing the money. I think there have to be \nprotections for the railroad worker to be sure the Government doesn't \ndirect the investments to benefit some interests other than the worker. \nThere needs to be some firewall between the investment committee and \nthe Government.\n  Then we need to look at the proceeds of these investments and ask \nourselves: Are they needed to pay benefits in the future? In that case, \nthey should be retained. If they are not needed, giving some of it back \nto the railroads and giving some of it back to the workers, I think, \nyou could justify. But how do you justify giving all of their money \nback until any money is earned?\n  Finally, how in the world can we justify lowering the retirement age \nfor railroad retirement workers at the\n\n[[Page S12038]]\n\nvery moment that we are raising it for everybody else?\n  This is a very bad bill, in my opinion. It is special interest at its \nworst. I know there are relatively few people who are against it. But \npeople who are against it feel very strongly about it. So we intend to \nresist.\n  I hope someone out in the country will take a look at these numbers I \nam talking about. You have to have some pause when the Railroad \nRetirement Board, which oversees the retirement fund, clearly says that \nin 17 years, if this bill is passed, there will be $15 billion less in \nthe trust fund than if the bill is not passed, and $7.5 billion has \ngone to the railroads and $7.5 billion has gone to railroad workers. \nYet the liability and the solemn commitment of the Federal Government \nto these retirees has not changed.\n  So if they have gotten $15 billion richer, and the commitment has not \nchanged, who is $15 billion poorer? The same person is always poorer \nwhen special interests get together to benefit themselves; that is, the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  That is why I am opposed to this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment our colleague from Texas on \nhis statement, and I will add a few comments.\n  I earlier told the majority leader that there would be strong \nobjection to moving forward with this bill. I am disappointed that he \ndid. After the tragedy of September 11, many of us thought it would be \nvery much in our Nation's best interests for us to be working together \nto try to pass legislation that is in our national interest. We passed \nemergency legislation. We passed antiterrorism legislation. We passed \nspending bills, a lot of which, in some cases, we thought were maybe \noverly generous. Yet we wanted to do that in a very bipartisan way.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader is now moving forward with some \nlegislation which, I think we have informed him, leaves a lot to be \ndesired and which doesn't fit into any national criteria as far as a \nnational emergency. It is purely and simply a special interest bill \ndesigned and written by special interests.\n  This bill wasn't written by the Finance Committee. It deals with \ntaxes. I am on the Finance Committee. This bill had no input by the \nFinance Committee. Not one member of the Finance Committee has had any \ninput in this bill. This is a bill written by and for special \ninterests. They did a pretty good job. They benefit themselves by at \nleast $15 billion. They benefit themselves by increasing benefits, \ncutting taxes, and keeping Uncle Sam as the guarantor of the benefit.\n  Senator Daschle said something about wanting to provide the railroad \ncompanies and employees the same opportunity as every other private \npension plan so they can invest their funds in the marketplace and \nenjoy good rates of return. I welcome that but take away the Federal \nguarantee. We can do that. I don't care if they make early retirement \nat age 50. I will be happy to let the employees and the railroads work \nout whatever benefit package they so desire as long as they are liable.\n\n  What they did in this case, as Senator Gramm eloquently pointed out, \ngreatly increases their benefits. They cut the payroll taxes to pay for \nthose benefits, and they say Uncle Sam is still liable. That is what I \ndisagree with. They increase benefits far and above what almost any \nother pension plan in America has.\n  Name another private pension plan that has a 100-percent survivor \nbenefit. Social Security doesn't do that. For Social Security, if you \nare a survivor, you get maybe a 50-percent benefit. Not in this \npackage. For Social Security, you don't get full retirement benefits at \nage 60. You get full retirement at age 65. Senator Gramm mentioned that \nit is going to 67. This bill says you get full benefits at age 60.\n  Again, maybe that is fine, if the railroad companies and employees \nwant to pay for that. But they have asked us to pay for it. We are \nliable. Some say: Wait a minute. They have a scheme in here that says \neven though their payroll taxes go down and their benefits go up, we \nthink maybe it will all work out. But if it doesn't, Uncle Sam is still \nliable. We still have a law on the books saying these benefits are \ngoing to be paid.\n  Why don't we privatize this system and allow the employees and the \nrailroad companies to come up with whatever retirement system they \nwant? God bless them. It would be a generous system. I love the \nrailroad companies. I love the railroad employees. Let them work out \nwhatever they mutually desire to get us off the hook.\n  Why should some poor company in Delaware or Oklahoma or Texas have to \nguarantee benefits that greatly exceed any benefits they provide and \nthey are liable for it as taxpayers? Then somebody said: Wait a minute. \nIsn't this $15 billion that we are transferring to them their money? \nNo, not really. They may claim it is in a trust fund. I have looked it \nup.\n  For the life of the railroad retirement system, the total amount of \nmoney paid out in benefits exceeds all the payroll tax contributions by \nemployees and companies by about $90 billion. That means Uncle Sam has \nbeen putting in and subsidizing a lot of money for the railroad \nretirement system since its inception. Basically, it is a pay-as-you-go \nsystem. It has problems because the number of active workers in \nrelation to retirees has declined. So it has a significant problem, as \nany payroll system, any pension system would have if they were stupid \nenough to go on a pay-go system.\n\n  Private plans do not go pay-go. Private systems have actuaries. They \nwant to have funds, real funds, that are really invested. You could say \nlet's go private. We can do that. The administration has offered to do \nthat. There are many of us who are willing to work with the railroads \nand the employees of the railroads to come up with a truly private \npension system but not a Government guarantee that says: Hey, let's \nincrease benefits, cut payroll taxes, make great big guarantees. \nGovernment, you guarantee it all. And then, oh, incidently, if there is \na problem a few years down the road, Uncle Sam, that is your problem \nbecause it is a benefit stipulated by law of the books. As to this \nproposal, even the railroad's own actuaries think it would be a \nproblem.\n  Looking at the payroll taxes, they reduce payroll taxes significantly \nin the immediate few years, and then they expect that by the years 2020 \nand 2021 the payroll taxes will go up about 69 percent. In other words, \nunder their own scheme, they say: Oh, we are going to have lots of \nproblems. Well, that is somebody else's problem.\n  Wait a minute. Whose problem is it? Right now it would be the Federal \ntaxpayers' problem because the Federal taxpayers would still be liable.\n  So I strongly object to this bill and will work very aggressively to \nsee that this bill does not become law. I will be happy to work with \npeople. The unanimous consent request that was offered said let's move \nthis bill with no amendments. Wait a minute. If we are going to move \nthis bill, we will have lots of amendments. Every Senator is entitled \nto offer amendments. I may want to have an amendment that says, let's \neliminate the Government guarantee. Let's make it purely private. Why \nhave tier 1 benefits that are supposedly the equivalent to Social \nSecurity--that is what everybody says in railroad retirement--but they \noffer benefits much greater than Social Security.\n  In Social Security, the normal retirement age is 65. The normal \nretirement age in the railroad system right now is 62; and they take it \nto 60. But yet we tell all of our constituents, your normal retirement \nage is 65--and now it is going to 67--but just the opposite in this \nbill. All the while we do it by cutting payroll taxes. And there are a \nlot of other benefit enhancements. A survivor benefit of 100 percent? \nThere may be some, but I have not found any private pension plans that \nwill allow survivor benefits of 100 percent. But I am all for it as \nlong as they pay for it. Great. If a private company and their \nemployees have a benefit system that says, here are your benefits for \nyour retirement system--so much on an annuity, so much per month, or \nwhatever--if you pass away, your survivor gets the same amount, fine, \nas long as they pay for it.\n  I think what is wrong is if they start asking us to pay for it, if \nthey ask us to guarantee it. If they want us to make that the law of \nthe land, where the Federal Government is ultimately\n\n[[Page S12039]]\n\nliable for it, then that is wrong. That is what is in the bill before \nus.\n  So I am just amazed. We have asked for hearings on the bill. This \nbill has never had a hearing in the Senate, and a good reason is that \npeople would be embarrassed. People would be embarrassed when you \nstarted asking interesting questions, difficult questions to the CEOs. \nThey do not want to appear before the Finance Committee. The actuaries \ndo not want to appear before the Finance Committee answering why we \nshould guarantee benefits that are far in excess of everybody else's \nprivate pension system.\n\n  Why don't we truly privatize it? Then they can invest 100 percent of \ntheir money in any investment they so desire. I would love for that to \nhappen. Let them invest. I hope they make great returns. But to give \n$15 billion--and they pretend that is their money when, in reality, for \nevery year that the railroad retirement system has been in existence, \nmore money has gone out to beneficiaries than has come in in payroll \ntaxes. That means Uncle Sam has been paying a lot, subsidized the \nsystem a lot, I believe to the tune of about $90 billion since the \n1930s.\n  So to say, oh, we want that $15 billion, that is really ours, so we \ncan go out and invest it just like everybody else does, kind of leaves \na little bit short the idea that Uncle Sam has been subsidizing this \nsystem for a long time. We still underwrite it and guarantee it. It is \nstill part of the law of the land.\n  Let's change that. Let's allow the railroad retirees and the active \nemployees and the railroads to have whatever pension system they want, \ndesire, and can afford, but let's not pass a law that says we will \nincrease your benefits, cut your taxes, and thank you very much; Uncle \nSam will guarantee the outcome now and forevermore. I think that is a \nserious mistake.\n  We have asked other countries, we have encouraged other countries, to \nmove towards a market system, to move towards the private sector, to \nmove to entrepreneurship, and yet, with the railroad companies, we \nmaintain this absurd idea that Government knows best, Government should \ncontrol it, Government should own it, and Government should dictate it.\n  I think we should get out of that. I want to turn them loose. I want \nthe employers and employees to work out whatever is mutually \nadvantageous and affordable and let them pay for it. Those are big \ncompanies. Those are big unions. Those are people with good jobs. Let's \nmake sure they have their own good pension system, and let them pay for \nit and not be asking Uncle Sam to be guaranteeing it now and \nforevermore.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm and Senator Nickles \nfor their comments and for their knowledge of the legislation. They are \non the Finance Commitee, which has jurisdiction in this area. They know \nthe details of what is in the bill. A lot of us have not had the time \nor are not on the committee of jurisdiction to study it as closely as \nthey have.\n  It is interesting to note that this legislation has been around for \nat least a year. The Finance Committee could have had hearings and \ncould have marked it up.\n  I think some of the major problems that have been pointed out by the \ntwo Senators who just spoke could have been worked out through an \namendment process in the Finance Committee.\n  But lo and behold, to the surprise of a lot of people, we are being \ntold now that the Democrats want to set aside the stimulus package and \nmove over to railroad retirement. Where is the emergency? We are at war \nand we are in a recession. We ought to be working on the Defense \nappropriations bill and an economic stimulus package. And yet we are \ngoing to delay one until--it appears, I guess, the Defense \nappropriations bill will not come up before next week. If we move over \nto this railroad retirement legislation, which many Senators support in \nconcept, it will put the stimulus package on a sidetrack, on the back \nburner.\n  I think the timing is just not right. We have been through 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths of difficult times. We have dealt with it in a bipartisan, \nnonpartisan way. It has not been easy, but we found a way to come \ntogether, and yet now, when we get to the point of discussing, How do \nwe provide an instant, positive impact on the economy, how do we pass a \nstimulative package that will have economic growth effects and job \ncreation, we cannot come together.\n  The House acted in a way in which, obviously, many in the Senate do \nnot agree. But the Finance Committee, instead of doing as we have \nalways done in the past, coming together in a bill that has bipartisan \nvotes, overwhelmingly, as we did earlier this year in the tax package, \nhad a totally partisan vote, right down partisan lines, on a package \nthat I guess is around $60 to $65 billion and is $51 billion in \nexpenditures as it is offered.\n  So the Finance Committee reported out a partisan bill and then added \n$15 billion for so-called homeland security that has not been requested \nby the President or his administration. There have not been hearings on \nit. Just voila, it was added to this package. And to make matters \nworse, now we are being told we should get off this and go to a bill \nthat is clearly not going to help us in the war effort or in \nstimulating the economy--a railroad retirement bill. Then, after that, \nwe are going to go to an agriculture bill. Supposedly, the Democratic \nleader will try to do that. And there are going to be objections to \nthat. There are all kinds of problems in that bill. It will take quite \nsome time. And then, and only then, would we go to the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill? And what happened to the stimulus package?\n  To further the effort to see if we can't come together, I have just \nbeen talking about some compromises we could work out. Everybody agrees \nwe need additional unemployment compensation. Nobody wants to block \nthat. The President has recommended and we are prepared to go with 13 \nweeks of unemployment compensation on top of the 26 weeks that is \nalready in the law. We recognize that for people who have lost their \njobs who had insurance coverage but who may have lost their insurance \ncoverage, we have to find a way for them to get that coverage. We are \nprepared to do that.\n  We are prepared to add to the national emergency grant fund $5 \nbillion for the States to use to provide health insurance coverage or \nother related assistance. If in fact we have a State where there has \nnot been a significant increase in unemployment, they could use it for \nother health-related issues. The Governors and the States would like \nthat very much.\n  One of the ways to make sure we have an immediate impact on the \neconomy--next month, not in the next 6 months or a year--is to take a \nserious look at a proposal by Senator Domenici and Senator Bond and \nothers--an approach that has even been talked about favorably by the \nranking Democrat in the House, Congressman Rangel--to have a payroll \ntax holiday. Say for the next month employees and employers would not \nhave to pay the payroll tax. Substitute that for the rebate checks and \nfor the alternative minimum tax retroactive features. It is about an \nequal amount of money. It would have an immediate impact on money that \nworkers would have in their pockets and that employers could benefit \nfrom, the 6.2 percent they have to pay. It would have an effect next \nmonth at Christmastime.\n  If we are really serious, we can come up with alternatives that will \nstimulate the economy. I challenge Senator Daschle and our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, let's look for some attractive \nalternatives. I prefer we have a 30-percent bonus for depreciation, but \nwe could compromise at 20 percent if it is there for multiple years--3 \nyears.\n  There is the art of getting this done. After 2\\1/2\\ months of finding \na way to make it happen in case after case, counterterrorism, \nassistance for cleanup and disaster assistance, with aviation security, \nwhile they may not have been perfect at all, we accomplished them and \nthe American people had a very positive reaction.\n  Now, right before Christmas, we are going to start drifting toward \nnot being able to come to a conclusion on an economic growth package. \nThis would be a mistake.\n\n[[Page S12040]]\n\n  While I clearly have a long history of being supportive of the \nrailroad industry, the workers in the railroad industry--I support \ntrying to have a viable railroad industry in this country; I have been \nsupportive of Amtrak even to the criticism of some of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle--I think if we start moving into this area in \nthe way that is being suggested, if we try to bring this bill up and \nbasically just push the stimulus off the table, that will be a mistake. \nI oppose that.\n  I would be willing to work in the Finance Committee to come up with a \nbill that would get the job done properly, but not this bill and not in \nthis way, and not at the expense of the stimulus package and completing \nour work in the appropriations area, particularly the Department of \nDefense. We are at war. We have an economic slowdown bordering at least \non a recession. That is what we should focus on. Help our troops in the \nfield and help our workers in their jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to compliment the Republican \nleader. I am speaking in terms of what I see him doing today. The \nRepublican leader has concluded that for some reason the Democratic \nleader wants to take the economic stimulus package away from the \nSenate.\n  Instead of continuing with it, if it is as important as everyone \nsays, we have a whole new piece of legislation requiring very lengthy \ndebate when, as a matter of fact, whether you are for it or against it, \nit can be done in due course. It need not be done today or the day \nafter tomorrow or next week. As a matter of fact, it could be done as \nthe first or second item of business next year, and it would make no \ndifference whatsoever.\n  Instead, what will make a difference, in addition to taking care of \nour troops--and our military in every respect will soon get an \nappropriations bill; if nothing else happens, that will happen; that \nissue is going to be taken care of, that big commitment--the second and \nequally as important commitment is to stimulate the American economy so \nthat the working men and women who are unemployed can look out there at \nAmerica and say: They are hiring people back. We were just reading the \nnew statistics and instead of 800,000 jobs lost, we have an increased \n250,000 or 300,000. We are on the way up, so that everyone who \nparticipates in this economy, from the smallest equity owner and the \nsmallest employee in the American free enterprise system to a highly \npaid high-tech employee--so that they can all receive encouragement \nfrom their Government to spend, to buy things they might need.\n  A very simple way to do it, along with the wonderful ideas that have \nbeen worked out heretofore by Senators on both sides of the aisle--I \nwill speak for the way you get money into the hands and pockets of \nAmerican working men and women and their employers. That is called the \npayroll tax holiday. Perhaps it would be fairer to call that the \nDomenici piece and say that is what my amendment was trying to do.\n  The other items our distinguished minority leader brought forward are \npart of the various stimulus packages that have been discussed. Some \nare in the centrist package wherein one of the leaders was Olympia \nSnowe coming up with some of these great ideas. They are hers. They are \ncentrist Senators. Some of them--not too many--are in the Democratic \nbill that is pending that would be replaced. But there are not very \nmany that are comparable; there are a few.\n  It is absolutely imperative that we ask honestly and forthrightly of \nthose who know the American economy what will do the most good to put \nAmerica back to work.\n  The best social program in the world remains even today a good, solid \njob. There is no social welfare program in America that comes anywhere \nclose to that. People who get good jobs, steady jobs, steady paychecks, \nfor the most part have health insurance and the like.\n  So what is the best thing for American working men and women with \nchildren and families and who want to buy a car so they can start going \nto the mountains or taking their children out camping, whatever it may \nbe? For them to have confidence in the economy and have money to spend; \nyou can't beat those two in America. If you can find confidence in the \nAmerican people and money in their pockets, you have a vibrant American \neconomy.\n  You can't have everybody employed because that does not work in our \nsystem. But we were down to 3.9 percent unemployment for a significant \nperiod of time. Everybody was very thrilled.\n  Yesterday we received an economic evaluation from a very powerful \ngroup that said this economic downturn has been of long duration. I \nmyself have spoken in the Chamber monthly or every 6 weeks or so; I \nsaid the economy started coming down 13 months ago. That is now \nverified by experts. It started then.\n  I also kept saying, don't argue about the word ``recession'' or is it \nthere yet; it is not good. And if it isn't there yet, it will be there \nin a couple months. Why don't we get on with doing something to help \nthe economy.\n  Yesterday that same very powerful economic group said we have been in \na recession since March. We don't have to argue anymore; we are in a \nrecession. Whether we stay there for a few more months or 6 months or a \nyear is very important. The sooner we can start coming out of it and \nget closer to neutral, where we are not growing and not going up or \ndown, then we will break out of that and start down the positive track \nof recovery, which means more jobs, more opportunity, more confidence, \nand more money in the pockets of our people.\n  Our distinguished Republican leader said to a group of us, we ought \nto talk about the fact that we don't need to go on to another bill; we \nought to stay hitched to the economic recovery plan, the stimulus \npackage, and get it done.\n  I will send to the desk the principal components of the proposal he \nand I and others have put forth today. It is called ``Amendment to \nHouse Stimulus Bill.'' It is there for people to read and puruse.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Amendment to House Stimulus Bill, November 26, 2001\n\n       A. Stimulus proposal for rewarding work:\n       1. Marginal Rate Cuts: Accelerate into 2002 reduction of \n     the 28% tax bracket to 25%.\n       B. Stimulus for encouraging investment:\n       1. Bonus Expensing: Enhance expensing of capital \n     expenditure with 20% bonus depreciation (3-year sunset).\n       2. AMT Repeal: Repeal corporate alternative minimum tax on \n     a prospective basis.\n       C. Relief for low and middle-income Americans:\n       1. Payroll Tax Holiday: Offer workers one-month (December) \n     holiday from Federal payroll taxes while holding federal \n     trust funds harmless.\n       D. Expand the safety net for working Americans:\n       1. Extended Unemployment Benefits. Provide additional 13 \n     weeks of unemployment benefits to worker who exhaust their \n     standard benefits after September 11.\n       2. Additional National Emergency Grants. Provide governors \n     with additional $5 billion in Emergency Block Grants for \n     health insurance coverage and other related assistance.\n       Total first year stimulus and assistance: $100 Billion.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this would be a $100 billion stimulus in \nthe first year, and if we include the holiday for 1 month, when the \nAmerican people will begin to see hope, when the paychecks go up, even \nif it is only for 1 month, and when their employers get to keep 6.2 \npercent in their treasury to use for other things, what could be \nbetter?\n  I urge our Democratic friends to take a look at it. This Senator has \ntalked to many Democrats prior to today about this proposal, maybe as \nmany as 15. As a general matter, most of them thought it was an \nexciting idea. I will not go beyond that because far be it appropriate \nfor me to characterize it beyond saying they certainly gave me \nencouragement.\n  I do not believe people are free today to go to meetings and speak \ntheir piece because they are all tied up in entanglements of \ncommitments. They have commitments to the old package, to the new \npackage, to the centrist package, to the Democratic package that came \nout of committee. Unless you can get on board the group that supports \none of those, you cannot get a package for America.\n  The lines established for those various groupings in the Senate \nshould\n\n[[Page S12041]]\n\ndisappear, and those who lead them should go to a meeting, be it with \nthe Democratic leader or both leaders, and say: Let's ask the Finance \nCommittee to put forth a bipartisan effort for the next few days. Here \nare all the issues. They are all boiled down to five or six issues. The \nrest is detail.\n  I believe if they went there with the right spirit--that we really \nneed to do this, that it is far more important than anything else other \nthan to make sure we appropriate the money needed for our military \naround the world and at home--we will not let the American people down.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of \nthis legislation, a bill to substantially revise and modernize the \nrailroad retirement system, a system that was established in the dark \ndays of the Great Depression. I also commend our leadership for \nbringing this important matter before the Senate in the closing days of \nthis session. The fact that this body is willing to take the time to \nconsider this measure during these critical days highlights the \nimportance of this issue to both rail labor and management. Swift \npassage of the bill is essential to the continued vitality of our rail \nindustry, and I urge the Senate to act on it without delay.\n  Two of the giants of our Nation's rail industry have roots in my \nState of Nebraska. The headquarters of the Union Pacific Railroad is \nlocated in Omaha. And the Burlington Northern maintains a major \npresence in the State, with over 8,500 employees in Nebraska alone. One \nstretch of Burlington's line located in Nebraska is the busiest rail \nsegment in the world; coal unit trains traverse Nebraska constantly, \nproviding energy to meet the Nation's needs.\n  In this case, management and labor of the Union Pacific Railroad and \nthe Burlington Northern have worked cooperatively over a period of \nseveral years to develop this legislation and to build wide support for \nit here in Congress. The House has acted on it overwhelmingly, in three \nseparate votes, and it is now time for the Senate to move it forward. \nIt enjoys strong bipartisan support in both Chambers, and we simply \ncannot afford to delay the bill when we all know it will pass easily, \nespecially when we have so much other important work to do, and so \nlittle time in which to do it. It is time for the Senate to act.\n  This bill introduces tried and true investment techniques into the \nrailroad retirement system. It represents a way to make better use of \nthe resources built up by the contributions of rail employees and \nemployers to the system. Approximately $17 billion in retirement funds \nwill, for the first time, be invested as normal, modern pension plans \nare, diversified among different types of investments, instead of \nlocked into safe but low-yield Federal bonds. This simple change will \npermit the opportunity for better benefits and lower contributions for \nour rail workers, and give the industry the opportunity to take more \nresponsibility for its own pension system.\n  For the first time, the law will now automatically regulate the \namount of contributions going into the system in response to the \nactuary's estimate of the amount of reserves in the system. Under \npresent law, if reserves falter, the Congress must step in and create \nnew legislation to either reduce benefits or raise taxes, or both--a \ncumbersome mechanism to accomplish an unpopular task. This bill \nprovides a much more streamlined means of dealing with such a \ncontingency, without Government involvement. Industry and labor both \nsupport this automatic provision, because they know that the investment \nmarkets, in the long run, will be more productive for the system than a \nsteady diet of only Federal bonds.\n  One of the most compelling arguments for this legislation is that it \nwill improve the lot of widows and widowers of retired railroad \nemployees. Under current law, they watch their monthly compensation \ndecline by two-thirds once their spouse passes away. This is not only \nantiquated, it is an unbearable burden on some of our elderly. It is a \nthrowback to a time when the system was in difficult straits and could \nnot afford more. Today the system can afford to do better than this, if \nrailroad retirement reform is enacted. The bill will provide the \nsurviving spouse 100 percent of what the deceased former rail employee \nwas entitled to in his or her own right. There are 50,000 retirees \naffected in one way or another by this one provision.\n  There is one other important element of the bill. The industry will \nnow be permitted to reduce the very heavy payroll tax burden it now \ncarries to provide benefits under the system through a 3-percentage-\npoint drop in contributions, phased in over three years. This aspect of \nthe bill will remove a real disincentive to hire new employees or to \nreplace those who retire. It will free up capital for other worthwhile \nexpenditures. And as we continue to strive to reach agreement on an \neconomic stimulus package, we all can recognize that this benefit is \nespecially important during this time of economic downturn.\n  I do not intend to go into all the improvements and the modernization \nthat has been written into this bill at this time. There will be \nadequate time for a full explanation of the bill as debate progresses. \nBut I want to once again stress the need for the Senate to move this \nmeasure forward. The Nation's railroad retirees and their families need \nus to act. The Nation's rail industry can help our economic recovery if \nwe act. And the Nation's citizens expect us to act.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to make these important points today, \nand I urge the Senate to act as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I had the privilege of presiding over the \nSenate during the last hour and listening to debate on two measures, \nincluding the measure the Senator from Nebraska has raised, the change \nin the railroad retirement system. We had considerable discussion on \nthe economic stimulus package which has been debated in the Senate and \npassed in the House. I will take a few minutes and share a word about \neach of these.\n  The Senator from Nebraska was a Governor and a former insurance \ncommissioner of his State. In my previous life, I served as Governor of \nmy State and also State treasurer. During that period of time we \nestablished the first cash management system for the State of Delaware. \nWe had good, sound, progressive policymaking with respect to pension \ninvestments. We took a pension system that was not funded, a pay-as-\nyou-go system, fully amortized it and strengthened the State's \nfinancial condition considerably. Basically, the State had money in \naccounts that did not earn much at all, the equivalent in some cases of \nTreasury rates, and we ended up developing a policy that enabled us to \ninvest those moneys at market rates in things other than U.S. Treasurys \nor CDs of the bank.\n  Part of what is proposed in this railroad retirement plan is: Take \nthe money that has been set aside, paid into by the railroads \nthemselves and by the railroad employees; that can only be invested in \nU.S. Treasury obligations. Let's give them the opportunity--not \nimprudently, but under the kinds of safeguards we have in Delaware, \nNebraska, and South Dakota, as well, for State pension moneys--to \ninvest those moneys on behalf of railroad employees, pensioners, and \ntheir survivors, in something other than U.S. Treasury obligations.\n  If you look at the performance of mutual funds, the stock market, the \ncorporate bond market, over time they will outperform Treasurys. Under \nthat plan, given a prudent investment policy, we will be able to see a \nhigher rate of return from those investments than currently realized in \nthe investments under the current railroad retirement plan.\n  We could have a good debate, and we ought to, about some other \naspects of\n\n[[Page S12042]]\n\nthis bill--which I cosponsored and I very much want to see come to the \nfloor for debate and discussion. Some of our colleagues have raised \nconcerns about reducing the retirement age for those under the railroad \nretirement plan from 62 to 60.\n  We could have a legitimate discussion over whether that reduction \nshould be a graduated reduction to see if the money in the pension fund \nholds up. We could have a good discussion and debate about that. We \nought to. We could have a good discussion about the issue of whether or \nnot we ought to reduce all at once the payroll tax paid by the \nemployers by the railroads. Maybe that is a reduction that should be \nphased in over a longer period of time. Again, this is a perfect issue \nto debate and seek middle ground. We should have a debate over whether \nor not the survivor benefits should go immediately to 100 percent of \nthe benefit of the deceased railroad retiree or whether that, again, \nshould be phased up over time.\n  Railroad retirement is not Social Security. It is not the same as \nSocial Security. I don't believe it was ever intended to be. Railroad \nretirement predates Social Security and has been around longer than \nSocial Security. There are two aspects of railroad retirement, one \ncalled tier 1, which is comparable to Social Security.\n  But another aspect is called tier 2, which provides, if you will, \nmore of a private sector dimension. What we have in railroad retirement \nis a hybrid of Social Security and a private pension plan.\n  People say we cannot make some of the changes that are envisioned \nhere with the railroad pension plan because they are not consistent \nwith what we are doing in Social Security. A lot of private retirement \nplans let people retire at age 60. A lot of private retirement plans \nallow employees to retire with benefits after 30 years of service. A \nlot of them provide that benefit at age 60 with 30 years of service, \nand that is what is being proposed here.\n  We can, I guess, debate for some time whether or not this is the \nright time to bring this issue up. It is not a partisan issue. It has \nbeen suggested it is partisan and divisive. It is not a partisan issue. \nI believe 380 Members of the House voted for this bill earlier this \nyear. There are 74 cosponsors to the measure in the Senate. The \ncosponsors come from both sides of the aisle. This is not a partisan \nissue. This is a bipartisan issue which seems to enjoy pretty good \nsupport in both Houses of the Congress, and also has the \nattractiveness, at least to me, that both rail labor and the railroads \nthemselves support this bill.\n  Enough on this measure. We are going to have a vote on cloture. We \nwill have an opportunity to vote whether or not to move to the bill. I \nhope we do, and I hope when we do we will have an opportunity to \nactually discuss and debate some of the issues that our Republican \nfriends have raised earlier this afternoon. I think we can find some \nmiddle ground that augurs well for those who are working in the \nrailroad industry, those who are retired from the railroad industry and \nfor their survivors, and one that is not unfair to the taxpayers of \nthis country.\n  Let me mention one other thing before I yield my time and that is on \nthe economic stimulus package. This is a debate and an issue which \ncries out for a reasonable compromise. Several of the elements of a \nreasonable compromise have been suggested today. I want to go back to \nthem, if I may.\n  Senator Domenici, along with Senator Corzine and others, has come \nforward with I think a perfectly reasonable proposal on a payroll tax \nholiday whereby for 1 month neither employers nor employees would pay \nthe Social Security payroll tax. The employees would keep that money in \ntheir paychecks. It would help people who are poor and also people who \nare not poor, but it would disproportionately help people at the lower \nend of the income spectrum. In addition, the employers would not pay \ntheir share of the payroll tax. It would help those businesses that are \nsmall and those that are not so small. I think disproportionately it \nmight help those that are small more than those that are large. That \nidea, the idea of a payroll tax holiday for 1 month, if it were offered \nin lieu of the proposal to provide additional payroll tax rebate \nchecks, in lieu of an expedited reduction in the 27 percent rate, and \nin lieu of an expedited expansion of the 10-percent bracket--that idea \ncould be a very good compromise to bring Republicans and Democrats \ntogether.\n  The payroll tax holiday has the added virtue, frankly, of helping \nStates. Like other employers, States pay payroll taxes for their State \nemployees. If they had a 1-month holiday, it would help most States. My \nState is not hurting as badly as others. The unemployment rate is well \nbelow average, but we are hurting too, and my guess is so is South \nDakota and others. A payroll tax holiday would also provide money in \nthe pockets of people who are very likely to spend it, and we need some \nof that stimulus.\n\n  Another of the elements I want to mention today to provide a bridge \nbetween Democrats and Republicans on economic stimulus deals with what \nis called bonus depreciation, accelerated depreciation for capital \ninvestments that are made over the next 1, 2, or 3 years. Several \nprinciples were outlined for us in an agreement adopted earlier this \nfall by Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate \nBudget Committee. Among those principles that were agreed to are these: \nthe economic stimulus package should have an immediate impact; it \nshould not have a long-term adverse consequence for a balanced budget; \nand it should be temporary in nature. The leaders of the budget \ncommittees agreed that all measures in the stimulus package should \nsunset in one year, to the extent practicable. If we take those three \ncriteria and look at this notion of accelerated depreciation in order \nto stimulate capital investment, I think a compromise lies between what \nthe House has agreed to and what the Senate is contemplating.\n  If you look at the history of the last 12 months or so in this \ncountry as our economy has wound down, one of the things that has \nhappened is we have seen a drying up of capital investment. There is a \nproposal offered by our Republican friends that says let's provide a \n30-percent writeoff, 30-percent bonus depreciation for investments made \nover a 3-year period for companies that make those kinds of \ninvestments.\n  Senator Baucus, in his proposal, said we should provide a 10-percent \ndepreciation bonus over a 12-month period of time. There is plenty of \nroom to compromise between 10 percent and 30 percent, and I suggest 20 \npercent might be that compromise for accelerated depreciation, bonus \ndepreciation if you would. As for the time period, we should stay true \nto the 1-year figure, as Senator Baucus has proposed and as the budget \ncommittee leadership suggested.\n  The third measure I have to offer as a compromise between Democrats \nand Republicans deals with a proposal I heard from Senator Collins of \nMaine and Senator Lieberman of Connecticut that we adopted in the \nCongress before I got here, in 1993. It is a proposal to encourage \ninvestment in small cap companies, those whose capitalization is $50 \nmillion or less. Those who hold investments in these companies--\nsecurities issued by those companies, issued for 5 years--the 1993 law \npromised a reduction by one-half in the capital gains tax. As it turns \nout, because of the alternative minimum tax that is in place, the \npractical effect of the incentive offered by the 1993 law is for the \nmost part moot. There is just not much of an incentive anymore, \nespecially when the capital gains rate is taken down to 20 percent.\n  I offer this. Look at a proposal offered by Senator Collins, \ncosponsored by Senator Lieberman, to make the 1993 law work. That \nproposal says let's make the 1993 law work by taking away the effect of \nthe alternative minimum tax for those who make investments in \naccordance with the 1993 law.\n  Those are three potential compromises which I think might bring us a \nlittle closer together as we try to work out some compromises. I hope \nwe can get to work on this Railroad Retirement Act and hammer something \nout on that as well.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nDelaware. I agree it is something on which we need to move forward.\n\n[[Page S12043]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12043-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the nomination \nof William Baxter for both TVA positions be confirmed en bloc, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid on the table en bloc, the President of \nthe United States be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nthe Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations were considered and confirmed en bloc as follows:\n\n\n                       TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY\n\n       William Baxter, of Tennessee, to be a Member of the Board \n     of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority for the term \n     expiring May 18, 2011.\n       William Baxter, of Tennessee, to be a Member of the Board \n     of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority for the \n     remainder of the term expiring May 18, 2002.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nconfirmation of Bill Baxter to be a member of the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority's Board of Directors.\n  The Tennessee Valley Authority has played and will continue to play a \ncritical role in the future of Tennessee and the entire TVA region. TVA \nis the Nation's largest public power producer serving over 8.3 million \ncustomers through its 158 distributors with revenues of $7 billion \nannually. In addition, TVA manages the fifth largest river system in \nthe country.\n  Over the last 7 years as a Senator from Tennessee, I have come to \nrealize that TVA is more than a power public company, more than steward \nof a river system, it is an integral part of the valley's economy and \ncommunity.\n  An organization of this size with such an important role must have \nthe very best leadership and management team in place. The board must \nbe able to lead the organization into a future which presents many \nchallenges including inevitable restructuring of the electric industry, \naddressing air quality issues, and managing TVA's debt.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has nominated an individual who has \nthe experience and the skills to help lead TVA into this dynamic \nfuture. In addition, I have known Bill for most of the last decade and \ncan personally attest to his intelligence, integrity, and ability. \nSimply stated, Bill Baxter is the right man for the job.\n  A TVA Director must fill three needs for the agency that Bill Baxter \nfits exceptionally well: business acumen, a commitment to public \nservice, and leadership skills that will benefit the entire Valley. I \nwill elaborate briefly on each of these. Bill is a business man, and a \ngood one, who for over 20 years has shown he knows how to manage a \ncompany and meet a bottom line.

Mr. President, I wish to address some comments made by \nthe majority leader this morning. Comments made by the majority leader \nthis morning indicated he was postponing consideration of energy \nlegislation until next year. I do not believe this is being responsive \nto the security needs of this Nation. As we know, the\n\n[[Page S12044]]\n\nHouse has passed comprehensive energy legislation. It has now been \nalmost 6 months since the administration transmitted its report and \nrecommendations on national energy policy to the Congress.\n  I do not think there is any question that had it not been for that \nthe change of leadership in the Senate, we would have had energy \nlegislation completed before the August recess.\n  When we left for the Thanksgiving recess, we assumed we would return \nto consider the stimulus legislation, followed by appropriations bills \nand items related to terrorism. The majority leader has stated that the \nenergy legislation would come to the floor as soon as issues relating \nto the terrorist attacks of September 11 were addressed. Now we seem to \nhave a change, again. The majority leader has announced we will turn to \nthe railroad retirement bill and the farm bill this week before we \nreturn to energy.\n  I ask my colleagues: Is railroad retirement more important to our \nNation's security than protecting our Nation's energy supply? Is the \nfarm bill more important to protecting our Nation's security? This is \nlike Lucy pulling the football from Charlie Brown. It seems the \nmajority leader can always find something else to do rather than \naddress the critical energy needs of this Nation and the energy \nsecurity threat.\n  We see new threats appearing. I find this terribly disturbing, \nespecially in light of two recent events that could jeopardize our \nnational security. First was the announcement yesterday by the Attorney \nGeneral that there was reason to believe that threats exist against our \nNation's natural gas supplies should bin Laden be captured or killed. \nSecond is the strong statement by the administration against Saddam \nHussein and Iraq about their continuing efforts to develop weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  I need not remind this body, as I have often said, that we import a \nsignificant amount of oil from Saddam Hussein--more than 1 million \nbarrels per day in September alone. Just last week two Navy sailors \nwere killed defending against Iraq's illegally smuggling oil.\n  I am going to quote from an article that appeared in an Alaska paper \nand is entitled ``Iraqi oil: 2 sailors die'':\n\n       For reasons mysterious to us, a few Alaskans become \n     irrational when it is suggested that oil from ANWR would be \n     preferable to oil imported by the U.S. from Iraq. Anything, \n     it seems, is better than opening the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge.\n       Well, maybe not anything. Everyone surely must be heartsick \n     over the loss of two American Navy men a few days ago when a \n     rusty tanker smuggling 12,000 barrels of Iraqi oil sank in \n     the North Arabian Gulf.\n       The two sailors from the USS Peterson boarded the \n     overloaded rust-bucket as part of the U.S. effort to prevent \n     Iraq from illegally diverting oil to shady foreign buyers, \n     who resell it on the spot market--with much of it winding up \n     in American refineries.\n       When the tanker, the Samra, went down, it took with it four \n     Iraqi crewmen and the American sailors. The oil was in tanks \n     hidden under bags of grain in the hold.\n       At the risk of further angering opponents of opening ANWR, \n     we point out that Petty Officer 1st Class Vincent Parker, 38, \n     of Preston, Miss., and Petty Officer 3rd Class Benjamin \n     Johnson, 21, of Rochester, N.Y., died because our own \n     domestic oil resources are not sufficiently developed.\n\n  It seems we have a grave inconsistency. On one hand, we are importing \noil from Iraq; on the other, enforcing a no-fly zone. And now we have \nhad the loss of two Navy sailors defending against Iraq's illegal oil.\n  Should an attack on our natural gas supplies occur or should there be \nsome disruption in our supply of imported energy, we will see energy \nprices skyrocket and risk seeing our recession quickly turn into a \ndepression.\n  Should this occur, I hope the American people will understand the \nmajority leader's position that they will just have to wait until next \nyear for some relief on energy legislation.\n  I was also quite surprised to hear the majority leader state that all \ncommittees of jurisdiction have had the opportunity for input on the \nlegislation he will introduce when, in fact, just the opposite is true.\n  In order to frustrate the will of Senators, the majority leader had \nto resort to the extraordinary measure of closing one of the standing \ncommittees of the Senate, the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, so that it would not report partisan energy legislation.\n  Despite the requirements of both the Senate and committee rules that \nwe hold business meetings at least monthly, we have been forbidden to \nmeet and, in fact, have not had a business meeting since the August \nrecess. I ask: Is this allowing the Senate to work its will?\n  Now that the majority leader has postponed consideration of \ncomprehensive energy legislation, will he allow the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to consider this legislation? That appears pretty \nevident.\n  I respectfully suggest the majority leader lift his prohibition on \nour committee so we can hold a business meeting to immediately consider \nthis legislation. I do not think it will take the committee more than \none business meeting to report an amendment or amendments to the \nSenate. If the majority leader introduces his version this week and \nallows the Energy Committee to meet next week, I am confident we will \nbe able to report bipartisan legislation in time for consideration by \nthe full Senate.\n  Should this not occur, I believe it to be my obligation as ranking \nmember of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to bring the \ndebate about our Nation's energy security to the floor of the Senate as \nsoon as possible, using whatever procedural means are available. I \nalert all my colleagues that it is my intent to use whatever means are \nnecessary to get an energy bill before this Senate before we recess.\n  I further remind my colleagues, as we look at a stimulus package, \nthere is no better stimulus than the ANWR issue in the energy bill. \nWhere else are you going to generate about 250,000 jobs in this \ncountry? Where else are you going to generate about $3 billion in \nrevenue from lease sales? And where else are you going to do this \nwithout the cost to the taxpayers of any amount of money?\n  This is a money generator. It is a jobs issue. The Senate should move \non this issue expeditiously.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, what is the matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to H.R. 10 is the \npending question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, at some point that is appropriate--this \nis not the time; I might do it after I ask unanimous consent and speak \non some other business--I certainly would want to speak to the issue \nthe Senator from Alaska has raised a number of times on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I will say, a moment ago he asked the question: Where else are you \ngoing to provide 250,000 jobs a series of times? The fact is, there is \na sensible energy policy for this country and a way to provide many \nmore than 250,000 jobs by properly pursuing a series of measures other \nthan violating the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is such a false \npremise, such a false offering for jobs that it really obviates most of \nthe commonsense approaches to energy that the Senate has yet to debate.\n  I very much look forward to the debate the Senator promises us. It \nwill be a good debate. There are millions of jobs awaiting Americans in \na sensible energy approach, and millions of Americans understand that \nand are waiting for us to move to that approach as rapidly as possible.\n  What is really interesting about the debate about the Arctic wildlife \nrefuge, so much as there is a debate, is that not a drop of oil is \ngoing to come in the near term and answer any of the immediate needs of \nnational security with respect to our dependency.\n  Moreover, most of the world's reserves are everywhere else but the \nUnited States. So whatever Alaska has to offer, we have great respect \nfor Alaska. We love the 95 percent of the oil shelf that is available \nfor drilling. It is not going to be a literal drop in the bucket with \nrespect to the independence issue or the global price of oil. So these \nare all issues that await us.\n\n[[Page S12045]]\n\n  It is an important debate for the country to have. There will be no \ndifference in the outcome whether that debate takes place in December \nor takes place in January, as the majority leader has promised us. So I \nanticipate the budget of this country, which still awaits action by the \nSenate, and the Defense appropriations bill itself, which is important \nto the funding of our troops immediately, ought to take precedence over \nthat other debate which incidentally has been begging for its proper \nattention for some 30 years or more.\n  I do not think another month is going to make all that much \ndifference in the outcome. So I do look forward to it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12045-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12045-S12047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1499\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, Senator Bond and I have been trying to \nbring S. 1499 before the Senate since it was introduced, but literally \nfor more than 1 month steadily, we have been held up, depriving the \nSenate of an appropriate debate and depriving us of an opportunity to \nachieve maybe 90 to 95 votes for this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to Calendar No. \n186, S. 1499; that the Kerry-Bond substitute amendment which is at the \ndesk be considered and agreed to, and the bill, as amended, be read \nthree times, passed, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I object reluctantly on my behalf and on \nbehalf of other Senators. I believe both Senator Kerry and Senator Bond \nwish to speak on the issue, and I will speak to it when they have \ncompleted their remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I understand the Senator from Arizona has \nindeed objected to this bill for a period of time now, as I referenced \nmoments ago. I regret that. We have tried to work out the issues with \nrespect to what is the American Small Business Emergency Relief and \nRecovery Act of 2001. The ranking member of the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, Senator Bond, has joined me for some period \nof time now in trying to move this important legislation for the small \nbusinesses of our country. We have 55 cosponsors of this bill, a \nmajority of the Senate, prepared to help the small businesses of the \ncountry. Two United States Senators, I regret to say, oppose this bill, \nand we are not able to proceed forward.\n  We have the support of the Airport Ground Transportation Association, \nthe American Bus Association, the Association of Women's Business \nCenters, the CDC Small Business Finance, the Chicago Association of \nNeighborhood Development Organizations, the Citizens Financial Group of \nRhode Island, the Clovis Community Bank of California, the Coastal \nEnterprises of Maine, the County of San Diego, the Delaware Community \nReinvestment Act Council, the Fairness in Rural Lending Group, the \nFlorida Atlantic University Small Business Development Center, the \nHelicopter Association, the National Association of Development \nCompanies, the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders--\nsome 5,000-plus lenders--the National Community Reinvestment \nAssociation, the National League of Cities, the National Limousine \nAssociation, the National Restaurant Association, the National Small \nBusiness United, National Tour Association, the Rural Housing \nInstitute, the Rural Opportunities, Small Business Legislative Council, \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors, the United States Chamber of Commerce, \nthe United States Tour Operator Association, the Women's Business \nDevelopment Center, and others.\n  This amendment incorporates a number of improvements that Senator \nBond and I have made at the recommendation of the administration and of \nother colleagues and of the business community. It seeks to provide \nhelp to small businesses nationwide that are struggling because of the \nevents of September 11, exacerbating an already declining economy in \nthe months prior to September 11.\n  They need access to working capital until normal operations resume, \nor until they can restructure or change the business to address the \nmarket changes. Many small businesses simply cannot find the working \ncapital they need, even though they are a viable business under normal \ncircumstances, because of this momentary downturn, because of an abrupt \ncutoff of business due to the reduction in auto rentals, hotel rentals, \nvisits to restaurants, travel and therefore business with travel \nagencies. All of those immediately impacted by the events of September \n11 are living out an aberration in the economy. It is not the normal \ncourse of doing business. Those are businesses that could be viable in \na matter of months, which we do not want to lose, providing in the \nnormal course of business we provide them with adequate access to \ncredit.\n  The problem is, all across the country, we know credit has tightened \nup as a consequence of the outlook of the economy. So we create this \nself-fulfilling prophecy, this cycle of a downward trend as a \nconsequence of people saying: I think the economy looks bad. . . . We \nhave to hold back on those loans. . . . Consequently, they hold back on \nthe loans and then, indeed, the economy looks bad because the failures \nensue because working businesses do not get their capital.\n  In American Banker, they wrote the following:\n\n       Lenders were already skittish following the steep economic \n     decline of the past year. The events of September 11 have \n     diminished their confidence and dimmed their prospect for \n     recovery.\n\n  This bill is geared to try to provide emergency lending completely \nwithin the current law and capacity of the Small Business \nAdministration. It builds on SBA's disaster loans, the 7(a) working \ncapital loans, the 504 loans for equipment and building improvements, \nthe venture capital investments and expanded access to SBA's business \ncounseling. SBA has done an extraordinary job of leveraging small \namounts of money into larger amounts of money in the country.\n  Let me point out that one of the objections of our colleagues who \nkeep stopping us from proceeding forward is that this bill will cost \nmoney. Based on a 1992 study by Price Waterhouse, the $17 billion of \n7(a) loans authorized by this bill will yield tax revenues from the \nsmall businesses borrowers of about $2.5 billion in the first year \nalone, more than off-setting the cost of the entire bill.\n  This bill is fiscally responsible. The Congressional Budget Office \n(CBO) has informally scored S. 1499 at $860 million if all aspects are \nfully funded and utilized. CBO has estimated that the vast majority of \nthe loans provided by S. 1499 (those made under section 7(a) of the \nSmall Business Act) will cost 3 percent; that means that for every $100 \nloaned, the cost to the government is $3. This is a cost-effective way \nto provide necessary access to capital to small businesses throughout \nthe country.\n  The judgment that is made in making a loan is how assured is that \nreturn on investment or what is the track record of the people to whom \nyou are lending. The fact is that the track record of the Small \nBusiness Administration over the last years has been improving steadily \nand is at a rate today that would suggest this is a positive \nundertaking for the Government of the United States. It is particularly \nimportant for us to engage in it. In fact, the Administrator of the SBA \nrecently said at a conference that the cost of the 7(a) program will be \n50 percent less in FY 2003.\n  I might point out that if one were to take a number of the businesses \nthat have been helped by the Small Business Administration--and I will \nbe very quick because I know my colleague from Missouri wants to \nspeak--the entire budget of the SBA for several years has been paid for \nmany times over by the tax revenues that have come from the success \nstories of the companies that the SBA has funded. How many of our \ncolleagues are aware that SBA was involved in funding Fed Ex, SBA was \ninvolved in the funding of Callaway Golf, SBA was involved in the \nfunding of Intel? Intel alone has returned more in terms of the tax \nrevenue in this country than the entire annual budget of SBA.\n  So we have many small businesses that are currently trying to stave \noff\n\n[[Page S12046]]\n\nbankruptcies. They are trying to prevent the doors from being closed. \nThey want to keep people working, and keeping those people working is \nin itself a stimulus for the United States because those are people who \npay their health bills, pay their mortgages, make their car payments, \nand all of that begins to restore the health of the economy in the long \nrun.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up this legislation in the next few \ndays. Small businesses are asking Members to do this. Our friends in \nthe House of Representatives, Congressman Don Manzullo, chairman of the \ncommittee, and Congressman Jim Moran have introduced a companion bill \nand are gearing up to pass it as soon as possible. I hope my 55 \ncolleagues, who are consponsors of this, and others waiting to vote for \nit, and the small businesses who need it, will be liberated from this \nhold in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I thank my 55 colleagues who are cosponsors of this \nbill, with a special thanks to Senator Bond, the ranking member of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. I also want to \nthank the many supporters of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of cosponsors and several of \nthe many letters of support for the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Cosponsors--The American Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery \n                              Act of 2001\n\n       Senators Bond, Wellstone, Harkin, Cleland, Lieberman, \n     Edwards, Carnahan, Levin, Cantwell, Landrieu, Snowe, Allen, \n     Crapo, Enzi, Burns, Ensign, Schumer, Clinton, Daschle, \n     Bingaman, Inouye, Sarbanes, Akaka, Reed, Durbin, Kennedy, \n     Grassley, Torricelli, Lincoln, Rockfeller, Hollings, Leahy, \n     Corzine, Johnson, Collins, Biden, Warner, Bill Nelson, \n     Mikulski, Jeffords, Bennett, Murray, Carper, Domenici, \n     Conrad, Smith (OR), Graham, Roberts, Stabenow, Dorgan, Hagel, \n     Hutchison, Dodd, Hutchinson, and Boxer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 12, 2001.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Small Business Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to thank you for \n     introducing S. 1499, ``The American Small Business Emergency \n     Relief and Recover Act of 2001,'' on October 8, 2001, and \n     pledge the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's support for this \n     important bill that provides much needed relief to many of \n     America's small business owners.\n       As a direct result of the events of September 11, many \n     small businesses have been physically and economically \n     devastated. Because of the unique character of this disaster, \n     many of the existing programs meant to act as a ``safety \n     net'' to the small business community have been found to be \n     inadequate or not available. Your bill, ``The American Small \n     Business Emergency Relief and Recover Act of 2001,'' serves \n     to correct these inequities and provide the economic tools \n     necessary for many small business owners to recover from this \n     tragedy.\n       For those small business owners whose enterprises have been \n     shattered by the repercussions of the economic shockwave from \n     ground zero, we must extend the lifeline of assistance in the \n     form of expanded Small Business Administration low-interest \n     loans and programs. We must not let the recent tragedies \n     serve to dampen the drive and determination of our nation's \n     existing small business owners who may be struggling \n     financially as a result of the events of September 11.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest \n     business federation, representing more than three million \n     businesses of every size, sector, and region. More than 96 \n     percent of the Chamber's members are small businesses with \n     100 or fewer employees. On behalf of these small employers, I \n     again thank you for introducing S. 1499, ``The American Small \n     Business Emergency Relief and Recover Act of 2001.''\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R.

Christopher Bond,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators Kerry and Bond: On behalf of the members of \n     the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders \n     (NAGGL), SBA's 7(a) lending partners, thank you for your \n     efforts to support capital access for small businesses, \n     especially in this time of heightened need. In accordance \n     with this need, NAGGL's leadership and membership fully \n     endorses S. 1499, the ``The American Small Business Emergency \n     Relief and Recovery Act of 2001.''\n       This bill's goal is to provide small businesses with the \n     necessary financial assistance to spur them, and thus \n     America's greater economy, to full recovery. It will do this \n     by addressing the credit needs of a variety of small \n     businesses, from those located at or near disaster sites, to \n     the multitude of small businesses throughout the country that \n     were indirectly impacted by the events of September 11, 2001.\n       Prior to September 11, there were already signs of a \n     slowing economy and a tightening of credit underwriting \n     standards by commercial lenders. Some small businesses were \n     already facing difficulty in obtaining credit. The events of \n     September 11th have only exacerbated these problems.\n       This is why the quick passage of S. 1499 is so important. \n     This bill addresses the difficulties facing America's small \n     business sector, and so we encourage your Senate colleagues \n     to pass it expeditiously.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Anthony R. Wilkinson,\n     NAGGL President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of 138,000 local elected officials, \n     the National League of Cities (NLC) strongly urges you and \n     your colleagues to support and push for immediate \n     consideration of S. 1499, the American Small Business \n     Emergency Relief and Recovery Act of 2001.\n       In the wake of September 11, cities nationwide have \n     reported stress to local economies and city finances, and \n     have indicated that a decline in local business is one of \n     their greatest concerns. In a recent letter to Senator \n     Daschle and members of the Senate Finance and Budget \n     Committees, NLC urged inclusion of small business relief in \n     any economic stimulus package.\n       S. 1499 would help the efforts of lending institutions, \n     community organizations and local public agencies in \n     providing assistance to small businesses. The measure would \n     expand access to Small Business Administration (SBA) low-\n     interest or no-cost recovery loans to small businesses that \n     were directly or indirectly affected by the attacks, and \n     those in need of capital and investment financing or \n     procurement assistance.\n       NLC has always supported adequate federal assistance to new \n     and existing small businesses, and this emergency legislation \n     reflects an important and timely effort by Congress to \n     recognize the impact of these attacks on local economies \n     nationwide by helping mitigate bankruptcies, business \n     closures, and lay-offs.\n       If you have any questions or comments, please contact Scott \n     Shrum in our office at 202-626-3033.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Donald J. Borut,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2001.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Restaurant \n     Association, the leading trade group for the nation's 844,000 \n     restaurant locations, we urge you to cosponsor S. 1499, the \n     American Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act of \n     2001.\n       S. 1499 would address both emergency relief needed in the \n     aftermath of the September 11 tragedies as well as the \n     magnified credit crunch caused by the economic downturn and \n     the uncertain economic outlook facing our nation. In October \n     2001, eating and drinking places cut 42,000 jobs, which \n     followed a 43,000 job reduction in September (seasonally-\n     adjusted). This is the worst employment performance in the \n     industry for this two month period since records have been \n     kept.\n       The purpose of S. 1499 is to help small businesses meet \n     their payments on existing debts, finance their businesses \n     and maintain jobs in the aftermath of the September 11 \n     attacks by strengthening and expending access to the Small \n     Business Administration's loan payments and management \n     counseling. With 11.3 million employees, the restaurant \n     industry is our nation's largest employer outside of \n     government. Ninety-two percent of restaurant in the United \n     States have fewer than 50 employees.\n       The National Restaurant Association applauds Senator John \n     Kerry and Senator Kit Bond for introducing this bipartisan \n     legislation and we ask that you consider cosponsoring S. \n     1499.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steven C. Anderson,\n       President and CEO.\n     Lee Culpepper,\n       Senior Vice President, Government Affairs and Public \n     Policy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, there are a couple of issues on which I \nagree very strongly with my good friend, the chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee, and one on which I disagree.\n\n[[Page S12047]]\n\n First, I agree on the need to bring up an energy package, have a sound \nand full debate, and pass a sensible energy package. We need it. I \ndisagree with him on the need to continue the environmentally sound \ndevelopment of natural resources and petroleum products out of ANWR.\n  I have been on the North Slope, a frozen desert which is not harmed \nby drilling there now. The 2,000 acres that would be involved out of \nANWR's 1.9 million acres will do nothing but provide a sounder base for \nthe caribou that live there--I disagree on that, but I strongly agree \nwith him on the need to bring up S. 1499.\n  If a Senator has a problem with it, air it on the floor. We have 55 \ncosponsors; 18 out of the 19 members of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee said it is time to do something for small business.\n  It had become apparent to all Members that in 2000 we had an economic \nslowdown. Officially, we are in a recession. As we know, as banks \ntighten credit standards, and as access to credit drops, small business \nslows down. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, there \nwere significant weaknesses in the small business sector. We proposed a \nreasonable, bipartisan measure that can go a long way toward helping \nsmall business get the restart it needs to provide jobs and spur \neconomic activity in this country.\n  Very briefly, the American Small Business Emergency Relief and \nRecovery Act would make economic injury disaster loans available to all \nsmall businesses directly impacted by terrorist attacks. Businesses \nthat shut down, such as airport shutdowns and general aviation \nshutdowns, and airport suppliers, would be allowed a repayment of \nprincipal and interest deferral for 2 years and interest could be \nforgiven.\n  The SBA current disaster loan program was not designed to meet the \nextraordinary circumstances that came about as a result of the \nterrorist activities. It could be a year or more before many of the \nsmall businesses in New York City can open their doors. They could not \nrepay the loans right away, so we allow them to defer.\n  Small businesses throughout the United States have shut down. When \ngeneral aviation was grounded, flight schools were closed, and other \nsmall businesses, depending on aircraft, were hurt. Our bill allows \nthese small businesses to defer for 2 years repayment of principal and \ninterest on their SBA disaster loans. Other small businesses \nexperiencing economic problems that need help with their cashflow, \nworking capital, or investments to continue their operation or hire \nmore people would be available for special loan programs with a lower \ninterest prime, with a 90 percent guarantee of the loan, and with a \ndeferral of principal and payments for up to a year.\n  Small businesses are already hurt. We need to give them a stimulus to \nget them moving again. There would be other breaks: No guarantee fees \nto be paid by small businesses. The amount that the SBA could guarantee \nwould increase from 80 to 90 percent for loans up to $150,000 and from \n75 to 85 percent for loans greater than $150,000. The participating \nbank fees would be removed on 504 certified development company loans.\n\n  That is what we propose. That is what the Small Business Committee \nsays makes sense. Right now we are talking about coming forward with a \n$70 to $80 to $90 to $100 billion stimulus package because we know the \neconomy needs a jump-start. That is $70 to $80 to $90 billion that \nwould mostly be paid out in the hopes that people would use that money \nto buy and get business started again.\n  We are in a business recession. The beauty of this program is no \nmoney is spent unless small business borrows money to put to work. We \nwant small businesses to get back to work. This program doesn't cost a \nthing unless some small business goes out and borrows the money and \nputs it to work, buys equipment, uses it for working capital, uses it \nto pay employees.\n  When we talk about credit scoring in the credit subsidy rates, \npeople's eyes always glaze over. They say the total cost of the bill \nfor 1 year is $815 million. That means they make $17 billion worth of \nloans, and somewhere around half a percent of those or $800 million may \ngo bad. We are talking million. The rest is paid back. There are other \nminor losses on fees. Total cost to the Government is $816 million.\n  I am almost embarrassed to come out here and talk about a stimulus \npackage in terms of millions of dollars because anybody on this floor \nworth their salt can get up and talk about billions and billions and \nbillions of dollars they would like to see in stimulus. We can get \nsmall business investing, growing, hiring more people, paying wages, \nbuying equipment, being good customers for other businesses, for $816 \nmillion.\n  I think this bill makes sense. We have a majority of the Senate \ncosponsoring it. Let's get on with this bill. If we are not able to \nbring it up as a separate bill, I have this warm feeling that it will \nbe offered as an amendment at some point and we will have an \nopportunity for that full debate at that time.\n  I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts; I expect as usual when \nwe are talking about helping small business, some 80 to 90 Members of \nthis body will go along with us.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to let us know what their problems are \nwith the bill, talk it out, get it done, and pass it. We are going to \nhave an opportunity to vote on it at some point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be given up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12047-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12047-S12049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           REMEMBER NEW YORK\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, exactly 11 weeks ago today, we as a \nnation suffered the most horrific and tragic attack in our long history \non our shores. It is almost impossible to reconstruct the feelings, the \nemotions, the reactions that have swept through our Nation in the wake \nof the events of September 11. Certainly our Nation has responded both \nabroad, under the President's leadership, through the extraordinary \nefforts of our men and women in uniform, to root out the terrorists \nresponsible for this attack. Here at home we have faced continuing \nchallenges in the aftermath of September 11, including the use of \nanthrax to bring about death and injury and create an atmosphere of \nfear. But I want to bring our attention back to that part of our Nation \nthat suffered the most grievous attack. That was in New York City in \nLower Manhattan.\n\n  I don't think it was any accident that the terrorists chose this \nparticular place in America to launch their attack. New York City is \nthe global city, not only the capital of global finance but of global \nmedia, of entertainment, of intellectual ferment. It is a beacon, a \nmagnet for immigrants from throughout the world. So the attack was well \nplanned, not only to destroy buildings and kill innocent people but to \nsend a signal to America that the terrorists were aiming to undermine \nour way of life.\n  Clearly, we have responded with such strength and resolution that the \neffort undertaken by those who thought they would destroy us has \nclearly been repudiated. We are, I believe, stronger and more unified \ntoday than we were on September 10. For that I am grateful. But I do \nnot want our country, as we turn our television sets and our eyes \ntoward Afghanistan, as we worry about tracking down whoever sent \nanthrax-laden envelopes to innocent people, including our colleagues, I \ndo not want anyone to forget what happened on September 11 in New York \nCity.\n  This is an aerial view of Lower Manhattan. It gives you some sense of \nthe destruction--acres and acres of destroyed buildings, fires that are \nstill burning below ground. Looking at this today brings back the \nmemories that I will always have of flying over this site on September \n12 and looking down and not only seeing that the towers and neighboring \nbuildings were gone but looking into what appeared to be the jaws of \nhell.\n  But beyond this picture of destruction there are so many lives that \nhave been impacted forever, not only those who are no longer with us \nbut their family members, their colleagues, their friends, and their \nneighbors have been affected, not only those who lost their lives but \nso many whose livelihoods were turned upside down.\n\n[[Page S12048]]\n\n  In New York City alone, as a result of the World Trade Center \nattacks, we lost over 3,500 innocent people. We are still reading their \nprofiles and learning a little bit about each one because of the \nextraordinary series that the New York Times runs every day. For that I \nthank the Times.\n  Some 20,000 families who called Lower Manhattan home were rendered \nhomeless. Think of it; 20,000 families couldn't go home, not only \nbecause of the destruction but because of the air quality. It was \nreported yesterday that 8,000 have still not returned home.\n  Madam President, 15 or 20 million square feet of office space was \ndamaged or destroyed resulting in the loss of nearly 125,000 jobs. And \nbecause the scene--not just the immediate area of destruction known as \nGround Zero but reaching far beyond--is a crime scene, and because the \nremoval of the debris ties up streets, we have an area that is called \nthe frozen zone. That makes it very difficult for businesses and \nresidents to be able to resume anything resembling normal life.\n  The New York City Partnership estimates we lost nearly 125,000 jobs, \nand that a total of 270,000 are at risk. The Partnership expects over \n50,000 small businesses to close their doors during the first quarter \nof the coming year. In the 45 days following the attack, 3,400 small \nbusinesses rendered inaccessible because of the damage and the crime \nscene designation lost an estimated $795 million in revenues.\n\n  We know the specific cases of the losses are not just in the private \nsector, because the public sector was also impacted in a way from which \nit will take years to recover. The Metropolitan Transportation \nAuthority and the Port Authority of New York suffered millions of \ndollars to subway stations, to the PATH train station and \ninfrastructure that ran underground, under the river, bringing \nthousands and thousands of people to work every day.\n  Hundreds of thousands of residents and businesses lost electricity \nand telephone capacity. Many remain without telephones all these weeks \nlater.\n  Verizon, which provides our phone service, and serves 300,000 voice \nlines and 3.5 million data circuits out of its building at 140 West \nStreet, was severely impacted because the building was destroyed.\n  Con Ed lost two substations that supplied power for nearly 400,000 \nhomes and businesses and suffered destruction of 11,000 feet of gas \ndistribution lines. Con Ed continues to provide electricity through \nwhat are effectively 35 miles of extension cords. I have seen these big \nextension cords lying on top of the streets, and I know this is \nsomething that needs to be tended to so they are cared for and covered \nup before the winter comes.\n  Many of New York's hospitals which cleared their beds in order to be \nready for the injured, many of whom never came because they lost their \nlives instead, suffered millions of dollars in losses.\n  The estimates for the economic loss, for the cost of debris removal, \nfor infrastructure repair and rebuilding, are in the range of $100 \nbillion.\n  During those days after the attacks we received a tremendous amount \nof support. Indeed, many people, many of my colleagues as well as \ncolleagues in the House, made the trip to Ground Zero because they \nunderstood what our Constitution says, which is that the United States \nshall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of \ngovernment, and shall protect each of them against invasion. When we \nwere invaded by those hijacked airplanes on September 11, our country \nresponded, not only out of the goodness of our hearts, out of a sense \nof empathy and sympathy, but because as a United States that is what is \ncalled for in our Constitution.\n  Many who came, including the President with whom I went to Ground \nZero, made a clear commitment. As the President said in the joint \nsession of Congress on September 21: We will rebuild New York City.\n  The Speaker of the House made a wonderful commitment to see New York \n``rise from the ashes that we saw today.''\n  Our leaders, Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, Congressman Gephardt, all \nmade that commitment. And OMB Director Mitch Daniels said the \nPresident's pledge of $20 billion is an absolute guarantee and it is \nlikely to be more. Of course, it will be more because the damage is so \nmuch more.\n  In those first days we had tremendous support, not only from our \nmajority leader but from the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd. Senator Schumer and I went to Senator Daschle and Senator \nByrd and to the President, told them what we had seen, made clear we \nwere going to face tremendous needs that we could not carry on our own, \nand secured a commitment for $20 billion to address those needs.\n  We all acknowledge that that $20 billion was a first installment. \nWith the invoices beginning to come in, it is quite clear that the cost \nwill be considerably higher. That is not something new for our Nation. \nIn natural disasters, and in terrorist attacks in the past, the Federal \nGovernment, which represents all of us, has stepped up to the plate to \ntake care of Americans.\n  The charts here illustrate the loss of life and damage from just a \nsampling of past disasters--Hurricane Hugo in 1989, the Northridge \nearthquake in California in 1994, the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, \nand the World Trade Center attack. If you look at the loss of life in \nthis first chart, you can see how the World Trade Center compares--the \nterrible, terrible commentary, to think that with all of the natural \ndisasters to which we are subject in our Nation that take the lives of \ninnocent people caught in a hurricane, or a tornado, or caught in an \nearthquake, or a flood, what happened at the World Trade Center is so \nmuch greater. The enormity of it, even today with the count at 3,553, \nis almost impossible for us to take in.\n  If you look at the estimated economic impact from major disasters--\nagain looking at Hurricane Hugo, Northridge, Oklahoma City, World Trade \nCenter--Hurricane Hugo resulted in losses exceeding $10 billion; the \nNorthridge earthquake had a total cost of $25 billion; in Oklahoma \nCity, the cost totaled $650 million; and, again, if we look at the \nWorld Trade Center with costs in excess of $100 billion, it is so much \ngreater than any tragedy, natural or man-caused tragedy, that we have \never encountered.\n  The Federal Government has always come to our rescue. If you look at \nthese examples--we could have taken others, but these are \nrepresentative--the return to the impacted area, the city or the State, \nhas always been in the range of 30 percent to 40 percent of economic \nloss.\n  With the money so far allocated by the White House from the $40 \nbillion emergency package enacted following the attacks, combined with \namounts earmarked for New York in the House appropriations bill, the \nfinancial capital of the world, a place that has so much meaning in our \nNation's history and the home of 8 million fellow Americans, is \nreceiving just 11 percent of the estimated losses suffered. Hurricane \nHugo received 38 percent; the Northridge earthquake in California, 39 \npercent; Oklahoma City, 41 percent; and, so far, even including the \nHouse appropriations, 11 percent for what New York has suffered. Even \nwith the full $20 billion committed by the President following the \nattacks, the Federal response would only be in the 20-percent range.\n  Sadly, while I, along with many of my colleagues, acknowledge that \nthis $20 billion would be just a first installment, even that money has \nbeen slow to come.\n  If we look at where we stand with respect to the summaries of loss of \nlife, the economic impact, and the estimated percentage of Federal \nresponse, we can see that New York is not getting the help that we not \nonly should expect but must count on.\n  New York needs that $20 billion which has been promised--not next \nyear but this year. The resources allocated thus far by the White House \nand the House appropriations bill leave so many immediate needs unmet.\n  If you look at what has already been provided, we are grateful indeed \nfor this help because already provided is $2 billion through FEMA for \nemergency response and debris removal; $500 million for SBA loans, \nmedical services, and dislocated worker assistance; $700 million to go \ninto a community development block grant; the House added to the money \nthat the administration had already provided an additional $8 billion \ndesperately needed, to increase the amount for debris removal by $4.4\n\n[[Page S12049]]\n\nbillion; to increase the amount for the community development block \ngrant by $1.8 billion; to put some money into workers compensation, \nwhich is desperately needed, of $175 million; and then creating an \nemergency employment clearinghouse to help all of the dislocated \nworkers who have, through no fault of their own, lost their jobs in the \naftermath of September 11.\n\n  The total is $11.2 billion, far short of the $20 billion that New \nYork was promised and that many of my colleagues and colleagues in the \nHouse and people in the administration certainly committed.\n  Let's look at what is left out. New York City agency costs, MTA \ninfrastructure damages, Port Authority costs, the utilities and \nexchange costs, hospital costs, university facilities that were \nimpacted, unemployment assistance, health care coverage for our \ndisplaced residents and businesses--all of those are zero.\n  If you look at where New York's $20 billion should be for ground \nzero, unfortunately, too many of our needs are on zero ground. All of \nthese needs that have been specified are not being taken into account \nby either the administration or the House appropriations process.\n  I commend my House colleagues from New York who fought hard, \nespecially the five members of the Appropriations Committee. They waged \na valiant battle, which actually resulted in increasing what the \nadministration was going to give us this year by $8 billion. It was \nagainst a tremendous amount of pressure that was placed on them.\n  There was lobbying against New York getting this necessary money from \nthe highest places in the administration, which I just for the life of \nme don't understand. I do not recall there being any argument for any \nlobbying against the needs of our residents and citizens who were \nimpacted by Oklahoma City or by the Northridge earthquake or by the \nhurricanes or floods or tornados that we have suffered. Yet the damage \nhere is so much greater.\n  People say, well, you know you can't use that money right now. That \nis just not true. We have specific requests that have been backed up by \neach of these particular items. We know we can sure use the \nunemployment assistance and the COBRA premium assistance because of all \nof our unemployed workers. We know the utilities have already spent \nover $1 billion getting telephone service and electricity reconnected. \nWe could go down each of these.\n  We are particularly concerned about our hospitals because so many of \nthem spent millions and millions of dollars and turned away revenues in \norder to be ready for injured victims who never came.\n  The Senate will begin its work on the appropriations for New York as \nwell as the stimulus package which includes some incentives that will \nhelp us to keep businesses and provide some assistance for residents so \nthey will go back downtown despite the fact that the fires are still \nburning. The air quality is subject to question. We will be able to \nprovide some additional help to our hospitals, we hope, as well as to \nbusinesses to stay in Manhattan and New York City.\n  The Senate is about to begin our process. But I wanted to take a few \nminutes on this day of commemoration as to what happened to New York \nand America 11 weeks ago to remind all of us about the cost of these \nattacks. New York City is a place noted for resilience. I think the \ncountry and the world have certainly seen that. It is a place that \nbounces back and keeps going. But one only has to be reminded of the \ntremendous damage that was inflicted to know we need some help. We are \nmore than willing to pick ourselves up and rebuild and do what needs to \nbe done to make this an even greater city in the 21st century than it \nhas been for 400 years, but now New York needs America's help. For \ndecade after decade after decade, New York has sent billions and \nbillions and billions of dollars right here to Washington. We run a \nbalance of payment deficit between New York and Washington that is $15 \nto $18 billion a year. But New York has a lot of wealthy people. \nFifteen percent of the State's revenues came right out of Ground Zero. \nSo we have paid for a lot of what needed to be paid for in our country \nthat did not directly affect New York.\n\n  We pay for commodities support systems so we have a good, safe food \nsupply, and our farmers are well prepared to produce the food we need. \nWe pay for our military even though we only have one major base left in \nour State. We pay for so many of the needs that people have all over \nAmerica. So as far as we are concerned, that is one of the prices we \npay for being so successful.\n  But now New York needs America's help. After having done so much for \nso long to make sure our country was strong and prepared for the \nfuture, we need some help to put New York back into business so that it \nwill continue as the capital of the global markets, as the capital of \nthe global entertainment and media world.\n  And so, Madam President, I ask that the administration reconsider its \nposition and be willing to provide us with the additional money that so \nmany of our people need and so many of our agencies require to get back \non their feet. I hope that everyone will remember that disparity of \ndamage and economic cost compared to the amount that has been provided \nfor us and make good on the President's promise of $20 billion. That \nwas one of the most emotional moments that I can certainly remember. To \nhave such a quick, open response from the President to meet the needs \nof New York was a shot in the arm and a great confidence booster when \nwe needed to hear it. What a shame it would be if that promise isn't \nfulfilled and if it isn't fulfilled in a timely manner this year so \npeople can put that money to work to rebuild their lives, to reclaim \ntheir jobs, to keep their businesses going, to repair the \ninfrastructure, and to make clear that New York is back and better than \never.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to take a few minutes to talk about \nwhere we are 11 weeks after this attack and to remind all of us that it \nwas an attack on America, and New York is counting on America's help.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in the wake of the September 11, 2001 \nattacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, our Armed Forces \nhave again been called upon to preserve our National Security. The \nSecretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \npreviously assured us that the military was ready for this latest \nendeavor. As demonstrated by the ongoing actions in Afghanistan, they \nwere right on target. As the senior member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and a retired Major General, I heartily concur that the world \nhas never seen a finer fighting force. However, as President Bush \ncautioned in his September 20 address to Congress, ``Americans should \nnot expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have \never seen.''\n  International terrorism is an enemy different than any we have faced \nbefore. President Bush has made it clear that ridding the world of this \nevil is of the utmost importance. He stated ``terror, unanswered, can \nnot only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of \nlegitimate governments.'' As we continue to wage ``civilization's \nfight'' we must ensure our National Security structure is prepared for \nan unpredictable future.\n  Providing for our Nation's security is the most important \nresponsibility of the United States Congress. The Constitution \ninstructs the Congress ``To\n\n[[Page S12050]]\n\nraise and support Armies. . . .'' and ``To provide and maintain a \nNavy.'' Since it is possible that we may be facing a lengthy campaign \nwhich potentially includes casualties, Senators and Representatives \nmust be prepared to take whatever actions are required to meet this \nsacred Constitutional directive. Although the Armed Forces have \nsucceeded in meeting this year's recruiting goals, there are no \nguarantees that tomorrow's youth will volunteer to the degree required \nto maintain the end strength goals of our Army, Navy, Air Force and \nMarine Corps.\n  Like all of you, I pray that we are able to swiftly bring to justice \nthose who perpetrated these heinous crimes of September 11. I hope this \ncan be done without incurring further loss of American lives and that \ndiplomacy and international law will succeed in eliminating the threat \nof terrorism in the future. Developments around the world following the \nattacks give us hope that some good may come from this tragedy. For \nexample, in Ireland officials have reported important progress in their \nnegotiations for arms decommissioning. Unfortunately, history \nillustrates that terrorism has existed for over two thousand years. \nCertain cowardly groups will inevitably resort to terror against \ninnocent people to compensate for their weakness and attempt to achieve \ntheir objectives. Accordingly, the President has rightly turned to our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  Several years ago, I argued that; ``we need to take a hard look to \nsee if it is time to reinstate compulsory national service.'' I \nbelieved then, as I do now, that the positive benefits to the Nation \nfrom compulsory service outweigh any of the conceivable drawbacks. \nHowever, the reality is that even today as we face the most serious \nthreat to our Nation since the Second World War, a national draft of \nsome sort is not being actively considered. The military is not eager \nto return to a conscript force, and others have not recognized the \nopportunity and value of asking Americans to provide public service as \na responsibility of citizenship.\n  Moreover, some have argued against the practicality of maintaining \nthe Selective Service System at all, claiming that its application is \nnow merely a part of the past. On the contrary, I believe that \nSelective Service is a national security insurance policy in place for \nthe scenarios we are facing today or may potentially face in the \nfuture. If, as the President has said, defeating the evil of \ninternational terrorism will require a substantial National effort, the \nUnited States must be prepared. In this case, the Selective Service \nSystem will be needed as an integral element for assuring our Nation's \nSecurity.\n  The recent attacks in New York and Washington, DC, and the subsequent \nanthrax cases have forever changed the way our leaders consider \nNational Security. In response, we must take appropriate actions. I \nagree with and support President Bush's assertion that nothing is to be \nruled out of consideration. Furthermore, I believe that operational \nreadiness or response to a major crisis may require the resources of \nthe Selective Service System. For this reason we must make absolutely \ncertain that this organization is at the highest level of readiness and \nability. Sadly, this is currently not the case.\n  Here are the facts. In 1985, the budget for the Selective Service \nSystem was $27.8 million. Today, the budget is $24.4 million, which in \nconstant dollars equals roughly $11 million. Today there are 150 fewer \ncivilians and 300 fewer military personnel associated with the \nSelective Service to carry out its missions. Finally, in 1985, if \ncalled upon to respond to a crisis, the Selective Service was capable \nof delivering personnel in 13 days. Today, we would have to wait 193 \ndays for the first person.\n  Some believe that 193 days is an acceptable amount of time. They \nargue that the likelihood of a crisis of significant magnitude to \nrequire a draft is simply too remote. Unfortunately, such thinking is \nnaive. Recently, the Senate Armed Service Committee held a hearing to \nexamine the results of an exercise called ``Dark Winter.'' The \nexercise, which took place at Andrews Air Force Base in June of this \nyear, simulated a possible United States reaction to the deliberate \nintroduction of smallpox in three states during the winter of 2002. The \nexercise highlighted a number of potential problems. Foremost among \nthose was that the medical system was quickly overwhelmed and that \npublic health is now a major national security issue.\n\n  We now know that bioterrorism is not merely a concept for a war game. \nThe Anthrax cases have highlighted the need to have a rapid and \nsubstantial response to medical crisis. In 1987, Congress correctly \ntasked the Selective Service System to develop a system to draft health \ncare personnel during a crisis. Driving Congressional concerns at that \ntime were the unpredictability of future threats and the availability \nof weapons of mass destruction, specifically, biological, chemical or \nnuclear. However, no additional resources have been provided since then \nand this program remains incomplete. No database exists to quickly \nmobilize health care practitioners in a crisis. Furthermore, we do not \nhave a validated centralized database of health care skills.\n  Again, there are those who believe if there were a crisis of the \n``Dark Winter'' type, the existing resources of the Federal government \nwould suffice. This is absolutely not the case. This past February, the \nhead of the Joint Task Force for Civil Support, Major General Bruce \nLawlor, expressed concern about the existing military medical system \nresponding to a homeland crisis. Specifically, he pointed out that the \nArmy medical system has been downsized by as much as 40 percent and \n``what remains is not organized for domestic support.'' Further, he \ncautioned that the current organization ``is not designed to deal with \na large number of civilian casualties that could occur in case of a \ndomestic terrorist event. Consequently, he recommended that the active \nduty military medical system be considered the ``last resort.''\n  I believe the Selective Service System is precisely the right tool to \nrespond to such a crisis. I envision an extremely capable and flexible \nSelective Service System. A system that can, when called upon, deliver \nmedical personnel for homeland defense in a matter of days and deliver \nthese professionals where they are needed in order to save lives. A \ntruly capable Selective Service System would be able to identify \nwhatever specific skill was required in order to guarantee the security \nof our Nation and quickly deliver appropriate individuals to where they \nwere needed. Such a system should require more than simply filling out \none card at age 18. In order to keep records current and databases \nuseful, one might be required to update information periodically. I am \nconfident that all Americans would be pleased and honored to do this \nsmall part for their Country.\n  Congress would also have to make some difficult decisions. First, \nwomen would also have to be considered eligible for the draft. One \ncould not envision a draft of Doctors and Nurses without calling upon \nthe many women who make up the majority of the health care profession. \nAlso, Congressional language prohibits any allocation of resources or \nimplementation of plans for a special skills draft such as I have just \ndescribed. Finally, an enhanced Selective Service System would clearly \nrequire greater funding and manpower.\n  I have previously asked my colleagues to debate this issue, and now \nis the time for action. I plan to introduce legislation which will \nstrike those provisions of the law which prohibit the Selective Service \nSystem from implementing a special skills draft. Additionally, I have \nasked the General Accounting Office to conduct a study to determine the \ncosts of a Selective Service System capable of performing the myriad of \ntasks I envision. Finally, In the next Session of this Congress, I will \nintroduce legislation which will require the registration of all \nAmericans for Selective Service at age 18.\n  The 21st Century is upon us and we must recognize that all Americans \nshare the responsibility to protect our homeland. I am confident that \nall Americans are eager to do their part.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12050-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12050-S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEATH OF SAMUEL L.

Woodring, a dedicated member of the community of North \nAugusta, SC, who passed away Thursday, November 15, 2001, at the age of \n75.\n  Sam Woodring will be remembered as one of North Augusta's most \nvisible\n\n[[Page S12051]]\n\nand spirited citizens. Perhaps best known as the owner and publisher of \nThe STAR newspaper, Mr. Woodring led the weekly newspaper for 45 years \nand was one of the city's most outspoken commentators. He worked \ntirelessly to inform the people of North Augusta and to remind the \ncommunity's public officials that their ultimate responsibility was to \nthe citizens who placed them in office. His work the The STAR newspaper \nearned him great respect within the journalism community of South \nCarolina and he won numerous awards from the South Carolina Press \nAssociation, including the prestigious Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award for \nCourage in Journalism.\n  However, the significant contributions Mr. Woodring made during his \nlifetime are not limited to his role with The STAR newspaper. He also \nserved the people of North Augusta as the president of the Chamber of \nCommerce, and he was a recipient of the Order of the Palmetto, South \nCarolina's highest civilian honor. In addition, he served his country \nwith honor and courage in the United States Army during World War II.\n  In conclusion, Sam Woodring was a man of character and integrity who \nwill be greatly missed by a wide circle of friends. He lived a life of \naccomplishment and made wonderful contributions to the community of \nNorth Augusta. He was a true American and a fine South Carolinian, and \nmy heartfelt thoughts and prayers remain with his family during their \ntime of mourning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12051-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12051-S12052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TITLE I TARGETING\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2058\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I am proud to have joined Senators \nLandrieu, Cochran, and DeWine in offering a truly historic amendment, \nwhich will for the first time specifically target new title I funding \ndirectly to our nation's poorest communities and schools. In doing so, \nthis amendment will help us move closer to realizing the original \npromise of title I and, more importantly, help us move closer to \nrealizing the promise we have made to give every child in America a \nhigh quality education.\n  The compromise reached today will provide $1 billion for the targeted \ngrant formula under title I, which was enacted into law by Congress in \n1994 but unfortunately has never actually been funded by appropriators. \nThis agreement ensures that no state, or local school district will \nlose any funds, but at the same time ensures those school districts \nwith the greatest need and with the greatest challenges will receive a \nsignificant boost in resources.\n  For example in my own State of Connecticut, this would mean our three \ncommunities with the greatest poverty and educational needs including \nBridgeport, Hartford, and New Haven would receive increases of 25, 35, \nand 31 percent, respectively, over their current funding levels for a \ncombined increase of over $12.4 million. That is $12 million more worth \nof educational services provided and high quality teachers hired to \nensure that title I children may achieve academic successes. I would \nalso mean substantial increases in investment for many other \ncommunities serving low-income students.\n\n  This agreement is by no means perfect. It leaves in place a \ndistribution system that remains badly diluted and seriously \ninefficient. However, it represents a dramatic change in policy, one \nthat Senator Landrieu and I, and the members of the Senate New Democrat \nCoalition have been fighting for for some time. And we are optimistic \nthat we can build on his breakthrough in the future to really put our \neducation money where our mouth is, and concentrate our resources and \nour resolve on lifting up our most disadvantaged schools.\n  Most immediately, this amendment makes a strong statement, \nacknowledging that title I is just not working as it was intended. The \noriginal goal of this critical program was to compensate for local \nfunding inequities within States and help level the playing field for \nlow-income children. But the truth is that this well-intentioned \nprogram is not nearly as focused on serving poor communities as it is \nperceived to be, leaving many poor children without any aid or hope \nwhatsoever.\n  As my colleagues know, Federal funds for poor children are currently \ndistributed through two grants, basic and concentration. In order to be \neligible for basic grants, which comprise the bulk of current title I \nfunds, local districts only need to have 10 school-age children from \nlow-income families, and these children must constitute only 2 percent \nof the total school-age population. Under the concentration grants, \ndistricts with a child poverty rate of 15 percent are eligible to \nreceive funding. As a result of these low threshold, title I funding \nhas been spread too thin and too wide. In fact, according to a 1999 CRS \nreport, title I grants are provided to approximately 90 percent of all \nlocal school districts, and 58 percent of all public schools. Even \nworse, because title I has not been close to fully funded, these \ndiluted formulas have left little aid available for many of the \ncountry's poorest students. CRS found that one fifth of all schools \nwith concentrations of poverty between 50 and 75 percent do not receive \na dime of title I funding.\n  In examining these inequities we also cannot ignore the growing \nimpact that concentration of poverty is having on the academic \nachievement of our nation's school children, particularly those who \nlive in disadvantaged communities. America's top 150 highest poverty \ncities have 40 percent of our all title I students. Students in these \ncities face many challenges, none greater that the pervasive poverty \nthat surrounds them. Studies show that, even after controlling for \nstudent's socioeconomic background, concentration of poverty has an \nimportant negative effect on student achievement.\n  For example, a U.S. Department of Education study found that ``The \nrelationship between family poverty status and student achievement is \nnot as strong as the relationship between school poverty concentrations \nand school achievement averages.'' An Urban Institute study of public-\nhousing students in Albuquerque, NM found that, after controlling for \nhome environment, if a poor child lived in a neighborhood and attended \nschool with 20 percent poverty rather than 80 percent poverty, that \nchild's standardized test scores were likely to improve by 13 \npercentage points.\n  Concentration of poverty does create a barrier to educational \nachievement, but that barrier is not impenetrable. University of \nTennessee's William Sanders found that high concentrations of poverty \ndo not on their own preclude or prevent schools from raising student \nachievement. Low-achieving students are often the first to gain, and \nexperience the greatest gains, from quality instruction. Unfortunately, \nonly a small share of our federal resources are getting to the \ndistricts most in need of critical funds, which limits the ability of \nthose districts to hire the most qualified instructors and provide the \nbest services.\n  The Federal Government alone cannot solve this grave inequity. We can \nonly supplement state and local funding, but cannot supplant those \nresources, and states and localities must do more to target their own \nresources. A recent Education Trust analysis of funding inequities \nreveals that school districts with the greatest numbers of poor \nchildren have less money to spend per student than districts with the \nfewest poor children. And a growing body of research shows, according \nto the Education Trust report, that additional dollars, if directed at \nthe most critical activities, can significantly raise the achievement \nof poor and minority students.\n  But the Federal Government can make a real and consequential \ncontribution, both in terms of leadership and of leverage of national \nresources, and this amendment aims to do both. As I have noted, it will \nsignificantly improve the targeting of Federal dollars. But it also \nincludes a second piece that will help reduce the inequities within \nstates. In addition to funding the targeted formula for the first time, \nthis amendment also funds the State finance and incentive grant formula \nfor the first time, a formula intended to reward states that have made \nreal strides in eliminating funding gaps with their own resources.\n  The amendment calls for channeling $500 million through this fourth \nformula, which is commonly known as the ``Effort and Equity'' formula. \nAlthough I share the concerns raised by many\n\n[[Page S12052]]\n\nthat the current design of this formula has substantial flaws and \nshould be modified so that truly meets its intended goal, I also share \nthe belief of my colleague from Iowa that we should do more at the \nfederal level to prompt states to better equalize their own funding.\n  That is why I am committed to seeing improvements made to the effort \nand equity formula through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nconference that is currently pending. I commend Senator Harkin for his \nwillingness to reexamine and overhaul this formula so that it better \ntargets funds within states to the districts with the highest \nconcentrations of poverty. And I look forward to working with him and \nwith a common focus to improve the fairness and the performance of \ntitle I. In achieving this goal, I believe that we can further work \ntogether to see even more funds appropriated to the targeted formula as \nthe appropriations process moves forward.\n  The compromise we have struck today might not be politically popular \nor perfect, but it is a great beginning and a way to draw our attention \nback to the original intent of the ESEA and the primary function of the \nFederal Government in education. It is a bold step forward, one that I \nbelieve that we can only enhance as the appropriations process as well \nas the ESEA conference moves forward, and I urge my colleagues to join \nus in supporting it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12052-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, on October 26th, I was deeply \nsaddened to learn of the passing of San Francisco Bay Area resident, \nDonald Tayer.\n  I have known Don Tayer and his family since the beginning of my \ncareer in public office, when I served as a Marin County supervisor and \nDon served as councilmember and mayor of the town of Tiburon. He was a \nmultitalented man who cared deeply for his community.\n  In addition to his work as a local elected official, Don Tayer forged \na distinguished legal career as a senior partner in the firm of Beeson, \nTayer & Bodine. For 25 years, he served as Executive Secretary in the \nSan Francisco office of the American Federation of Television and Radio \nArtists (AFTRA) and the Screen Actors Guild; he served as counsel to \nthe Actors' Equity Association and the American Guild of Musical \nArtists; he was the very first recipient of the Annual Bill Hillman \nAward, in recognition of his service to AFTRA's San Francisco local; \nand in August of this year he received AFTRA's National George Heller \nMemorial Gold Card--the highest honor bestowed by the union--for his \nmany and remarkable contributions.\n  He was an adjunct professor in the School of Urban and Public Affairs \nat Golden Gate University and former chairman of the Labor and \nEmployment Law Section of the Bar Association of San Francisco.\n  Don also somehow found the time to enjoy a rich cultural and \ncommunity life. He was president of the San Francisco Bay Area Chapter \nof the American Jewish Committee for 5 years, and continued to serve as \na member of the Committee's National Board of Governors. He was a \nrecipient of its Distinguished Service Award in 1987.\n  Don Tayer served on the Marin Arts Council and was both president and \na member of the Board of Directors of San Francisco's Center for the \nArts at Yerba Buena Gardens--where a memorial tribute will be held on \nDecember 1st.\n  I offer my condolences to Don's wonderful wife Joyce; to his children \nLisa and Marc and his four grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12052-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12052-S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN KAY AND HER ``THANKSGIVING PRAYER''\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a wonderful \nUtah woman, mother, and nationally published poet, Ms. Kathryn Kay. I \nalso want to relate a remarkable story concerning Ms. Kay and a poem \nshe wrote more than 60 years ago.\n  The poem, ``Thanksgiving Prayer,'' and the story behind it could have \nhappened today. Its message is timely, its impetus notable.\n  ``Thanksgiving Prayer'' was part of a book of poems If the Shoe Fits, \nwritten by Kathryn Kay. The book was sold out of a little book store in \nthe heart of Hollywood, California, where Ms. Kay was living and \nworking at the time. The book, and its ensuing poem, were read and \nwell-liked by many Hollywood stars, including the wife of the legendary \nveteran film actor, Hobart Boswarth.\n  At that time, the Nation was about to embark on a celebration \ncommemorating the sesquicentennial of the ratification of the Bill of \nRights. Mrs. Boswarth was serving as the Pacific Coast chairwoman of \nthe celebration, and in that role was able to give the poem, \n``Thanksgiving Prayer,'' to President Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. \nShe framed it in gold and presented it to Eleanor Roosevelt for her \nwork in improving the cultural arts. Kathryn also officially dedicated \nthe poem to her with ``sincere appreciation of her example, which \ncauses women of today to build for tomorrow.''\n  Mrs. Boswarth also arranged for this poem to be part of the Southern \nCalifornia Bill of Rights Celebration. She had the poem cast on a large \nbronze plaque, ready to be placed on Mt. Whitney, and read at the \nbeginning of the official week long celebration of the Bill of Rights, \nas proclaimed by President Roosevelt. The date for the ceremony was \nDecember 7, 1941.\n  As history so tragically reminds us, no celebrations took place that \nday; America was attacked, and we were at war.\n  The bronze plaque was melted down to make bullet casings for the war \nAmerica was battling. The heartfelt words of gratitude for America \nwould not be immortalized.\n  Ms. Kay went on to publish many more poems, and two more books of \npoetry. She returned to Utah, and continued her career in live \ntelevision and as a columnist for the Salt Lake Tribune. She married \nLee Pratt, and raised two wonderful sons.\n  But her love for poetry never dimmed. Kathryn Kay has been a driving \nforce for many, many years in Utah to promote poetry, from the high \nschool to the professional society level. She helped found the Utah \nState Poetry Society, and served two terms as its president. In fact, \nwell into her late 80s, she continued to edit the society's yearly \npublication.\n  Kathryn is 95 years old, still living in Utah, and still touching the \nlives of those around her. Perhaps her greatest tribute recently came \nfrom her son, Jim. He described his mother this way: ``She is a happy \nbreath of sunshine, who appreciates life and makes life better for \neveryone she meets.''\n  I pay tribute to Kathryn Kay today, and in turn, share with the \nNation the words penned by her so many years ago. As we all pause \nduring the next few weeks to celebrate the holiday season in our own \nway, I hope that the words of this poem written during another time of \nconflict and war will serve to strengthen us and remind us of the \nblessings we share as Americans.\n  The poem follows:\n\n                          Thanksgiving Prayer\n\n     God ev'ry year about this time,\n     according to routine,\n     I've bowed my head in the accepted way\n     and offered thanks, like some well synchronized machine.\n     that prayed because it was the time to pray.\n     But, God, this year is different, this year I seem to feel\n\n[[Page S12053]]\n\n     America's Thanksgiving is my own,\n     that in my nation's gratitude I have a part that's real\n     a part that until now I've never known.\n     And, God, this year a deep humility has filled my heart,\n     a newborn pride rings true throughout my soul\n     because I do belong, because I have and am a part,\n     a tiny part of one tremendous whole.\n     I think I know the feeling of those first Americans\n     who said, ``We must give thanks for this, our land.''\n     I cherish now the rights that are each woman's, ev'ry man's,\n     the rights I've just begun to understand.\n     This year my heart has learned what all Thanksgiving Days are \n           for,\n     true thankfulness at last I realize,\n     but, God, I'm sorry that it took the tragedy of war\n     in other lands to open up my eyes.\n     Again I bow my head but this time deep within me stirs\n     a mighty prayer, part of one vast design,\n     ``God, help me make America as proud that I am hers\n     as I am proud, and grateful she is mine!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12053-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING MONTANA'S STUDENTS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate \nscience students and science educators in my home State of Montana.\n  Last week, newly released scores from the 2000 National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, NAEP, often referred to as ``Our Nation's Report \nCard,'' placed Montana's eighth grade science students atop the Nation. \nOur fourth grade students earned the 2nd highest score among States.\n  These scores reflect the high quality science education that \nMontana's teachers provide. I am proud of the dedication and hard work \nof Montana's teachers and students; in our technologically-advanced, \ninformation-rich society, an understanding of scientific thought and an \nability to use scientific methods to make new discoveries will be \ncritical to improving our quality of life.\n  We often lament our public education system and the challenges it \nfaces. There can be no doubt that we can and must meet these \nchallenges. The scores that I commend today, however, demonstrate two \nthings. First, that dedicated, hard-working teachers are critical to \nthe success of the education we provide. Second, that our public \nschools deliver a quality education, despite the financial challenges \nthey face.\n  These scores also underscore the importance of investing in our \neducation system. In my State of Montana, teachers have demonstrated \nagain and again their teaching skills, their commitment to delivering a \nsolid education, and their ability to make creative improvements in \ntheir schools and classrooms, all this, despite low wages and ever-\nincreasing responsibilities. Unfortunately, this level of commitment \nwill not persevere if these trends continue.\n  We are at a crossroads at the Federal level with respect to education \npolicy and financial support. We know that a quality education is the \nkey to future success as individuals and as a nation. We need to make a \ncommitment to our students that the education they receive will provide \nthem with the knowledge and skills they need to be successful.\n  Let's match the commitment that Montana's teachers and students have \nmade to science education excellence with a commitment from the Federal \nlevel to provide the resources and support that they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12053-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12053-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/27/senate-section/article/S12053-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on November 16, 2001, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has agreed to the report of the committee on \nconference on the disagreeing vote of the two Houses on the amendment \nof the House to the bill (S. 1447) to improve aviation security, and \nfor other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolutions:\n\n       S.

A bill to require a transfer of jurisdiction for development \nof an Armed Forces recreation facility, Park City, Utah; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today I introduce a bill that requires a \ntransfer of jurisdiction for development of an Armed Forces recreation \nfacility in Park City, UT. This bill would enable the Secretary of the \nInterior to transfer, without reimbursement, a parcel of real property \nin Park City to the Secretary of the Air Force. The Air Force will use \nthis property as the location for an Armed Forces recreation facility.\n  I can think of no better use for this beautiful land in Utah than to \nsupport the military men and women who are serving our country. The \nbill I introduce today is the culmination of several months of careful \ncoordination between the Department of Interior and the Department of \nDefense to make certain that the transfer is accomplished within all \napplicable laws, policies, and regulations. Given the tremendous \nchallenges our nation's service members face at this time, I am proud \nto introduce this bill which will contribute much to the morale, \nrecreation, and welfare of our service members. I hope that we can \nsecure quick passage of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n\n  S. 1735. A bill to establish a National Commission on Threats to the \nHomeland and United States National Security; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, today I am pleased to join Senator Lugar  \nin introducing legislation to create the National Commission on Threats \nto the Homeland and United States National Security.\n  Two months ago, in barbaric attacks in New York and Washington that \nwe will never forget, the world changed before our eyes. In an instant, \nthe fight against terrorism became our top national security priority. \nThat new reality requires us to undertake a thorough review of our \nnational security priorities. That effort is underway across the \nexecutive branch and in several committees of Congress. President Bush \nacted decisively to create the Office of Homeland Security and in \nnaming Governor Ridge to be its head. Congress acted quickly to tighten \naviation security and to give federal law enforcement new tools to \ncounter terrorism.\n  These measures are just initial steps in what will surely be a major \nreorientation of the ship of state. As we begin to reorient our \ngovernment, I believe we must engage in a thorough assessment of the \nrange of threats that we face and the priorities which we should accord \nsuch threats in our national security strategy.\n  Terrorism is undoubtedly the major threat to the United States. In \nthat regard, we must have a full understanding of the types of \nterrorist threats we face and of their relative probability. This week, \nthe continuous reports of anthrax being discovered in various parts of \nthe country, including here in the Senate, have focused the country on \nthe threat of bioterrorism.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the only threat we face. Terrorists proved \ntheir deadly ability to turn airplanes into weapons of mass \ndestruction. They have used truck and car bombs in the past. And we \nknow that terrorist organizations are seeking materials necessary for \nthe production of chemical or nuclear weapons. What we need to know is \nthe priority we should accord those threats. That is the purpose of \nthis proposed commission.\n  There are, to be sure, other threats that remain to our territory and \nto our national security interests. Russian weapons of mass destruction \nstockpiles and expertise pose the risk of accidental war or of \nproliferation to rogue states and terrorist groups. Ballistic missiles \nin developing countries can threaten U.S. forces overseas and could \nsomeday threaten our homeland. And international narcotics trafficking \ncontinues to threaten many countries, including ours. Terrorism is not \nthe only threat. But after September 11 it is clearly the preeminent \nthreat.\n  The proposed National Commission on Threats to the Homeland and \nUnited States National Security will not seek to reinvent the wheel. \nRather, it would build on the work of several recent blue-ribbon \ncommissions which have assessed various threats, both collectively and \nindividually, to U.S. national security.\n  In seeking the creation of this new commission, neither Senator Lugar \n nor I wish to discredit this earlier work and the ideas that flowed \nfrom it. Instead, we seek to use that work as a foundation in \nconstructing a comprehensive threat assessment and a resulting U.S. \nnational security strategy. It is therefore instructive to quickly \nreview the major findings of some of these earlier commissions and \nhearings.\n  Perhaps the best-known is the U.S. Commission on National Security/\n21st\n\n[[Page S12057]]\n\nCentury, better known as the Hart-Rudman Commission after its two \ncochairs, former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman. In its final \nreport, issued in 2001, the Hart-Rudman Commission offered a chilling \nprediction borne out only months later: ``States, terrorists, and other \ndisaffected groups will acquire weapons of mass destruction and mass \ndisruption, and some will use them. Americans will likely die on \nAmerican soil, possibly in large numbers.'' The Hart-Rudman Commission \nurged making the security of the American homeland the primary national \nsecurity mission of the U.S. government and called for the creation of \na National Homeland Security Agency to coordinate these efforts.\n  Two commissions have focused on the specific threat of international \nterrorism and dealing with the consequences of a terrorist attack with \na weapon of mass destruction, WMD.\n  The National Commission on Terrorism, chaired by Ambassador L. Paul \nBremer, recommended a series of measures to expand the authorities of \nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement, steps now under consideration in \nthe anti-terrorism legislation before Congress. It also urged the \nUnited States to use all the instruments at its disposal, diplomatic, \nfinancial, economic, and military, in targeting states that sponsor \ninternational terrorism.\n  The Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for \nTerrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction, better known as the \nGilmore Commission after its chair, Virginia Governor James Gilmore, \nfocused on the need to develop a national strategy of domestic \npreparedness to respond to any act of WMD terrorism. This commission \nalso called for the creation of a central office within the White House \nto coordinate federal efforts, which closely resembles what President \nBush has decided to do in appointing Governor Ridge to a new ``homeland \nczar'' position.\n  The Russia Task Force of the Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board, \nbetter known as ``the Baker-Cutler Task Force'' after its co-chairs, \nformer Senator Howard Baker and former White House Counsel Lloyd \nCutler, looked at the particular threat posed by unsecured nuclear \nweapons and fissile material in the former Soviet Union. This task \nforce declared the deteriorating situation as ``the most urgent unmet \nnational security threat facing the United States today'' and called \nfor spending approximately $30 billion over the next 8 to 10 years to \nadequately secure these weapons and related materials.\n  Finally, with the emergence of several anthrax cases in several \nlocations in the United States, the threat has become all too real. The \nCommittee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on this subject the week \nbefore the September 11 attacks. Former Senator Sam Nunn, now heading \nthe Nuclear Threat Initiative, Dr. D.A. Henderson, the architect of the \ninternational campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s, and other \nexperts testified on the nature of the threat and what we can do in \nresponse. As they made clear, a mass destruction bioterrorism attack is \na low-probability event with high consequences. The right answer is not \npanic, but rather the foresight to implement a set of commonsense \nmeasures to strengthen our public health system, including our \nemergency care capabilities and our vaccine stockpiles, to handle a \nbioterrorist attack if and when it occurs.\n  The Commission that we envision would, I repeat, build on the fine \nwork done by the foregoing panels. It would assess the current threat, \nin light of the attacks on September 11, and in light of the \nassessments and analyses performed by government agencies and the \npanels I have just discussed. The commission would be a small group, \njust six distinguished Americans with experience at the highest levels \nof national security, law enforcement, and public safety. It is my hope \nthat the commissioners chosen for this task would include former \ncabinet secretaries, and even former Presidents.\n  The bill we introduce requires two reports, an interim report to be \nproduced within 180 days of enactment of the legislation and a final \nreport to be produced by September 11, 2002, one year after the attacks \non our country. The reports should provide a roadmap for our national \nsecurity strategy, what the major threats are, the likelihood such \nthreats will result in attacks on the United States, the potential \ndamage to the United States or U.S. interests, and the current U.S. \ncapabilities to counter and respond to such threats. From this \nassessment we can build a national security strategy for the coming \ndecades.\n  I appreciate the support and assistance of the Senator from Indiana \nin developing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection,the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1735\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
