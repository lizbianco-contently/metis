We listen in on Your \nconversation with the Psalmist when he was beset with trouble. We hear \nYour gracious invitation: ``Call on Me in the day of trouble; I will \ndeliver you, and you shall glorify Me.''--Psalm 50:15. We respond with \nthe Psalmist, ``Hear my prayer, O Lord. Do not hide Your face from me \nin the day of trouble; incline Your ear to me . . . though I walk in \nthe midst of trouble, You will revive me.''--Psalms 102:1; 138:7.\n  Thank You, Lord, for Your reviving power. You revive us with \nconvictions which cannot be compromised: You are our refuge and our \nstrength; You have blessed our Nation through our history; You will \nhelp us be victorious over the evil of terrorism. We also are revived \nby the replenishing of our confidence: You will save us through our \npresent crisis; we need not fear. We feel Your Spirit surging into our \nsouls: anxiety is replaced by serene security, frustration by faith, \ntiredness with temerity, caution with courage. And so we say with the \nPsalmist, ``In the day when I cried out, You answered me, and made me \nbold with strength in my soul.''--Psalm 138:3.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3061, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3061) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2002, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader for \nhis statement about scheduling. It is my hope and it is my \nrecommendation that we proceed very promptly with this bill, with the \npossibility of concluding it before the end of business today, or \ncertainly no later then midday tomorrow.\n  There has been ample time for Senators to consider amendments to this \nlegislation. Last year, this bill was reported out of committee on June \n30 and floor action was concluded on July 27, and because of scheduling \nthis year, it has come at a later time, understandably. Senators have \nhad an opportunity to consider whatever amendments they want to offer. \nThere is real concern as to what may happen in the remainder of the \nlegislative season, and there has been some talk and most of us, if not \nall of us, do not want to see a continuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nbill before the Senate today contains $123.1 billion in discretionary \nspending, the full amount of the subcommittee's budget authority \nallocation under section 302(b) of the Budget Act. This amount \nrepresents an increase of $11.4 billion over the FY'01 freeze level. \nThe bill is within its outlay allocation of $107.7 billion. In \naddition, $300 million in emergency spending is also included for the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  At this time, I want to take this opportunity to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, the chairman of the \ncommittee, for his hard work in bringing this bill through the \ncommittee and on to the floor for full consideration by all Senators.\n  The programs funded within the subcommittee's jurisdiction provide \nresources to improve the public health and strengthen biomedical \nresearch, assure a quality education for America's children, and offer \nopportunities for individuals seeking to improve job skills. I'd like \nto mention several important accomplishments of this bill.\n  Few things are more important than a person's health and few things \nare more feared than ill health. Medical research into understanding, \npreventing, and treating the disorders that afflict men, women and \nchildren in our society is the best means we have for protecting our \nhealth and combating disease.\n  Since January 2001, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee has held 12 hearings \non medical research issues. We have heard testimony from NIH Institute \nDirectors, medical experts from across the United States, patients, \nfamily members, and advocates asking for increased biomedical research \nfunding to find the causes and cures for diseases such as Alzheimer's \nand Parkinson's disease, ALS, AIDS, cancer, diabetes, muscular \ndystrophy, multiple sclerosis, heart disease and many other serious \nhealth disorders. The bill before the Senate contains $23.7 billion for \nthe National Institutes of Health, the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment. The $3.4 billion increase over the FY 2001 appropriation \nwill support medical research that is being conducted at institutions \nthroughout the country. This increase will continue the effort to \ndouble NIH by FY 2003. These funds will be critical in catalyzing \nscientific discoveries that will lead to new treatments and cures for a \nwhole host of diseases.\n  The use of human embryonic stem cells for research has become an \nissue that is consistently debated in the press, on radio and \ntelevision, and amongst people around the world. The fact that in fewer \nthan 3 years, stem cell research has gone from an avant garde interest \nof a few select scientists to a common, contemporary issue reveals the \nimmense potential that stem cells offer ailing patients.\n  Yet coming to terms with the inherent moral and ethical issues of \nstem cell research is difficult. We struggle with the balance of our \nrespect for human life against the compassion we have for those who \nsuffer from diseases that could be cured by stem cells. On August 9, \n2001, President Bush recounted his own struggle with this volatile \nissue. The President made a diligent, valiant effort to reach an accord \nthat would satisfy all sides.\n  I believe that limits on the use of Federal research money to only \nexisting stem cell lines, will place barriers in the path of medical \nprogress. We are just beginning to understand which researchers and \ncompanies throughout the world have ownership of these existing stem \ncell lines and we have little knowledge of their property rights, plans \nto share or license the use of those lines to other researchers, or \nwhether the donors of those embryos have given the requisite informed \nconsent. We know little about the quality of those existing stem cell \nlines, although up to one-third of them may be so fragile that they \nwill be of no use to any researcher. We do not know how future \ntherapies will be developed for our genetically diverse population from \nonly a few select genetic lines. Perhaps most importantly, we are now \nlearning that the existing stem cell lines may be inappropriate for \nproducing any human therapies because of their exposure to mouse feeder \ncells while growing in culture.\n\n  Since 1998, the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation has held nine hearings to explore the potential medical \nbenefits of stem cell research. The subcommittee has heard more than 21 \nhours of testimony from some of the most preeminent scientists in the \nworld who have described how stem cells have the potential to cure the \nmost common diseases afflicting Americans today. We have heard from \nethicists who have discussed the moral and social implications of \npursuing this line of research. We have listened to company executives \nwho recount their ideas and hopes for delivering therapies to patients \nand patent attorneys discussing intellectual property rights. But the \nmost striking and most compelling testimony has been from patients who \nsuffer from disease and disabilities that destroy lives.\n  The Labor-HHS and Education bill before the Senate adds a new \nprovision to the existing embryo ban (carried in the bill since FY'96). \nThis language permits Federal dollars to be used--at the discretion of \nthe President--for research on embryonic stem cells from embryos that \nmeet the following criteria: created in excess of clinical need, will \notherwise be discarded, and are donated with the written consent of the \nprogenitors. This language for the first time, states that Federal \ndollars may be used for embryonic stem cell research.\n  Since September 11, 2001, Americans have become acutely aware that \nour enemies will use any means to murder and maim large numbers of U.S. \ncivilians. The use of biological agents is no longer a threat--it is a \nreality. The deaths of 3 individuals from inhalational anthrax and the \ninfection of others with the cutaneous form of the disease has made all \nof us aware of the need to act quickly to provide the funds needed for \nprevention and treatment needs. The committee has included $338 million \nto coordinate state and local readiness, stockpile appropriate \npharmaceuticals, and build our public health infrastructure to respond \nto any act of bioterrorism. The anthrax found in Senator Daschle's \noffice and in the House and Senate mail rooms, at postal facilities in \nNew Jersey and the District of Columbia and surrounding areas, in news \nand other media facilities proves that we must try and prevent, detect \nand quickly respond to any further acts of bioterrorism. Additional \ndollars to address bioterrorism needs will be considered during \nsupplemental appropriations bills in November.\n  For the first time, the committee has included $1 million for a \npublic awareness campaign to educate Americans about the existence of \nspare embryos and adoption options. During stem cell hearings, we were \nmade aware that\n\n[[Page S11155]]\n\nthere are 100,000 spare frozen embryos stored in in-vitro fertilization \nclinics throughout the United States. Many infertile couples could \nchoose to adopt and implant such embryos if they were aware of that \noption.\n  Since 1999, $2.9 billion has been devoted to programs to assist \ncommunities in preventing youth violence. This year the committee has \nincluded $1.542 billion to continue to address youth violence in a \ncomprehensive and coordinating manner throughout the Federal \nGovernment. Funds will be used to improve research, prevention, \neducation, and treatment strategies to identify and combat youth \nviolence.\n  To enable all children to develop and function at their highest \npotential, the bill included $6.6 billion for the Head Start Program, \nan increase of $400 million over last year's appropriation. This \nincrease will provide services to 916,000 children in 49,420 classrooms \nacross the Nation.\n  To help provide primary health care services to the medically \nindigent and underserved populations in rural and urban areas, the bill \ncontains $1.34 billion for community health centers. This amount \npresents an increase of $175.1 million over the FY 2001 appropriation. \nThese centers provide health care to nearly 12 million low-income \npatients, many of whom are uninsured.\n  Again this year, the committee has placed a very high priority on \nwomen's health. The bill before the Senate provides $818.7 million for \nprograms specifically addressing the health needs of women. Included in \nthis amount is $27.4 million for the Public Health Service, Office of \nWomen's Health, an increase of $6.1 million over last year's funding \nlevel to continue and expand programs to develop model health care \nservices for women, provide monies for a comprehensive review of the \nimpact of heart disease on women, and to launch an osteoporosis public \neducation campaign aimed at teenagers. Also included is $266 million \nfor family planning programs; $124.2 million to support the programs \nthat provide assistance to women who have been victims of abuse and to \ninitiate and expand domestic violence prevention programs to begin; \n$167.2 million for sexually transmitted diseases; $195 million for \nbreast and cervical cancer screening; and $39 million for the Office of \nResearch on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n  In FY'01, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee held several hearings to explore \nthe factors leading to medical errors and received testimony from \nfamily members and patients detailing their experiences with medical \nmistakes. The Institute of Medicine also gave testimony and outlined \nfindings from their recent report which indicated that 98,000 deaths \noccur each year because of medical errors and these deaths may cost up \nto $29 billion in excess health care expenditures and lost productivity \neach year. The bill before the Senate contains $60 million to determine \nways to reduce medical errors, an increase of $10 million over the \nFY'01 appropriation.\n  The bill maintains $2 billion for the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program. The amount, when combined with the additional $300 \nmillion in emergency appropriations, will provide a total of $2.3 \nbillion for the LIHEAP Program in FY'02. LIHEAP is the key energy \nassistance program for low income families in Pennsylvania and in other \ncold weather states throughout the Nation. Funding support grants to \nStates to deliver critical assistance to low income households to help \nmeet higher energy costs.\n  For programs serving the elderly, the bill before the Senate \nrecommends $2.4 billion. Included is: $366 million for supportive \nservices and senior centers; $561 million for congregate and home-\ndelivered nutrition services; and $202.5 million for the national \nsenior volunteer corps; $450 million for the community service \nemployment program which provides part-time employment opportunities \nfor low-income elderly. Also, the bill provides $909.1 million for the \nNational Institute on Aging for research into the causes and cures of \nAlzheimer's disease and other aging related disorders; funds to \ncontinue geriatric education centers; and the Medicare insurance \ncounseling program.\n\n  The bill includes $5.1 billion for AIDS research, prevention and \nservices. Included in this amount is $1.833 billion for Ryan White \nprograms, an increase of $75.4 million; $781.2 million for AIDS \nprevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control; and $2.375 \nbillion for research at the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases.\n  To enhance this Nation's investment in education, the bill before the \nSenate contains $48.5 billion in discretionary education funds, an \nincrease of $6.3 billion over the FY'01 freeze level, and $4 billion \nmore than the President's budget request.\n  For programs to educate disadvantage children, the bill recommends \n$11.8 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion over last year's level. The \nbill also includes $200 million for the Even Start program to provide \neducational services to low-income children and their families; $36 \nmillion for the education of homeless children, and $30 million for \nmigrant education programs.\n  For school improvement programs, the bill includes $8.7 billion, an \nincrease of $1.6 billion over the FY'01 appropriation. Within this \namount, $3.039 billion will be used for a new state grant program for \nimproving teacher quality. To assist States and local education \nagencies in developing education reform initiatives, the bill includes \n$410 million. Also included is $925 million for grants to local \neducation agencies for emergency school renovation and repair \nactivities. The committee recommendation includes $712.1 million for \neducational technology state grants, as authorized under the Senate-\npassed version of H.R. 1. This program consolidates the four current \neducational technology programs.\n  For the 21st century After School Program, the bill provides $1 \nbillion, an increase of $154.4 million over last year's level. This \nprogram supports rural and inner-city public elementary and secondary \nschools that provide extended learning opportunities and offer \nrecreational, health, and other social services programs. The bill also \nincludes language to permit funds to be provided to community-based \norganizations.\n  For Impact Aid programs, the bill includes $1.130 billion, an \nincrease of $137.1 million over the 2000 appropriation. Included in the \nrecommendation is: $50 million for payments for children with \ndisabilities; $954 million for basic support payments, an increase of \n$72 million; $68 million for construction and $50.5 million for \npayments for Federal property.\n  The bill provides $516 million to assist in the education of \nimmigrant and limited-English proficient students. This recommendation \nis an increase of $56 million over the 2001 appropriation.\n  The $8.4 billion provided in the bill will help local educational \nagencies meet the requirement that all children with disabilities have \naccess to a free, appropriate public education, and all infants and \ntoddlers with disabilities have access to early intervention services. \nThe $999.6 million increase over the FY'01 appropriation will serve an \nestimated 6.5 million children age 3-21, at a cost of $1,133 per child. \nWhile also supporting 612,700 preschoolers at a cost of $637 per child.\n  To improve post-secondary education opportunities for low-income \nfirst-generation college students, the committee recommendation \nprovides $805 million for the TRIO program, a $75 million increase over \nthe 2001 appropriation. These additional funds will assist in more \nintensive outreach and support services for low income youth.\n  For student aid programs, the bill provides $12.3 billion, an \nincrease of $1.6 billion over last year's amount. Pell grants, the \ncornerstone of student financial aid, have been increased by $250 for a \nmaximum grant of $4,000. The supplemental educational opportunity \ngrants program has also been increased by $22.1 million, the work study \nprogram is held at the FY'01 level and the Perkins loans programs is \nincreased by $15 million.\n  In this Nation, we know all too well that unemployment wastes \nvaluable human talent and potential, and ultimately weakens our \neconomy. The bill before us today provides $5.5 billion for job \ntraining programs, $80.8 million over the 2001 level. Also included is \n$1.4 billion for Job Corps programs; $950 million for adult training; \nand $1.549 billion for retraining dislocated workers and $1.127 billion \nfor youth training.\n  The bill provides $1.422 billion for worker protection programs, an \nincrease of $63.8 million above the 2001\n\n[[Page S11156]]\n\nappropriation. While progress has been made in this area, there are \nstill far too many work-related injuries and illnesses. The funds \nprovided will continue the programs that inspect business and industry, \nassist employers in weeding out occupational hazards and protect \nworkers' pay and pensions.\n  The bill includes $395 million for the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting, an increase of $30 million over the FY'2003 \nappropriation. In addition to the core amount provided for CPB, the \nCommittee recommends $25 million for the conversion to digital \nbroadcasting.\n  There are many other notable accomplishments in this bill, but for \nsake of time, I have mentioned just several of the key highlights, so \nthat the Nation may grasp the scope and importance of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator Harkin and his staff and \nthe other Senators on the subcommittee for their cooperation.\n  This bill has very substantial additional funding for education--some \n$4 billion more than last year. It has very considerable additional \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health, which funding has been a \npriority, on which the distinguished chairman, Senator Harkin, and I \nhave worked during his chairmanship in the early 1990s and mine for \n6\\1/2\\ years, beginning in 1995 through earlier this year. If there is \na continuing resolution, those increases will not be realized.\n  I think there is also an appropriate point of emphasis with what is \nhappening in the country. I believe other Senators share my belief that \nthere is a real need for us to spend time in our States with our \nconstituents, telling them what is happening in the world and telling \nthem what is happening in America. We all know that all of this work \nshould have been finished by September 30. Here we are on October 30.\n  So I urge my colleagues, in furtherance of what the distinguished \nActing majority leader has said, to let us know what the amendments are \nand offer to bring them. If we are not accorded that kind of \nconsideration, it is my hope we will move to the third reading so that \nwe can go to conference.\n  This is not going to be an easy bill to conference. Unless we proceed \nwith dispatch, we will not have the benefit of these very substantial \nincreases in funding.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro \ntempore. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken with the managers of the bill, \nand being a member of the committee, I have been so impressed with the \nhearings these two Senators have held over the last several years. It \ndoes not matter who is the chairman of the subcommittee; they have done \noutstanding work. They are always on the cutting edge of what is going \non in the country. So I hope people will realize what an important bill \nthis is.\n  I am going to work to have a unanimous consent agreement in order \nthat by 4 o'clock this afternoon there will be a filing deadline for \nfirst-degree amendments on this bill. We will work on that while the \nmanagers are giving their opening statements.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank our assistant majority leader for \nhis efforts in this regard. I thank him for all of his support through \nthe years, and especially this year, for bringing this bill before the \nSenate. It is an important bill.\n  I will give my opening statement in a moment. I certainly hope we are \nable to reach some agreement on the filing of amendments sometime this \nafternoon. This bill has been laid to the side for a long time. People \nhave known it was going to come up. I hope we can get the amendments \nfiled. I hope we can dispense with this bill, if not today, as was \nsaid, early tomorrow. There is no reason we cannot finish the bill \ntoday. I hope we can move in that direction. I thank Senator Reid for \nhis efforts in this regard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2017\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send a substitute amendment to the desk, \nwhich is the text of the Senate-committee-reported bill, and ask the \nclerk to report it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 2017.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nthat the amendment be considered as original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendment; and that no points of order be considered waived by \nvirtue of this agreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, I am very pleased to bring before the Senate the 2002 \nappropriations bill for the Department of Labor, Department of Health \nand Human Services, Department of Education, and related agencies.\n  I am also pleased to report that the bill was approved on a unanimous \nbipartisan vote on October 11.\n  I begin by thanking my good friend and partner in this effort, \nSenator Specter, and his excellent staff for working with me and my \nstaff to put together this bill on a bipartisan basis. This is always \none of the most difficult bills to put together, and it is certainly \none of the most important.\n  Our Nation's health and the strength of our tomorrow are shaped by \nthe critical health, education, and labor investments made by this \nbill.\n  I also thank Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for their steadfast \nsupport and guidance throughout the year and for their good work in \nhelping us get an enhanced allocation.\n  The bill we are putting forward today obviously is not perfect, not \nby a long shot, but given the limited resources with which we had to \nwork, I think it is a very strong bill and one I can strongly \nrecommend.\n  As we have done throughout our over 10-year partnership working on \nthis subcommittee, the fiscal year 2002 bill is truly the product of \nbipartisan negotiation as Senator Specter and I have worked closely \ntogether to shape it. We have done our best to accommodate the \nliterally thousands of requests we have received from our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I will highlight some of the main features of the \nproposal before us.\n  First, it takes a number of important steps to improve the quality, \naffordability, and accessibility of health care in America. By \nproviding a record $3.4 billion increase to medical research funded by \nthe National Institutes of Health, we are keeping our 5-year commitment \nto double our national investment in potential medical breakthroughs. \nThis action holds the hope of improving the lives of millions plagued \nby killers such as Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's, diabetes, \nosteoporosis, spinal cord injuries, and so many others.\n  The bill also makes a major improvement in access to affordable \nhealth care by providing a record $175 million increase to community \nhealth centers and major increases in critical prevention activities \nsuch as cancer and heart disease screening. These changes are \npreventive in nature and will save lives and improve health.\n  The bill also has a major new effort to improve health care in our \nrural areas and small towns. We will bring more doctors and nurses and \nother health professionals to places they are needed by expanding the \nNational Health Service Corps and the Nurse Loan Repayment Program. Our \nstruggling rural hospitals are given help to\n\n[[Page S11157]]\n\ndeal with Medicare paperwork burdens and help to expand into other \nactivities such as adult daycare.\n  As a Senator from Iowa and as cochair of the Senate Rural Health \nCaucus, I know how sorely these changes are needed.\n  Education continues to be a top priority of this subcommittee, and \nwhile our bill provides substantial new investments in quality \neducation, it is my strong hope and expectation that more resources \nwill be provided when we complete action on the education reform bill \nnow in conference.\n  I also sit on that conference committee, led by our distinguished \nchairman, Senator Kennedy. That bill, which is now in conference, \ncontains an amendment that was offered by Senator Hagel and me that the \nSenate approved without one dissenting vote, that we will finally meet \nour commitment to fully fund special education. We need that provision \nto do right by our schools and our local property tax payers.\n\n  That amendment in that bill--I am talking not about the bill before \nus, but the education reform bill that is in conference--the amendment \nSenator Hagel and I offered, would over the next several years increase \nfrom the present level of 15 percent to 40 percent the amount the \nFederal Government will put into special education on an average-cost-\nper-pupil basis.\n  Twenty-five years ago when we passed the special education bill, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, we stated at that time \nthat the goal of the Federal Government was to provide 40 percent of \nthe average-per-pupil cost. That was 25, actually 26, years ago, and we \nare now at 15 percent.\n  Special education continues to be one of the highest costs to our \nlocal school districts, one that is burdening our local school systems \nand our local property tax payers. Yet the Federal Government has not \nlived up to its commitment. So in that education bill, Senator Hagel \nand I offered an amendment to boost that funding. It is now in \nconference, and hopefully we will keep that provision in the bill.\n  That will, of course, free up some money for other parts of education \nwhich we did not have in our bill and were unable to meet all the \nneeds.\n  I especially want to say with the downturn in the economy, I believe \nwe are going to need more money especially for title I programs in \neducation for the next year, and beyond that depends on what happens to \nthe economy. Certainly we are going to need it for the next year.\n  Again, I am hopeful the education bill that is in conference will \ncontinue; that the House will recede to the Senate and will keep that \nmoney for special education.\n  I am also very pleased to report this bill before us today contains \nnearly $1 billion to make needed repairs to our schools, including \nnecessary security enhancements. Last year, this subcommittee, under \nthe leadership of Senator Specter, started an initiative to help our \nlocal school districts make their schools safe. It has been extremely \npopular in the States, and in a time of economic downturn, this job-\ncreating initiative is even more urgent and it should be continued.\n  I will, at some appropriate point, point out on a chart how much all \nof the various States have received in the last year to make needed \nrepairs, to bring their schools up to fire and safety code \nrequirements, and to make needed security enhancements for their \nschools. As I said, it has been very helpful to the States. The \nGovernors all support it; the school boards support it; and the parent-\nteacher associations. There is no one who is opposed to it.\n  So we put the money back in this year to keep it going. With all of \nthe talk about stimulus and stimulus package, and looking at the \nstimulus package the House sent us with all of the tax breaks for huge \ncorporations, it seems to me the best stimulus we could provide would \nbe to send money directly to our communities so they could repair and \nmodernize their schools. We get a couple bangs for the buck on that. We \nput people to work; it stimulates local economies, and of course that \nhas a backup effect because there will be suppliers of different \nequipment, and it provides for all kinds of multiplier effects in the \neconomy.\n  The second thing we get when we finish is we get something of lasting \nvalue for our country: better schools. So I am hopeful this program \nwill be continued.\n  This bill also makes college more affordable for millions of young \npeople by increasing the Pell grant maximum to $4,000 and increasing \nthe TRIO by $75 million, which brings that program's total funding to \n$805 million.\n  The bill also makes an important downpayment on needed improvements \nto elementary and secondary education. It increases funding for title I \nby $1.4 billion, to a total of $10.2 billion. It increases afterschool \nprograms by $154 million, which brings that to a total of about $1 \nbillion. It increases funding for teacher quality by over $900 million \nfor a total of just over $3 billion for teacher quality.\n  This bill also funds crucial worker protection and job training \nefforts. I am pleased we have been able to improve our commitment to \nworker training and safety in this bill. We have also funded our State \nunemployment offices to handle the increased caseload they will face \nwith the economic downturn.\n  Coming from a State with one of the highest percentages of senior \ncitizens in the Nation, I am keenly aware of the many needs of our \nNation's seniors. Accordingly, our bill contains a substantial \ninitiative to improve services to our Nation's elderly. We will allow \nmany more homebound seniors to receive Meals on Wheels. This is a very \ngood, low-cost program that helps the elderly and disabled in small \ntowns and urban centers all over our country. For many of the seniors \nit is their only hot meal of the day and often the person who delivers \nthe meal is the only visitor they have during the entire day.\n  This bill also provides a major increase in services such as adult \ndaycare, to help seniors remain in their own homes and to give their \nloved ones needed respite and support care.\n  Finally, our subcommittee has held a series of hearings on the need \nto better protect Americans from the threat of bioterrorism, which, of \ncourse, is on so many of our minds today, especially those of us who \nhave offices in the Hart Building, knowing we are not going to be able \nto get our staffs back in the building for, I guess, a few more weeks, \nfrom what I understand. It is a concern of Americans all over America \nabout the mail they receive and whether they are going to be exposed, \nwhether or not our food is going to be safe. So bioterrorism is \nsomething we have to address.\n\n  This Friday, our subcommittee will be having a hearing on the \npotential threat of smallpox and what we are doing and what more we \nneed to do to protect our country against this possible terrorist \nthreat.\n  While the bill before us contains a modest level of funding to \naddress this need of bioterrorism, a much larger package will be \nincluded in the antiterrorism supplemental appropriations bill. We have \ndeveloped a detailed $2.3 billion plan that would beef up our public \nhealth system, boost our vaccine stockpiles, help hospitals respond to \npotential surges, boost vaccine research, and increase lab security.\n  This subcommittee is serious about meeting this threat head on, and \nwe are prepared to fully fund a comprehensive, commonsense, \nantibioterrorism effort.\n  I conclude by saying Senator Specter and I are now prepared to move \nthis bill. The leaders have asked us, as we heard earlier, to move the \nbill quickly. We are eager to complete it so we can get to conference \nwith the House. So I hope, if Members have amendments, they will come \nto the Chamber and offer them. Hopefully, we can wrap up this bill \nsometime today.\n  As the chairman, I usually am aware of possible amendments. I must \nsay at this point in time I have not heard of any amendments. So if any \nSenators have amendments, I hope they will come and offer them as soon \nas possible.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Specter, and his staff for all \ntheir help in putting this bill together. As he said earlier, we have \nhad a great partnership now going on over 10 years. We keep switching \nsides. One is the chairman or ranking member, then chairman or ranking \nmember. Quite frankly, I like it a little bit better this way, but I \ncould not have asked for a better chairman when I was ranking member.\n\n[[Page S11158]]\n\nI appreciate all of the many kindnesses he has afforded me, and the \ncloseness with which we have worked over the years to develop our \nappropriations bills, especially this one this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, to reiterate, I thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa for those very generous comments. It is not \nuncommon to hear hyperbole when one Senator talks about another, but \nthe relationship which Senator Harkin and I have developed for more \nthan a decade represents bipartisanship at its best.\n  I understand when Senator Harkin says he likes it a little bit better \nwhen he is the chairman. Some people would not be surprised to hear he \nlikes it a lot better when he is the chairman. Senator Harkin chaired \nthe subcommittee prior to 1995 when I became chairman and was chairman \nfor some 6\\1/2\\ years. The transition has been seamless. Tom Harkin and \nArlen Specter learned a long time ago that if one wants to get \nsomething done in Washington, they have to be willing to cross party \nlines.\n  Our work on this subcommittee involves three of the most important \nsubjects on which the Congress has to appropriate, and that is on \neducation, where it is a priority second to none; and health, which has \na standing with education; and labor and work safety are matters of \nenormous importance where the public interest is very well served by \nthis kind of bipartisanship and this kind of cooperation.\n  We have structured a bill with the assistance of a superb staff. Both \nSenator Harkin and I refer to our deputies, Ellen and Betty Lou, as \ndeputy Senators because they take over. We have the final say, but they \nare tremendous.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We do?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Harkin just said, ``We do?'' And I would add: \nYes, sir, we do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We think we do.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is an enormous staff contribution. Senator Harkin and \nI have received more than a thousand requests from Senators for \ninclusion in this bill, and we have done our best to accommodate all \nthose requests. We have accommodated a surprisingly high number as we \nhave worked through the priorities on this bill.\n  This bill provides for $123 billion in budget authority, and that is \nan increase of $11.4 billion over last year, and we are within our \n302(b) allocation. We are within the budget. This represents a \ndetermination by the Senate of the very high priority on these issues.\n\n  In providing funding for education, health and labor, with emphasis \non worker safety, we have added funds to the National Institutes of \nHealth which we believe to be the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment. We started on this very substantial increase for fiscal \nyear 1998. Up until that time there had been increases but not enormous \nincreases. Senator Harkin and I determined this was the highest \npriority because of the tremendous number of ailments which were \naddressed by the National Institutes of Health.\n  That year, we asked the Budget Committee for an extra $1 billion; we \nwere turned down. So we came to the floor and offered an amendment on \nthe budget for an extra $1 billion; we lost 63-37. We got out the sharp \npencils and found the extra $1 billion in priorities. The next year, \nhaving lost our effort for an extra $1 billion from the budgeting \nprocess, we asked for $2 billion; we were turned down again. We lost \nagain on the floor, 52-48. But we have pursued this matter with \ntenacity and diligence, so that last year when we asked for $2.5 \nbillion--this year we are asking for $3.4 billion--we had a vote of 96-\n4. We have had that kind of support. That reflects the Nation's mood.\n  From fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001--and if we mark in the \n$3.4 billion this year--we will have increased NIH funding by $11 \nbillion on an existing budget in fiscal year 1997 of $12.7 billion. We \nbelieve that has been good for America. We have been able to watch NIH \nand, with other oversight, move within 5 years, perhaps, of conquering \nParkinson's disease, delaying Alzheimer's disease, and made enormous \nachievements in cancer research and therapy and in heart disease.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my comments the long list \nof diseases tackled by the National Institutes of Health, with \nremarkable success, be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Among the hearings our subcommittee has held since \nDecember of 1998, there were nine on stem cells, which burst upon the \nscene in November of 1998. The President has taken a significant step \nforward in authorizing Federal funding for all of the stem cell lines \nwhich were in existence as of August 9 at 9 p.m. Subsequent hearings by \nour subcommittee have disclosed the likelihood is high that will not be \nsufficient to have the kind of medical research which is necessary. The \ndetermination of that will await another day, candidly, as our country \nhas been so heavily involved on the war against terrorism.\n  In response to very legitimate concerns which have been addressed by \nmany about the possibility of having life from those embryos which are \ndiscarded on in vitro fertilization, we have included in this bill $1 \nmillion as a starting project to have an embryo adoption awareness \ncampaign.\n  In in vitro fertilization, perhaps a couple will create a dozen of \nthese embryos. Then there will be selected three or four of the \nstrongest embryos for implantation, for in vitro fertilization. The \nbulk of the remaining embryos will be discarded. An issue has been \nraised about the possibility of adoption of these embryos. Certainly, \nif it were possible to bring all of these embryos to life, no one would \nsuggest remotely they be used for research for stem cell \nextraction. But it is only because they are going to be discarded that \nit is concluded it is better to use them than to simply lose them and \nthrow them away.\n\n  In an effort to have the maximum utilization possible of these \nembryos if life can be produced, we have started on this embryo \nadoption awareness campaign and have allocated $1 million--not an \nenormous sum of money, but enough for a start. If it moves ahead, we \nwill be revisiting this matter with increased appropriations in \nsubsequent years.\n  Our funding has been very extensive on other critical programs of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The Centers for Disease \nControl, which is now very much in the headlines, was the subject of an \nadditional $170 million last year for improvement of the plan. About 18 \nmonths ago, I made a visit to the Centers for Disease Control in \nAtlanta because I could not believe the stories I was hearing about \nrenowned scientists working in corridors with their desks under \nextraordinarily difficult circumstances. I went to Atlanta. I found \nthat the conditions were even worse than had been described.\n  Senator Harkin and I crafted $170 million for our budget for capital \nimprovements which will exceed some $1 billion over the course of \nyears. This year, we have added some $250 million to that program. We \nhave had a substantial increase in Head Start, of some $400 million, \nand we are now at $6.6 billion. The Ryan White AIDS program has an \nincrease of $75 million to $1.888 billion. Children's Graduate Medical \nEducation, a very important item, has had an increase up to $243 \nmillion.\n  On education on title I, disadvantaged youngsters, we have had the \nremarkable increase of $2.4 billion, or a total of some $11.8 billion. \nOn the important item of teacher quality State grants, an increase of \n$930 million to $1.9 billion, we have had a virtual doubling of that \nimportant account. On special education, an item I hear about so often \nin my town meetings as I visit the 67 counties in Pennsylvania, we have \nhad an increase of $1 billion, moving toward the goal of having the \nFederal Government fund 40 percent of special education.\n  Pell grantees have been raised consistently. Now they are at $4,000, \nan increase of $250 over last year. Gradually we are moving them up and \nup and up.\n  With respect to labor, the dislocated worker account, which is so \nimportant today with the economy having the difficulties which are so \nwell known, we have an increase of $136 million, for a total of $1.5 \nbillion.\n  Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, has an increase \nof\n\n[[Page S11159]]\n\nalmost $25 million; mine safety, an increase of almost $10 million; the \nNational Labor Relations Board, an increase of $10 million to try to \nget them to cope with their very heavy backlog.\n  That is a summary of some of the items in this bill. We think we have \ncrafted the priorities in accordance with America's needs. These are \nthree Departments of enormous importance. We have a substantial \nallocation for bioterrorism which we have addressed each year.\n  That will be in our regular budget--$338 million. That is going to \nhave an increase yet to be determined.\n  We had a special hearing several weeks ago where the indications were \na minimum of $1.5 billion, which was the request at that time. That is \ngoing to be substantially increased to enable us to cope with the very \nserious threat which confronts America today.\n  That is a very brief summary. I urge my colleagues to come to the \nSenate floor. Now is a good time to offer amendments. There is no \ncompetition; Senators may offer amendments right at the head of the \nline.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                Diseases\n\n       Alzheimers.\n       Parkinsons.\n       ALS\n       Muscular dystrophy.\n       Diabetes.\n       Osteoporosis.\n       Cancers: breast, cervical and ovarian; lymphoma; multiple \n     myeloma; prostate; pancreatic; colon; head and neck; brain; \n     lung.\n       Pediatric renal disorders.\n       Multiple sclerosis.\n       Deafness and other communication disorders.\n       Glaucoma.\n       Macular degeneration.\n       Sickle cell anemia.\n       Heart disease.\n       Spinal cord injury.\n       Sudden infant death syndrome.\n       Arthritis.\n       Schizophrenia and other mental disorders.\n       Polycystic kidney disease.\n       Hepatitis.\n       Cooley's anemia.\n       Primary immune deficiency disorders.\n       Autism.\n       Stroke.\n       Obesity.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to Senator Stevens, a minority member \non the Appropriations Committee, speaking on this bill, I want to \nannounce to everyone that as soon as we come back from the party \ncaucuses, after the recess at 2:15, there will be a unanimous consent \nagreement setting a time for filing--not for filing but for calling the \ncloakroom. We are going to come up with a list of finite amendments at \na certain time today.\n  We would like to offer that unanimous consent right now, but we have \nbeen given information that the minority wants to complete their caucus \nlunch before they make a decision. I only state we hope that can be \nworked out. I am confident it will be, but if it is not, we are going \nto offer the unanimous consent and someone will have to come and \npersonally object to it. We need to move this bill along.\n  The Republican senior member of the committee is on the floor and he \nhas worked very hard. We now have two bills that have been sent to the \nPresident. We have two or three conference reports we are going to \ncomplete this week, so we are making progress. One of the things we can \ndo to show some significant progress is complete this bill tonight or \nprior to lunch tomorrow and then move on to another appropriations \nbill.\n  I hope we can have that agreement on a finite list of amendments \nentered shortly after we come back from lunch.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So I understand what the Senator from Nevada is saying, I \nam going to offer an amendment to this bill and every bill that comes \nto the floor. It is something that was dropped out of the bill last \nweek on counterterrorism. It deals with what is called advanced \npassenger information systems. We have airlines landing this morning \nfrom Pakistan, from Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, airliners \ncoming from those countries for which there is no passenger information \nforwarded to the Customs Department.\n  Eighty-five percent of the airlines do voluntarily provide that \ninformation. Fifteen percent of the airlines do not. I have described \nthe countries from which the airlines come that do not provide that \ninformation. Everyone agreed we ought to do this. I offered the \namendment and it was knocked out in conference on the counterterrorism \nbill because we had some people worried about their jurisdiction. They \nwould not allow it in conference.\n  Today we have literally thousands of people coming on airplanes from \nthat region and the names of those people are not provided to the \nFederal law enforcement authorities as they are from 85 percent of the \nother carriers. In this case, those names are not provided now. It \nseems to me that compromises this country's security.\n  I aim to fix that as quickly as we can. I intend to offer that as an \namendment to every bill, and I will offer it this afternoon to this \nlegislation as well. I want to make sure I am not prevented from doing \nso.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, he certainly is not \nprevented from doing so. I hope he offers that amendment as soon as \npossible. The sooner we get to it, the quicker we are going to move \nthrough the bill, but Senators will have an opportunity to offer any \namendments they want. We are not trying to cut off any amendments. We \nare simply saying we want to cut off time so we know what amendments we \nare going to have to work through before we complete this legislation.\n  I look forward to supporting my friend, the Senator from North \nDakota, on this most important legislation dealing with airport \nsecurity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, while the Senator from North Dakota, who \nmade the comment concerning the advanced lists, is present, I want to \nmake a comment on another subject. But I say Alaska has suffered \nrecently because of the loss of cargo lines that came through Anchorage \nand went on to other parts of the United States or Mexico or Canada. \nThey landed primarily for fuel. The Customs regulations were changed \nand because of those changes, one of which was the request for the \nadvanced lists, a series of those cargo lines have now decided to land \nin Canada and not land in the United States. So their first landing is \nin Canada.\n  I do not think the Senator is going to propose we get an advanced \nlist of passengers on Canadian airlines. I am not sure it is possible \nunder NAFTA. So I urge him to consider some way to deal with this \nproblem of requiring lists that might lead to these planes deviating \nand going into Canada and actually we would have less information than \nwe have today. I do not want to debate it now, but I will talk to him \nabout it and tell him what happened in Alaska. I hope he understands.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question? I understand he \nwants to talk about other things. My interest is in making sure we have \nthe passenger lists of people coming into this country. As I indicated, \nin 85 percent of the cases we do, but we do not now from Pakistan, \nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, and so on. It seems to me that security is \nparamount at this point, and I certainly will visit with the Senator \nfrom Alaska about the issue he raises. I am talking especially about \npassenger lists at this point. I will talk more about it this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I support the Senator's request. I supported his \namendment before, and I will support it again, but I do think we have \nto take a look to see what the consequences of some of these \nrequirements are and be prepared to meet the changes that come in terms \nof the airline travel.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about the Labor-Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill. I know it will be up after lunch. I \nwelcome the statement of the distinguished majority whip that we will \nseek a listing of these amendments today. I also am delighted I was \nable to be with Senator Specter who spoke about a matter that he and I \nhave discussed at other times, and that is the creation of some type of \ncategory that will allow us to distinguish between normal visa \napplicants, or holders who are privileged to be in this country, and \nthose who should properly be on a list of known terrorists.\n  I, for one, do agree with him. We should find some way to treat those\n\n[[Page S11160]]\n\npeople as we would agents of foreign nations and treat them as \nprisoners of war. We ought to start getting tougher, as the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania says.\n  What worries me most, as one of the few survivors of the World War II \nera, is I do not think we understand how tough we have to get to deal \nwith some of these issues that are coming before our country. I hear \npeople saying once again there is a global threat warning out and we \nare sort of crying wolf.\n  Well, it is not crying wolf. I really believe the Attorney General \nand the head of our new homeland defense agency are right to warn the \npeople of the United States, and I think it is high time we decide how \ntough we are going to be in facing the challenges that have now beset \nus because of our global war against terrorism.\n  As I said, I came to talk about the Labor-Health and Human Services \nbill. It is the largest bill that comes before the Appropriations \nCommittee. It is the largest because its breadth of coverage, as well \nas its size, means it does more to help everyday Americans than any \nother bill we consider in this Congress. It addresses American's health \nneeds from community clinics to bioterrorism to immunizations. It \nprovides services for Americans who need a helping hand from electric \nbills to job training. It helps narrow the education gap, providing \nPell grants to lower income university students, to assistance to \nAlaska native colleges. I am pleased the committee has agreed to fund \nthe Denali Commission. It was a commission I urged Congress to create \nto adopt a novel approach to providing assistance to remote areas in my \nState. The overhead of this commission in handling Federal funds is \nheld to 5 percent or less. It is probably the lowest rate in the entire \nFederal Government.\n  We have found by handling money through a commission that has on it \nmembers of the State government, of the Federal Government, of business \nand labor, of the environmental community, as well as the native \ncommunity, we can make decisions on how to spend and where to spend \nFederal money without the enormous overhead of the rest of the Federal \nexecutive branch. It has already helped build health clinics in remote \nvillages where there are no doctors or nurses. We have pioneered in \ntelemedicine and tele-education in my State. I am most pleased that the \nAppropriations Committee has agreed to continue to support this \napproach.\n  Sadly, my State leads the Nation in domestic violence, child abuse, \nand alcoholism. I am deeply grateful to the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation for including an initiative to develop a statewide plan to \ncombat domestic violence and child abuse in Alaska. Likewise, I am very \npleased funds have been provided to implement the physical education \nfor progress legislation Congress adopted last year at my request.\n  It is my hope we will move forward on this legislation quickly. I \nurge our colleagues to come to the floor as soon as possible to clear \nany amendments with the managers of the bill. We have other bills to \nwhich we should move. I know the chairman of the committee, Senator \nByrd, will be speaking on this matter. I join him in requesting we \nconsider how we can move the remaining legislation that comes from our \nAppropriations Committee and still finish our business in time to get \nhome for Thanksgiving.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will speak at more length on the subject \nI talked about a few moments ago, the issue of the advance passenger \ninformation system, which sounds like an innocuous system but it is a \nvery important system by which we help provide for this country's \nsecurity. Let me describe exactly what has happened.\n  We have 57 million people enter this country every year by airplane. \nCommercial airplanes from all around the world come into this country. \nWe have some 57 million people on those airplanes entering the United \nStates. There are 94 different air carriers flying those people into \nour country. There were 400,000 international flights with passengers \nprocessed into our country in the last year.\n  The question, especially since September 11, and since the terrorist \nthreats against this country resulted in these devastating attacks of \nmass murder, the question is, Who are these people who are entering our \ncountry? What is their background? Do their names show up somewhere on \na list of people who are affiliated with or associated with a terrorist \ncell? Are they known or suspected terrorists? Who are they?\n  In order to answer that question, we have what is called the advance \npassenger information system, which has 85 percent of the passengers \ncovered by APIS because the carriers that are bringing them into this \ncountry voluntarily provide information to the Customs Service in \nAmerica, saying here is our passenger list. That list then is cross-\nchecked against the list of the Customs Service, the FBI, and others, \nto try to determine whether there are people who are trying to enter \nour country who should not enter. Pretty simple.\n  But the 15 percent of the passengers who are not part of this system, \nwhose names don't come in to be checked, includes passengers on \nairplanes coming from, among other countries, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \nJordan, Egypt, and Pakistan. Let me give carriers that do not comply. \nThey are not part of the voluntary system and do not provide passenger \nlists or information about passengers: Air Lingus, Aer Transat, Bahamas \nAir, Champion, Saudi, Kuwait, Royal Jordanian, Air Pakistan \nInternational, Canada 3000.\n  I chaired hearings in the appropriations subcommittee dealing with \nTreasury and general government. We had the Commissioner of the Customs \nService testify. He talked about this. He talked about this being an \nimportant piece of information we get in our attempt to try to prevent \nterrorists, or known or suspected terrorists, from coming into our \ncountry. He said it is voluntary. There is 15 percent of the \ninformation we don't get; 15 percent of the 57 million passengers, with \ntheir names, are not given to our Customs Service to be checked. I \nasked, should it be checked? And he said of course it should, but he \nsaid at present it is not mandatory. I said, it is not mandatory? And \nhe said, of course, it should be mandatory.\n  I indicated we would try to get that done after the September 11 \nattacks when there were 19 people riding the airplanes who came into \nthis country to commit murder. While they committed an act of self-\ndestruction, they murdered thousands of American citizens. Especially \nfollowing that, we ought to be concerned about border security. This is \none part of border security.\n  We had a piece of legislation called the counterterrorism bill which \nthe President signed into law last week. That bill had an amendment I \noffered on the floor of the Senate that would have required the \nairlines coming into this country to provide the advance passenger \ninformation lists. My amendment passed. The Senate said yes. It was in \nthe Senate bill. It came back from conference, and, mysteriously, it \nwas gone. That somehow got destroyed.\n\n  That amendment was destroyed in conference. Why? Apparently, because \nthere were some Members who decided in conference they have \njurisdiction over this, it didn't go through this hoop or that hoop or \ndidn't have this hearing or that hearing. Therefore, they asserted \njurisdiction on this and said they would not allow it to be in \nconference.\n  What is the result of that, in my judgment, small-minded decision by \nsome in Congress? What is the result? The result is that today, on \nTuesday, there are airplanes landing all across this country coming in \nfrom Pakistan, from Egypt, from Saudi Arabia, from Kuwait, from Jordan, \nand there is no advance passenger list given the Customs Service \nagainst which they can check the lists and determine whether there are \npassengers we don't want coming into this country.\n  The result of knocking that out of the conference so it was not in \nthe counterterrorism bill last week, in my judgment, injures this \ncountry's ability to provide for secure borders. It is\n\n[[Page S11161]]\n\nsmall thinking in the extreme, in my judgment.\n  Today and tomorrow these airplanes will haul passengers into this \ncountry and we will not have information about who those passengers \nare. We will have information on most of the passengers coming in from \nSouth America, from Europe, from most of the countries with which we \nhave trading relationships and good relationships; they have signed a \nvoluntary agreement with us. But the fact is, some of the key \ncountries, some of the key carriers from that region that we need to be \nvery concerned about at this point, are not involved if we receive no \npassenger list.\n  Someone said, when you read the names--Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi \nArabia, Kuwait, and more--aren't you profiling passengers? I said it is \nnot about profiling passengers but about getting a list of all \npassengers coming into this country and trying to profile who might be \nknown or suspected terrorists and keeping them out. If they happen to \ncome from one region of the country, I regret that. But we are not \nprofiling passengers; we are profiling terrorists to see if we can keep \nout of this country those whom we don't want to let in because they \nhave suspect ties to terrorist organizations.\n  Coming into this country with a visa is coming into this country as a \nguest of the United States. We have every right to keep out of this \ncountry those who have ties to or those who are associated with known \nterrorist organizations. But today, Tuesday, we cannot do that because \nof behavior that represents monumental littleness, as one of our great \nformer Presidents said in a conference last week, knocking out the \namendment to which the Senate had already agreed, knocking out the \namendment that came to that conference from the Senate.\n  As a result, I intend to offer this amendment just after lunch today \non this piece of legislation, and I will offer this amendment on every \npiece of legislation until it becomes law, until it is in a vehicle \nsigned into law by the President of the United States. So at 12:30 on \nTuesday next week or a week after when a plane lands in this country, \ncarrying passengers from abroad, we will know that in every \ncircumstance information on the passenger list from that plane is \nprovided to the U.S. Customs Service before departure.\n  Some might say, well, isn't this an unusual, intrusive and difficult \nthing to ask of others? The answer is no. Anyone who watched those \ncommercial airplanes fly into the World Trade Center in New York knows \nthat a lot has changed since September 11.\n  This country's security is critically important. Border security, it \nseems to me, is where you start. The President said yesterday, as \nreported in the papers today dealing with visas, that we should be \ntightening up on visas. I fully agree with that. You have to maintain \ncontrol of your borders. That doesn't mean you build a wall and keep \npeople out. It means you have sufficient capability to understand who \nis coming in and to keep the wrong people out. That is what it means.\n  My hope is that we will be able to add this amendment to this \nappropriations bill. I understand this isn't an appropriations \namendment. I understand that completely. My hope is that my colleagues \nwho have already approved this--the Senate has already approved this \nlegislation--will understand that our job is to keep sending this \nmatter to conference on every vehicle possible so that the next \nairplane that lands from abroad is an airplane with a list of \npassengers that we have, and that list has been checked against the \nCustoms list, against the FBI list, and against all of the lists of \nsome 20 different agencies that have lists that tell us about people \nwho should not be allowed to enter this country because of their known \nor suspected ties to terrorist organizations.\n  I will come back after lunch with an amendment I will formally offer. \nMy hope is that the chairman and the ranking member will see fit to \nagree to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for no \nlonger than 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I sat here for the last few minutes and \nlistened to my colleague from North Dakota talk about border security. \nCertainly what he has said I agree with in principle. I haven't seen \nhis amendment. I will now search it out and read it.\n  I have always believed if you have a guest in your home and find out \nthat guest is going to burn down your home, you are going to get that \nguest out of your house just as quickly as you can before he or she \ntouches the match. Foreign nationals in this country are guests of our \ncountry. They are guests in our home. There is nothing wrong with \nasking them to play by a few rules and for us to know who is on the \nguest list.\n  If that is what the Senator from North Dakota is talking about, I \nwill support him in that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11161-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11161-S11162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from J. Eldon \nYates, chairman and founder of the Vietnam Veterans Institute; the \nAmerican Legion national commander, Richard Santos; the Veterans of \nForeign Wars executive director, Robert Wallace; and Joseph Lipowski, \nthe national commander of AMVETS.\n  They joined me, several of my colleagues, and the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, Anthony Principi, just a few moments ago outside our \nCapitol to call on this Senate and our leader, Tom Daschle, to bring a \nnational energy policy bill before this Senate before we adjourn this \nyear.\n  Clearly, the President has been outspoken in the last month--and I \nagree with what he is doing--about strengthening our resolve and \nprotecting our freedoms as the country cries out for a national energy \npolicy that is a policy of national security.\n  Today the administration announced that we are going to start buying \noil to put into our national Strategic Petroleum Reserve to beef up the \ntotal volume in that reserve in case of a national crisis. But even \nwhen that is done, if the oil of the Middle East were cut off, that \nreserve would last only for a few weeks before we would be in a \nsignificant energy crisis.\n  Our President as well as the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary \nof Energy, the Vice President, labor unions, chambers of commerce, \nNational Association of Manufacturers, and small business groups speaks \nout. America is being told today that national energy is a national \nsecurity issue.\n  Strangely enough, the chairman of the Energy Committee even spoke \nthis last weekend saying he wanted a national energy policy addressed \nbefore the end of the year. Yet nothing is done. The Energy Committee \nhas been shut down by orders of the majority leader. Republicans are \nproducing an energy bill. We have been to the floor time and time again \nasking for a time certain on which to debate this critical issue. The \nHouse acted in August. Our world would come tumbling down around us at \nthis moment, economically speaking, if the oil of the Middle East were \nshut off from this country. Our economy would stifle. It is an issue of \nnational security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       AMVETS,\n\n                                     Lanham, MD, October 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of AMVETS, I am writing to \n     encourage you to bring H.R. 4, the Securing America's Future \n     Energy Act of 2001, before the full Senate for consideration \n     at the earliest possible moment prior to the close of the 1st \n     Session of the 107th Congress.\n       As you know, our current reliance on foreign oil leaves the \n     United States vulnerable to the whim of individual oil-\n     exporting countries, many existing in the unpredictable and \n     highly dangerous Persian Gulf. And it cannot be overstated \n     that energy supplies touch nearly every aspect of our lives \n     from our economy to our national security.\n       Passage of H.R. 4 would greatly assist in our ability to \n     secure a more dependable and diversified domestic supply of \n     energy. And, I would note that since the Persian Gulf War our \n     security has become more threatened with our dependence on \n     foreign sources of oil growing from 35 percent of domestic \n     supply to nearly 60 percent.\n\n[[Page S11162]]\n\n       AMVETS firmly believes that we cannot wait for the next \n     crisis before we act. H.R. 4, as approved by the House, is a \n     critical part of an overall policy America requires to \n     promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound \n     production and distribution of energy for the future. We urge \n     your expedited approval of this legislation.\n       Dedicated to service.\n                                               Joseph W.

Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: The 2.7 million members of the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies \n     Auxiliary supports H.R. 4, the ``Securing America's Future \n     Energy Act of 2001'' or SAFE Act of 2001. We applaud the \n     House of Representatives for its bipartisan work in \n     addressing our energy vulnerability by passing H.R. 4. We \n     believe the Senate should consider and vote on H.R. 4 so that \n     our nation has an energy plan for the future and can move \n     forward quickly with a comprehensive plan to develop our \n     domestic energy resources.\n       Keeping in mind the horrific events of September 11 and \n     mindful of the threats we are facing, we strongly believe \n     that the development of America's domestic energy resources \n     is a vital national security priority. We need to take steps \n     to reverse our growing dependence on Middle East oil as \n     quickly as possible. By passing H.R. 4, the Senate will be \n     supporting our troops serving in combat on Operation Enduring \n     Freedom, the American people, and our national security with \n     a comprehensive energy legislation that is desperately needed \n     to diversify the energy supply for our country and chart a \n     course for the future.\n       The VFW strongly urges the Senate to consider and vote on \n     H.R. 4 as passed in the House in this session of Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E.

Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write today out of a sense of \n     urgency concerning our national security, as it relates to \n     our need for energy independence. The development of \n     America's domestic energy resources is vital to our national \n     security. We respectfully urge you to adopt the provisions \n     contained in H.R. 4, the ``Securing America's Future Energy \n     Act of 2001.''\n       War and international terrorism have again brought into \n     sharp focus the heavy reliance of the United States on \n     imported oil. During times of crises, such reliance threatens \n     our national security and economic well being. The import of \n     more than 50 percent of our petroleum from the Persian Gulf \n     further compounds our foreign trade balance at a time when \n     our energy demands continued unabated. It is important that \n     we develop domestic sources of oil, contained within our \n     public lands--such as the supplies within the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge.\n       Working for a comprehensive energy policy and achieving \n     responsible energy independence are critical national \n     security and economic goals. H.R. 4, as passed by the House \n     of Representatives, is a major step forward to achieving \n     these imperative goals. We strongly urge your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard J. Santos,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement Of Our Nation's Veterans Groups, ``Our Domestic Energy \n         Security is Our National Security'', October 30, 2001\n\n       We, the undersigned, representing our nation's veterans, \n     strongly believe that the development of America's domestic \n     energy resources is a vital national security priority. The \n     horrific events of September 11, 2001, constitute a threat to \n     our people, our economy, and our nation's security. With U.S. \n     troops actively engaged in combat overseas, we firmly believe \n     that America can and will win this prolonged war against \n     terrorism, using all its resources to defend our nation and \n     the cause of freedom around the world.\n       Because of these beliefs, we applaud the House of \n     Representatives for its bipartisan work in addressing our \n     energy vulnerability by passing H.R. 4, the ``Securing \n     America's Future Energy Act of 2001'' or the ``SAFE Act of \n     2001.'' It is imperative that the Senate pass the House \n     version of H.R. 4 so that our nation can move forward in \n     establishing our energy security, as well as our defense of \n     freedom at home and abroad. It is essential for us to develop \n     all domestic energy resources including the supplies within \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       By passing H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy legislation, \n     the Senate will be supporting our troops in the field, all \n     Americans, their families, and our nation. We, as Veterans, \n     stand united and respectfully request that the Senate vote on \n     and pass H.R. 4.\n\n                                               J.

Mr. President, America's veterans, those who have stood in \nharm's way year after year and decade after decade in defense and \nsupport of our freedom, now speak out and say: Senator Daschle, this is \nan issue of national security. Where are you? Why aren't you allowing \nthe Senate to debate this issue now and have on the President's desk a \nnational energy policy before we recess this first session of the 107th \nCongress?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk a minute about part of the \nLabor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill as it pertains to an area \nof particular concern to me and my State; that is, rural health care.\n  I am cochairman of the Rural Health Care Caucus, along with the \nSenator from Iowa. I think this issue has been treated very well in \nthis bill. I would like to comment just a bit about it.\n  We have, of course, a special focus on rural health care because it \nis unique. And because it is a special kind of issue that does not \napply everywhere, I think it is necessary for us to deal with it from \ntime to time.\n  We submitted a letter from our caucus. I think there were 43 Members \nof the Senate listed on the letter asking for some consideration. I \nthink this committee has reacted quite well.\n  There are a number of things of which most people are not aware and \nwhich are not talked about very often. Although 20 percent of the \npopulation of this country lives in what is called rural areas, only 9 \npercent of physicians practice in those areas. You can see it is always \nsomewhat difficult to have the kind of medical services in rural areas \nthat are available in other places.\n  Rural areas contain 67 percent of the country's primary health care \nprofessional shortage areas. I guess that is not a surprise, but indeed \nthat is the case. It is in need of focus to ensure we have primary care \nin all of these rural areas.\n  There are 2,187 rural hospitals, a majority of which are primary care \nhospitals. Specialized care is very limited. Only 12 of 245 long-term \ncare hospitals are in rural areas, and 81 of 601 psychiatric hospitals \nare in rural areas. None of the country's 73 children's hospitals is in \nrural areas.\n  As you can see, there is a need, and indeed there has been and \ncontinues to be special emphasis on it.\n  For example, national health care services: This is a program that \nprovides primary health care providers in our Nation's most underserved \ncommunities. Last year, only 12.5 percent of the communities eligible \nfor provider placement received assistance. That has increased. \nAdequately? I do not know. Would we like more? Of course. Nevertheless, \nit has been treated well.\n  There is an increase for community health centers. Community health \ncenters provide services in rural areas for people living in \nunderserved areas. They provide a service that is not always needed but \nis unique to rural areas.\n  Rural health research: A grant is provided for rural health research \nas to how to provide more services.\n  We understand the rural areas are not going to have all of those \nkinds of services in every community. In our State, we look for a \nmedical care network that can be moved around to the places where it is \nneeded.\n  The Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act is in the bill with some \nnew funding; also, State offices of rural health which help provide a \nnetwork and a system to provide those services in small communities.\n  We had some requests for funding in the Rural Interdisciplinary \nTraining Program. This program addresses the shortage of health care \nprofessionals in rural areas. In the bill we also have the Rural \nHospital Improvement Program.\n  So, of course, there are other areas in which we would like to have \nmore emphasis, but I wanted to rise to suggest that this area of this \nbill is a very important one and one that means a great deal.\n\n[[Page S11163]]\n\n  When we think of Wyoming, of course, we think of a rural State. I \nthink there are twice as many people in Fairfax County as there are in \nWyoming. But every State has rural areas. New York is one of the most \nrural States in terms of how many people are concentrated in a \nparticular area. So when we talk about rural States, it is not just a \nwestern phenomenon. Rural needs exist in all our States.\n  So I hope we can go forward with this part of the bill. I thank those \nwho put the bill together for their emphasis and interest in providing \nfor rural health care.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 1536, the Departments of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The Senate bill provides $123.071 billion in nonemergency \ndiscretionary budget authority, which will result in new outlays in \n2002 of $50.014 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority \nare taken into account, discretionary outlays for the Senate bill total \n$107.716 billion in 2002. The Senate bill is at its section 302(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  In addition, the bill provides $300 million in emergency-designated \nfunding for the low-income home energy assistance program (LIHEAP), \nwhich will result in new outlays of $75 million in 2002. In accordance \nwith standard budget practice the budget committee will adjust the \nappropriations committee's allocation for emergency spending at the end \nof conference.\n  The Senate bill also provides $18.474 billion in advance \nappropriations for 2003 for employment and training, health resources, \nchild care, and education programs. Those advances are specifically \nallowed for under the budget resolution adopted for 2002, and, combined \nwith all other advance appropriations considered by the Senate to date, \nfall within the limit imposed by the resolution. Finally, the bill \nextends the Mark-to-Market Program for multifamily assisted housing, \nwhich is estimated to save $355 million in 2002.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget \ncommittee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n S. 1536, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION,\n  AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002, SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                            CONFERENCE REPORT\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority...............      123,071      272,937      396,008\n  Outlays........................      107,716      272,968      380,684\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............      123,071      272,937      396,008\n  Outlays........................      107,716      272,968      380,684\nHouse-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority...............      123,071      272,937      396,008\n  Outlays........................      106,753      272,968      379,721\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............      116,328      272,937      389,265\n  Outlays........................      105,957      272,968      378,925\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................            0            0            0\nHouse-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................          963            0          963\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............        6,743            0        6,743\n  Outlays........................        1,759            0        1,759\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the\n  conference report to the Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the fiscal year \n2002 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill \nbrought forward today by Senator Harkin and Senator Specter, the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  As a member of the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee, I am well aware \nof the competing priorities funded in this bill including health care \nfor the disadvantaged, medical research, education, Head Start, child \ncare, and job training. The subcommittee faces a difficult task every \nyear accommodating these important priorities, but behind the \nleadership of the chairman and ranking member, I believe we have \nproduced a bill that balances these priorities.\n  The bill provides $1.343 billion for community health centers. The \nweakening economy and skyrocketing cost of insurance raise the \nlikelihood that thousands of Americans will lost their health benefits. \nThese facts, combined with the persistent lack of access to care in \nmany rural and urban communities, make it imperative that we strengthen \nthe ability of community health centers to serve our Nation's \nunderserved and uninsured patients. Last year, Senator Bond and I \nlaunched the REACH initiative to double funding for community health \ncenters by 2005. The $175 million increase provided in the bill with \nsupport from 67 Senators keeps the Senate on track to meet our goal.\n  From cancer to vision to biomedical imaging, the work of the \nSubcommittee to invest in the National Institutes of Health, (NIH), has \nled to improvements in the quality of life for countless Americans. I \nstrongly support the unprecedented investment in the NIH made in this \nbill. This basic and clinical research is critical to the advancement \nof medical science and human health. Over the past 30 years, the 5-year \ncancer survival rate has risen from 38 percent to 59 percent. This \nmeans that approximately 8,400,000 people are alive today as a result \nof progress in cancer research.\n  Our investment in the NIH has been returned many times over. Every \ndollar spent at the NIH returns over $7 in lower medical costs and \nincreased economic productivity. Advances in the treatment of \ncardiovascular disease between 1970 and 1990 have had a positive \neconomic value of $1.5 trillion annually. Still the costs of disease \ntallies as high as $180 billion a year for cancer and $38 billion a \nyear for vision ailments. The investment made by this bill will cut \ninto the amounts our government and our citizens spend fighting and \ntreating these diseases.\n  In addition, it is important that we open the competition for \nbiomedical research to institutions from all parts of the country. This \nbill includes $200 million for the National Center for Research \nResources' Institutional Development Awards, a program that helps \nStates like South Carolina overcome the geographic concentration of NIH \nawards by developing the infrastructure needed to compete for \nbiomedical research funding.\n  I would also like to point out the importance of the cancer programs \nfunded out of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Cancer Registries can be a powerful tool in the war against cancer. \nWe know that early detection of cancer saves lives and saves the health \ncare system millions of dollars. With budgets getting tighter in States \nacross the country, cancer registries give public health agencies clear \nguidance of where to target scarce resources for prevention activities. \nI am told that the registry in South Carolina is like many of the other \nregistries. It has the ability to collect sophisticated and accurate \ndata, but lacks the resources to fully analyze and act upon the data it \ncollects. The true potential of cancer registries cannot be realized \nuntil a larger investment in the program is made.\n  The South Carolina breast and cervical cancer detection program, \nknown as the Best Chances Network, just celebrated its 10th \nanniversary. Over that time, the program provided more than 110,000 \ncancer screenings to low-income women and have detected 1,400 cancers, \nsaving countless lives. By all accounts the only problem with the \nprogram is that it cannot serve all eligible women.\n  The subcommittee also did an admirable job funding education \nprograms. The bill contains a $1.5 billion increase for title I. This \nsubstantial increase is important because the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act will put new mandates and higher \nexpectations on our nation's schools. In turn, our schools should \nexpect us to meet our mandates and provide them with the resources we \npromised. The $10.2 billion provided in the bill will move us closer \ntowards fully funding title I, a goal that 79 members of this body \nvoted to affirm earlier this year.\n\n[[Page S11164]]\n\n  The bill contains $3 billion for State grants for improving teacher \nquality. It is critical to the future of our education system that we \nrecruit our best and brightest to the teaching field and make efforts \nto retain the quality teachers already present in our system. This \nfunding gives States the flexibility to improve teacher compensation, \nhire new teachers to reduce class size or provide additional training \nor mentoring to current teachers.\n  This bill addresses the crumbling infrastructure in many of our \nschools by providing $925 million for school construction. Seventy-\neight percent of public schools in South Carolina reported a need to \nupgrade or repair a school building to good overall condition. I am \npleased that the bill will help our schools address some of the needs \nof their facilities and thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the \nleadership he has shown in this area.\n  Finally, the bill increases funding for higher education programs. \nThe amounts provided in this bill will bring the maximum Pell Grant \ntotal to $4,000. We also provide for a $75 million increase for the \nTRIO programs. Since 1965, an estimated two million students have \ngraduated from college with the special assistance and support of our \nNation's TRIO Programs. These programs have been successful. Studies \nhave found that students in the Upward Bound program are four times \nmore likely to earn an undergraduate degree than those students from \nsimilar backgrounds who did not participate in TRIO, and students in \nthe TRIO Student Support Services program are more than twice as likely \nto remain in college than those students from similar backgrounds who \ndid not participate in the program. I am pleased that this bill will \nallow more eligible students to benefit from the TRIO Programs.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11164-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11164-S11165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RESTORING CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY AND HOMELAND DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, last week, late in the week, Senator Byrd \nand I held a press conference. The reason we held this press conference \nwas to indicate that we believe we need to do something to restore \nconfidence in the economy. We also believe that part of restoring \nconfidence in the economy is making sure that homeland defense is \nsomething that is more than just words.\n  We are proposing things that cost money. It is great to talk about \nhomeland defense, but if there is no money attached to it, it becomes a \nshallow promise to the American people.\n  Some of the things that Senator Byrd and I have talked about have to \ndo with bio-terrorism. We believe there should be some prevention. \nMadam President, if you are going to have good, high-quality medical \ncare, you have to have preventive medical care. The way to reduce costs \nand have a healthier public is to put our resources in the front end, \nnot wait until everybody is sick and in the hospital. Bio-terrorism is \nno different. We need to have prevention and response. We need to have \nfood safety initiatives. We have so few food inspections now. I believe \nI heard my friend from Iowa say, in a debate in this Senate Chamber \nlast week, that about 1 percent of the food in our country is \ninspected. We need to do better. We need to make sure that State and \nlocal governments, who have responsibilities in this area, have some \ncapacity to do that.\n  We believe there should be upgrades to State and local health \ndepartments. We believe we have to take a look at hospitals to make \nsure there is enough hospital capacity.\n\n  We want to accelerate the purchase of vaccines. In America, this huge \ncountry of 270 million people, we believe we should have an adequate \nnumber of vaccines that are under the direction of the Centers for \nDisease Control. We need to make sure we have adequate supplies. If we \ndo not use them, fine; but we should have them available. And to \naccelerate the purchase of these vaccines is going to cost money.\n  Antibiotics: We know we have an inadequate supply of antibiotics. We \nneed to make sure there is a satisfactory supply of these antibiotics \nfor all the problems that may arise. And that is true for other \npharmaceutical supplies.\n  We need to make sure there is better security for our labs.\n  These things I have just enumerated will cost about $3 billion.\n  I came to Washington with Tom Ridge. He and I were in the House of \nRepresentatives together. I have maintained a friendship with him, \nincluding the time he was Governor of Pennsylvania.\n  A year ago, we traveled to Israel and the Middle East together, and \nwe spent some time together. I have great respect for him as a person \nand for his abilities. But I truthfully say that I am not sure he is \ngoing to be able to do what is going to be required of him unless he \nhas the resources to do it.\n  I had a meeting in with him last week. What he suggested was: Let me \ndetermine, first, what I need, and then I will come back and tell you \nwhat I need.\n  I am willing to do that. But I am not going to stand in the \nbackground and deprive him of the resources to do his job.\n  We have 40 agencies that collect intelligence. I believe we need a \nperson who has authority to tell these entities what to do and what he \nneeds from them. So I am willing to wait for a reasonable period of \ntime for Governor Ridge to get back to us and tell us what he needs. \nBut if this is going to go onto a program where they are going to try \nto do his job and not spend any money, then I am going to move forward \nand give him the tools I believe he needs.\n  I am willing to wait for him to tell me what tools he needs, but if I \nget nothing in the reasonable future, then I am going to go ahead and \ndo something on my own.\n  In New York, we learned to do something that should have been done a \nlong time ago; that is, to develop nationwide appreciation for the \npolice officers and firefighters.\n  In my past, I was a police officer for a period of time here in \nWashington, DC. I have always had great respect for the police. But it \nwas not until I went to the State legislature in Nevada that I \ndeveloped the respect for firefighters that I have.\n  When I went there, they were trying to pass legislation.\n  One of the things they told us, that there were more people who die \nand are injured fighting fires than police officers who die or are hurt \nin the line of duty. Firefighters have all kinds of problems on a daily \nbasis. This was exemplified by the tragedy at the World Trade Center \nwhen hundreds of firefighters died in that terrible attack. We need $6 \nbillion to make sure the State and local antiterrorism investments are \nthere for our police and fire departments. We need to have firefighting \ngrants to allow local governments to have the capacity to train these \npeople better. So for State and local antiterrorism investments for \npolice and fire departments and additional firefighting grants, that \nfigure is $1.6 billion.\n  We need to also recognize that the FBI needs more assistance. All \nFederal law enforcement needs help. That includes computer \nmodernization, especially for the FBI. They need additional agents. \nThey are working long hours and getting worn down since September 11. I \nam not going to state in the Chamber the numbers of people in the Las \nVegas Customs office. To do so would be embarrassing to me and to our \ncountry. It is the same all over the country. We are asking the U.S. \nCustoms to do all kinds of things legislatively that they don't have \nthe staff to do. We need a huge additional amount of money to take care \nof Customs.\n  We know that the terrorists who came and did the acts of September 11 \ndidn't come over the southern border we hear so much about. They came \nthrough the northern border. We need to make sure there is more funding \nfor the Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, and U.S. Attorneys. Our courts need more \nmoney, as does the U.S. Marshals Service. What I have\n\n[[Page S11165]]\n\ntalked about here, starting with the FBI, is going to cost us about \n$1.7 billion.\n  We know most of the time who comes into this country, but once they \ncome here, they are lost in a maze of 270 million people. We need the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to improve their tracking of \npeople who are in this country and people who are on student visas. I \nbelieve we should do all we can to have exchange programs and have \npeople study in our great universities. Out of the approximately 135 \ngreat universities in the world, 121 of them are in the United States. \nIt is great we have people who want to come from other countries to \nstudy here. But we need to make sure that once they come here, they are \nnot lost in the maze of people in the United States.\n  We need border enhancements, improved tracking of people, including \npeople on student visas. This is going to cost about $1.5 billion. We \nknow that airport security is going to cost more money, about $1 \nbillion. Transit security is also important, $1.1 billion. We need to \nmake sure there is adequate Federal security protection in Federal \nfacilities such as nuclear plants and border facilities, national \nparks, and water projects. That will cost over $1 billion.\n  Enhancements for highways: I believe if we are going to have a real \nstimulus package in this country, we are going to have to do something \nwith job creation. It is not going to be done all on the tax side. We \nhave to create jobs.\n  For every billion dollars, for example, we spend on highways, we \ncreate 42,000 jobs. So much needs to be done with our highways. This \nwould be an immediate pick-up, an immediate stimulus to our economy all \nover America, whether it is New York or Nevada or any of the other 48 \nStates. There are projects that have been designed, and the only thing \nholding up the projects from going forward is money. We would create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs if we decided to spend $4 billion on \nthese projects.\n\n  We could easily spend $2.5 billion for enhancement of highways. We \ncould allocate $2.1 billion for clean and safe drinking water projects. \nIndian Health Service clinics and other initiatives need to be taken \ncare of.\n  There needs to be a direct, strong movement to restore confidence in \nour economy. One way we can do that is to create jobs. The other way, \nand they go together, is to restore confidence in our homeland defense.\n  I have discussed with Senator Abraham, Governor Ridge, the head of \nthe FBI, and the head of the CIA the need to have a place for training \npeople who are part of our counter-terrorism task force. I am very \nprovincial in this. I understand that. But the Nevada test site, where \nwe set off 1,000 nuclear devices over the years, is a place as large as \nRhode Island. It has mountains, valleys, deserts, dry lakes. It has a \nfacility already there for testing chemical spills. It has huge \ndormitories and restaurants. It is a place that is waiting for some \nactivity.\n  In addition to that, if we want to test hardened silos that Saddam \nHussein and people in Afghanistan have dug and built, we can use a \nnetwork of tunnels that have been built there for nuclear testing over \nthe years that are miles long. So as part of restoring confidence in \nthe economy, we should have this national terrorism center.\n  I only hope that we all understand that it is extremely important we \nnot walk out of here with a stimulus package that is driven solely by \ntax cuts. I acknowledge that there are certain things we can do that \nare important on the tax side. There are other things we need to do. We \nneed to look at those people who have been displaced in the September \n11 aftermath.\n  Senator Carnahan offered an amendment on the airline security bill. \nIt was a good amendment that failed on a party-line vote. That is too \nbad. We need to make sure before we leave here that the Carnahan \namendment passes. We must do that.\n  We also must recognize that people who have been displaced not only \nhave problems of unemployment, but they have no health insurance. We \nhave to do something to extend COBRA or somehow to take care of COBRA.\n  While we talk about these extended unemployment benefits, we have to \nunderstand that unemployment compensation is a bridge to nowhere unless \nthere is a job on the other end of it. We have to make sure we do \nsomething about that.\n  I spoke last evening to Senator Nelson of Florida. I have spoken to \nthe two Senators from New York and other States who have an interest in \ntourism. That includes at least 30 States that have tourism as the No. \n1, 2, or 3 most important economic forces in their States. We have to \nboost tourism.\n  There has been general agreement that we should look at a program to \ngive a tax credit to people who travel--short-term, of course. We need \nto take a look and see if we need to restore the deductibility for \nbusiness meals to stimulate the economy in that regard.\n  Senator Dorgan and I introduced legislation last week that would look \nat the ancillary businesses inside the airline business, such as rental \ncar companies and travel agencies. These people also need a shot in the \narm.\n  If we walk out of here this year and don't take into consideration \nthe fact that we need to restore confidence in the economy by creating \njobs and making sure people feel good about our homeland defense \nissues, we will have made a big mistake.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act of 2001 as amendment to the fiscal year 2002 \nLabor-HHS bill. I am joined by my friend and partner in this endeavor, \nSenator Wellstone.\n  We are well aware of many of the arguments that will be made against \nour amendment. For instance, while the nation is rightly focused on \nrecovering from the trauma and damage inflicted on September 11, it \nwould be wrong to overlook this important issue because it is simply \nthe right course of action to undertake. We are well past the time to \nact on extending and building on the federal mental health parity law \nthat expired on September 30.\n  Others will argue that our amendment costs too much. However, CBO has \nscored our bill as costing less than one percent 0.9 percent and again \npassing this bill is long overdue and the right thing do for the \nmillions of Americans suffering from a mental illness. The number of \nAmericans suffering from a mental illness or the number of family \nmembers affected by a mental illness has not magically decreased over \nthe past couple of months.\n  We are ready for a vigorous debate on a host of issues, but I would \nlike to begin by saying: Our bill has 64 bipartisan cosponsors; the \nHELP Committee reported out the bill on August 1 by a vote of 21-0; 144 \norganizations support the bill; and CBO has scored the bill as raising \ninsurance premiums by 0.9 percent.\n  The human brain is the organ of the mind and like the other organs of \nour body, it is subject to illness. And just as we must treat illnesses \nto our other organs, we must also treat illnesses of the brain.\n  Building upon that, I would ask the following question: what if \nthirty years ago our nation had decided to exclude heart disease from \nhealth insurance coverage? Think about some of the wonderful things we \nwould not be doing today like angioplasty, bypasses, and valve \nreplacements and the millions of people helped because insurance covers \nthese procedures.\n  I would submit these medical advances have occurred because insurance \ndollars have followed the patient through the health care system. The \npresence of insurance dollars has provided an enticing incentive to \ntreat those individuals suffering from heart disease.\n  But sadly, those suffering from a mental illness do not enjoy those \nsame benefits of treatment and medical advances because all too often \ninsurance discriminates against illnesses of the brain. More often than \nnot, opponents of mental health parity argue the costs are too great. \nHowever, I would submit the cost of parity is negligible, especially, \nwhen contrasted with the cost impact upon society. The devastating \nconsequences inflicted upon not only those suffering from a mental \nillness, but their families, their friends, and their loved ones.\n  Furthermore, the following are several additional costs that result \nfrom mental illness: 16 percent of all individuals incarcerated in \nState and local jails suffer from a mental illness; suicide is \ncurrently a national public health crisis, with approximately 30,000 \nAmericans committing suicide every year; of the 850,000 homeless \nindividuals in the United States, about one-third or 300,000 of those \nindividuals suffer form a serious mental illness; and finally what \nabout the people that are crying out for help and society only hears \ntheir cries after they have committed a violent act against themselves \nor others.\n\n  Just look, at the tragic incidents in Houston with the mother killing \nher five children, the Baptist church in Dallas/Forth Worth, and the \nUnited States Capitol to see the common link: a severe mental illness. \nUnfortunately, there is no place that a community can take these \nindividuals for help. The police can do very little and likewise for \nhospitals.\n  Some of you may have seen last year's 4 part series of articles in \nthe New York times reviewing the cases of 100 rampage killers.\n  Most notably the review found that 48 killers had some kind of formal \ndiagnosis for a mental illness, often schizophrenia: 25 of the killers \nhad received a diagnose of mental illness before committing their \ncrimes; 14 of 24 individuals prescribed psychiatric drugs had stopped \ntaking their medication prior to committing their crimes.\n  In particular I would point to a couple of passages from the series:\n\n       They give lots of warning and even tell people explicitly \n     what they plan to do.\n       . . . a closer look shows that these cases may have more to \n     do with society's lack of knowledge of mental health issues . \n     . . In case after case, family members, teachers and mental \n     health professionals missed or dismissed signs of \n     deterioration.\n\n  Now let us look at the number of individuals suffering from some of \nthe dreaded mental illnesses.\n  Major depressive disorder: 9.9 million American adults age 18 and \nolder suffer from this disorder in a given year;\n  Bipolar disorder: 2.3 million American adults age 18 and older suffer \nrrom this disorder in a given year;\n  Schizophrenia: 2.2 million American adults age 18 and order suffer \nfrom this disorder in a given year; and\n  Obsessive--compulsive disorder: 3.3 million American adults age 18-54 \nsuffer from this disorder in a given year.\n  However, medical science is in an era where we can accurately \ndiagnose mental illnesses and treat those afflicted so they can be \nproductive.\n  I would ask then, why with facts like these would we not cover these \nindividuals and treat their illnesses like any other disease? We should \nnot.\n  Working together, we took a historic first step with the passage of \nthe Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, but that law is also not working \nas intended. While there may be adherence to the letter of the law, \nthere are violations of the spirit of the law.\n  For instance, ways are being found around the law by placing limits \non the number of covered hospital days and outpatient visits. \nConsequently, Senator Wellstone and I have again joint forces and \nintroduced the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2001.\n  The bill seeks a very simple goal: provide the same mental health \nbenefits already enjoyed by Federal employees.\n  The bill is modeled after the mental health benefits provided through \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and expands the Mental \nHealth Parity Act of 1996 by prohibiting a groups health plan from \nimposing treatment limitations or financial requirements on the \ncoverage of mental health benefits unless comparable limitations are \nimposed on medical and surgical benefits.\n  At 2:25 this afternoon, an amendment arrived at the desk. I read off \nthe names of the cosponsors, but I did not name the bill. So let me do \nthat. This bill is called a mental health parity amendment. Another way \nof talking about it is that it is the mental health parity bill put \ninto an amendment form. So we will not have to wait any longer to have \na national debate as to whether insurance companies in the future--not \nthis year but one full year from now is the way we have drafted the \nbill--will or will not be able to insure people against their illnesses \nand/or diseases and provide less coverage for the mentally ill as \ndefined in this bill than they do for other well-recognized diseases \nsuch as cancer, diabetes, whatever they may be.\n  That means the thousands upon thousands of American families who have \nyoung people in their teens with schizophrenia--well diagnosed, they \nare told by the medical people what they have, they are subject to \ntreatment, to medication and, yes, a very long life of difficulty if, \nin fact, they do not have medication and treatment facilities in these \ngreat United States, the last group of Americans who have no health \ninsurance because they are defined out of the coverage by the \nconventional approach to what is a disease and an illness and what is \nnot. They are left out.\n  So if one goes to New York or Chicago or, yes, Albuquerque, and finds \nstreet people and watches them and looks at them and says, oh, my, what \nare they doing, they will find that fully between 33 percent and 40 \npercent are\n\n[[Page S11167]]\n\nsick. That is why they are there. They are sick and they probably have \nno insurance coverage, even though they are as sick as someone's next \ndoor neighbor who had a heart attack and is being taken care of in the \nbest heart facility at the local hospital, and the insurance company \npays the bill.\n  We have had a history in America of not covering the mentally ill \nunder conventional, typical insurance coverage. Quite to the contrary, \nwe have sat by and watched insurance companies--obviously they are \ndoing the best they can and this is part of their business. They are \nremaining solvent and being able to insure people at the most \nreasonable prices. The insurance companies come along and say: Since we \nare not obligated to do so, we will not cover the mentally ill; or if \nwe do, they will be covered with a much smaller total coverage number, \nand everything about the coverage will be less than what we cover for \npeople with the ordinary diseases that we so often talk about, \nincluding the great strides being made in heart disease treatment, \nheart disease research, heart disease care, or any of the other \ndiseases we are so free to talk about. Somebody is being taken care of. \nThe insurance company is paying the bill. New buildings rise up to \ncover them because they are insured.\n\n  That is a great resource, coming directly from the back of the \ninsured to the marketplace, the marketplace of paying for the best \ndoctors, of paying for facilities. If somebody can pay for them, you \nare apt to build them.\n  What about the mentally ill? The mentally ill have no facilities to \nspeak of--just a few--because nobody will pay for them. There are no \nspecialty clinics to speak of. There is very little private sector \ninvolvement in building health facilities where the mentally ill can be \ntaken to make sure they take their medicine and are cared for. In the \nordinary language of the marketplace, there is no money in it. There is \nno money in it because the people are not insured.\n  Five plus years ago, my friend Senator Wellstone and I passed the \nfirst parity bill. It was partial parity. It caused the discrimination \nagainst the mentally ill under insurance policies to go away partially. \nIt just expired. This bill, that is now in amendment form, passed out \nof the committee 21 to 0. A couple of Republican Senators want to offer \namendments, and I am pleased they can offer them now, this afternoon. \nWe tried our best to get the bill called up as a freestanding bill, \nhoping we would be given a day, 2, or 3 days. We could never get it \ndone because there were some Senators--and it is their privilege and \nprerogative--who thought that we don't need to mandate coverage, even a \nyear and a half from now, as we do here, and we do not need to cover \nthe mentally ill that doctors define as having a brain disease and \nshould have coverage. Some think their cause of not covering it is \nbetter served if we never get this bill up.\n  I understand what a great imposition this is on the appropriations \nprocess and on the two wonderful Senators managing this bill, but I \ndon't see any other way to do it. There are millions of Americans who \nhave worked through their organizations. There are 140 organizations in \nAmerica supporting this legislation. Some have a special interest. Some \nwill receive better payment for taking care of the mentally ill. Some, \nsuch as the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill, understand the \nplight of people with schizophrenia, the plight of people with bipolar \ndiseases, the manic-depressive. They understand what parents are going \nthrough in America.\n  These diseases do not always strike the elderly or the young. As a \nmatter of fact, one of the most dread of these diseases has a \npropensity for showing itself when our young people are teenagers, \nbetween the ages of 17 and 18, up to 25 or 30. At this age the disease \ncauses a great disability and poses a major problem for care of a son \nor daughter. Across this land thousands of people have already gone \nbroke, cashing out every asset they own, trying to take care of their \nchild, while America looks on the insurance system and says: We cannot \ntell anybody what kind of insurance they should cover. We cannot tell \nany insurance company what they ought to cover. We take for granted \nthat they will cover heart conditions, heart research, they will cover \nany of the other diseases we more or less call ``physical'' diseases. \nOn the periphery sits the mentally ill with little or no coverage.\n\n  My good friend, Senator Wellstone, and I have been joined by 65 \nSenators. I sent this to the desk at 2:25. This is a very historic \ntime. This amendment will pass, if not today, tomorrow. And today we \nwill finally have made the Senate vote. I am convinced they will vote \nyes, let's get this started; get rid of this discrimination that has \nfestered long enough in terms of the health coverage system of the \nUnited States. Before the day is out, I believe the number of Senators \nwill go up, not down.\n  For those frightened for small business, the committee, headed by \nSenator Kennedy, the committee we entrusted with our bill, which has \nthe jurisdiction, has the authority to decide to send us a bill or not, \ndecided, in order to have great unity and the first time through to get \nDemocrats and Republicans on board, they would make an exception for \nsmall business. Everyone should know, all businesses with 50 employees \nor fewer are exempt; we are not mandating this coverage at this point. \nSmall businesses that might be worried about this, or Senators who \nmight be worried in their behalf, can read this bill. They will find \nthat exemption.\n  There is much more to say. Taking this up at the end of the year does \nnot do this bill justice. It is a major undertaking by the legislative \nbranch of the U.S. Government, led by the Senate. Nonetheless, we are \ngoing to proceed. To those who procedurally are determined not to let \nus have a straight vote, you will find a few changes in this bill from \nthe language that came out of the committee. We wanted to make sure \nthis bill was as protected as we could make it from procedural motions \non the floor. It is not effective until the year 2003. That cures a lot \nof procedural problems some might have had. It is not subject to a \npoint of order, a 60-vote point of order, because of that change and 2 \nor 3 other changes we made in order to see to it we got a straight up-\nor-down vote.\n  For the mentally ill, the schizophrenic whose family is desperately \ntrying to take care of them, or someone suffering the great delusions \nthat are typical, the mammoth delusions that are common for a \nschizophrenic or for the bipolar suffering--for some unknown reason, \nthey can be in a very low mood and then as high as they can get, and in \nbetween the highs and lows is a great inability to live a normal life--\nthis is the best we can do for those families in America, for those \nmillions suffering. We have to offer it today. We have to get the \nSenate to say yes or no on whether coverage by insurance policies is \npart of the normal, everyday coverage for health care, whether or not \nit will include that portion of Americans.\n  Obviously, these dread diseases are not typical only to America. In \nany particular area where a group of humans live, there is a certain \npercentage who will turn up with schizophrenia. There is a certain \ngroup that will turn up with the enormous ups and downs of the bipolar \ndisease I described.\n  There is also clinical depression, which probably has more victims \nthan any other in terms of numbers. What does depression bring, along \nwith the other two diseases I mentioned? A total loss of hope; \nsuicides, which are growing in numbers, especially among teenagers. \nMore times than not when that event occurs, the trail of symptoms \nindicates if they had been treated for depression, it probably would \nnot have happened.\n  In any event, I am prepared to go on much longer and in much more \ndetail.\n  For those who want us to delay consideration of this measure, I urge \nyou to come down. See if I am correct. I don't think you have a \nparliamentary way of avoiding having the Senate vote. I don't think \nthere is a way that you can make it subject to a point of order where \nwe will need 60 votes. I don't believe there is a point of order with \nreference to the budgetary impact because we are able to understand in \nadvance those kinds of procedural approaches. The bill is no longer \nsubject to those kinds of procedural attacks.\n  We feel good about it. We would like to spend some time talking about \nthe reality of this bill and what it will and won't do.\n  I close by saying the last argument that will come from those who \noppose\n\n[[Page S11168]]\n\nit is: Can we afford it? I assume they will also say: We are now in a \nrecession. So we really can't afford it.\n  I just told you it is not effective until 2003. We give everyone time \nto get out of the recession. Besides that, in terms of budgetary \nproblems, the best estimate we have, and we will put it in the Record \nshortly, is the Congressional Budget Office saying when fully \nimplemented, this may increase the cost of health insurance by nine-\ntenths of 1 percent. That is what the Congressional Budget Office says.\n  I have given you the small business exemption. I have given you the \nexperts' cost. I have given you when it will come into effect. Later on \nwe will discuss who is covered by it. That is still something to be \ndiscussed. Some will want to know whether we made it too broad, whether \nwe covered too many people, and whether we covered them in language \nthat is so vague so that the disease is not adequately defined. We \nthink we have done all of those things.\n  We are pleased to engage later in the day with anybody who would like \nto talk about that.\n  I yield the floor. I thank Senator Wellstone for his help. We will be \nhere this afternoon defending this measure as long as we are needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I believe the Senator from \nPennsylvania wants to speak. I will defer to him. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I follow the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I compliment my distinguished colleague \nfrom New Mexico for his diligent work over a very long period of time \non this very important issue. When he talks about the measure, it is \nSenator Domenici, for himself, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Specter. \nI am second on the cosponsor list on his substantive amendment. When he \nasked me before submitting it whether I would be a cosponsor, I said \nthat I wanted to wait and see the discussion.\n  The concern that I have is the moving of this appropriations bill. My \ncolleague from New Mexico understands that full well. He is on the \nAppropriations Committee and is the chairman of the subcommittee. I \nthink it is a bill which ought to be enacted. I believe there ought to \nbe mental health parity. The reasons which he has given are very \npersuasive.\n  The concern I have is it is legislation on an appropriations bill, \nand the concern as to whether there are tax implications to include \ndeductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and catastrophic maximums which \nwould provide a basis for a so-called blue slip by the House of \nRepresentatives. We can handle that in due course. I am going to await \nthe arguments.\n  I would like to find some way to accommodate this amendment. I am \njust not sure at this point that it is possible. But I wanted to \nexpress those views at this time. I know the Senator from Minnesota is \nwaiting to comment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania. I know in discussions with the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand Senator Harkin from Iowa that we can go over all of the points. We \nhave made a special effort to deal with it.\n  First of all, I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici from New Mexico. \nIt has been my honor to have worked with him now for over half a decade \non this question.\n  I believe the Senate will pass this amendment. When we pass this \namendment, I think it will be viewed favorably by historians. I am not \ntrying to be melodramatic.\n  There are 67 Senators, Republican and Democrat alike, who support \nthis piece of legislation. It passed out of the HELP Committee by a 21-\nto-0 vote. There are 150 organizations that support it. There are two \nreasons.\n  First of all, this legislation is major civil rights legislation. We \nare coming to November 2001. When this amendment and bill pass, I \nbelieve we can keep it in conference. We will have passed a major piece \nof civil rights legislation which will say that we will no longer \npermit discrimination against those people who struggle with mental \nillness in our country.\n  This legislation says, when it comes to those who are struggling with \nthis illness, there will no longer be discrimination. It is modeled \nafter the Federal Employees Benefits Plan.\n  It basically says there will be the same requirements when it comes \nto deductibles, copays, and days in the hospital and outpatient visits.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts as chairman of the HELP \nCommittee for helping us get this through the Health Committee on a 21-\nto-0 vote. He and his staff have been there throughout all of the \nnegotiations and work on this bill.\n  I thank Senator Domenici. Next to Senator Domenici, I thank Senator \nKennedy.\n  I think there is going to be an overwhelmingly positive vote because \nit is just wrong for someone who is struggling with this kind of \nillness to be told they are going to have to pay a higher copay, and \nthey are going to have to pay a higher deductible. No health insurance \nplan will let them stay a few days in the hospital. No. They can only \nhave a certain number of outpatient visits.\n  We will not do that with someone who suffers from a heart condition, \nnor to someone who is suffering from diabetes, nor to someone who broke \ntheir ankle. We don't say to them they are going to be in the hospital \nonly 1 day and that is it, or 2 days and that is it. Nor would we \ncharge them high copays and deductibles to the point where they can't \nafford it.\n  We have to end the discrimination. It is 2001. The time has come for \nthis idea.\n  The Surgeon General in his report said close to 20 percent of \nAmerican people struggle with this illness and 18 million people \nstruggle with depression.\n  I have had the honor of working with Al and Mary Kluesner from \nMinnesota. They started an organization. It is now a national \norganization. It is called SAVE. Two of their children committed \nsuicide. They have two children who are doing spectacularly well.\n  Up until very recently, a lot of families, parents, brothers, \nsisters, husbands, and wives blamed themselves when they lost a loved \none who took their life. There has been this shame. People have blamed \nthemselves. But now we know a lot more. Now we know how much of that is \nbiochemical. Now we know it can be diagnosed. Now we know it is \ntreatable. The success rate for treatment of those who are struggling \nwith depression is 80 percent.\n  Kay Jamison, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins who has tried to take \nher life twice, has written several powerful books. One book is called \n``An Unquiet Mind'' about her own experiences. Just a month ago she \nreceived the McArthur Award--the genius grant --for her work. She has \nwritten about the gap between what we know and what we do. It is \nlethal.\n  The Kluesners became involved and people all across the country have \nbecome involved. They no longer will accept the stigma. They no longer \nwill accept the discrimination. They have come out of the closet. They \nhave come out of the closet to speak for their loved ones because they \nknow it is a matter of life or death.\n  If we would end the discrimination, we would get the care to people; \nwe would save some lives.\n  Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people in our \ncountry. In Minnesota, it is the second leading cause of death.\n  So much of this can be diagnosed. So much of this is preventable. \nThat is why this amendment and this legislation is so important.\n  It is not just a question of civil rights. It is not just a question \nof saying it is the end of discrimination. It is also a question of \nwhat we can now do as a nation. Because if our health care plans--\nmodeled after the plan that we participate in, the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan--say there will be no difference in terms of the \nway we treat this illness versus any physical illness, then, I say to \nSenator Domenici, the care will follow the money. Once the health care \nplans provide the coverage, you will have an infrastructure of care out \nthere for people that we do not have right now.\n\n  There will be arguments and counterarguments, and I am ready for all \nof them.\n  Let me just make a couple more points because I will be in this \nChamber for a while with this amendment,\n\n[[Page S11169]]\n\nand other Senators are in the Chamber right now.\n  There was a young woman named Anna Westin. Her mom and dad, Kitty and \nMark Westin, have brought parents together as well. They have brought \nparents together because their daughter--a beautiful young woman--\nstruggled with anorexia. Same issue: She tried to get coverage from the \nplan. It was the Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan in Minnesota. They could \nnot get the coverage for the days in-hospital that she needed to be \nthere. They lost their daughter.\n  By the way, Blue Cross/Blue Shield has made a settlement with them \nand is going to do much better in terms of providing the coverage. I \ncannot make a one-to-one correlation and say because she did not get \ncoverage, therefore, Anna took her life. But I can tell you this: I \nhave met with parents, I promise you, all across the country who have \ntold me about what it means when they cannot get coverage to take care \nof their children.\n  I went down to Houston; and Sheila Jackson-Lee had a hearing she \nwanted to do with me. It dealt with mental health and children. It was \nunbelievable the number of people who came who wanted to speak about \ntheir desperate story with their own children. At this public hearing, \nthe guy who was the head of the corrections system for one of the \nlargest counties in the United States of America--I could not believe \nwhat he said--said: I am a law and order person. Nobody seemed to doubt \nthat. And he said: I want to tell you, a lot of people believe that if \nthese kids are locked up in our facilities, they have done something \nwrong. He said: I want to tell you--I think the figure he used was 40 \npercent--40 percent of these kids, if they had gotten some help, would \nnot even be in jail. They should not be locked up. It is the only place \nthe parents can get any help for them.\n  There was a time when we talked about how we institutionalized \npeople, we warehoused people struggling with mental illness--adults and \nchildren in institutions. Now we are warehousing them in our jails, and \nmany people should not be there--many children should not be there.\n  So this legislation ends the discrimination for a broad range of \nmental illnesses that affect adults and children.\n  This legislation has an exclusion for small business so that \nbusinesses are not covered unless they have 50 employees or more.\n  This bill has been scored by CBO as costing no more than a 1-percent \nincrease in premium. Then there is the benefit of what happens when we \nfinally end the discrimination and what happens when we finally provide \nthe coverage for people.\n  We had testimony--my last point because I will have a chance to speak \nlater--before the HELP Committee, I say to Senator Kennedy. There were \na number of people who came in--I wish I could remember all of their \nnames: doctors, psychiatrists, social workers--and they were talking \nabout the aftermath of September 11. I am not mixing agendas. I am \nbeing as intellectually honest as I can.\n\n  One woman, who worked with the firefighters, said: I want to tell you \nthat given what people have gone through, you are going to have to have \nan infrastructure of mental health care. Her name is Dr. Kerry Kelly. \nShe talked about her experiences with her onsite work as chief medical \nofficer of the New York Fire Department. She just basically said: Look, \nwe are going to need a lot of help for family members. And people have \nbeen saying that all across the country.\n  So, I say to colleagues, please consider this legislation civil \nrights in ending discrimination. Colleagues, please consider this \nlegislation as a way of finally providing the care to men, women, and \nchildren who, if they are provided with the care, can go on and lead \ngood, productive lives. And, colleagues, also please consider this \nlegislation preparedness legislation. The truth is, no longer, when we \ntalk about health care for adults or health care for children, or \npublic health, or what we have to do, can we not consider mental health \npart of the cake. It is part of how we deliver humane and dignified and \naffordable health care to people in the country.\n  This is about as important a piece of legislation as I think we can \npass. But, look, I have my biases. I came here as a Senator who has a \nbrother who has struggled with this illness all of his life. When I was \nelected in 1990, I thought if there was one thing I would try to do, \nfor sure, I would try to end this discrimination in coverage. For sure, \nI wanted to make sure that people were able to get the help they \nneeded.\n  I have had a chance to work with Senator Domenici for over half a \ndecade. And I have had a chance to work with Senator Kennedy for over a \ndecade. Now is the moment where we can pass this legislation as a part \nof this bill. And I think we can keep it in conference. This would be a \nhuge step forward for our country.\n  We need each other as never before. There is an ethic going on in \nthis country about the ways we can help one another. I think that is \nall for the good in the most difficult of times. This would be the best \npossible way of living up to this value and this ethic, to adopt this \namendment with an overwhelming vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate and thank \nour two leaders in this extremely important bill in the area of health \npolicy--Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone--for ensuring that the \nSenate will have an opportunity to address one of the most compelling \nhealth care issues we are faced with in our society. I thank them for \ntheir constant support on this issue over the years.\n  We have had debates on mental health parity on a number of different \noccasions, but with the shaping and the fashioning of this amendment, \nthis really is the moment of truth on this issue. This is the time to \ntake action.\n  Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone deserve all of our thanks for \ntheir leadership and the work they have done. I would also thank those \nwho have been a part of the process in helping us develop the \nlegislation, the scores of families who came and testified and shared \nsome of the great personal challenges they have faced as they have \ndealt with the challenges of mental illness in their families, deserve \na great deal of credit.\n  We express to them that the best way we can ever thank them for being \nwilling to share some of the great challenges they have faced over a \nlifetime of care and dedication and commitment--and in a number of \ninstances financial ruin--is to have real parity in our health care \nsystem. This legislation will do that for us.\n  I was listening to both of our colleagues and remember so much of the \nsimilar debate we had back in 1996 on the HIPAA legislation, when both \nSenator Domenici and Senator Wellstone brought these matters to the \nfloor of the Senate at that time. A number of our colleagues spoke with \ngreat passion and great commitment, and we thought we had made a \nsubstantial downpayment in moving us irrevocably in that direction. \nBut, nonetheless, we were not able to do so because there were those \nwho were able to find ways of circumventing the legislation and finding \nways of subverting both the intent and, for me personally, even the \nletter of the law. The Senate voted for it overwhelmingly, Republican \nand Democrats alike.\n\n  Over the years, this body has been somewhat slow in finally \nresponding to science rather than ideology. For years, those who were \nchallenged mentally were too often put aside in our society and denied \na position of respect and dignity. They were shunned. They were looked \ndown on. They were pitied. They were, in many instances, abused. Their \nlot was not a good one in America.\n  Then, more recently, that attitude has changed. I would like to \nbelieve there has been a new sense of respect for the valuing of \nindividuals on the basis of their character rather than, as was used \nwith these words, ``the color of their skin'' or their gender or their \nethnicity or their disability. We have made important progress.\n  What we have seen over time is corresponding progress in being able \nto deal with the challenges of mental illness. We have made real \nprogress. Now there is really no excuse whatsoever. Now there is no \nreason whatsoever to deny the Senate the opportunity this\n\n[[Page S11170]]\n\nafternoon to move toward true equality and true parity in terms of \nmental health.\n  If we look at some of the mental disorders that are most common in \nterms of challenges to our communities, one is bipolar disorder, \nanother is depression. Compare those to the physical disorders of \nhypertension and diabetes, common illnesses, common challenges we face; \nyou find that the treatment success rates for these chronic diseases of \nbipolar disorder and depression far exceed those for hypertension and \ndiabetes. This is true across the board. Not everyone understands it; \nnot everyone believes it. But increasingly, the medical information and \ntestimony and results indicate that mental illness is treatable. It is \nsuch a statement of hope for families to know that, if they get the \nappropriate treatment, they can free the individuals facing these \nchallenges from some of the torments they are facing in the course of \ntheir lives. We have made enormous strides. We are making enormous \nstrides.\n  Our two colleagues share my belief that we are at the time of the \nlight science century--with the mapping of the DNA, stem cell research, \nand all sorts of recent exciting medical breakthroughs. We view the \nopportunities for continued progress in this area, such as in the year \nof the brain, where we have had very profound research and discoveries \non what impacts thought process in people's minds. We have made \nenormous progress, not only in understanding but also in dealing with \nthese issues.\n  The question is, why not have parity? It is so compelling and so \nnecessary.\n  I will digress for a moment and thank our colleagues for bringing \nthis to our attention at this time in our country's history. All of us \nstill are sensing the powerful emotions we felt on September 11. We \nknow anxiety still exists for so many families, not only as a result of \nthe particular enormous tragedy that was so devastating to so many \nfamilies but also its impact on our Nation as a whole and, more \nrecently, the challenges we are facing in terms of the dangers of \nAnthrax. We know it has only directly affected some 15 of our fellow \ncitizens, but we know that the fear and the anxiety among our fellow \ncitizens is significant.\n  I dare say, this anxiety has impacted no group more than the children \nof our country. They are feeling this enormous anxiety. They are \nfeeling it not only as a result of September 11; they are also feeling \nit with regard to the threats of Anthrax and the whole threat of \nbioterrorism. There is a lot of anxiety in America today.\n\n  We don't expect this bill to solve all of the problems, but what it \nwill do is give the stamp of the U.S. Senate. Any fair review in the \nreading of the record is going to reflect very clearly that there are \nways of providing assistance to those who need the attention and the \ncare and the guidance and the support and the treatments that are out \nthere for American families.\n  The most obvious ones are those that have been involved in the \ncurrent rescue efforts at ground zero and their families. Having had an \nopportunity the other evening to talk to the head of the firefighters \nunion and to listen to him for a short period of time, I could already \nsee that the challenges that are going to be faced by so many of the \nfamilies involved are going to be severe.\n  We know that challenges still exists. We know now in recent years \nenormous progress has been made in understanding the very challenge of \nmental illness and mental disease. We know extraordinary progress has \nbeen made.\n  The only reason for not accepting this amendment may be the issue of \ncost. It always comes around to the issue of cost. At least it comes \naround so often by those who want to resist legislation.\n  That argument does not stand up in this case. We have experience in a \nnumber of the States on this issue. In our committee, this was raised \nas an issue. And we agreed to raise the exemption from companies with \n25 employees or less up to companies of 50 employees or less. That \nmeans approximately half of all working families in this country will \neffectively be covered, but there will still be many others left out. I \nregret that, quite frankly. But I am satisfied that if we get this in \nplace and we have the results that I know will come, we will be right \nback in a very short period to extend the exemption from employers of \nless than 50 down to 25.\n  The fact is, 23 States have passed parity laws. There is absolutely \nno evidence that any of them have experienced any significant increase \nin costs. We know that now as fact. We are not dealing with theories, \nestimates, or judgments by those who are opposed to it. We are dealing \nwith facts. The facts are as I have stated; there has not been a \nsignificant increase in cost.\n  The Senators from New Mexico and Minnesota would agree with me that \nwith an effective program providing mental health parity, you are \nprobably going to see a reduction in the cost of health care because \nwhen you treat the mental health challenges and the illnesses for \nindividuals, more often than not, it has a very positive impact in \nterms of other physical disabilities.\n  Those studies have been presented before our committee, and I am \nabsolutely convinced that even though this is going to provide \nadditional kinds of treatment for individuals who need it, the overall \nbottom line is going to be savings in health care expenditures. We have \nseen examples of it. I won't take the Senate's time right now to go \ninto those studies, but a very compelling case has been made.\n  If you think back to it logically, you will see the reasons for it. \nThe first reason is to assist families and individuals by increasing \nthe nation's capability to provide mental health services to Americans \nwho need it. It is a grave mark on our national consciousness if we \nhave the ability to assist these families and we do not do so. This \nlegislation will ensure that we are going to do it.\n  Secondly, with the progress that has been made with these \nbreakthrough treatments and medicines, we have the chance to make a \nimportant difference to our fellow citizens in their lives and the \nlives of their families and to have an enormous positive impact on our \nfellow citizens.\n  Finally, this is not going to be an additional burden in terms of \ncost. This is a compelling case. It has been made eloquently and \npassionately by two of those who have given their commitments and the \nforce of their arguments--Senators Domenici and Wellstone. They have \nmade this case time in and time out. It is time for the Senate to act. \nIt is essential that we act, and I hope this will pass overwhelmingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to be a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  First of all, I wish to express my gratitude for the leadership shown \nby Senator Wellstone and Senator Domenici. They brought to the Senate, \nwith this unique partnership they have formed, something that will be \nlong remembered. They are from different political parties, two \nindividuals with different views on almost everything in political \nlife. In the last 6 or 7 years in the Senate, they have brought \ntogether something that has been very dynamic. As a result of their \nleadership, laws have been changed in this country, attitudes have been \nchanged in this country, and the entire United States owes a debt of \ngratitude to these two men.\n  We have all had experiences with diseases where we may have said, \nyes, my cousin, my brother, my father, or my neighbor had this same \ndisease--whether it is cancer, heart disease, whatever the condition--a \nmedical problem with which we have all had experience. If we are honest \nwith ourselves--and we are becoming so--if we talk about mental \nillness, it is the same thing.\n  How many of us have relatives who have clinical depression? Lots of \nus. How many know of members of our families who have bipolar \ndisorders? That is a relatively new term but something we understand. \nThe same applies--whether it is cancer or heart disease, it applies to \nthis.\n  I have been stunned by how many people have been affected by a \nsuicide. It is no secret in this body that my father committed suicide. \nIt is no secret that it took a long time for me to acknowledge it \npublicly and talk about my father's death. But since I have, every \nplace I go, people come to me and relate stories. For example, I was at \na TV interview in Las Vegas. One of the anchors who did the interview \nsaid: May I speak to you afterward? I said sure, and I waited. Her \nbrother committed suicide. Every place I go, people\n\n[[Page S11171]]\n\ncome up to me and say their mother, father, brother, or sister \ncommitted suicide. We know at least 31,000 people each year kill \nthemselves. There are really more because there are automobile \naccidents and other kinds of ``accidents'' that are not counted, but \nthey are suicides.\n  Many people deny that their loved ones have committed suicide. I try \nto have them be as forthcoming as I should have been many years ago \nabout my father. It affects us all.\n\n  That is what this amendment is all about--parity, making sure that \nheart disease is treated no differently than depression that leads to \nsuicide.\n  There is a tendency of some to think these problems are identifiable \nat a given age. Well, the sad reality of it is that mental illness \ndoesn't appear at any certain age. Children have mental disorders, \nmental problems. Teenagers develop them. People in their twenties and \nthirties have them.\n  Here are two examples. There is a woman I have gotten to know in \nWashington--a 78-year-old widow. She is a very pretty woman. Her \nhusband was extremely well educated. She has two sons. They both were \nhappy, with good jobs, in good professions. While in their forties, \nthey developed mental illness--both of them. Now she cares for her two \nsons. She is 78 years old. I visit her at least once a month. Some \nmonths they are in better shape than in other months. They are under \nmedication and treatment. But it has affected her life dramatically.\n  I often wonder what is going to happen. In fact, I don't know about \nthe one son. One, I know, was happily married with children before he \ngot sick. Now he is divorced. I often wonder what is going to happen to \nthese men after this woman passes away.\n  Another example is somebody I knew who was a great athlete in high \nschool, a high school all-American, college all-American, a \nprofessional athlete. I wonder what happened to him. All of a sudden, I \ndidn't see him on the roster and wondered what happened to him. He is \nin an institution--a mental institution. Who would ever guess it? I \nwill not mention his name. Who would ever guess he would have been in a \nmental institution--this fantastic athlete, tough, hard, and so good. \nHe is in a mental institution.\n  I recognize that there needs to be more done so that we accept mental \nillness more. That is what this legislation is all about. That is what \nmental parity is. That is the name these two men--Senators Wellstone \nand Domenici came up with, ``mental parity,'' or mental fairness, to \ntreat diseases the same, whether it is heart trouble or depression.\n  We are doing better than we were. One reason we are doing better, in \nmy opinion--the one to which I have devoted so much time, suicide--is \nwe have a man who is the Surgeon General who is a tremendous person. \nAll we had to do was talk to him about suicide and he knew something \nhad to be done. Dr. Satcher has worked tirelessly, since he became \nSurgeon General, to bring about change. He has worked with us to make \nsure there was money to study the causes of suicide. We don't know why \npeople commit suicide.\n  You would think the suicide would be in States--and I say this \nwithout any denigration whatsoever--where it is dark and cold in the \nwintertime, such as North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota, these cold \nStates, but it is not.\n  It is not. Suicide is west of the Mississippi, in States where the \nSun shines a lot, wide open plains and places for people to get \noutdoors. The 10 leading States in suicide are west of the Mississippi. \nWe do not know why, but we are studying why, and we hope to learn more.\n  In the Senate, we have passed resolutions recognizing the problems \nwith suicide. We are appropriating some money now. We are doing better.\n  To show this is a serious problem, I have a statement that indicates \nthat a telephone survey conducted by the Pew Research Center of the \npeople and the press a few days after the attacks on September 11 found \nthat 71 percent of respondents reported being depressed, 49 percent \nsaid they had difficulty concentrating, and 33 percent reported \ninsomnia.\n  We have all talked to our friends and relatives who after this attack \nare having trouble sleeping. For the first time these people are having \ntrouble sleeping.\n  In another study conducted 3 weeks after the attacks, respondents \nsaid they were depressed, and 20 percent 3 weeks after of the events \nsaid they were having trouble sleeping.\n  There should be full parity for mental illness. We have to make sure, \nas has been discussed today, that companies, businesses, and government \ndo not try to figure out some way to get around this. They should not \ndo that. It is the intent of this amendment that people with mental \nillness be treated as well, as fairly, and as equally as people with \nmedical illnesses. That is the purpose of this legislation.\n  If, in some subsequent time, someone is trying to figure out the \ncongressional intent, the intent of this is to have mental parity, to \nhave people who have mental illness treated the same as people with a \nmedical illness.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to the people who have us talking \nabout this issue, Senator Wellstone and Senator Domenici. But for their \nadvocacy, we would not be here today and we would not have been doing \nthings in the past 5 years. It is because of them we are considering \nthis amendment. I am personally indebted to them for the work they have \ndone to help those with no voice, to help those with no lobbyists, to \nhelp those who cannot help themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nlegislation and to add my name to this amendment. I join with others \nwho have thanked Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone for their \ndiligence and dedication on what is an extremely important issue. It is \nextremely important to all of our families.\n  I have been involved with mental health issues all of my adult life, \nstarting when I was in the State House of Representatives in Michigan \nchairing the Mental Health Committee and writing legislation we have in \nplace in Michigan for children, families, and adults. But today I rise \nin support of this amendment because of my personal situation.\n  My father, who was an extremely loving and wonderful man, a \nbusinessman in business with my grandfather in a car dealership in Eau \nClaire, MI, when I was growing up, in his mid-thirties found himself \nbeing diagnosed a manic-depressive. At first, we did not know what that \nmeant in terms of the highs and lows he was experiencing.\n  At that time--it was the midsixties--there was very little available \nin the community. It mostly was hospitalization for anyone who had any \nkind of mental health problems. We did not have a lot of money. Our \nfamily was not a wealthy family, and we struggled with attempts to get \nmy father adequate care.\n  One of the things we learned as we moved through this disease with \nhim was that mental illness is as physical as any disease that is now \ncovered by our insurance system. If you are a manic-depressive, that \nmeans you have chemicals in your brain that are off balance. They \nprovide too much of a stimulus that causes one to be awake, to go into \na manic state; it causes then too less of a stimulus, so one goes into \na depression and they may swing back and forth.\n\n  Just as we have now developed medicines to help those who have cancer \nand diabetes or those who have Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease--and \nwe are moving on all kinds of fronts to develop new medications--we \nhave medicine now for those who are diagnosed manic-depressive.\n  When my father was finally able to find someone who understood his \ndisease, there was something developed called Lithium, and he had the \nopportunity to begin taking that medication each month. He was able to \ngo back to his normal life. He was able to work and function and be a \npart of the community because this was a physiological disease that was \ntreatable by medication.\n  We know, whether it is schizophrenia, manic-depression, or other \ndiseases, that we are talking about imbalances in the brain. These are \nphysiological changes. These are health problems, as much of a health \nproblem as diseases that are covered by insurance.\n\n[[Page S11172]]\n\n  I cannot think of anything more basic than finally, in 2001, \nunderstanding in our health insurance system what we have now known in \nthe medical community for years, and that is: If we provide treatment, \nwe can treat those with mental illnesses as well as physical illnesses \nwith great success.\n  My colleagues have spoken to the fact if we do not do that, we will \ntreat them in our jails, we will treat folks who are homeless and under \nthe bridges sleeping at night. There will be some way that those who \nhave mental illnesses will find themselves in situations where they \nwill be reaching out, and we will be addressing it in some way in the \ncommunity. The question is, do we do it in a positive way in the health \ncare system where it needs to be addressed or will we be addressing it \nin some other way that is not positive?\n  I hope we will all come together. It would be wonderful to see \neveryone coming to the Chamber and supporting this long overdue \namendment on mental health parity. I hope my colleagues understand this \nhas been worked out. This is a bill that has been balanced. For those \nconcerned about small business, this is legislation addresses those \ncompanies with less than 50 employees being exempt, that there is a \nyear delay--there is a lot that has been put together in this \namendment.\n  I compliment my colleagues who have worked so hard to come up with a \nbalanced approach and yet proceed with the principle of mental health \nparity. In this day and age, shame on us if we do not understand the \nvariety of ways in which someone can become ill and require our health \nsystem to address those equally. It is long overdue. I strongly urge \nadoption of this amendment.\n  I again thank my colleagues who have come forward and have fought so \ndiligently for this principle for so many years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator before she leaves \nthe Chamber, I thank her very much for her remarks. I have been very \namazed in the 5 or 6 years I have been involved with mental illness \nissues as it pertains to Federal policy, as it pertains to State law, \nthe more I go out and meet people, whether it is in a townhall meeting \nwhere a lot of people from all walks of life come, or whether it is a \nspecial event where somebody is being honored and there is a lot of \nglitter around, or even if you go to New York for some kind of event \nand you are meeting the people of swank New York, wherever and \nwhenever, you always have more than one person walk up and tell you \nabout their family--schizophrenia, manic depression, clearly \ndepression, especially among young people, always somebody brings that \nup.\n\n  To be honest, it is so common as an illness that it is hard for this \nSenator to believe we are in this year, 2001, still letting people \nwrite insurance policies and act as if heart conditions and all the \nresearch that goes with it should be covered, even build hospital \nclinics because insurance companies are so willing to pay because that \ninsurer carries all of his resources on his back and builds new \nhospitals, builds new clinics, builds new techniques, builds more \nresearch, but all of these people who walk up to us and tell us their \nstory, there is no money, there is no coverage.\n  Some people will take that as this is a big philosophical difference. \nThey would say to Senator Domenici on the Republican side, why do you \nwant to tell anybody what to do? Why do you want to tell insurance \ncompanies what to do?\n  Frankly, I think when we started this process of what will insurance \ncompanies cover and what they will not, I asked a question of those who \nthink this is philosophical: What if we would have said a heart \ncondition is not covered by insurance. Why? Because the heart is part \nphysical and it is part spiritual, and we do not know enough about it \nso let us not cover it.\n  What do you think we would be doing today? Do you think we would get \nto 2001 in American chronology and we would still be having insurance \ncompanies say they are not covering heart conditions because 41 years \nago they should not have covered heart conditions because, after all, \nit is part spirit and part physical?\n  Those who oppose this legislation want to leave the millions of \nAmericans with severe mental illnesses right where they have been for \ndecades. They do not want to acknowledge there is treatment, that it is \ncostly, that one can get well, and that it is defined as brain disease \nin many parts of the medical community.\n  It is not something that is unlike any other illness. It is very much \nlike a lot of illnesses. It has a huge number of qualities that are the \nsame as mental illnesses that we are so concerned about that we would \nnot let an insurance company get by without covering them to the \nmaximum. We would have them here and we would be citing them for some \nkind of contempt of America if they did that, I would think.\n  So when the Senator from Michigan joins us and tells us the real \nfacts, it begins to show signs that the message is getting through.\n  Let me give one more example. When President Kennedy was the \nPresident, we were engaged in a very serious national effort with the \nseverely mentally ill who were locked in cages. We could tell a whole \nstory about that terrible part of American health care. As an ironic \nsituation, I might say they are no longer locked in cages as they were. \nAt that point in history, we decided that could not be done, they had \nto be let out.\n  Now more of the seriously mentally ill are in jails in America than \nthey are in hospitals. They are not in the cages. They are in jails \nbecause there is no place else to put them. They are getting arrested \nfor malfeasance, most of it small. When it gets to the big crimes, we \nhave a national argument about whether or not they are mentally insane \nwhen they commit mass murder.\n\n  In any event, the reality of it is we decided way back then that we \nwere going to treat the mentally ill differently. But what we thought \nwould happen was that across America there would be clinics, there \nwould be facilities built that would let the doctors treat the mentally \nill in a modern, hospitable, decent manner, not in the dungeons of the \npast.\n  Guess what happened. Nobody put up any money. Now one would say: \nWell, who should put up money? Either the Government ought to pay for \nsome facilities or there ought to be some coverage if it is an illness \nso that the insurance companies would pay for it based upon it being \ncarried by the mentally ill person. When they get sick, the insurance \ncomes into play. With that, the private sector may build many \nfacilities for the mentally ill. It is not going to happen until we do \nthat.\n  I thank the Senator so much for her remarks today. They were right \non, from this Senator's standpoint, and very relevant.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. One more time, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nhis commitment on this issue and the way he is able to explain the \nimportance of it.\n  I stress, along with the Senator, if we had private insurance \ncoverage, then the facilities would be there. They would know there is \na way for this to be paid for and, in fact, as we do with other kinds \nof health insurance, the hospitals would know there is a reimbursement \nsystem, the physicians would know there is a reimbursement system, and \nthey would know as well there would be for these mental illnesses.\n  I thank the Senator for his wonderful commitment and leadership, as \nwell as Senator Wellstone. I am hopeful we can move forward and that \nthis can truly be a historic day.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send to the desk a list of cosponsors. There were 65, \nplus the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Mexico if this \nhas been scored by the Office of Management and Budget?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What would be its impact on fiscal year 2002?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No impact on the year 2002. We have made the bill \noperative and effective in 2003.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to confer with the distinguished \nchairman of our committee, but we reached a firm agreement we would not \nexceed 686 for this year, and I do not know how that impacts taking on \na bill that will start impacting 2003. What would be the impact in \n2003?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Over $150 million a year. We knew of the agreement and \nthe binding nature of our agreement, and I felt bound by it in terms of \nhow much money for 2002, and I think that is literally for 2002 but not \n2003, 2004, or 2005. So we changed the effective date to 2003 in the \namendment before it was sent to the desk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I must express my reservation until we reach an \nunderstanding about how this will impact the agreement we made with the \nOffice of Management and Budget and with the House on this bill. It \ndoes add outyear expenditures, as I understand it. The Senator has \nindicated it does not impact 2002. I reserve judgment on this \namendment.\n  I am a cosponsor of it. I think the bill itself is a worthy bill, and \nit basically is an entitlement program. It is not an appropriation, as \nI understand it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator asked me a question, and I want to answer \nthis way: Frankly, most of this bill is going to be taken care of by \ninsurance companies paying insurance bills, but there is some U.S. \nGovernment responsibility because it reduces the receipts in certain \nareas that would have otherwise come in because of the overall costs. \nWe knew in 2002 it was subject to a point of order because, in fact, \nthere is a cap in 2002. There is no cap for 2003 and the years beyond, \nand for that reason we do not believe a point of order lies in the \noutyears, nor do we think anybody is bound to reduce appropriations by \nthat amount in the outyears.\n  We are prepared at some point to exchange serious discussions, if \nanyone wants to do it, on this issue.\n  I yield my time, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Above and beyond the National Mental Health \nAssociation and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, there is a \nFairness Coalition of Mental Health, and other children, education, law \nenforcement, and labor organizations all behind this legislation. There \nis a broad range of organizations supporting the legislation.\n  I point out to colleagues the legalistic language of the bill. This \nbill is modeled after the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program in \nwhich we participate. It says to a group health plan: Do not treat \nmental health benefits differently from the coverage of medical and \nsurgical benefits. You have to treat it the same way. The legislation \ndoes not mandate that a plan provide mental health coverage but says if \nyou have mental health coverage, you have to treat it the same way or \nhave the same coverage as for physical illness. That is why it is \ncalled a parity bill.\n  There are still important steps to take, which I hope someday we \nwill, so all the people in our country who have no coverage will be \ntreated. This legislation for over 100 million would make an enormous \ndifference.\n  The cost to the Nation is enormous. Additional health care costs \noccur when people cannot get the coverage they need, and they wind up \nin the emergency room or it leads to other illnesses. There is a \nproductivity loss from people who struggle with illness and get no \nhelp. There are the social costs of crime: When people do not get \ntreatment, they cannot work or they wind up homeless. We have a lot of \nhomeless people struggling with mental illness. When we treat children \nat a young age, it will have a huge impact on whether they have a life \nof misery where they could end up in trouble, more trouble, then \nincarceration, or whether they are treated and they can go on and live \na very productive, happy, and healthy life.\n  I visited a correction facility--and there are many facilities--in \nTallulah, LA. I could talk about this forever. Mr. President, 95 \npercent of the kids had not committed a violent crime. Too many were \nkids who struggled with mental illness. They should have been checked \nat the front end of assessment when a kid breaks and enters a house or \nsteals a car. Remember, we are talking about anywhere from 10 percent \nto 20 percent of children in this country who struggle with this \nillness.\n  Too many kids all across the country--and your police, law and order \ncommunities, law enforcement communities, will tell you this--do not \nget any treatment, there is no coverage, and they wind up incarcerated \nwhen they should not be incarcerated. Then what happens is almost \nindescribable. The kids are not able to defend themselves. Quite often \nthey are brutalized. Then they come out of these facilities \ndysfunctional. But they never should have been in the facility in the \nfirst place. We never provided the care for them. There never was the \ncoverage.\n  I am sure there can be some good negotiation and things can be worked \nout in conference on offset, but I argue for $150 million more a year, \nor whatever the final costs would be. Is it not worth it to end the \ndiscrimination and provide the coverage to so many people, including a \ngood number of whom are our loved ones, with the difference being life \nor death?\n  In the words of Rabbi Hillel: If not now, when? When are we going to \nend the discrimination? This is a matter of civil rights. When are we \ngoing to have the health care plans that provide the coverage for \npeople who are struggling with this illness, including many children? \nWhen are we going to make sure, with the plans now no longer able to \ndiscriminate, there will be an infrastructure of care in our \ncommunities, the delivery of the care will follow the money, and the \nmoney will be in the plans?\n\n  This is more than worth it. We have 65 Senators supporting this \nlegislation. This is bipartisan. If Senator Domenici and I are working \non something together, it has to be bipartisan. I cannot even think of \nanything else on which we agree--I don't mean that; I am kidding.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  We use the word ``message.'' I hate the word. Everybody says: What is \nour message? What is our message. This would not be a bad statement. I \nthink it would be good for our country--much less the people we can \nhelp, it would be good for our country--if the Senate went on record \ntoday supporting an amendment that I think is all about helping people, \nall about helping some vulnerable people, all about ending \ndiscrimination, all about calling for our country, America, to be a \nbetter country, all about calling on all of us to be our own best \nselves, all about making sure we provide care to people, many of whom \nup to now have not received any care.\n  The consequences of the plans discriminating and not providing care \nare so tragic. People who struggle from depression and get no care take \ntheir lives. Children don't get any care and they wind up incarcerated \nwhen they could have a good life.\n  The highest percentage of suicides is in the elderly population. \nSometime soon I would like to get to Medicare. With Medicare, if you \nsee your doctor apart from in-home care, you pay a 20 percent copay. \nBut if you are struggling with depression--and the highest rate of \nsuicide is in the elderly population--and you go to see a doctor, you \npay a 50-percent copay. That is in Medicare. That is blatant \ndiscrimination. Why is depression less important than any other \nillness?\n  We can help a lot of elderly people. We can help a lot of children. \nWe can help a lot of people in our country. Most important of all, we \ncan help ourselves as Senators. It would not be such a bad thing to \nhave a strong bipartisan vote for something all about values, people \nhelping one another and recognizing we can do better. As Bobby Kennedy \nwould have said, we can do better as a nation.\n  Please Senators, give this amendment your support. Let's pass it with \nan overwhelming vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senators Domenici, Wellstone, and Kennedy. It is \nan amendment which will ensure that people with mental illnesses are \ntreated equally, fairly, and equitably, on parity with people who have \nphysical illnesses. I do not think there are words that are strong \nenough to point out the rightness of this in our American health care \nsystem.\n  Today, in America, two-thirds of our citizens with mental illness do \nnot have access to mental health treatment, despite the fact that many \nhave health insurance. For far too long, mental health consumers have \nbeen discriminated against in the health care system--subjected to \ndiscriminatory cost-sharing, limited access to specialties, and other \nbarriers to needed services. In fact, many of them are just flat left \nout of the system.\n  I have had some personal experience with this in my life. I know it \nis a very difficult trial even if one is not without resources. That is \nwhy I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act, legislation that represents a critical step toward equal \ncoverage for mental health services. This amendment, the one we are \ndebating today, incorporates the text of that legislation. And I hope \nto be a cosponsor, as well, of the amendment.\n  This amendment builds upon legislation enacted 5 years ago which \nsought to ensure parity between mental and other types of health care.\n  That law took the first steps toward recognizing that mental illness \nis a serious yet treatable disease. I served on the board of the NYU \nChild Study Center which worked for the better part of a decade to \ndiagnose, to learn diagnosis, and to make sure that we had treatment \nregimens that actually could attack this disease, based on science and \nwith great and positive outcomes.\n  It is because of those experiences and some in my own life that I \ncommend\n\n[[Page S11175]]\n\nSenators Wellstone and Domenici for their great leadership on this \nmovement. It is a very powerful statement to our country that we care \nabout everyone, and their tireless efforts should truly be commended \nbecause they will ensure that Americans with mental illness will have \nequal access to mental health services.\n  Unfortunately, the law enacted several years ago has now expired. \nFrankly, everyone would agree that it included some loopholes that \nallowed health care plans to evade many of its goals. This amendment is \ndesigned to restore the law and to close those loopholes.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the amendment would ensure true mental \nhealth parity by prohibiting inequitable copayments, deductibles, and \ninpatient and outpatient visit limits for mental health services.\n  These are real issues for real people who are in these circumstances, \nnot unlike circumstances people might have with their physical health. \nWe know that people would not be tolerant of those kinds of activities.\n  These are commonsense proposals which will make a real difference in \npeople's lives and I hope my colleagues will support them.\n  Earlier this year, many of us worked hard to pass a strong Bipartisan \nPatient Protection Act that would provide for strong health care \nprotections for all uninsured Americans, the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nMany of these protections, however, will do nothing for mental health \nconsumers if group health plans are allowed to continue discriminating \nbetween mental and other medical and surgical health care coverage.\n\n  Advances in medical research have made great strides in our ability \nto treat mental illness. As a nation, we need to make sure that our \ninsurance covers those advances. Without proper coverage, the benefit \nof this research will be unable to reach those who need it most.\n  As a country, I heard Senator Wellstone say, we lose $300 million in \nmissed days of work, health care costs and criminal justice costs in a \ngiven year as a result of untreated mental illness. We simply cannot \nafford to do that. It is a simple cost/benefit equation that tells us \nthat we need to move forward on this.\n  It is overwhelmingly on the side of making sure that parity is \nattended to. In attempting to find a treatment, those suffering with \nmental illness face countless obstacles, as we have discussed over and \nover. This amendment would reverse those discriminatory practices, \nensuring that health insurance coverage is strong and fair.\n  I am pleased that my home State of New Jersey has enacted a mental \nhealth parity law, but, frankly, it does not go far enough and flat out \nexcludes children, our most vulnerable, from its coverage.\n  In addition, because of the ERISA preemption, not everyone in New \nJersey is covered by our own State law. Therefore, we need a strong \nFederal law that ensures mental health parity for all Americans.\n  In a few weeks I will be introducing legislation that goes a step \nfurther. My bill will address the fragmentation of the delivery system \nby providing increased support to community mental health services. But \nthis is a step we should take and we should take it now.\n  I am proud of the leadership Senators Domenici, Wellstone, and \nKennedy have provided to make sure that our Nation has addressed this \nissue through the years. It is imperative that we now bring to closure \nthis debate about parity by including this amendment in this \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey \nleaves the floor, might I say that there is no need to be personal \nabout legislation, but I thank him for his comments.\n  It is obvious that there are many who have been here for a short \ntime, such as the Senator, who already understand that we can't go on \nas a nation fooling ourselves that schizophrenics are not sick, they \ndon't have a disease; that serious depression, which is now causing \nsuicide in numbers that just go off the map, we can't run around and \nsay, well, for some reason, some purposes, it is an illness or a \ndifficult disease, but for other purposes, well, in terms of whether \nthey should have insurance, we will look the other way and act as if it \nisn't.\n  We have had Senators who understand manic depression take the floor. \nThose are just two nice words. One means high; one means low. But you \nput that in the brain of a person, and it is not very normal. They have \nto be sick, and they are diagnosable. They are treatable. But here we \nare, the millennium is here, we are one year into it, and some people \nwould still say: Let's play like it ain't so. Let's just wish it away. \nAnd certainly when it comes to health insurance, we just can't. We have \nto leave things alone no matter how backward it is, how disjointed it \nis, how unreal it is. We just have to look the other way.\n  When will be soon enough? I think now. I will tell the Senator, in \norder to get it through here, we had to put it off a year in terms of \nits effectiveness. I would like it to be effective as soon as it gets \npassed, but it won't because we wouldn't have gotten a bill out of the \nSenate that would be subjected to some technical objections. I \nshouldn't say we wouldn't, but it would be difficult. We made a call \nand said that it is better 2 years from now than to leave it as it has \nbeen forever.\n  So tonight you will be part of voting in an appropriations bill, and \nwe will put on it covering the mentally ill of this land with parity or \nnondiscrimination of health insurance. We are going to exempt some \nsmall businesses. Somebody will argue about that: Why are you doing \nthat? We can't get everything in one swoop. We really think the \ncoverages by big corporations are where we are going to find out how to \ndo this. So they are all going to be under it, whether it be Ford or \nIntel or whomever. Many of them include coverage already. But no more \nexcuses. No more looking the other way.\n  Frankly, in the State of the Senator from New Jersey, in 8 or 9 \nyears, there will be new mental health facilities built. You are going \nto ask: Who built this? We know not all are going to be built by the \nFederal Government because we don't build them. We never did enough \nsince John Kennedy decided we should go another way with the mentally \nill and try to be more humane. What is going to happen is private \nentrepreneurs are going to say, what is the insurance company going to \npay when we take care of that depressive person for a week?\n  If they pay enough, they are going to build the clinics just as they \nhave built hospitals, just as they have built other health facilities. \nAs of now, nobody accepts the responsibility. Everyone wants to look \nthe other way. I am grateful that Senators who have been here a while, \nsuch as this Senator, the Senator who has just arrived, are all coming \nto the same conclusion this afternoon. Perhaps by 6 o'clock we will \nhave passed this bill.\n  It is very strange. It goes out in the country. I have been working \nfor it. I expect the debate to go on for a couple weeks. That isn't \ngoing to happen. The reason it isn't is because 67 Senators signed this \nbill and we brought it up. I thank each one of them.\n  I have a detailed statement that includes a number of approaches to \nthis issue, including an analysis and summary of what the New York \nTimes found when they analyzed mass killers. They analyzed 25 mass \nkillers and found half of them had serious mental illnesses such as \nschizophrenia. There was no place to put them. They had been put in \njails. Cops had arrested them. People had tried them on in prisons. But \nnobody took care of them. Then they ended up over in one of the Texas \ncities killing all the people in that Baptist church.\n  We find that half of the mass killers in America are those kinds of \npeople. There is no place to put them. Relatives don't know what to do. \nNeighbors say: Look at all this behavior. Isn't it strange? We will \ncall a cop. The third time the cop is called, he says don't call \nanymore. What does that person who is desperately ill do?\n  We invite these kinds of murders and mass killings that occur in our \ncountry. It is time to try something that may give these sick people \nanother option.\n  I have a quick set of facts about mental illness, the numbers on the \nkinds of mental illnesses that exist. I think it will help Senators who \nwant to read the Record to understand the scope of this problem.\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Quick Facts on Mental Illness\n\n       Major Depressive Disorder--9.9 million American adults age \n     18 and older suffer from this disorder in a given year;\n       Bipolar Disorder--2.3 million American adults age 18 and \n     older suffer from this disorder in a given year;\n       Schizophrenia--2.2 million American adults age 18 and older \n     suffer from this disorder in a given year; and\n       Obsessive--Compulsive Disorder (OCD)--3.3 million American \n     adults age 18-54 suffer from this disorder in a given year.\n       16% of all inmates in State and local jails suffer from a \n     mental illness; 600,000-700,000 mentally ill individuals are \n     booked into a jail every year; 25% to 40% of America's \n     mentally ill will come into contact with the criminal justice \n     system.\n       Suicide is currently a national public health crisis, with \n     approximately 30,000 Americans committing suicide every year.\n       Of the 850,000 homeless individuals in the United States, \n     about \\1/3\\ or 300,000 of those individuals suffer from a \n     serious mental illness.\n       In the developed world, including the U.S., 4 of the 10 \n     leading causes of disability for individuals over the age of \n     five are mental disorders. In the order of prevalence the \n     disorders are major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar \n     disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder.\n       The direct cost to the United States per year for \n     respiratory disease is $99 billion, cardiovascular disease is \n     $160 billion, and finally $148 billion for mental illness.\n\n\n                         efficacy of treatment\n\n       Treatment for bipolar disorders have an 80 percent success \n     rate.\n       Schizophrenia has a 60-percent success rate in the United \n     States today if treated properly.\n       Major depression has a 65 percent success rate.\n       Compared to several surgical procedures:\n       Angioplasty has a 41-percent success rate.\n       Atherectomy has a 52-percent success rate.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to support the Senator from New \nMexico in his effort. I have been an original sponsor of the bill he \nhas had. In years past, I was chairman of this bill in Wyoming and \nworked on this for some time. As a good focus on rural health care is \nunique, this is another unique issue with which we need to deal. I urge \nsupport for the amendment. I thank the sponsors for their efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his support. It \nmeans a lot. His voice is important. I appreciate his mentioning that \nis not something that only applies to metropolitan America; it is \nimportant in rural America. I thank Senator Corzine as well. I will not \ntake much time now.\n  Senator Corzine asked that he be a cosponsor of the amendment. I \nbelieve Senators Byrd and Stevens, with the agreement that we now have, \nasked to be included as cosponsors. I ask unanimous consent they all be \nadded as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from New Mexico \nand the Senator from Minnesota for their advocacy on this amendment. As \nI commented earlier in the debate on this amendment, I have cosponsored \nthe authorizing legislation for the past two Congresses and had \nwithheld cosponsorship of this amendment as a manager of this \nappropriations bill until I could see how it was going to be worked \nout. We are now in the process of working it out. I think we will be \nsuccessful, but it is still too early to make a final commitment.\n  What is occurring here is on the scoring for budgetary purposes, if \nit is on this bill, it is scored against this bill; and we are now up \nto the limit of our authorization. But we are now looking into the \nremedy of having it scored in another direction--that is technical--and \nan amendment is now being prepared that may cure that problem. It is \nnot a commitment to cure the problem, but we will know shortly.\n  In the interim, as a comanager of the bill, I do not intend to raise \nany point of order that this is legislation on an appropriations bill. \nTechnically, that point of order can be raised. It does not have to be \nraised because of the difficulties of getting Senate consideration on \nthis bill for a very protracted period of time. As the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici, outlined, I think it is not appropriate to raise \na point of order that this is legislation on an appropriations bill. At \nleast I do not intend to raise that point of order.\n  This is a proposal that I believe has great merit. That is why I have \ncosponsored the authorization bill for the last two Congresses.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor \nto the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Harkin, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and I are urging colleagues to come forward to offer \namendments. It is now 4:25. We have only had one amendment offered all \nday. It is very important that we move ahead with the disposition of \nthis bill.\n  Last year, we had the bill out of committee on June 30 and it passed \nthe Senate on July 27. Then we had months of negotiation in the \nconference committee, so that if we are to get this matter into \nconference and have a conference report, it is urgent that we proceed \nat this time.\n  There is substantial funding for education, which has the consensus \nof the Senate. There is substantial money for the National Institutes \nof Health, and the public interest requires that we move ahead. If we \ndo not finish our appropriations bills, there is the possibility--or \nperhaps probability--that the bills that are unfinished will be folded \ninto a continuing resolution. That means that important funding will \nnot be provided.\n  Again, on behalf of Senator Harkin, my comanager, I urge our \ncolleagues who have amendments to come to the floor. Perhaps Senator \nHarkin would like to italicize my urging.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will respond to my distinguished ranking \nmember, my friend, that I believe we are making some good progress. A \nmajor amendment is being worked out right now. I hope we go to a voice \nvote shortly. I only know of one other amendment that might be pending. \nQuite frankly--hope springs eternal--I think we might be through with \nthis shortly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator suggesting that only one other amendment \nis pending and we may be in a position to go to third reading?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe that might be the case. People may want to go \nhome early tonight and have dinner with their families.\n  Mr. SPECTER. What time does he think we might go to third reading?\n  Mr. HARKIN. It depends on how long it takes to work out this \nlanguage. We are waiting for Senator Dorgan. He had an amendment. I saw \nhim a minute ago. Perhaps he will be out here shortly. I don't think \nthat will take too long.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we urge colleagues, if they have \namendments to offer, to come to the floor and do so now.\n  In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know pending before the Senate now is \nlandmark legislation. I commend my colleagues, Senator Paul Wellstone \nand Senator Pete Domenici, truly a political odd couple, one from the \nState of Minnesota and the other from New Mexico, who have come \ntogether on this important cause, both understanding the importance of \nour maturing as a nation when it comes to the issue of mental health.\n\n[[Page S11177]]\n\n  I am a strong supporter of the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act \nwhich they are bringing to this legislation. I am pleased it is finally \ngoing to come for a vote. I know those two Senators, as well as \nSenators Daschle and Kennedy, have worked tirelessly to make this \nhappen. I know advocates for the mentally ill have waited, frustrated \nand disappointed time and again, and had hoped this day might someday \ncome. I recognize it is equally imperative we do not threaten this \nbill's passage by attaching amendments that may make it even more \ndifficult in conference.\n  With this in mind, I do, however, want to raise the subject of \nanother amendment relating to mental health, and I ask my colleagues to \nconsider it in the context of the underlying Wellstone-Domenici \namendment.\n  The issue I am about to discuss affects literally thousands of \nAmericans every single year. This amendment of which I speak would be \nan improvement on the bill we are currently debating. However, I want \nto make it clear I will not be offering this as a second-degree \namendment. I want to give to Senators Wellstone and Domenici every \nopportunity to bring their important bill through conference intact. \nAlthough I believe my amendment would be a worthy addition to theirs, I \nam going to save that cause until another day.\n  Let me talk about this amendment and why I would have brought it to \nthe floor. Some time ago I received a letter from a constituent in \nIllinois who in the 1980s suffered severe depression and received the \nkind of treatment which allowed her to return to work. I will call her \nMary Smith. At the time, Mary had employer-sponsored health insurance \nthrough her husband's job, but in the fall of 1998 Mary and her husband \nlost this employer-based insurance coverage when her husband lost his \njob.\n  Mary applied for comprehensive health insurance plans offered to \nindividuals. Her application was declined because, as the insurance \ncompany noted, ``Due to her medical history of depression she did not \nmeet the company's underwriting requirements.''\n  Mary was turned down for health insurance due to a medical history of \ndepression. She wrote me, and this is what her letter said:\n\n       As I see it, we are being punished for accessing health \n     care. In 1987, when I was clinically depressed, I could have \n     chosen to avoid proper medical care, become unemployed and \n     received Social Security disability. I did not. I obtained \n     the help I needed and continued to support myself, my family \n     and contribute positively to society. Depression is a \n     treatable medical illness. Insurance companies must stop \n     their indiscriminate denial of this coverage.\n\n  Sadly, Mary Smith is not alone. Each year more than 50 million adults \nin the United States suffer from mental illness, 25 percent of our \nadult population. Some 18 million Americans are affected by depression \nannually. One in five Americans has a mental disorder in any one year. \nFifteen percent of the adult population use some form of mental health \nservice during the year. Eight percent have a mental disorder. Seven \npercent have a mental health problem. Twenty-one percent of children \nages 9 to 17 receive mental health services in a year.\n\n  The problem Mary Smith faced is, under the current system of care in \nthe United States, individuals who are undergoing treatment or have a \nhistory of treatment for mental illness may find it difficult, if not \nimpossible, to obtain private health insurance, especially if they have \nto purchase it on their own and cannot rely upon group insurance \nthrough an employer.\n  In part, this is a result of the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act that protects millions of Americans in the group \nhealth insurance market and affords very few protections for \nindividuals who apply for private nongroup insurance. Approximately 9.6 \npercent, or 26 million Americans, are insured in this private nongroup \ninsurance market--26 million people.\n  A 1996 GAO study found that insurance carriers denied up to 33 \npercent of applicants for private health insurance because they had a \npreexisting health condition, including, of course, mental health \nconditions. HIPAA provides few protections for individuals who apply \nfor insurance in the individual insurance market. Individuals without \nat least 18 months of prior continuous group coverage are not protected \nagainst discrimination and red lining. This issue is not about parity. \nIt is not about mental health benefits. It is about discrimination. It \nis about red lining.\n  Mary Smith was being told she could not get any health benefits, not \njust mental health benefits. She was denied all health insurance \ncoverage because many years before she had successfully treated a \ncondition of depression. She was not eligible to get hospital coverage \nif she needed surgery. She was not eligible for preventive care, such \nas a flu shot. She was not eligible for a doctor's visit. Had she \nbecome injured or ill, she would have received no care.\n  Efforts to improve health care parity have focused on providing \nequality between mental health covered services and other health \nbenefits, and I salute Senators Wellstone and Domenici for their \nleadership. These efforts are very important, and I strongly support \nthem.\n  Parity will not help individuals who do not have access to any \naffordable insurance coverage due to preexisting mental illness \ndiscrimination. Think of that for a moment. We are saying if you cover \na person for other illnesses, in the Wellstone-Domenici amendment, you \nalso have to provide mental health protection as well. I believe that \nis sound.\n  Mary Smith never reaches that point. Mary Smith, whose husband lost \nhis job, ends up in the private insurance market. She cannot even get \ninto a private health insurance plan because the company, under the law \ntoday, can discriminate against her because she had treatment for a \nmental health problem.\n  Individuals who seek insurance in the individual market are people \nsuch as Mary who are in periods of transitional employment, but they \nare also people who are self-employed. They are family farmers. I have \nmany of them in my State. They are small business owners. They are \nrecent college graduates who lose coverage under their parents' plan, \nand they are the children and spouses of self-employed people and those \nin transitional employment.\n  Every person at risk, needing to buy private health insurance, is \nsubject to this discrimination. If they had been treated for a mental \nillness, they could run into the same experience Mary Smith did.\n  This type of discrimination is precisely why many Americans do not \nseek treatment for mental illness. Despite the efficacy of treatment \noptions and the many possible ways of obtaining a treatment of choice, \nnearly half of all Americans who have severe mental illness do not seek \ntreatment. They are not only concerned about the stigma in society, \nthey are clearly concerned about the discrimination which is allowed \nunder the law for those people who have turned for help.\n  This reluctance to seek care is an unfortunate outcome of very real \nbarriers. Foremost of these is the stigma that many in our society \nattach to mental illness and to people who have it. How many of us, or \nour family members or friends, have thought about what might happen if \nwe went to seek therapy for anxiety, depression, or even marriage \ncounseling? It is unconscionable that persons should have to consider \nnot being able to get health insurance coverage because they did the \nright thing and were treated for a mental condition.\n  Repeated surveys have shown that concerns about the cost of care are \namong the foremost reasons that people do not seek care.\n  My amendment prohibits insurers from charging persons with \npreexisting health conditions higher premiums. This is because insurers \nuse higher premiums to keep certain people locked out of the plan.\n  The GAO interviewed one insurance carrier in my home State of \nIllinois which only charges 2 to 3 percent of its enrollees a \nnonstandard rate, but the rate they charge is double the standard rate.\n  In some States, including Illinois, high-risk pools have been created \nto act as a safety net to ensure the uninsured have access to coverage. \nThese safety nets are often expensive. For Mary Smith, this safety net \nwould have cost her and her husband $700 a month for health insurance. \nThey are a great deal for insurers; all sick people are in one pool.\n\n[[Page S11178]]\n\n  Risk pools undermine the underlying function of insurance to include \na broad pooling of risk. They relieve insurers of responsibility.\n  Mental disorders impose an enormous emotional and financial burden on \nill individuals and their families. And when they go untreated, costs \nescalate. Mental disorders are costly for our Nation in reduced or lost \nproductivity and in medical resources used for care, treatment, and \nrehabilitation.\n  The National Institute of Mental Health estimates the annual cost of \nuntreated mental illness exceeds $300 billion, primarily due to \nproductivity losses of $150 billion, health care costs of $70 billion, \nand societal costs of $80 billion.\n  Two years ago the Surgeon General issued a report on mental health. \nThe report concludes that a broad range of treatments of documented \nefficacy exists for most mental disorders.\n  Diagnoses of mental disorders are as reliable as those of general \nmedical disorders. In fact, the success rate of treatment for disorders \nsuch as schizophrenia is at 60 percent; depression, 70 to 80 percent; \nand manic disorder, at 70 to 90 percent, surpassing those of other \nmedical conditions. Heart disease, for example, has a treatment success \nrate of about 50 percent.\n  Here is what we know: We know mental health is fundamental to our \nhealth. We know millions of Americans suffer from mental illness. We \nknow treatment exists for mental illness. We know the treatment works. \nWe know, despite the efficacy of treatment options, nearly half of \nAmericans who have mental illness do not seek medical care. We know \nthat reluctance to seek care is a result of real barriers, including \nstigma, discrimination, and of course financial obstacles which are \ntreated by the Wellstone-Domenici amendment. We know mental disorders \nimpose an enormous emotional and financial burden on sick individuals \nand their families and that untreated mental illness is costly for our \nNation in lost productivity and medical resources. We know the private \ninsurance system perpetuates barriers, reinforces stigma, throws up \nfinancial roadblocks, and undermines the health of millions of \nAmericans who do the right thing and seek treatment.\n  The amendment I was prepared to offer today, because of Mary Smith, \nwould try to do the right thing. It is common sense. It doesn't cost \nanything. It does not solve all the inequities that individuals with \nmental health conditions face. But it does remove one of the many \nbarriers to health care faced by those who have been treated for a \nmental condition. I think there is no more appropriate context in which \nto address this than a patient protection act.\n  This amendment prohibits any health insurer that offers health \ncoverage in the individual insurance market from denying an individual \ncoverage because of a preexisting mental illness unless a diagnosis, \nmedical advice, or treatment was recommended or received within the 6 \nmonths prior to the enrollment date. Health plans can exclude coverage \nfor mental health services but not for more than 12 months. The \nexclusion period must be reduced by the total amount of previous \ncredible insurance coverage.\n\n  It also prohibits plans in the individual market from charging higher \npremiums to individuals based solely on the determination that such an \nindividual had a preexisting mental health conditions. It defines a \npreexisting mental health condition as including all clinical disorders \nand personality disorders diagnosed on Axis I or Axis II of the most \nrecent edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This broad definition would \ninclude mood, anxiety, eating, sleep, and adjustment disorders, \nclinical disorders such as mental retardation and autism, cognitive \ndisorders such as amnesia and dementia, and sexual and gender identity \ndisorders.\n  These provisions apply to all health plans in the individual market, \nregardless of whether a State has enacted an alternative mechanism, \nsuch as a risk pool, to cover individuals with preexisting health \nconditions.\n  The amendment does not mandate that insurers provide mental health \nservices if they do not already offer such coverage. It does not \nprohibit health plans from establishing a waiting period for mental \nhealth services for individuals with a preexisting mental health \ncondition of up to 12 months.\n  All we are trying to do is to ensure that if you should go to a \ntherapist or a psychiatrist or a psychologist or seek other mental \nhealth services, you do not have to worry that you or your family will \nnot be able to get health insurance because you asked for help. It \nsimply does not make sense, just because a person seeks treatment for \nmental illness, he or she is rendered uninsurable.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this important initiative to \nensure that such individuals are not discriminated against when \napplying for health insurance coverage. It is just the right thing to \ndo.\n  Mary Smith's letter is one of many we receive in our Senate offices. \nI am glad we picked this one and read it carefully and closely. I \nthought for a moment about how we could help this woman who did the \nright thing. Faced with a mental illness, she went to a doctor, and \nhaving gone to that doctor her life has improved. She stayed on the job \nand had a much better life. She could have applied for a government \nprogram and didn't do it. She wanted to stay in the workplace. Little \ndid she know that a few years later when her husband lost his job, the \nfact that she was successfully treated for depression would ultimately \nmean they could not buy health insurance in the private market.\n  How can we stand by as a nation and allow this kind of discrimination \nagainst people who are no more guilty of their condition than a person \nis guilty for the color of their eyes? It is something God has sent to \nthem. In this situation I think we should consider the passage of \nlegislation which would prohibit this discrimination once and for all \nand make certain, as the underlying Wellstone-Domenici amendment, this \namendment would say we are going to treat mental illness in the 21st \ncentury much differently than we have in years gone by.\n  I thank you for the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDaschle be included as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, since there was news today that Dr. \nHyman is stepping down as Director of the National Institute of Mental \nHealth, and since I believe we are going to pass legislation on \nantidiscrimination in mental health coverage which will be landmark and \nwill make a real difference in the lives of people--and I have spoken \nplenty about the amendment already--I wanted to thank Dr. Hyman for all \nof his leadership. He has been an exceptional director.\n  I have had a chance to work very closely with him through Ellen \nGerrity, a fellow in my office. We are lucky enough to have her working \nwith us. She worked for the IMH. I think Dr. Hyman has done a good job, \nalong with Dr. Satcher, who is Surgeon General. He has done magnificent \nwork. The two of them have done perhaps the best job we have seen in \nthe history of our country of providing an education for people in the \ncountry. So much of mental illness is a brain disease. It can be \ndiagnosed. It is very treatable.\n  That is the good news. The bad news is there is a huge gap between \nwhat we know and what we don't know. We are trying to close that gap--\nnot all of it but a good part of it--with this piece of legislation.\n  I thank Dr. Hyman. He is one of the people I have had a chance to \nwork closely with in Washington. He is a good example of someone who, \nwith a highly developed sense of public service, has made a huge \ndifference.\n  I thought I would use this opportunity to thank Dr. Hyman and wish \nhim the very best as he moves on to be, as I understand, provost at \nHarvard University.\n  We have had a number of Senators--I don't need to speak more--who \nhave\n\n[[Page S11179]]\n\ncome to the floor and have spoken. I think what they have said is not \nonly significant, but the way they have said it is significant.\n  Senator Domenici always speaks about this issue with a tremendous \namount of eloquence and a lot of knowledge. His wife Nancy Domenici--I \ndon't think he would be offended if I said it--is probably every bit \nthe leader he is. I don't want to say more, but she is every bit the \nleader he is.\n  We have two Senators out here managing the appropriations bill who \nwant to move us forward. After we have done the work to make sure we \ndeal with rule XVI and germaneness--and we have done a lot of work on \nthe budget point of order--I think they have been very gracious in \nletting us go forward. Senators Harkin and Specter are very supportive \nof this piece of legislation. Senator Thomas from the State of Wyoming \ncame and spoke.\n  It reminds me of 1996, I think it was, when we passed partial \nlegislation. I remember Senator Simpson came out on the floor and spoke \nabout a tragedy within his own family. I believe it was a niece who \ntook her life at a young age. Senator Corzine came out on the floor and \nmade it very clear that this issue means a great deal to him.\n  Senator Reid spoke about his own experience, that his father took his \nlife. Senator Harry Reid has been absolutely, in his own very quiet \nway, perhaps the most powerful Senator, in a positive way, on the whole \nissue of treating depression than anybody in the Senate.\n  Senator Kennedy came out and spoke. He has devoted a good part of his \ncareer to this issue. He is the health care Senator, but, actually, \nlong before we had this kind of coalition--and we have 150 \norganizations supporting this piece of legislation. We have \norganizations such as the National Mental Health Association and NAMI--\nthe National Alliance for the Mentally Ill--that deserve a lot of \ncredit, along with the whole coalition. If I went through all 150 \norganizations, it would take a lot of time. But I personally think \nSenator Kennedy deserves a great deal of credit for being willing to \nlight a candle a long time ago to speak to this awful discrimination.\n  I also thank all of these different organizations because the truth \nis, when we started out on this matter over a half a decade ago, it was \nthen an issue--it still is an issue of discrimination--but the problem \nwas there was not exactly a political constituency that had any real \nclout. Then I think what has happened in the last 6, 7, 8, 9 years is \nthat a lot of families have said: We are the ones who struggle with \nthis illness--or we have a loved one who struggles with this illness--\nand we refuse to be treated as men and women of lesser worth. We are \nmen and women of worth and dignity. We struggle with an illness just as \nany other illness. We are going to be advocating for ourselves.\n  It has been the citizen politics, the citizen lobbying that has led \nto the result of--we have a dispute as to whether it is 65 or 67 \nSenators who now support this. This piece of legislation passed out of \nthe HELP Committee on a 21-0 vote. We made some compromises, but it is \nstill an enormous step forward. I do not think it would have happened \nwithout the citizen politics.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer--because we both represent the State \nof Minnesota--we represent a State that is a model State, as we are in \nmany ways, but we passed full parity for both substance abuse \naddiction, which I think is terribly important--and I think that is the \nnext piece of legislation on which we ought to work--and mental health \nand, by the way, with very little cost but with great benefit.\n  The estimates of the amount of money we have saved in our State for \npeople who now get the treatment and, therefore, are productive and go \nto work or do well in school and do well in their families verses what \nwas going on before is just stunning and important. The problem is \nbecause of ERISA, a lot of the self-insured plans are not covered, so \nwe still have 50 percent of the people not covered and, thus, the need \nfor national community regulation.\n  But I thank a lot of the people in Minnesota who both the Presiding \nOfficer and I know well; and certainly Sheila and I have gotten to know \nthem very well because we have had so many meetings with so many \npeople.\n  I mentioned the Kluesners earlier, Mary and Al Kluesner. I mentioned \nthe Westins. But there are so many others who have met with us, who \nhave met in public. There have been so many picnics on our lakes that I \nhave attended with people. There are so many people who have told their \nown stories. They have made a huge difference.\n  So again, colleagues, we have 65 or 67 Senators who support this \nmeasure. It is strongly bipartisan. We now have the support of the \nchair and ranking chair of the Appropriations Committee, and the chair \nand ranking chair of the Budget Committee. We have the whip who has \nspoken, and Senator Daschle, the Senate majority leader, who has asked \nto be a cosponsor. We have 150 organizations: Religious, children, \nlabor, and health.\n  We are close to adopting an amendment that I believe we can keep in \nconference. I am not trying to be coy, but I think if I had to have \nsomebody in my corner, I would want Tom Harkin more than anybody else. \nHe chairs this committee. If I had to have one person to fight for me, \nhe would be the one.\n  So I thank colleagues. We may have a lot more debate yet, but I think \nwe are going to take this journey. I believe we are going to wind up in \na good place where we are going to make our country better. We are \ngoing to make our country better by passing this.\n  I see other colleagues in this Chamber, so I do not want to take any \nmore time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending Domenici \namendment. I am opposed to the Domenici amendment. I am not going to \nforce the Senate to vote on it this afternoon. I think it is clear \nwhere the votes are, but I want to explain the issues. I want to raise \nthe issues in this debate so that they can be looked at by the House.\n  I believe, based on what I have been told, the administration is \nopposed to the amendment. There is also a point of order against the \nsecond-degree amendment that will be offered directing scoring. That \npoint of order will lie against the conference report if the bill comes \nback from conference with the directed scoring provision in it. I want \nto reserve my right to raise that point of order at that time.\n  I want to be brief, but let me basically explain what we have here. \nWhat we have is an amendment that imposes a new mandate on the private \nsector of the economy. That mandate is a mandate where we decide what \nkind of health insurance Americans should have, and they are going to \nhave it whether they want it or not; and we are going to override some \n70 years of negotiations between private employers and private \nemployees as to what their health insurance looks like.\n  We are going to mandate that if a company provides health insurance \nthat has any mental health provisions in it, those benefits have to be \ntreated the way benefits are for physical health or else the company \nmay be prohibited from providing the policy.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, in looking at this mandate, has \nestimated that what will happen is, premiums will go up, some companies \nwill drop mental health coverage altogether, and others will continue \nto provide it under these new circumstances. Remarkably, they estimate \nthat the adoption of this amendment, over a 5-year period of \nimplementation, will drive up costs on the private sector of the \neconomy by $23 billion. So we are about to impose $23 billion in costs \non the private sector of the economy because we think we know better \nwhat private health contracts, negotiated between employers and \nemployees, ought to look like.\n  There is a budget problem here because the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that by paying the $23 billion in additional health \ninsurance premiums, that American industry and agriculture will end up \npaying lower wages than they would have paid, and that we will collect, \nover a 10-year period, over $5 billion less in taxes because of this \namendment.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee informed the \nSenate that he would charge, in future budgets, that $5 billion against \nthe Appropriations Committee if the amendment were adopted.\n  We are now, as I understand it, in the process of writing an \namendment that\n\n[[Page S11180]]\n\nsays that for the purposes of the budget, even though this amendment \nwill cost over $5 billion, we are not going to count it.\n  Without going on and on, let me raise the list of particulars. No. 1, \nwho are we to be telling American workers and American business what \nkind of health insurance benefits they should have and how that package \nshould be made up and what they should choose? What about workers who \nwould rather have higher wages than to have this new benefit that we \nare deeming to be in their interest?\n  What about the $23 billion of cost that we are going to impose on the \nprivate sector? I know the amendment is written so it does not start \nuntil 2003. The point is, that is $23 billion of cost over a 5-year \nperiod that will be borne by the private sector, $23 billion that could \nhave gone to create more jobs, more growth, more opportunity.\n  I simply raise two questions regarding the $5 billion of lost tax \nrevenue because companies, as estimated by CBO, will pay lower wages \nwhen they are mandated to pay for these benefits: first, what about \nworkers that would rather have those wages than the benefit? Shouldn't \nthey have a choice, or are we granted such wisdom that we make the \nchoice for them?\n  Second, if it is going to cost $5 billion, have we not made an \nabsolute mockery out of the budget process, made it a complete fraud by \npassing a law that says, yes, it costs $5 billion, but we are going to \npretend that it does not cost $5 billion?\n  That is basically the proposition that is before us. We are going to \nsay, if you are going to provide mental health coverage, you have to \nprovide it on par with physical health coverage or you can't provide \nit.\n  The logical question is, isn't that something that people should \ndecide about their own insurance? Isn't that the same decision that \npeople make, in deciding do they want a new refrigerator, or do they \nwant to send Johnny to college. They have tradeoffs on which they have \nto make hard decisions? What about the people who are going to lose \nincome? We are going to lose $5 billion in taxes over a 5-year period. \nWhat about the people who lose billions of income?\n  Maybe they would have wanted to spend on it something that would have \nhad greater value to them. Maybe nobody cares whether they could have \nspent those billions better because we are going to spend it for them.\n  Then the question becomes, if we are going to spend it, instead of \nbeing honest about it, we are simply going to pass a law that says, it \ncosts $5 billion, everybody knows it costs $5 billion, and there is no \ndebate about it costing $5 billion. But so that we don't have to worry \nabout it, we are going to pass a law that says, while it costs $5 \nbillion, for budgetary purposes, we are going to act as if it doesn't \ncost $5 billion so we don't have to count it against appropriations in \nthe future.\n  I simply have to say, I would be ashamed of this amendment. This is \nbad law, bad principle, and bad precedent.\n  If I thought we had more than 15 people who would vote against it, I \nwould demand a vote. I would be happy for the world to know I am \nagainst it. I don't want to put my colleagues on the spot, but I am \nhoping that the House will not accept this amendment. The Senator who \noffered the amendment, 5 or 6 years ago, had a similar amendment that \ncost only $300 million a year. Rather than extending that, we are \nadding a full-blown mandate on the private sector.\n  I am hoping something can be worked out. I hope we will not have \ndirected scoring. We ought to pay for this in appropriations if we are \ngoing to do it.\n  Finally, I am hoping the administration and the House will not go \nalong with this amendment.\n  I am sorry to have taken people's time. But I wanted to come to the \nChamber and basically outline what is wrong with this amendment, and \nwhat is wrong with the procedure that we are following by directed \nscoring when we say we know it is going to cost $5 billion but we have \ndecided that we are going to pretend that it doesn't. We are going to \ncharge it against mandatory spending.\n  In any case, I hope it will be fixed. It should be fixed. This is bad \npolicy. It sets a bad precedent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will respond very briefly, as one of the co-managers \nof the amendment. I thank the Senator from Texas. I actually don't mean \nthat as sort of fake Senatorial courtesy. He has intellectual \nintegrity, and I understand exactly what he is saying.\n  Two quick points I will say to him: There is an argument on the CBO \nscoring of $1.3 billion over 10 years. I say to my colleague, I would \nchallenge that. I believe Senator Domenici would as well. He is in a \nmarkup right now on another bill.\n  I understand my colleague is going to reserve final judgment on the \nconference report, but the quarrel I have with it is with the \nassumption. The assumption that CBO is making, not $5 billion, $1.4 \nbillion over 10 years, the assumption that is being made is that with \nthe mental health coverage ending the discrimination, that what \nemployers will do is, therefore, in order to make up the cost, which \nCBO, by the way, said is minuscule, less than a 1 percent increase in \npremiums, will cut wages for employees. That is the assumption. And \nthen, with less wages, there will be less that will be contributed to \nSocial Security.\n  For the record, I would challenge that assumption. I will challenge \nthat assumption on the basis of what we have seen in States that have \nthe mental health parity where that has not happened. For a lot of \ncompanies and a lot of employers, it is a very attractive proposition \nto offer this coverage because families are crying out for it.\n  As to the second point, that the money is not going to be spent, we \nare not saying that there isn't going to be the expenditure of money. \nWe are saying it is not going to lie against this bill. We are going to \nhandle this just as anything else we do. We paid for the tax cuts. We \nwill pay for this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will be brief. I am reading from the \nCongressional Budget Office cost estimate of August 22, 2001. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the proposal will reduce \nFederal revenues in the initial year by $230 million and $5.4 billion \nover a 10-year period. That was the number I was using.\n  I think there is no question about the fact that one of three things \nwill happen. From my point of view, they are all bad.\n  No. 1, some people will lose health coverage they already have \nbecause the company, in trying to escape the $23 billion of cost over 5 \nyears, can simply drop mental health coverage. That is bad.\n  No. 2, the company can simply decide to not provide health insurance \nat all, which is perfectly legal. That is also bad.\n  Then third, if companies lower wages or if wages don't grow as much \nas they would have grown because these higher premiums have to be paid, \nfor many workers that is bad because there are obviously many who would \nrather have that income than to have the coverage, and we are making \nthe decision for them.\n  I respect the opinion of my colleague from Minnesota, who is for this \nbenefit, but all I am saying is he may think it is a great idea, but \nthere are probably a lot of working people in America who would rather \nnot risk that coverage, or would rather keep the mental coverage they \nhave, or would rather have higher wages.\n  Finally, is the question about how we are going to do the budget. It \nseems to me that is a point where clearly--and I don't know the \nargument on the other side, other than the Appropriations Committee \ndoesn't want to be saddled with the cost of paying for this program, \nwhich they view as a rider to the appropriations process, which I \nunderstand--that the taxpayers are going to be saddled with the costs. \nSomebody is going to have to end up paying that $5.4 billion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, again, I appreciate what my colleague \nsaid. Initially, I was talking about the Social Security cost, not the \noverall cost. We have been very clear about the fact that it would \nrequire some investment of resources. The fact is, I again\n\n[[Page S11181]]\n\nsay to my colleague from Texas, there are plenty of examples of States \nthat have moved forward. Quite to the contrary of wages going down, \npeople have been supportive of it because this is not a small thing. \nThis affects about 50 million adults in the country. Depression alone \naffects 18 million.\n  The reason we have 150 organizations--religious, labor, law \nenforcement, children, you name it--and the reason we have 65 Senators \non this bill is that they have heard from people across the country, \nincluding Democrats, Republicans, and others, who have said this is \nwhat happened to me and my family because of the discrimination and \nbecause there is no coverage.\n  If a health care plan is going to have mental health coverage, it \nought to be treated the same as any physical illness. It is a matter of \ndiscrimination, of basically civil rights. Ending the discrimination \nand making sure people get coverage is what this is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, the attacks against America have \nunified our nation. There is a new spirit of bipartisanship, of \ncivility, and of common purpose.\n  Republicans, Democrats, and Independents are working together with \nthe President to expedite legislation important to our efforts at home \nand abroad. Contentious issues have been set aside, in order to focus \non the issues that unite us.\n  Thus, it is with disappointment that I feel compelled to come to the \nSenate floor today to discuss a dispute between the State of Missouri \nand the Health Care Financing Agency (HCFA) now known as the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS.\n  The details of the dispute are complex, but the consequences are \nenormous. At stake is the health of Missouri's children, seniors, and \nother vulnerable citizens.\n  The subject of this dispute is Missouri's provider assessment \nprogram, which is a tax on hospitals.\n  States use the money generated from these taxes as their ``match'' \nfor federal Medicaid dollars. Medicaid funds are then paid out to \nproviders according to formulas established by state law.\n  Over a decade ago, Congress became concerned that states were using \nprovider taxes improperly to increase the federal contributions to \nMedicaid programs. In response, Congress enacted a law in 1992 that \nplaced limitations on provider assessment programs.\n  One specific limitation is that a provider assessment must not \ncontain a ``hold harmless'' provision. This means that states may not \nguarantee that a hospital will receive back from Medicaid the amount of \nfunds it paid to the state in provider taxes.\n  In 1992, under the leadership of Governor John Ashcroft, now the \nAttorney General, Missouri complied with the federal law by enacting \nthe Federal Reimbursement Allowance Program law. This law created a tax \non hospitals, but contained no ``hold harmless'' provision. Governor \nAshcroft signed the bill into law. Governor Carnahan continued the \nprogram, and Governor Holden is continuing it.\n  For almost a decade, the program has been operating under the \nauspices of HCFA now CMS. During this time, 100 percent of the revenues \ngenerated by the tax have been dedicated to Missouri's Medicaid \nprogram. The program has made Missouri a national model for using \nFederal, State, and private resources to provide health care to as many \nneedy citizens as possible.\n  This long-standing and legal tax has assisted Missouri in creating a \nstrong healthcare safety net for its children, pregnant women, and most \nvulnerable seniors.\n  Much of Missouri's success can be attributed to expanded enrollment \nof eligible citizens in Medicaid. During the 1990's, the number of \nMissourians covered by Medicaid more than doubled, increasing from \n364,000 in 1990 to 839,000 in 2001.\n\n  The number of children enrolled in Medicaid has grown at an even \nfaster rate, increasing from 180,000 in 1990 to 474,000 in 2001.\n  An important step in covering more children was the enactment of the \nState's Children's Health Insurance Program, also known as MC Plus. \nUnder the leadership of Governor Carnahan, MC Plus was designed to \ncover children up to 300 percent of the poverty level. It is a national \nmodel. Due to MC Plus, parents who were working, but did not have \naccess to health insurance through their employer, could now provide \nthis precious resource to their children.\n  The MC Plus program has made a difference in the lives of 75,000 \nchildren in Missouri.\n  This combination of initiatives has sharply reduced the number of \nMissouri citizens that lack health insurance. Between 1996 and 1999, \nthe percentage of uninsured in Missouri dropped by more than one-third, \nfalling from 13.2 percent to 8.6 percent. In 1999, Missouri has the \nfourth lowest percentage of uninsured citizens in the country.\n  These tremendous accomplishments, however, could be in jeopardy from \na bureaucratic squabble over the technicalities of Missouri's provider \ntax.\n  For many years, HCFA has complained that the manner in which \nMissouri's provider tax revenues are distributed to health care \nproviders violates federal law. During this entire period, HCFA has \nbeen threatening to terminate the program and recoup $1.6 billion from \nthe State. Such action would devastate Missouri's health care program.\n  Let's be clear about what is in dispute. HCFA has never alleged that \nthe provider tax itself contains a ``hold harmless'' provision.\n  Rather, HCFA--and now CMS--appear to believe that the State, under \nthe leadership of then Governor Ashcroft, made a collusive arrangement \nwith health care providers. CMS has suggested that state officials \nillegally agreed that each hospital would get back in Medicaid \nreimbursement at least the amount it paid in taxes.\n  Missouri strongly disputes the allegation that there is a hold \nharmless arrangement between the State and its hospitals. And, in fact, \nthe Federal Government has never provided Missouri with a shred of \nevidence that state officials engaged in illegal collusion with the \nhospitals. I repeat, not a shred of evidence.\n  Instead of proving its case, HCFA continues to complain about the \nprovider tax, threaten Missouri with legal action, and uses \nbureaucratic leverage to force Missouri to change its incredibly \nsuccessful program.\n  Mr. President, this is truly a case of form over substance. Missouri \nhas created a program that pumps millions of dollars into health care \ncoverage for its citizens. Missouri then distributes tax dollars to \nhealth care providers according to a state formula, which everyone \nagrees is consistent with Federal law.\n\n  Yet, a set of health care bureaucrats in Washington seek to destroy \nthis program. Why? Because they have a hunch--without any concrete \nevidence--that the people who designed the program almost 10 years ago, \nsecretly conspired to circumvent the technicalities of federal law. \nThis is a case of bureaucracy run amok.\n  Ironically, this is the same agency that has recently changed its \nname so to shed its image that it cares more about rules and \nregulations than people. As a matter of fact, this administration \nannounced when it took office that it would measure performance by \nlooking at health care outcomes, not by compliance with bureaucratic \nrequirements.\n  Nonetheless, it is this administration that is now threatening to \ntake action against the State of Missouri. It is doing so even when \nthere can be no doubt that our program is working to provide better \nhealth care to kids, to seniors, and our most needy citizens.\n  Of course, the timing of this threatened action could not come at a \nworse time. Our economic downturn is causing a great deal of distress \nin our communities. We are seeing significant job losses. State \nrevenues are declining, and at the same time our citizens' needs are \nincreasing.\n  Why, I ask, at this time of national emergency, would the \nadministration choose to attack a successful program that has provided \nhealth care security for so many?\n  And why would the administration want to divert the State's attention \nfrom the task of helping Missouri get through this economic downturn?\n  There really are no good answers to these questions.\n\n[[Page S11182]]\n\n  Senator Bond and I, Governor Holden, and other Members of the \nCongressional delegation are unified in opposition to the threatened \nCMS action. I strongly urge Secretary Thompson, CMS Administrator \nScully, and other leaders in the administration to examine this issue \nwith great care before taking an action that would cause so much harm \nto our State.\n  Mr. President, I stand here with my fellow Missouri Senator to draw \nawareness to this important issue. I hope that CMS understands that we \nintend to take aggressive action to protect a highly successful program \nin Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is an issue that I brought to the \nattention of the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee when we marked up this bill in committee. I have been working \nover the past few years to protect the Missouri Medicaid program from \nthe devastating impact of a potential recoupment of almost $2 billion. \nConfronted with such a recovery--or even a fraction of that amount--\nMissouri would inevitably be forced to cut back on its Medicaid \nprogram, putting health care for many Missourians in jeopardy. I am \nhopeful that the State of Missouri and CMS can work together in good \nfaith to find a resolution that protects the care that the Missouri \nMedicaid program provides to 479,091 children, 21,517 seniors in \nnursing homes, and close to 30,000 pregnant women across the state.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate and thank Senator Carnahan and Senator Bond \nfor bringing this important issue to our attention. I am concerned that \nattempts to recoup Medicaid dollars from their state could jeopardize \nthe health care it provides for hundreds of thousands of children, \nsenior citizens, and pregnant women.\n  Clearly, our first priority has to be the beneficiaries of the \nMedicaid program. At this time of economic uncertainty, the last thing \nthis Government should do is put our most vulnerable citizens at \ngreater risk.\n  Again, I thank the Senators from the State of Missouri for raising \nthis issue, and I look forward to working with them on this matter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleagues from Missouri for bringing this \nimportant issue to the Senate's attention. I support their efforts and \nencourage CMS to work in good faith with the State to find a resolution \nto this matter that allows Missouri to continuing making progress in \nproviding health insurance to its citizens.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Specter for their \nsupport on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and my colleague, Senator Carnahan. We \nhave talked about this a great deal. Over the last decade, Missouri's \nMedicaid Program has faced a series of difficult but important \nchallenges.\n  Not only has the program been forced to struggle with internal \nissues, such as transitioning to managed care, reaching out to \nMissourians who are eligible but not yet enrolled in the program, and \nproviding adequate payment to health care providers who care for \nMedicaid patients. It has had to deal with a number of important \nchallenges presented at the Federal level as well. Not the least were \nefforts by Congress, attempted in both 1995 and 1997, but foiled by me \nand other legislators and people in similar circumstances in other \nStates, to limit States' abilities to make disproportionate share \nhospital payments to safety net hospitals.\n  Another challenge has been to expand coverage to children in working \npoor families as called for by the creation of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP. I was an early supporter of this program \nand its efforts to expand coverage for low-income children. Missouri \nachieved this as part of its 1997 Medicaid waiver which is now in \neffect.\n  In addition, in 1999, under the previous administration, the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, then called the Health Care \nFinancing Administration, HCFA, initiated an investigation of the \nMissouri Medicaid Program.\n  Since HCFA began the process, CMS has carried on this effort, moving \ndown the path to contend that Missouri may owe the Federal Government \nportions of the Medicaid funding the State received beginning in 1992 \nbased on concerns about whether the tax imposed on hospitals and \nnursing homes by the State of Missouri to help finance the Medicaid \nProgram actually complies with Federal law.\n  We all know that many States prior to 1992 tried to squeeze extra \nFederal funding by taking or accepting money from health care \nproviders, essentially nursing homes and hospitals, in order to inflate \nartificially State level medical spending and, thus, increase the \nFederal share of costs in the joint State-Federal Medicaid Program.\n  In 1991, of course, Congress passed the law to outlaw these \ncontributions and to establish strict new controls on provider taxes. \nThis law imposed a requirement on States that provider taxes be uniform \nand broad based, and it prohibited States from instituting hold \nharmless Medicaid schemes in which payments to a health facility, \nparticularly including DSH payments, were directly or indirectly \nrelated to the amount of provider tax a facility pays.\n  The State of Missouri believes it is fully in compliance with that \nlaw. CMS disagrees. Missouri does impose a tax on hospitals and nursing \nhomes to finance a State's share of Medicaid expenses, but the State \ninsists the tax is uniform and broad based.\n  Furthermore, the payments the State makes to Medicaid providers \nrecognize their proportion of indigent payments, but these payments are \ntargeted to needy facilities and are in no way intended to facilitate \nor pay for compensation for the provider taxes by the facilities that \nreceive the reimbursement.\n  This is a unique setup in which the State sends Medicaid payments for \nsome hospitals to a subsidiary of HMA, the hospital association, which \nthen acts as an agent in distributing the funds.\n\n  The CMS concerns about the Missouri situation center on this \narrangement, and we have reason to believe they were on a course to \nattempt to seek $1.6 billion in repayments. This would be an enormous \nsum for the Missouri Medicaid Program whose annual budget in 2001 was \nonly $3.5 billion, including both Federal and State funds.\n  If this action were to be taken, it would devastate the Medicaid \nProgram of the State of Missouri and the care it currently provides for \nover 479,000 children, 21,000 seniors in nursing homes, and close to \n30,000 pregnant women. That is absolutely unacceptable, and that cannot \ngo forward.\n  The State of Missouri already faces huge budget shortfalls due to \noverspending and, in the near term, will have difficulty even in \nmaintaining the current programs and services which are so vitally \nneeded. If CMS were to succeed in taking these funds back, Missouri's \nMedicaid Program and over 800,000 people currently served could be \ngrievously harmed.\n  I come to the Chamber today with my colleague from Missouri to raise \nthis issue for the Senate. We have entered into a colloquy with the \nmanagers of the bill because we believe, as a result of raising this \nissue when we discussed it in the Appropriations Committee markup, that \nwe started the process of bringing the State of Missouri and CMS \ntogether in good faith negotiations on the issue.\n  We strongly urge them to come to a resolution that meets CMS's \nconcerns but that protects the integrity of Missouri's Medicaid Program \nand the care it provides to some of Missouri's most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  I appreciate the time of the Senate, and I appreciate the \nunderstanding of the managers of the bill. My colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Carnahan, and I look forward to seeing a successful resolution \nthat will take care of the concerns of CMS, but also not take away the \nvitally needed Medicaid support for needy children, for the seniors in \nnursing homes, and for the pregnant women.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2035 to Amendment No. 2020\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished senior \nSenator from Alaska and myself, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 2035 to amendment \n     No. 2020.\n\n[[Page S11183]]\n\n       At the end of the amendment add:\n       (a) Notwithstanding Rule 3 of the Budget Scorekeeping \n     Guidelines set forth in the joint explanatory statement of \n     the committee of conference accompanying Conference Report \n     105-217, the provisions of the amendment that would have been \n     estimated by the Office of Management and Budget as changing \n     direct spending or receipts under section 252 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 were it \n     included in an Act other than an appropriations Act shall be \n     treated as direct spending or receipts legislation, as \n     appropriate, under section 252 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency deficit Control Act of 1985, and by the Chairman of \n     the Senate Budget Committee, as appropriate, under the \n     Congressional Budget Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment by Mr. Domenici is the text of \nS. 534, the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2001. This \namendment would prohibit group health plans and group health insurance \nissuers that provide both medical and surgical benefits and mental \nhealth benefits from imposing treatment limitations or financial \nrequirements for coverage of mental health benefits that are different \nfrom those used for medical and surgical benefits.\n  The problem Senator Stevens and I encountered in processing this \namendment is that the Senate Appropriations Committee would be charged \nwith approximately $1.5 billion over the next decade if this amendment, \nworthwhile as it may be, were to be adopted. Both Senator Stevens and \nI, I believe, are cosponsors of the underlying legislation, S. 534. I \ndid not realize that legislation was going to be offered as an \namendment to an appropriations bill, however, or I might not have \ncosponsored it. Because of the adverse impact on discretionary \nspending, we would be forced to oppose this amendment in its current \nform. In an effort to find a workable solution to the problem, this \namendment would direct that any expenditures resulting from this \namendment be charged to the committee of jurisdiction under the budget \nprocess. If this amendment is adopted, I will drop my opposition to the \nunderlying amendment.\n  Senator Stevens and I have spoken with the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, and they are in agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to join with the distinguished chairman of \nour committee in offering this amendment to the Domenici amendment.\n  Senator Byrd and I have made a firm agreement to hold the line on the \nunderstanding we reached with the House of Representatives and the \nPresident of the United States to hold the total spending to $686 \nbillion this year. This amendment does not breach that agreement. I am \ntalking about the Domenici amendment does not breach this agreement.\n  Further, the amendment to the Domenici amendment will assure in \nfuture years, if there are caps continued under the Budget Control Act, \nthat this amendment will not result in monies being assessed to our \ncommittee, as Senator Byrd has stated. They should properly be asserted \nto the committee of jurisdiction.\n  I am of the firm opinion this is a good bill. I was a cosponsor of \nthe bill. I did not expect it to be offered to an appropriations bill, \nbut under the parliamentary situation I do not express objection to \nthat. I do, however, think the Senate should be reminded once again we \nhave a firm understanding with regard to the appropriations process \nthis year, and if we hold to that understanding I think we will finish \nour bills in time to enjoy the holidays with our relatives. If we \nbreach that agreement, we will be here for a long time.\n  I am proud to serve with Senator Byrd, who is chairman, because we \nare two people who I believe keep our word. We have in this instance \nconvinced the Senate to follow us in that regard. So I thank the \nSenator very much and am pleased to cosponsor the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Very quickly, I know Senator Domenici is in a markup \non the energy and water bill, along with Senator Harkin.\n  I thank my two colleagues for their amendment. I think it just adds \nto the strength of the bill. It is very important to have their \nsupport. So I thank both of them for their work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nfull committee, Senator Byrd, and the ranking member, Senator Stevens, \nfor their assistance in moving ahead with this very important \namendment.\n  Parity for mental health has been an objective of about two-thirds of \nthe Senators for many years. Through today's action, I think we are on \nthe road to getting that accomplished. So I salute my colleagues and \nthank my colleagues for their cooperation and good work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the second-degree \namendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2035.\n  The amendment (No. 2035) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2020, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 2020), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HARKIN. Madam \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

That upon \npassage, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with \nthe House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with this \naction occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this is an amendment I discussed on the \nfloor briefly earlier today. I shall be brief again. I understand under \nideal circumstances this amendment would be placed somewhere else, at \nsome other time, perhaps in some other bill. It is an amendment that is \ncritically important and should have been done last week. It should now \nbe law. It should already be providing protection to the American \npeople today but is not.\n  I am angry about that because the Congress should not have missed \nthis opportunity last week. I don't intend to let the Congress miss \nthis opportunity at any point along the way. I will offer it, and if it \nis not finally a part of this bill when signed by the President, I will \noffer it to every bill.\n  Let me describe the circumstance. I am chairman of an appropriations \nsubcommittee and I held a hearing a few weeks ago and had the \nCommissioner of the Customs Service and the Commissioner of the \nImmigration Service testifying before that subcommittee. One of the \nthings they talked about was the need to provide security with respect \nto who is coming into our country. A country cannot be secure unless it \nhas some notion of border security. We have millions of people coming \ninto our country each and every year. They are guests of ours, coming \nin on a visa given by our country.\n  When people come to our country, we welcome them. We want them to \nvisit our country, but we also want to be sure the people who are \ncoming to our country from foreign lands are people we want to have as \nguests. There are some we want to keep out: Those involved in terrorist \nactivities, those who have had association with terrorist groups, known \nand suspected terrorists. We do not want to welcome them into our \ncountry. We want to keep them out. That is the whole purpose of border \nsecurity.\n  We have around 80 million people who come to this country every year \non some 400,000 international flights. I repeat, on 400,000 \ninternational flights we have some 80 million people disembark to visit \nthe United States.\n\n[[Page S11185]]\n\n There are just over 100 major air carriers flying those passengers \ninto our country. We have an arrangement with 95 of those air carriers \nto voluntarily provide the United States Customs Service with advance \npassenger lists of who is coming to visit our country. The Customs \nService runs that list against a list the FBI has, the Customs Service \nhas, and 21 different agencies of law enforcement, to evaluate which of \nthese passengers, if any, should not be allowed into our country, which \nof them are on the suspect list, and which are on the list of known or \nsuspected terrorists.\n  We have the majority of the airline carriers and the majority of the \nnames of passengers being given to our law enforcement authorities in \nthe form of an advance electronic passenger list. It is called the \nAdvance Passenger Information System. It is a voluntary, not mandatory, \nsystem covering 85 percent of the international air passengers that are \nnot already pre-cleared by Customs. It works fine except we have a \nnumber of carriers from countries that do not participate.\n  Let me list a few: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan, just to \nname a few.\n  One would ask whether we should be getting advanced passenger \ninformation from these countries. The answer is yes. In fact, the \nSenate said yes last week. The Senate was prepared to adopt this \namendment last week as part of the counter-terrorism bill, which is \nwhere it should have been. In conference it was knocked out. It went to \nconference with the U.S. House. Some were worried more about committee \njurisdiction than they were about security. So they knocked it out.\n  The result was, when the President signed that counter-terrorism \nbill, it did not have this provision that makes mandatory the Advanced \nPassenger Information System.\n  What does that mean? It means that today about 219,000 international \nair passengers arrived in the United States--today, Tuesday. About \n34,000 are pre-cleared by U.S. Customs agents stationed abroad who run \nan APIS-type check as part of the clearing process, 156,000 are pre-\nscreened through APIS while they are in flight, leaving approximately \n29,000 whose names are not provided to the Customs Service until they \narrive because their carriers do not participate in the Advanced \nPassenger Information System. Why? Because the Congress last week \ndecided not to include that requirement in a conference report.\n  The President wants this requirement. The Customs Service wants the \nrequirement. All the Federal law enforcement authorities want the \nrequirement. We get it on 85 percent of international air passengers. \nAnd the ones we don't get it from are Pakistan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, \nEgypt, and Jordan, just to name a few.\n  I ask the question: Does it promote this country's security to \nrequire those air carriers to provide the same information that \nvirtually every other air carrier in the world provides to us? The \nanswer is clearly yes.\n  We are less secure today than we should be because the Congress \nknocked out my provision in that conference committee. That provision \nwas not in the counter-terrorism bill when the President signed it, \ndespite the fact that the Senate supported it. The Senate said yes. But \nit was knocked out in conference.\n  I intend to offer this to any vehicle I have the opportunity to offer \nit to. I know that it doesn't necessarily belong on an appropriations \nbill. But it belongs in law in this country. It belongs there now. It \nshould be there now. It should be providing security for this country \nnow with respect to the 29,000 people who entered this country today \nwhose names were not provided under the Advanced Passenger Information \nList. It makes no sense to me to be in this situation.\n  Some would say, well, this really inconveniences and mandates the air \ncarriers to do this. No, it does not. Most of the air carriers do it \nvoluntarily, and they have a good relationship with our country. But \nsome air carriers decided that they will not do it. The Customs \nCommissioner and others indicate that we ought to make it mandatory. I \nagree with that.\n  Since September 11, things have changed. It is not profiling. It is \nnot profiling in any way to ask for an advanced list of passengers who \nare going to visit our country as guests in our country. But we are \ntrying to profile those who are terrorists and suspected terrorists. \nLet's admit to that.\n  One of the goals that we have in all of our efforts with respect to \nincreasing security at our borders is to determine who the people are \nwho associate with terrorists and known terrorists or suspected \nterrorists, and try to keep them out of our country. Unfair? I don't \nthink so, not in the circumstance where thousands of Americans have \nbeen killed-- cold-blooded murder by terrorists who decided to use an \nairplane as a weapon of destruction; not at a time when terrorists sent \nanthrax-laced letters around this country through the mail system and \npeople die.\n\n  I ask that we include this amendment in this appropriations bill. I \nhope those who are talking about their committee jurisdiction will \nunderstand that this isn't about jurisdiction. It is about security. \nThis isn't about trying to protect your little area. It is about common \nsense to try to protect this country's borders. The Advanced Passenger \nInformation System works. It has worked for a long while. It provides \nthis country names that are important to secure our borders, except \nthat it doesn't do it in all instances. In the instances where it \nfails, it is critically important to give this country critically \nimportant information in order to give this country some assurance and \nsome comfort.\n  I understand that we will probably deal with this amendment tomorrow. \nI wanted to offer it this evening.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I believe this amendment which I am \npledged to cosponsor should become law. It is very reasonable for the \nUnited States to require that airlines provide information about their \ninternational travelers coming to the United States so customs can be \nable to check if any of the passengers are of special concern.\n  We are going to considerable lengths to improve the safety of our \naviation system and to improve our ability to better protect our \nborders. Requiring that international airlines provide some basic \ninformation about their passengers and their cargo is very reasonable.\n  I understand some airlines are concerned about the small costs \ninvolved. Some airlines might have other reasons to not comply. But \nwith 85 percent compliance with the voluntary requirements, clearly the \nburden is well within reason. There is no question, given the realities \nof our world, this should be required information for any international \nflight coming to the United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11185-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, the terrorist attacks carried out by \nOsama bin Laden and al-Qaida on September 11 require a reevaluation of \nour national policy on what the government should be doing on its \nprimary responsibilities: the security of the people.\n  The United States was stunned by that diabolical attack. It was \nthought impossible to make the country, with special emphasis on the \nCongress, more ``fighting mad''; but that was done with the anthrax \nattacks. As a nation, we are determined to respond thoughtfully and \nforcefully to win the war against terrorism. This floor statement \nbriefly reviews some of the responses by the U.S. to terrorism for the \npast two decades to learn from our mistakes of the past and to guide us \non what to do in the future.\n  The United States has been slow to assert extraterritorial \njurisdiction to\n\n[[Page S11186]]\n\nbring to justice terrorists who attack U.S. citizens around the world. \nOrdinarily, jurisdiction resides in the locale where the crime \noccurred; however, a nation may assert extraterritorial jurisdiction \nwhere its citizens are victimized on foreign soil which provides the \nnexus for jurisdiction beyond its boundaries.\n  It was not until 1984 that the United States asserted \nextraterritorial jurisdiction to try terrorists who kidnaped or \nhijacked Americans abroad. Those provisions were contained in the \nOmnibus Crime Control Act of 1984 which was added onto the \nappropriations bill for the Department of Justice. The Senate and House \nJudiciary Committees, led by feuding chairmen, could not agree on \nlegislation, so an appropriation subcommittee took up the issues in an \nunusual way. The bill was passed in the middle of an all-night session, \nin which I participated along with Senator Warren Rudman on the Senate \nsubcommittee, and Congressman Bill Hughes on the House subcommittee.\n  That legislation still left a void on terrorism other than kidnaping \nor hijacking. On July 11, 1985, I introduced the Terrorist Prosecution \nAct of 1985, to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction for any attacks \non any U.S. citizen anywhere in the world. Several months later, the \nneed for such legislation became urgent when on December 27, 1985, 16 \npeople, including five Americans, were killed by random terrorist \nstrafings at the Rome and Vienna airports, and many others were \nwounded. This provided the impetus to pass the Terrorist Prosecution \nAct which became law on August 27, 1986, providing the basis for the \nindictments against Osama bin Laden for conspiring to murder 18 \nAmericans in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993, and 12 Americans at the \nNairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salam, Tanzania, Embassies in 1998.\n  Although there were solid precedents for the United States to act \nagainst indicted terrorists, who were harbored in foreign countries, \nthe United States declined to pursue an aggressive policy to enforce \noutstanding warrants of arrest. In 1886, in the case of Ker v. \nIllinois. 119 U.S. 436 (1886), the Supreme Court of the United \nStates held that a prosecution could be validly pursued even where the \ndefendant was abducted in a foreign country and brought back to the \nU.S. for trial. Ker, under indictment for fraud in Illinois, had fled \nto Peru. Illinois authorities pursued him to Peru and brought him back \nto Illinois for trial and conviction. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates said:\n\n       There are authorities of the highest respectability which \n     hold that such forcible abduction is no sufficient reason why \n     the party should not answer when brought within the \n     jurisdiction of the Court which has the right to try him for \n     such an offense, and presents no valid objection to his trial \n     in such court. (Ker, 119 U.S. at 444.)\n\nThat principle was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in \nFrisbie v. Collins, 342 U.S. 519, 522 [1953], in an opinion by Justice \nBlack, a noted civil libertarian.\n  Based on my experience as district attorney of Philadelphia in \npursuing indicted criminals, I thought some of those techniques could \nbe applied to international terrorists. Those ideas were expanded after \nchairing the Intelligence Committee and Judiciary Subcommittee on \nTerrorism.\n  After studying ``Ker'' and ``Frisbie,'' I urged U.S. executive branch \nofficials to consider abduction, if necessary, to bring back to the \nUnited States indicted terrorists. In hearings before the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, I \nquestioned Secretary of State George Schultz, Attorney General Edwin \nMeese, FBI Director William Webster and State Department Counsel \nAbraham Sofaer on that subject. In testimony before the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Terrorism on July 30, 1985, Judge Sofaer raised a \nseries of objections to such forceful action, saying:\n\n       I would say that seizure by U.S. officials of terrorist \n     suspects abroad might constitute a serious breach of the \n     territorial sovereignty of a foreign state, and could violate \n     local kidnapping laws--that is, the people who do the seizing \n     could be, in fact, criminals under local law. Such acts might \n     also be viewed by foreign states as violations of \n     international law incompatible with the foreign extradition \n     treaties that we have in force with those nations.\n\n  It may be that those hearings, urging the application of ``Ker'' and \n``Frisbie,'' led to action by U.S. law enforcement officials against \nFawaz Yunis, although his case did not involve abduction in a foreign \ncountry, but the principle was close. In June 1985, Yunis and other \nterrorists hijacked a Jordanian airliner with two U.S. citizens in \nBeirut, Lebanon. In September 1987, a joint operation of the FBI, CIA, \nand U.S. Military led to the capture of Yunis, who was lured onto a \nyacht off the coast of Cyprus with ``promises of a drug deal.'' Once \nthe yacht entered international waters, Yunis was arrested and returned \nto the U.S. for trial where he was convicted of conspiracy, aircraft \npiracy, and hostage-taking, and then sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n\n  The hearings on ``Ker'' and ``Frisbie'' may have also led the DEA--\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration--to abduct from Mexico Dr. Alvarez-\nMachain who was implicated in the kidnaping and murder of a DEA agent \nin Mexico in 1985. After the DEA unsuccessfully negotiated with Mexican \nauthorities for Alvarez-Machain's surrender, DEA officials offered a \nreward to a group of Mexican citizens for delivering Alvarez-Machain to \nthem in the United States, which was done in April 1990. The trial \ncourt dismissed the case because the DEA agents had violated the \nextradition treaty with Mexico, and the Circuit Court of Appeals \naffirmed. When the case reached the Supreme Court of the United States, \nthe Court reversed the lower courts and stated this principle of law:\n\n       The power of a court to try a person for a crime [exists \n     even if] he had been brought within the court's jurisdiction \n     by reason of a forcible abduction. (United States v. Alvarez-\n     Machain, 504 U.S. 655, 661 (1992).)\n\nAnd now onto Osama bin Laden's longstanding record on terrorism against \nthe United States.\n  The cases of Ker, Frisbie, and Alvarez-Machain provided ample \nprecedent for the United States to have acted against Osama bin Laden \nprior to September 11, 2001. For a decade, Osama bin Laden had been \nprosecuting a war of terrorism against the United States. In 1992, he \nissued a religious declaration, known as a fatwah, urging that United \nStates troops be driven out of Saudi Arabia, and the fatwah was \nextended in 1993 to demand expelling U.S. troops from Somalia. The \nterrorists convicted for bombing the World Trade Center in 1993 were \ntrained in al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan. In 1996, al-Qaida called for \na jihad against the United States.\n  In February 1998, bin Laden and al-Qaida issued another fatwah, \ncalling for the murder of U.S. citizens wherever they were found in the \nworld. In May 1998, bin Laden announced the need to possess a nuclear \nweapon against ``Jews and Crusaders.'' In indictments returned in \nNovember 1998, Osama bin Laden was charged with conspiring to murder \nU.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and Somalia and for being directly involved \nwith the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August \n1998. In June 1999, bin Laden called for the killing of all American \nmales. And then bin Laden was involved with al-Qaida in the terrorist \nattack on the USS Cole.\n\n  Notwithstanding demands by the United States and the United Nations, \nthe Taliban refused to turn bin Laden over to U.S. authorities. In \nharboring bin Laden, the Taliban, the de factor government of \nAfghanistan, was an accessory after the fact. In his September 20, 2001 \nspeech to a Joint Session of Congress, President Bush equated those who \nharbor terrorists with the terrorists themselves.\n  From all that, it was readily apparent that bin Laden and al-Qaida \nwere at war with the United States even prior to September 11. Then, on \nSeptember 11, in addition to murdering 7,000 Americans, bin Laden and \nal-Qaida sought to destroy our symbol of economic achievement by \nleveling the twin towers of the World Trade Center and to decimate the \nWhite House and U.S. Capitol with planes which crashed into the \nPentagon and in a Pennsylvania field.\n  In a Senate floor statement the following day, September 12, I said--\nand it is worth repeating now:\n\n       [T]here have been many declarations that what occurred \n     yesterday with the Trade Towers and the Pentagon were acts of \n     war. And there is no doubt about that. Similarly, what bin \n     Laden did in Mogadishu in 1993 and in the Embassies in 1998 \n     were acts of war. At this time, while the Congress should \n     never act precipitously, I do suggest that consideration be \n     given to a declaration of war\n\n[[Page S11187]]\n\n     against the political entity which harbors and has given aid \n     and assistance to bin Laden's terrorist organization and bin \n     Laden and his co-conspirators, based on the indictments which \n     already have been handed\n     down . . .\n\n  It was my view on September 12 that even though we could not prove at \nthat time that bin Laden was responsible for the terrorism of September \n11, that a basis already existed for declaring war on Afghanistan and \nthe Taliban for harboring bin Laden based upon the indictments which \nhad already been returned establishing probable cause for acts of war \nwhich bin Laden and al-Qaida had committed against the United States.\n  On September 13, when the President met with Members of Congress from \nNew York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, which were the impacted States, I \nurged President Bush to consider a declaration of war against \nAfghanistan and the Taliban on the basis of the outstanding indictments \nagainst bin Laden and the Taliban's refusal to turn him over. The \nPresident made no response at that meeting to my suggestion.\n  President Bush declined to ask for a declaration of war, but he did \nrequest a resolution authorizing the use of force which was passed \nunanimously in the Senate and 420-1 in the House.\n  Presidential executive orders have provided that: ``No person \nemployed by or acting on behalf of the U.S. Government shall engage in, \nor conspire to engage in, assassination.'' But in April 1986, President \nReagan ordered the bombing of Tripoli, Libya, and Muammar Qadhafi after \nintelligence intercepts implicated Libyan intelligence operatives in \nthe bombing of a disco in Berlin, resulting in the death of two \nAmerican soldiers.\n  Similarly, President Clinton ordered a missile attack on Osama bin \nLaden in Afghanistan in August 1998 after the Embassy bombings. In an \ninterview with Tom Brokaw on NBC News on September 18, 2001, former \nPresident Clinton said:\n\n       We had quite good intelligence that he [bin Laden] and his \n     top lieutenants would be in his training camp. So I ordered \n     the cruise missile attacks, and we didn't tell anybody, \n     including the Pakistanis, whose airspace we had to travel \n     over, until the last minute, and unfortunately we missed \n     them, apparently not by very long. We killed a number of \n     terrorists, destroyed the camp, but we didn't get him or his \n     top lieutenants. And I made it clear that we should take all \n     necessary action to try to apprehend him and get him. We \n     never had another chance where the intelligence was as \n     reliable to justify military action. He's very elusive. He \n     spends the night in different places, often stays in--in \n     caves. There were times when he tried to hide among a lot of \n     women and children. It's a tough . . .  nut to crack. But the \n     world is changed now, and . . .  the pressure that President \n     Bush and the administration is putting on the Taliban and \n     also on the Pakistanis, and the statements the Pakistanis \n     have made, and the unity we've got around the world--we \n     finally got other countries as concerned about this as we \n     are. . .\n\n  Now to a discussion of Israel's response to terrorism. It is worth \nnoting what Israel has done in its war against terrorism. Israel has \nadopted a policy on what could be called ``executions'' after its own \ndetermination of terrorists' guilt. After the massacre of the 11 \nIsraeli Olympic athletes in Munich in 1972, it is reported that Prime \nMinister Golda Meir and Defense Minister Moshe Dayan authorized the \nexecutions of 9 of the terrorists whom they identified as being \nresponsible for the Munich murders. One person, killed in Norway, was \nreported misidentified as a terrorist. Such executions have also been \ncarried out by Israel against terrorists who were principals of the \nPLO, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and Hamas whom the Israelis found \ninvolved in murders of Israeli civilians.\n  The terrorism of September 11 should make us more understanding of \nthe perils faced by Israel for five decades. Since the second Intifada \nbegan in September 2000, Israel has sustained 165 deaths from the \nkillings. On a proportionate basis to our population, that would \ntranslate into over 7,000 Americans, a virtual equivalency to the mass \nmurders on September 11. Should Israel be expected to respond \ndifferently from the way we responded to September 11? Just as the \nUnited States must find a way to stop terrorist attacks on U.S. \ncitizens, a way must be found to stop the violence which has killed 714 \nPalestinians as well as 165 Israelis.\n  In seeking to organize a coalition against bin Laden and al-Qaida, \nthe United States has urged, even pressured, Israel to temper its \nresponses against Palestinian terrorists. In so doing, the United \nStates should consider whether it is applying a double standard between \nwhat we are doing and what we ask Israel to do. What is the difference \nbetween the United States demand on the Taliban to turn over Osama bin \nLaden contrasted with Israel's demand on Chairman Arafat to turn over \nthe assassin of the Israeli tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi.\n  The usually perceptive Thomas L. Friedman in his October 23 New York \nTimes column applied such a double standard. Asking Israel to pull its \npunches against Palestinian terrorism to stop ``. . . inflam[ing] the \nArab-Muslim world in order to avoid . . . seriously undermining our \n[the United States] coalition against bin Laden,'' Friedman calls for \nIsrael to subordinate its security interests to those of the United \nStates. Friedman then asks Prime Minister Sharon whether ``. . . you \n(know) how serious this war is for America''? Is the war against \nPalestinian terrorism any less serious for Israel?\n  In seeking the assistance of Arab countries in the coalition, the \nUnited States has been careful not to ask for more than can reasonably \nbe expected. Similar consideration must be extended to Israel. During \nthe gulf war in 1991. Prime Minister Itzhak Shamir and Israel \ncooperated with the United States by taping their windows, wearing gas \nmasks, and not responding to Iraqi Scud missile attacks. Israel has \nmade serious, good-faith efforts to negotiate with Arafat \nnotwithstanding the Intifada violence. Prime Minister Barak made the \nPalestinian authority a very generous offer in January 2001. Foreign \nMinister Shimon Peres has engaged in extensive negotiations until those \ntalks were interrupted by outbursts of Palestinian terrorism.\n  There was a real question as to how much control Chairman Arafat can \nexert over Palestinian terrorism. Last April 16, I met Chairman Yasser \nArafat in Cairo near midnight at the precise time Israel was responding \nto Palestinian mortar attacks. As we talked, aides brought Arafat \ncommuniques describing the fighting. I asked Chairman Arafat why he had \nnot accepted then Prime Minister Barak's generous offer earlier in the \nyear. Chairman Arafat responded that he had, but he was obviously \noblivious to the fact that he imposed so many conditions it was, in \nfact, not an acceptance.\n  I then called on Chairman Arafat to make a clear statement calling \nfor an end to Palestinian terrorists attacks. He said he had done that \nat the Arab summit on March 29, 2001. The transcript of his speech \nrefuted his statement. That speech was another example of his \nlongstanding tactic of sending contradictory messages. Chairman Arafat \nis famous for saying one thing in English to one audience and the \nreverse in Arabic to another audience.\n  In assessing Chairman Arafat's ability to reign in Palestinian \nterrorism, we must take into account that today he is not the man he \nwas when he shook the hands of Prime Minister Rabin and Peres on the \nWhite House South Lawn on September 13, 1993, in the presence of \nPresident Clinton. Shortly thereafter, I met Chairman Arafat in Cairo \nin January 1994 traveling with a congressional delegation. At that time \nArafat was healthy, robust, and forceful.\n  Seven years later, when I again met him in Cairo, he was shaky, \nhesitant, and spoke mostly through his aides. The recent challenges to \nhis authority by Hamas, resulting in Chairman Arafat's firing on and \nkilling Palestinians in early October, shows his diminished authority \nand raises serious questions as to whether he can be effective in \nending the Palestinian violence even if he wants to.\n  This April, Secretary of State Colin Powell criticized Israel's \nresponse to Palestinian terrorism saying Israel's military action was \n``excessive and disproportionate.'' In hearings before the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations on May 15, 2001, I \nchallenged Secretary Powell's characterization and said:\n\n       While Israel did respond very, very forcefully, Israel \n     could have responded much more forcefully and is facing a \n     situation where everybody is sort of at wit's end. And I \n     believe that the calculation is made that if they hit them \n     hard enough within reason that they will--that the \n     Palestinians perhaps will stop the terrorism although that is\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\n     very complicated with Hamas and Islam Jihad and the others.\n\n  Then Secretary Powell sought to justify his comment by saying that we \ntried to be ``even-handed''. He then referred to ``the cycle of \nviolence.'' The comment on ``cycle of violence'' suggests some sort of \nparity or moral equivalency between the purpose and level of force \nbetween Palestinian terrorists and Israel's reaction in self-defense.\n  There is, realistically viewed, no moral equivalency.\n  Terrorism, the killing of innocent victims, is totally reprehensible, \nrepugnant, and morally unjustifiable. Self-defense in response to such \nterrorism is morally justifiable and is authorized under international \nand natural law.\n  When United States pressure on Israel increased, Prime Minister \nSharon bluntly told the Bush Administration ``do not try to appease the \nArabs at our expense'' and analogized the situation to the allies \nsacrificing Czechoslovakia in the Munich Pact of 1938. The Bush \nadministration replied in kind calling Sharon's comment \n``unacceptable.''\n  In limiting the freezing of terrorist assets to individuals and \ngroups connected to the al-Qaida organization and the Irish Republican \nArmy, President Bush did not extend United States efforts to ``every \nterrorist group of global reach,'' as articulated in his September 20th \nspeech. Perhaps he left out Hamas, Hezbollah, the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization and other Arab terrorist organizations to maximize the \nchances to get Syria and other Arab countries into our coalition.\n  Israel's battle against Palestinian terrorism would have benefited by \nour freezing the bank accounts, of Hamas, Hezbollah and the PLO, just \nas we did with terrorist organizations connected to Osama bin Laden; \nbut United States national interests at the moment may have differed--\njust as Israel's national interest may differ.\n  Israel cannot be blamed for the September 11 terrorism. Senator John \nMcCain was right when he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on October \n21:\n\n       So if Israel were taken off the face of the Earth tomorrow, \n     we would still be facing the same terrorist problems we have \n     today.\n\n  Osama bin Laden's hatred against the United States, is rooted in \nevents which preceded Israeli's existence. His videotaped statement \nbroadcast on October 7 cited, ``what America is facing today is \nsomething very little of what we have tasted for decades. Our nation, \nsince nearly 80 years is tasting this humility.'' He raged against the \nUnited States for our military action against Iraq and Japan. The two \nreferences to Israel were minor compared to his diatribe against \nAmerica as the ``head of international infidels.''\n\n  His disregard for human life was palpable in minimizing ``a few more \nthan 10 were killed in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.'' The intensity of \nhostility was demonstrated by a statement by Ayman al Zawahir, one of \nhis close associates, on the same videotape:\n\n       American people, can you ask yourselves why there is so \n     much hatred against America?\n\n  The New York Times on October 7 characterized bin Laden's anti-\nAmerican attitude:\n\n       Mr. bin Laden, born in Saudi Arabia, has typically focused \n     his anti-American statements on the presence of American \n     troops in Saudi Arabia, declaring it a violation of Islamic \n     holy places. Now, in keeping with the rest of the Arab world, \n     he shifted focus to the Palestinian uprising that began in \n     September 2000, as officials believe.\n\n  A minister of the United Arab Emirates is reported to have warned the \nUnited States that if Israel continued killing Palestinians, ``most of \nus will certainly have to reconsider our role in the coalition''. The \nUnited States was obviously seeking to assuage Arab objections when \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld skipped Israel in his recent mid-East \ntrip and Secretary of State Powell emphasized that Israel would not be \npart of any military coalition. Hezbollah and Hamas are now reportedly \naccelerating their terrorism on the expectation that Israel may be \nreluctant to respond out of concern for Arab participation in the \ncoalition. That is a prelude to the most important part of this \nsomewhat lengthy statement, and that is a focus on dealing with \nterrorism in the future.\n  The conduct of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida prior to September 11 \nshould have put the United States on notice that we were facing a \nruthless, powerful enemy engaged in a religious war with the capacity \nto inflict enormous damage. By 20/20 hindsight, the United States \nshould have taken whatever action was necessary to, as President Bush \nlater put it, either bring bin Laden and al-Qaida to justice, or to \nbring justice to them. The point is not to attach blame for what \nhappened in the past; but to learn from this bitter experience how \ntough and determined we must be from this day forward in fighting \nterrorism. After September 11, it is obvious that the civilized world \nfaces decisions on how to deal with terrorism which threatens our \nsurvival. Self defense, acknowledged as a person's most primordial \nmotivation, is recognized as a fundamental principle in international \nlaw.\n  Congress, in conjunction with the President, has the responsibility \nto conduct hearings, deliberate, and establish our national policy on \nhow to deal with terrorism. As a starting point, Congress should \nconduct oversight hearings to determine whether our intelligence \nagencies were at fault in failing to provide warnings of the September \n11 attacks. If so, Congress must act to cure such deficiencies and to \ndo whatever is necessary at whatever cost to reorganize our \nintelligence agencies and provide the resources to be as sure as \npossible that we will not be again caught by surprise. The oversight \nhearings on the adequacy of our intelligence should be deferred until \nnext year so as not to distract the intelligence community from using \nits full resources to detect current threats.\n\n  Congress, in conjunction with the President, should consider the \npublic policy behind the Executive Order banning ``Assassinations.'' As \na starting point, we should consider whether the pejorative term \n``assassinations'' is accurate or whether we are really dealing with \n``executions,'' even if they are based on a non-judicial determination \nof guilt. It is one thing to prohibit the CIA from involvement in the \nkilling of a leader of a foreign political faction or from the killing \nof a foreign leader contrasted with the CIA implementing a Presidential \nfinding to take bin Laden into custody or kill him if there is no \nalternative.\n  The use of force in war or against terrorism does not require the \nsame level of proof to convict in a U.S. court of law. Without \nprejudging Israel's nonjudicial determinations of guilt and the \nfollowing ``executions,'' Congress must decide what quality of proof \nand what level of force is necessary to assure our Nation's survival.\n  It was concluded that the Executive Order banning assassinations did \nnot preclude President Reagan's order to bomb Libya and Qaddafi or \nPresident Clinton's order for a missile attack against bin Laden and \nal-Qaida in Afghanistan in August of 1998. In 1976, the Church \nCommittee on Intelligence Operations concluded:\n\n       . . . short of war, assassination is incompatible with \n     American principles, international order, and morality. It \n     should be rejected as a tool of foreign policy.\n\n  The Church committee's interdiction against assassination, ``short of \nwar,'' raises the obvious question as to when war begins or whether \nterrorism isn't in fact, war. When it becomes a matter of survival, I \nsuggest the pristine rules of the Church committee may have to be \nsuperseded, again depending on the circumstances.\n  Judicial determinations of guilt are not required as a basis for the \nuse of deadly force in war and should not be the basis for action \nagainst terrorists. Israel has long considered itself in a war for \nsurvival facing being vastly outnumbered and surrounded by hostile \narmies in wars in 1949, 1956, 1967 and 1973, and some of those nations \nstill have a state of war technically against Israel. In moving against \nthe Munich murderers and Palestinian terrorists, Israel has adopted an \nactivist policy of execution after a nonjudicial determination of \nguilt. All of that I suggest is worth studying.\n  In President Bush's speech to the Joint Session of Congress on \nSeptember 20, he said:\n\n       The war on terrorism . . . will not end until every \n     terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and \n     defeated.\n\n  Congress, in conjunction with the executive branch, must also decide \nwhat\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\naction should be taken against every nation which sponsors, supports, \nor harbors terrorists in order to meet President Bush's goal. We must \ndetermine what national security and survival require in evaluating a \npolicy on abducting or executing terrorists in foreign countries and \ntaking tough action against these who harbor them.\n  Consideration should also be given to the detention of individuals \nwhere there is reason to believe they are part of al-Qaida or some \nother group which is actively planning terrorism against the United \nStates. Under existing law, membership or an affiliation with such a \ngroup without more is not a basis for arrest or detention. The standard \nfor detention should not require the level or probable cause necessary \nfor a warrant of arrest or a search warrant but it should be more than \nmere surmise. It is obviously a difficult line to draw.\n  A case was reported after September 11 where a suspected terrorist \nwas detained when he tried to gain entry to the United States from \nCanada, but was released when there was not sufficient evidence to \narrest him. He was reportedly later identified as one of the pilots on \na September 11 hijacking, which illustrates the point that if we let \nthem go when we have reason to detain them, they may come back to kill \nus.\n  Twenty-first century terrorists do not wear uniforms. Study must be \nundertaken to determine an appropriate standard for detention on the \nanalogy of detaining prisoners of war. The issue of detention of aliens \nreceived considerable attention during the debate on the terrorism \nlegislation which was signed into law by President Bush on October 26. \nThat legislation answers part of the problem but not all of it.\n  Poignant scenes from ``Saving Private Ryan'' illustrate the problem.\n  In the movie, U.S. forces captured a German soldier behind enemy \nlines as they were making their way on their mission to save Private \nRyan. The German soldier pleaded for his life. The American soldiers \ndid not have the capacity to take him with them as a prisoner, so they \nhad the alternative of killing him or letting him go.\n  When he promised to move to U.S.-held territory and surrender \nhimself, the American soldiers relented and released him.\n  In a later scene, that German soldier confronts the same American \nsoldiers and kills several of them. That sequence illustrates American \ngenerosity and our natural instincts to be merciful. It is a lesson \nworth noting that we, as a nation, must reevaluate our level of \n``toughness'' if we are to survive.\n  In this Senate floor statement, I have sought to raise issues which \nmust be decided after congressional hearings and deliberations rather \nthan to provide definitive answers.\n  Now, Mr. President, I come to the crux of what I have had to say.\n  In summary, these are the issues to be decided by Congress in \nconjunction with the President, after hearings, deliberation, and \nconsultation. These are some of the issues which have to be considered. \nI do not say they are all inclusive, but these are the ones on my mind \nnow.\n  First, should the United States revise its policy against \nassassinations to acknowledge that war and terrorism warrant executions \nunder some circumstances?\n  Second, should such executions be authorized based on a nonjudicial \ndetermination of guilt, recognizing that responses to war and terrorism \nhave traditionally not required the level of proof to indict or convict \nin a U.S. court of law?\n  Third, what level of our national leadership should be invested with \nthe power to make such nonjudicial determinations of guilt?\n  Fourth, what are the standards for the quality and quantity of proof \nto make such a nonjudicial determination of guilt?\n  Fifth, should the United States be deterred from going into another \nsovereign nation to abduct or take forceful action against a terrorist \nwhen the host nation fails or refuses to turn over such terrorists?\n  Sixth, to what extent should the United States act against foreign \nnations or their officials who harbor terrorists?\n  And seventh, should individuals be detained where there is some basis \nto believe that they are non-uniformed members of al-Qaida or another \nterrorist organization on the analogy of incarcerating prisoners of \nwar? If so, what should be the standard for such detention, and who \nshould make the determination?\n  My sense is that America will maintain its resolve in carrying on the \nwar against terrorism regardless of how long it takes. The \nsteadfastness and durability of the coalition is another question. In \nmy opinion historically, ``Remember Pearl Harbor'' will be a mild \ndeclaration or exhortation to ``Remember September 11th!!''\n  That concludes my statement. I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nAlaska, for his patience, and in fact he was patient. He came in at the \nlatter part of my statement, and I have taken considerable time until \nSenator Stevens arrived, and there is no other Senator who sought \nrecognition. I appreciate the opportunity to make the statement which \nhas been the product of considerable work on my part.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11189-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11189-S11190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF THE BAYER CORPORATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to recognize \nand acknowledge the activities of one of my own very good corporate \nneighbors and constituents, the Bayer Corporation of Pittsburgh. Last \nweek, on October 24, Bayer Corporation's president and chief executive \nofficer, Mr. Helge H. Wehmeier, and U.S. Postmaster General John E. \nPotter announced Bayer's donation of 2 million doses of their \nantibiotic Cipro, one of the FDA's drugs of choice for the treatment \nand cure of anthrax disease.\n  This medication was donated to the Federal Government and is intended \nfor use by Federal employees who may need it. The medication will be \nadministered by U.S. Federal health care agencies, including the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and its Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, as well as local and State health care \nofficials in the Washington, DC, area.\n  There has been a claim, and justifiably so, for the heroism of our \nfiremen, our police, and our health care workers who responded to the \nattacks on September 11. Now with the problems with anthrax, we \nappropriately add to that honor roll the U.S. postal workers. Mr. Helge \nH. Wehmeier had noted that the unsung heroes, less celebrated perhaps, \nbut no less brave in their readiness to perform their duties, were the \npostal workers. Regrettably, we have seen problems with anthrax there. \nThe contribution by Bayer should be of substantial help.\n  I also call my colleagues' attention to the comments of Department of \nHealth and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson last week with \nrespect to the negotiations with Bayer and Mr. Wehmeier. I ask \nunanimous consent, following these brief remarks, there be printed in \nthe Record a copy of the press release which was issued following the \nmeeting with Secretary Thompson and Mr. Wehmeier, president and CEO of \nthe Bayer Corporation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   HHS, Bayer Agree to Cipro Purchase\n\n       Washington, Oct. 24.--HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson and \n     Mr. Helge H. Wehmeier, President and CEO of Bayer \n     Corporation, today announced agreement for a significant new \n     federal purchase of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (trademarked \n     Cipro) at a substantially lowered price. The antibiotic is \n     expected to be available by year end. Supplementing existing \n     emergency stockpiles, it would be available for use in the \n     event of a bioterror event.\n       Under the terms of the agreement valued at $95 million, HHS \n     will pay 95 cents per tablet for a total initial order of 100 \n     million tablets. This compares with a previously discounted \n     price of $1.77 per tablet paid by the federal government. \n     Bayer said it will rotate the government's inventory, as part \n     of this agreement, to assure the American public a \n     continuously fresh supply of Cipro. This inventory rotation \n     adds an additional value of 30 percent for the government, \n     which is included in the agreement.\n       Funds for the purchase are included in the $1.6 billion \n     emergency proposal made by President Bush Oct. 17, which \n     awaits Congressional action. HHS is also carrying out \n     substantial new purchases of other antibiotics that are \n     effective against anthrax, especially doxycycline. The \n     purchases will fulfill Secretary Thompson's proposal to \n     quickly increase the nation's emergency reserve of\n\n[[Page S11190]]\n\n     antibiotics. Resources to be on hand by January would treat \n     up to 12 million persons immediately for anthrax exposure. \n     Treatment would be with a mixture of effective antibiotic \n     products, with Cipro representing about 10 percent of the \n     antibiotics on reserve. Currently, 18.6 million Cipro doses \n     are available in the nation's emergency reserve, which would \n     enable immediate treatment of about 2 million persons in \n     combination with other antibiotics.\n       ``This agreement means that a much larger supply of this \n     important pharmaceutical product will be available if \n     needed,'' Secretary Thompson said. ``The beneficial price \n     also means that we can have more funds available to assist \n     state and local health responders to be ready for all \n     eventualities. I commend the Bayer Corporation for its \n     ongoing efforts to ensure a fully adequate supply of this \n     valuable product.''\n       ``Bayer is fully committed to supplying America in its war \n     on bioterrorism. This agreement between Bayer and the \n     Department of Health and Human Services is an important \n     security measure that will enable the nation to have in its \n     stockpile ample supplies of Cipro to combat the threat of \n     anthrax,'' said Bayer president Wehmeier. ``Cipro has become \n     standard for anthrax treatment. The men and women of Bayer \n     are 100 percent committed to delivering this vital antibiotic \n     to the U.S. government on schedule.''\n       Secretary Thompson said current supplies of Cipro and other \n     antibiotics which are effective against anthrax ``are \n     entirely adequate to meet the current need. This purchase is \n     aimed at expanding our emergency stand-by capacity, to make \n     us even better prepared for the possibility of massive \n     exposure to anthrax or other biological agents.''\n       As a further contingency, the agreement provides for the \n     option of a second order of 100 million tablets at 85 cents, \n     and a third order at 75 cents, if it is determined that \n     further orders are needed. Cipro is one of many antibiotics \n     that have been found effective in the treatment of exposure \n     to anthrax in the incidents in recent weeks. Current \n     treatment practice for anthrax exposure, including those \n     possibly exposed to anthrax, is a 60-day course, involving \n     initial use of a broad spectrum antibiotic like Cipro, for \n     five days, followed by determination of other antibiotics to \n     which the pathogen is susceptible.\n       The Cipro to be purchased would be used to expand emergency \n     stand-by supplies in the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile \n     (NPS), maintained by HHS' Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention. The NPS includes both vendor managed inventory \n     and 50-ton ``Push Packages,'' designed to be able to reach \n     any point in the continental United States within 12 hours. \n     The current eight ``Push Packages'' are to be expanded to 12, \n     under the President's proposals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11190-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMUNITY RAIL LINE RELOCATION ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, many cities and towns across our country \nare experiencing conflicts between railroads, motor vehicles, and \npeople for the use of limited and increasingly congested space in \ndowntown areas. High density highway-rail grade crossings, even \nproperly marked and gated ones, increase the risk of fatal accidents. \nMany rail lines cut downtown areas in half while serving few, if any, \nrail customers in the downtown area. Rail traffic can cut off one side \nof a town to vital emergency services, including fire, police, \nambulance, and hospital services. Downtown rail corridors can hamper \neconomic development by restricting access to bisected areas. Sadly, \nsince September 11, we now must be concerned about freight trains \ncarrying hazardous materials through the middle of densely populated \nareas being targets of terrorist actions. These problems exist in small \nand large cities and towns across the Nation.\n  While TEA-21 provides some flexibility in the use of the Highway \nTrust Fund to enable States to address some of these concerns, it is \nprimarily focused on solving transportation problems by building or \nmodifying roads, including road overpasses and underpasses, as it \nshould be. However, in many situations, this highway-rail conflict \ncannot, or should not, be fixed by cutting off or modifying a roadway. \nThe answer is often to relocate the rail line.\n  To address this need I introduced S. 948, the Community Rail Line \nRelocation Assistance Act of 2001. The bill would authorize the \nSecretary of Transportation to provide grants to States and communities \nto relocate a rail line where this solution makes the most sense. In \nthose cases where the best solution is to build a railroad tunnel, \nunderpass, or overpass, or even reroute the rail line around the \ndowntown area, this bill will enable these cities and towns to afford \nto undertake such a significant infrastructure project. The bill does \nnot tap the Highway Trust Fund. Instead, the rail line relocation grant \nprogram would compete for appropriations on an annual basis.\n  S. 948 is supported by the United States Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, the National League of \nCities, the Association of American Railroads, the Short Line and \nRegional Railroad Association, the Railway Progress Institute, the \nNational Railroad Construction and Maintenance Association, and the \nRail Supply and Service Coalition.\n  The Senate may soon consider other legislation to authorize funding \nto increase security for Amtrak, other modes of transportation, and our \nnation's ports. I ask my Senate colleagues to consider the needs of \ntheir own States, to cosponsor S. 948, and to support inclusion of this \nprovision in the next transportation authorization bill to be \nconsidered by the Senate. So far, working with representatives of our \nNation's cities, I have identified 40 cities in 23 States that are \nconcerned about rail crossing problems and for which rail line \nrelocation may be the solution, I am sure there will be several more \nsuch cities that will be identified in the weeks to come. I ask \nunanimous consent that the list of these cities be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Cities Concerned With Rail Crossings and Rail Line Relocation\n\n       Arizona: Marana and Tucson.\n       California: Fremont, Hemet, Mountain View, Paramount and \n     Richmond.\n       Colorado: Arvada.\n       Georgia: Augusta.\n       Iowa: Iowa City.\n       Illinois: Carbondale, Elgin and Roselle.\n       Indiana: Portage.\n       Massachusetts: Boston.\n       Minnesota: Rochester.\n       Mississippi: Biloxi/Pascagoula, Greenwood, Jackson, \n     Meridian, Tupelo and Vicksburg.\n       Missouri: St. Joseph.\n       North Carolina: Winston-Salem.\n       North Dakota: Fargo.\n       Nebraska: Grand Island and Lincoln.\n       Nevada: Reno.\n       New York: Hempstead.\n       Ohio: Brooklyn, Lima and Mansfield.\n       Oklahoma: Edmond.\n       Pennsylvania: Pittsburgh.\n       South Carolina: Columbia.\n       Tennessee: Germantown.\n       Texas: Beaumont, College Station and Laredo.\n       Wisconsin: Madison.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11190-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11190-S11191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                       medical device technology\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, first I thank, Chairman Kohl and \nSenator Cochran for their outstanding work in putting together an \nexcellent bill. An important part of this legislation provides funding \nfor the Food and Drug Administration to perform its vital mission to \nprotect and promote the public health. That mission includes the \nessential work of evaluating the safety and effectiveness of promising \nnew life-saving and life-enhancing medical device technologies so that \nthey may be used with patients in an expeditious manner. However, we \nmust be sure that the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDHR) \nare provided with the adequate resources to carry out their work. The \nnumber of patents issued in the medical device sector has increased by \n30 percent in recent years. The private sector is committing \nsubstantial increases in funding to healthcare research and \ndevelopment. We are fortunate that the FDA will be faced with the task \nof evaluating many new technologies that will benefit all of us next \nyear. It is my hope that we could review this issue in conference to \nensure that the premarket review function at CDRH receives an \nappropriate level of funding to carry out their mission.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleague for raising this matter. It is my \nconcern that the pre-market review function at the Center for Devices \nand Radiological Health does not have sufficient resources to keep up \nwith the tremendous pace of innovation that is now taking place in the \nhealth sector. Despite the FDA's ongoing efforts to improve in this \narea, review times for breakthrough medical devices are lengthy and \nlikely to get longer. While this bill makes important progress toward \ngiving FDA the funds it needs to carry out its mission, I hope the \nchairman would work with us in conference\n\n[[Page S11191]]\n\nto find a way to provide the resources needed to reduce medical device \napplication review times.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the remarks and understand the concerns \nexpressed by my colleagues. I agree that patients should not have to \nwait for promising new therapies due to insufficient resources at FDA. \nLanguage in the report accompanying the Senate bill states that the \nincrease received by FDA's Devices and Radiological Health Program for \nfiscal year 2002 is consistent with agency estimates for bringing \nmedical device application review times within statutory limits. While \nthis statement is accurate according to the budget submitted to \ncongress by the FDA, I have been informed that in testimony to the \nHouse Appropriations Committee, FDA officials stated the agency would \nneed more funds than requested in their budget to decrease application \nreview times significantly. I believe it is important for us to work \ntogether to resolve this issue, and look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and our House counterparts in the Conference Committee.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I was proud to offer an amendment to \nthe fiscal year 2002 agriculture appropriations bill.\n  The amendment I offered last week set aside $500,000 from the Office \nof Generic Drugs at the Food and Drug Administration for use in the \neducation and dissemination of information to America's senior citizens \nregarding the efficacy, safety and availability of generic drugs.\n  Currently, the FDA informs the public and providers about generic \ndrugs through print advertising, reaching a limited number of \nindividuals. It is my hope that this amendment will allow FDA to \nenlarge its outreach, utilizing not only print media, but also radio \nand television public service announcements.\n  In the absence of a Medicare prescription drug benefit, it is \nimperative that Congress provide alternative avenues for seniors \nneeding to lower their out-of-pocket prescription drug costs.\n  Although millions of seniors already know about and use generic \ndrugs, there are still many others who are not aware of their \navailability. Indeed, many highly used brand-name drugs whose patents \nhave expired have generic alternatives available. These generic drugs \nare chemically identical in their active ingredient to their brand-name \ncounterparts and are sold at substantial discounts from the branded \nprice.\n  For example, the prescription drug Kelflex, an antibiotic, costs \napproximately $88 per month. Its generic equivalent costs about $13 per \nmonth, a potential annual savings of $900 for an individual who uses \nthis product. In fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \ngeneric drugs save consumers an estimated $8 to $10 billion per year at \nretail pharmacies.\n  As each of my colleagues knows, the nature of health care has changed \ndramatically in America since the creation of Medicare in 1965. In many \ninstances, diseases or conditions that once required hospitalization \nare now treated by pharmaceuticals. However, as advances in \npharmaceuticals continue and the population ages, the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services reports that national spending for \nprescription drugs is expected to more than double from an estimated \n$117 billion to $366 billion over the next ten years. Unfortunately, \nthe financial burden on Medicare beneficiaries, those who use \nprescription drugs the most, will continue to increase. Consider the \nfact that Medicare beneficiaries account for 14 percent of the U.S. \npopulation, yet they consume approximately 43 percent of the nation's \ntotal drug expenditures and you can understand why we need to address \nthis issue.\n  $500,000 will ultimately only be a drop in the bucket in finding a \nsolution to providing access to affordable prescription drugs to \nseniors. However, these funds will help provide valuable information to \nthose who rely on medications the most. With greater reliance on \npharmaceuticals, increased direct-to-consumer advertising and the \nincreased empowerment of seniors, it is imperative that those who use \nprescription drugs become better educated about the availability of \ngeneric equivalents that are just as effective as their name-brand \ncounterpart.\n  While seniors wait for Congress to pass permanent prescription drug \nbenefit legislation, the federal government should capitalize on other \nopportunities to aid seniors in their effort to obtain affordable \nprescription drugs.\n  That is why I have offered this important amendment and why I will \nwork with Secretary Thompson and the Department of Health and Human \nServices to provide seniors with thorough information regarding highly \nutilized drugs, their generic equivalent and comparative pricing, as \nwell as any other pertinent information that is necessary to improve \nthe health and quality of life of our senior citizens. This information \nwould prove to be highly useful to seniors and could easily be included \nin the annual ``Medicare & You'' publication. Seniors are typically \nvery knowledgeable consumers of health care, and whatever information \nwe can provide is a critical way to help them bypass the high cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  It is a sad reality that some senior citizens on fixed incomes do not \ntake their full doses of their medications because they try to save \nmoney by stretching out their supply. Unfortunately, such self-\nmedication can lead to life threatening health considerations. The \namendment I offered will help our seniors get the information they need \non lower cost generic drugs so they may obtain the prescription drugs \nthey need to live their lives to the fullest.\n  I thank the manager and ranking member of the subcommittee for \naccepting this important amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11191-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11191-S11192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CHANGES TO THE 2002 APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION AND BUDGETARY \n                               AGGREGATES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, section 314 of the Congressional Budget \nAct, as amended, requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto adjust the budgetary aggregates and the allocation for the \nAppropriations Committee by the amount of appropriations provided to \nthe Social Security Administration for continuing disability reviews, \nup to $520 million in 2002, and the amount of appropriations provided \nto the Department of Health and Human Services for adoption incentive \npayments, up to $20 million in 2002. S. 1536, the Departments of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for 2002, provides a total of $453 million for the \ntwo activities.

EDMUNDS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, today I rise to speak about a very \nspecial soldier from Cheyenne, WY.\n  A U.S. Army Ranger was one of two soldiers killed October 19, when a \nBlack Hawk helicopter crashed in Pakistan.\n  Spc. Jonn J. Edmunds died when the helicopter he was riding in \ncrashed while supporting Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Jonn Edmunds was a 1999 Cheyenne East High graduate. He was 20 years \nold.\n  Jonn Edmunds and Pfc. Kristofer T. Stonesifer of Missoula MT, are the \nfirst combat deaths of the U.S. led military campaign against \nterrorists in Afghanistan. The soldiers were members of B Company Third \nBattalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, based in Fort Benning, GA.\n  Last Saturday, I attended Spc. Edmunds' funeral and had the \nopportunity to speak with Jonn Edmunds' father Donn. I told him how \nsorry we are for his loss. How words are not enough to comfort his \nfamily and friends or to express our pride for the job he was asked to \ndo.\n  This unfortunately, is war and this terrible loss will not be the \nlast. That certainly doesn't make it any less difficult for the family \nwhen someone like Jonn, young, patriotic, dedicated to his country and \nservice, is killed.\n  I want to again offer my sincere condolences to the family. We don't \npretend to understand your loss, but we share in your grief. Wyoming \nshares your grief and they, like I do, thank you for your son's \nservice.\n  War is hell. It will take the lives of soldiers and innocents alike.\n  I believe, as do all American's, that our cause is just. The cost of \ndoing nothing would be much worse. This effort will not be a short one. \nIt is important that we stay dedicated to the cause of defeating \nterrorism even in the face of terrible loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11192-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred February 17, \n1999 in Novato, CA. A 17-year-old gay male student, Adam Colton, was \nambushed and severely beaten. The letters F-A-G had been scratched into \nhis stomach and arms. Colton had been beaten the previous September in \nan anti-gay incident.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11192-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OVERSEAS COOPERATIVES\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise to commend Senator Leahy and \nSenator McConnell for their leadership in crafting the Fiscal Year 2002 \nForeign Operations Appropriations Bill.\n  I am here today to state my continued support of international \neconomic assistance for programs that utilize cooperatives and credit \nunions. Last year, Senators Grams, Feingold and I sponsored the Support \nfor Overseas Development Act, S. 3072. This Act was included as part of \na larger bill, the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance and International \nAnti-Corruption Act, H.R. 4673, which was signed into public law on \nOctober 17, 2000. This bipartisan legislation enhances current language \nin Section 111 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n  Overseas cooperatives foster similar principles abroad that U.S. \ncooperatives are based on: free democratic associations of mutual \nbenefit for members. For four decades, cooperatives and credit unions \nhave proven to be an effective and efficient way to assist people in \ndeveloping and market transition countries. Currently, U.S. \ncooperatives are working in over 67 different countries.\n  Under our legislation, USAID is encouraged to put greater priority on \nthe development of agricultural cooperatives for marketing, processing \nand inputs. USAID should explore community-based cooperatives for rural \nelectric and telephone service when national utilities are privatized. \nStrong financial cooperatives, such as credit unions and farm credit \nassociations, are ways to generate member-owned savings and provide \nmicro-loans to entrepreneurs and farmers. Housing and community \ndevelopment cooperatives can address issues such as daycare for HIV/\nAIDS, orphans and community responses to environmental problems such as \nsolid waste collection.\n  The Administrator of USAID, Andrew Natsios, is currently putting \ntogether a report to Congress regarding the implementation plan for \nthis legislation. I am looking forward to reviewing this report.\n  Credit unions and rural cooperatives are able to mobilize local \nsavings or equity for micro-loans as a way to provide greater food \nsecurity, the world's poor need access to microenterprise loans, credit \nand savings. Rural areas in developing countries need electricity and \ntelecommunications, yet history shows that there are insufficient \nprofits for private companies to enter these markets. Cooperatives \nshould be part of programs pursued by the World Bank and other \nmultilateral institutions to enhance rural communities as part of their \nprivate sector approaches.\n  USAID can tap cooperative methodologies to bridge ethnic and \nsectarian differences to build communities in areas that are rife with \nconflict. In communities ravaged by HIV/AIDS, war, terrorism and \ninequality, cooperatives empower communities. Cooperatives are direct \nand meaningful expressions of diplomacy where poor people can \nparticipate in decision-making that affects their daily lives.\n  Overseas cooperatives are an important way to promote broad-based \neconomic, political and social development. I am looking forward to \nprogress on this legislation in fiscal year 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11192-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11192-S11193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  WISE WORDS FROM A WARRIOR'S WARRIOR\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, Colonel David H. Hackworth, U.S. \nArmy, Ret., knows war as few men do. Today's most decorated living \nsoldier, he is a warrior's warrior.\n  He joined the Army when he was 15, was battlefield commissioned in \nKorea when he was 20 and was the youngest colonel in Vietnam.\n  His heroic achievements in both these wars made him a living legend. \nNever afraid to speak out, even when it meant criticizing our effort in \nVietnam, Hackworth has long been a knowledgeable observer worth \nlistening to.\n  This old soldier who has seen so much shared his recent observations \nin a thought-provoking, tell-it-like-it-is column in The Washington \nTimes. It is an article that should be read and believed by all \nAmericans. I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Times, October 27, 2001]\n\n                            Fight or Flight?\n\n                          (By David Hackworth)\n\n       My No. 1 son rang from Florida: ``Dad we're scared. We're \n     starting to wonder if we made a mistake leaving Indiana.'' \n     Another Floridian, Frederick George, wrote: ``I've never been \n     more depressed than now. I'm 86 years old, and I've seen a \n     lot.''\n       My phone rings off the hook, and my mailbox is jammed. Most \n     of the messages say: We're not coping well with this War \n     Against Terrorism. My comeback: Get used to it.\n       We're in for at least 30 rounds, and Round One is far from \n     being over. My 5- and 8-year-old grandkids will probably be \n     in college before the last terrorist creep has been hunted \n     down and folks can get back to the way things were before \n     Sept. 11.\n       You can try running, but you can't hide from fear. Just ask \n     the yellow-stained members of the House who ignored the \n     report\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\n     from last year's Hart-Rudman Commission predicting ``a direct \n     attack against American citizens on American soil is likely \n     over the next quarter-century'' and then cut and ran when the \n     first shot came their way.\n       But the attack on the World Trade Center proved in spades \n     that all citizens of every free country in the world are now \n     targets, so there's no longer any place safe to run. The \n     quickest way to get a grip and make it through this new kind \n     of war is to check out--and copy--the combat soldier's MO. \n     The whole living-on-the-bayonet-edge mindset becomes almost \n     second nature once a grunt accepts that his life can be \n     snuffed out any second. His ears get used to incoming--they \n     automatically tell him to hit the deck because a round is \n     about to thud in close, or to finish that smoke because it's \n     going over the hill. He's used to walking through areas where \n     one misstep will explode a mine and take his leg or life, and \n     he learns to take care of himself and his buddies almost \n     without thinking. Or he lets fear rule and goes mad. Or he \n     goes into denial and gets killed.\n       Many of you are combat vets--you just don't remember that \n     for most of your lives you lived with the fear of being \n     instantly incinerated and radiated by the Bomb. Remember the \n     air-raid sirens and the ``Duck and Cover'' drills? Those \n     25,000 Soviet nuclear warheads once pointed at you and yours \n     would have done a zillion times more damage than terrorist \n     bombs, kamikaze planes or bugs and germs.\n       On the battlefield, I wore my steel pot begrudgingly. It \n     was heavy and a pain. But I knew it would improve my chances \n     of staying alive, so I cursed it while I wore it. Now I \n     resent wearing a surgical mask and gloves and opening much of \n     my mail outside. But just like wearing that helmet, it helps \n     me stay alive while the FBI and the police track down the \n     terrorist sleepers imbedded in our society.\n       And so must all of you learn to live on a potential killing \n     field. Instead of letting fear knock you down, use it as \n     warriors do to stay alive. Fear can pump up your reactions if \n     employed positively and let you make it through the darkest \n     night. Survival is our strongest instinct, and we will win \n     this sucker just as we did World War II, the Cold War and the \n     conflict that follows this one.\n       The other survival skill you should borrow from a grunt is \n     alertness. A soldier asleep on guard duty is a dead soldier. \n     A terrorist will have a tough time doing his thing if we all \n     keep a sharp eye out for whatever doesn't compute.

Mr. President, today I honor one of the most \nfervent advocates for the labor movement and working families across \nthe country; Mr. Paul Dufault.\n  For the past 45 years, Paul has served the men and women of New \nEngland as an active member, secretary-treasurer and later as president \nof the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1445. Despite a \nchanging economy and an evolving workforce, Paul's vision and \nmotivation remained strong and unwavering for almost half a century. I \nam proud to extend to him my warmest appreciation for his steadfast \ncommitment to economic prosperity for all individuals and families.\n  Paul began his career in labor advocacy as a part-time employee at \nStop and Shop Supermarket, where he became a member of the Retail \nClerks Union Local 1445 in 1956. Four years later, when Local 826 of \nWorcester acquired the Worcester jurisdiction from Local 1445, Paul was \nbrought on as an organizer. Paul's strong work ethic and potential did \nnot go unnoticed an this was reflected in his promotion to business \nagent. This was followed in 1967 with an appointment to International \nRepresentative. Paul then advanced in 1971 to president of Local 1435. \nWith the merger of the Retail Clerks International Union and the \nAmalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen in 1976, Local 1435 merged \nwith Local 1445 and Paul stepped into the position of secretary-\ntreasurer.\n  In 1996, Paul was elected president of United Food and Commercial \nWorkers Local 1445 of Boston, MA. More than 3,000 new Local 1445 \nmembers were organized in the last three years, resulting in Local 1445 \nbecoming the largest UFCW local in New England. Paul's leadership has \nresulted in improved benefits and working conditions for members. Local \n1445 is indebted to Paul and all he has done for the working men and \nwomen of New England and I join them in thanking Paul for his \ncontribution to the labor movement over the last 45 years.\n  In addition to Paul's accomplishments in Local 1445, Paul was also \nvice president of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO and served as chairman of \nthe UFCW Interstate Health & Welfare fund, where he had been a trustee \nsince 1971. He contributed his expertise in labor issues to the \nGloucester Seafood Workers Pension and Health Welfare fund as a \ntrustee, and served as an alternate on the UFCW National Pension Fund, \nas well.\n  Mr. President, I am truly grateful to join families across \nMassachusetts and throughout the country in celebrating Paul's career \nand contributions. I wish he and Judy, as well as his four children and \nseven grandchildren, the very best as they begin this new chapter in \ntheir lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11193-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF SALLY SKINNER BEHNKE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize an outstanding citizen of the State of \nWashington. Sally Skinner Behnke has been awarded the 2001 Isabel \nColman Award for Excellence in Community Service for displaying \nsignificant and broad based leadership in her community. This \nprestigious award is given by the YWCA of Seattle-King County-Snohomish \nCounty and is reserved for an individual or organization whose efforts \nhave contributed to enhancing the quality of life in the community. Ms. \nBehnke's efforts for over 20 years have done just that.\n  Some of her many achievements include being the first woman to serve \non the board of Washington Mutual, Past President of the University of \nWashington Alumni Association, founding member and Past President of \nthe Northwest School for Hearing Impaired Children, and an active fund-\nraiser for the Lifelong AIDS Alliance. The two experiences that she is \nmost proud of are working on the board of the Fred Hutchison Cancer \nResearch Center and serving as Past Board Chair of Children's Hospital. \nThese contributions to our community make her more than worthy of this \naward and our recognition.\n  Ms. Behnke's work is inspiring, and her words are encouraging. She \nsaid, ``Take care of your home. Look around at this wonderful, \nwonderful place that is yours and mine. And if you haven't already, \nfind a little corner of it to give your heart to.''\n  On behalf of the people of Washington State, I would like to thank \nMs. Behnke for her time, energy and many years of dedicated \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11193-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11193-S11194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MELVIN VAN PEEBLES\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in a year when we have seen such \nterrible news about New York, we do well to remind ourselves of all the \ngood things that come from that great city.\n  One such thing was the awarding of Chevalier in the Legion D'Honneur \nto my friend, Melvin Van Peebles, by the Consul General of the Republic \nof France on April 24 of this year. The award was made to Mr. Van \nPeebles because of his work as an author, a producer, and a director of \naward-winning films.\n  I have known Melvin for years, and I know him as a man of conscience, \ntalent, erudition, and eclectic friendships. I have always considered \nmyself honored to be one of his friends. The man who first introduced \nme to Melvin was my good friend, Dr. Henry Jarecki, of New York, and he \nand Gloria Jarecki hosted the investiture at Gramercy House in New York \nCity.\n  I ask consent to print in the Record the comments made by Dr. Jarecki \nat that event, and to add my own congratulations to Melvin Van Peebles \nfor an award justly deserved.\n  The comments follow:\n\n                      Remarks of Dr. Henry Jarecki\n\n       Back in the fifties, while Melvin was becoming well-known \n     in America, I had been out of the country. So it is no \n     surprise that when Katie McGee first mentioned the name \n     Melvin Van Peebles some thirty-five years ago, I knew so \n     little about his work that I expected to meet a Dutchman. It \n     was indeed some years before I knew who I was dealing with \n     but in the meantime he had become a\n\n[[Page S11194]]\n\n     close friend who I could hang out with and gab about \n     philosophy, somebody who was an advisor and when needed, a \n     fellow mischief-maker. Gradually, I got to see and know all \n     about the famous Sweetback movie and his other films and I \n     read and saw his plays, especially Ain't Supposed to Die a \n     Natural Death and Don't Play us Cheap, two of the ones I \n     think are among the great works of American literature. Waltz \n     of the Stork, a musical I backed, was not one of the great \n     works. Otherwise I would be rich today. But we reflected on a \n     lot more plays, too, including the Bessie Smith piece called \n     the Champeen that we argued about for five years and still \n     have to make.\n       Close friends sometimes disagree--we solved that by making \n     bets. One bet he lost made him work for me on Wall Street for \n     a year during which he became the first Black trader on the \n     American Stock Exchange. Not surprisingly, he wrote a book \n     about it as he does about almost anything he does. That book, \n     called Bold Money, introduced many nonprofessionals to the \n     world of security option trading. He always writes books \n     about what he does. He makes movies about the making of \n     movies and he writes books about the ``making of the making \n     of a movie'' movie. Happily, all of this piques his viewers' \n     and readers' interest and makes him a bunch of money.\n       But he's made a lot more than movies, plays, and money. He \n     has made a number of wonderful children, all of whom I've had \n     the pleasure of hanging out with over the years, Megan, \n     Mario, Max, and maybe more. Megan has the beauty and the \n     wonderful heart she had when she worked at Mocatta and Mario \n     has become a distinguished motion picture actor and director \n     himself. Very few people know that one of the steps of his \n     professional life, maybe the step that taught him all there \n     was to learn about acting before he went to Hollywood was \n     working as a gold trader for me at a company called Mocatta.\n       The Van Peebles children have been friends of my children \n     and Melvin himself has helped each of my children, most \n     recently my son Eugene, who made a film called The Opponent \n     based loosely on Eugene's early life friendship with Mike \n     Tyson. Melvin's most recent French film, A Belly Full, was \n     not the reason for this Legion of Honor award but was its \n     occasion.\n       Even before making a great name in America, Melvin had \n     become well-known in France, partly for his book and movie, \n     Story of a Three-Day Pass which had won many awards there, \n     and throughout his life he has remained an American bridge to \n     France, even having one French son, Max, who has helped him \n     work on many of his movies. And so this clearly American icon \n     has gradually become a French figure of the arts as well.\n       We are all honored to be here tonight with Melvin Van \n     Peebles to help celebrate his receiving this award from \n     Consul-General Richard Duque who honors us with his presence. \n     I personally have in my own very modest film-making career \n     achieved only one thing: when I, following in Melvin's \n     footsteps, was making a movie about Cuban music in Havana \n     with my friend Gary Keys, I managed to buy some Cuban cigars \n     and also a wonderfully appropriate humidor in which to keep \n     them. And so, Melvin, I take pleasure in presenting you with \n     this unusual-looking humidor and the accompanying box of \n     Cuban cigars. If you choose to give some of these cigars out \n     to some of your guests here, feel free to do so: I have a \n     second one upstairs. And those who worry about smoking Cuban \n     cigars--and I'm not one--can always say the words of Melvin's \n     friend Pat Leahy, the Senator from Vermont, who tells us that \n     he cannot be criticized for burning Castro's crops.\n       Thank you all for coming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11194-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11194-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11194-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                    enrolled joint resolution signed\n\n  At 2:41 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled joint resolution:\n\n       H.J.

General Hospital, a 108-year-old health care \n     facility located in our nation's capital, will stop operating \n     as a full-service public hospital as a result of the Mayor of \n     Washington, D.C.'s plan to privatize the hospital, \n     eliminating a safety net for thousands of disadvantaged \n     people who otherwise would not have access to basic health \n     care services; and\n       Whereas, D.C. General Hospital is a major trauma center and \n     plays an indispensable role in providing quality and \n     affordable health care to the 100,000 under and uninsured \n     residents of the city. Additionally, the hospital is only one \n     of two health care facilities in the Washington, D.C. area \n     with a Level III neo-natal unit, treating 1,000 premature and \n     critically ill infants a year; and\n       Whereas, Concerns over the possible closing of the hospital \n     and the move to change its public institution status have \n     generated opposition from numerous observers throughout the \n     country, including health care officials, representatives of \n     medical organizations, community activists and policymakers \n     who feel that D.C. General Hospital represents this country's \n     commitment to providing health care services to the residents \n     of its inner cities; and\n       Whereas, D.C. General Hospital should continue to operate \n     as a fully-funded public hospital in order to provie \n     lifesaving health care services to Washington, D.C.'s poor \n     and uninsured: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island and \n     Providence Plantations hereby urges the Congress of the \n     United States to maintain the public institution status of \n     D.C. General Hospital so it can continue to operate as a \n     fully funded public hospital, provide lifesaving health care \n     services to Washington, D.C.'s poor and uninsured and \n     represent this country's commitment to providing health care \n     services to the residents of its inner cities; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and he hereby is \n     authorized and directed to transmit duly certified copies of \n     this resolution to the United States Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, the presiding officers of the United States \n     Senate and House of Representatives and the entire Rhode \n     Island congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-201.

As \n     federal tax laws now stand, this payment would be subject to \n     personal and business federal taxes as income. In reality, \n     however, the settlement money clearly should be categorized \n     as involuntary converted property. Under this determination, \n     the manufacturer's settlement would be treated like other \n     property that can be converted to similar purposes over a \n     specific period of time; and\n       Whereas, Every effort should be made to encourage the \n     reinvestment of settlement resources to mitigate job loss, \n     lessen the economic stress to local communities, and protect \n     families from more serious financial difficulties. In \n     addition, it would be poor public policy for the federal \n     government to reap a tax revenue windfall as a result of this \n     rare and unique situation; and\n       Whereas, As the home of the Olds automotive legacy and 20 \n     of the top 50 Oldsmobile dealerships, Michigan has a major \n     stake in the fair treatment of these businesses and \n     individuals. It would be wrong for the tax code to act as a \n     disincentive to the reinvestment of the settlement dollars in \n     job-creating enterprises: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact H.R. 2374 to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code to consider certain transitional dealer \n     assistance related to the phase-our of Oldsmobile as an \n     involuntary conversion; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-204.

On that date, \n     four separate groups of terrorist highjackers took forcible \n     possession of four different commercial jets and, with \n     incomprehensibly evil intent, used them as missiles to \n     destroy some of the nation's most symbolic landmarks and to \n     murder innocent people located within and around them; and\n       Whereas, The terrorists crashed one of the jets, American \n     Airlines Flight 11, into the One World Trade Center building \n     in the Manhattan borough of New York City, crashed another, \n     United Airlines Flight 175, into the neighboring Two World \n     Trade Center building, and crashed a third, American Airlines \n     Flight 77, into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The fourth \n     plane, United Airlines Flight 93, which apparently was on its \n     way toward Washington, D.C., crashed approximately eighty \n     miles from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Shortly thereafter, the \n     Two World Trade Center building collapsed as a result of the \n     damage it sustained, followed quickly by the collapse of the \n     One World Trade Center building and, later in the day, by the \n     collapse of the neighboring Seven World Trade Center \n     building; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that thousands of innocent \n     victims, including police officers, firefighters, and other \n     rescue workers, lost their lives and that thousands more were \n     injured as a result of these devastatingly evil acts of \n     terrorism, causing human suffering of an incomprehensible \n     magnitude; and\n       Whereas, The President of the United States and the United \n     States Congress rightly have interpreted these terrorist acts \n     as a declaration of war against the United States of America \n     and all that it stands for. It is imperative at this dark \n     time to unite as a nation in order to combat the evil of \n     terrorism: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the State of Ohio fully \n     supports the President of the United States and the United \n     States Congress in the actions they must take in order to \n     seek justice for the devastation that our nation has suffered \n     from terrorism and to protect our nation from further \n     terrorist acts of aggression; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of \n     the United States, to the Speaker and Clerk of the United \n     States House of Representatives, to the President Pro Tempore \n     and Secretary of the United States Senate, to the members of \n     the Ohio Congressional delegation, and to the news media of \n     Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-207.

I, sec. 19, Constitution of the \n     State of Alaska, was amended by an overwhelming majority to \n     specifically protect an Alaskan's individual right to keep \n     and bear arms; and\n       Whereas the Clinton Administration's stance on gun \n     ownership moved dangerously in the direction of abridging or \n     eliminating individual Second Amendment freedoms; and\n       Whereas, under the Clinton Administration, the United \n     States Department of Justice interpreted the Second Amendment \n     to not protect the right of individual citizens to keep and \n     bear arms but to apply only to governmentally recognized \n     military organizations; and\n       Whereas the Clinton Administration's stance on gun \n     ownership intentionally ignored the original intent of the \n     Constitution's framers and sought to dramatically limit the \n     Constitutionally affirmed Second Amendment freedoms of \n     individual law-abiding Americans; be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges President \n     Bush to renounce the Clinton Administration's anti-gun \n     ownership policies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature requests \n     President Bush to use his executive powers and influence to \n     reorient the United States Department of Justice towards a \n     policy that fully recognizes the right of individual \n     Americans to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-208.

Let us celebrate \n     their lives and accomplishments as their loss will impoverish \n     our country in ways as of yet unknown; and\n       Whereas, We encourage support for our President, George W. \n     Bush, as he weighs the options before him and seeks wise \n     counsel for the difficult decisions that must be faced by our \n     country in the months ahead; and\n       Whereas, We witness the prayer services, candlelight vigils \n     and spontaneous supportive actions of a grieving nation that \n     are a balm to wounded hearts across our stricken land; and\n       Whereas, Our duty is not to shrink, fearful of the future, \n     but to go boldly to claim our place as a leader among nations \n     and a people committed to freedom and justice; and\n       Whereas, We go forth affirming our cherished liberty and \n     freedoms and now to rebuild an even better America and world; \n     and\n       Whereas, We go forth fulfilling the promise of the future \n     that was taken from so many as their sacrifice demands; and\n       Whereas, The intent of these horrific acts was to divide us \n     into irreconcilable parts, let us confound such terrorism and \n     come together as a nation and as a people as never before in \n     a spirit of tolerance and true compassion for the beliefs \n     that unite us are far more plentiful than the items that \n     divide us; and\n       Whereas, Even as our nation weeps for our murdered fathers, \n     mothers, sons and daughters, we will undertake the necessary \n     task of rebuilding and safeguarding our future; therefore be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania urge the President and the Congress of the \n     United States and this Commonwealth to commemorate every \n     September 11 as a day of mourning and remembrance; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Senate extend its deepest sympathies and \n     condolences to the families and friends of the victims of \n     this terrible tragedy; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate unanimously and unequivocally \n     condemn those individuals and countries who played any part \n     in the shedding of innocent American blood; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the presiding officers of \n     each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-210. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Pennsylvania relative to the nations \n     response to September 11, 2001; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, As our nation prepares its response to the horrors \n     visited on our people on September 11, 2001, we pause to lend \n     our support and give thanks to those who will be seeking \n     justice for our beloved dead and injured; and\n       Whereas, As the President of the United States, George W. \n     Bush, said in his speech to the nation during a joint session \n     of the Congress of the United States on September 20, 2001: \n     ``Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice \n     to our enemies, justice will be done''; and\n       Whereas, We wholeheartedly support the President of the \n     United States in his pledge to use every resource at \n     America's disposal to successfully conclude the conflict \n     brought to our peaceful shores, whether through diplomacy, \n     the use of intelligence capabilities, instruments of law \n     enforcement and elimination of financial resources or every \n     necessary weapon of war; and\n       Whereas, We recognize that a nation cannot maintain peace \n     without a willingness to defend itself against terrorism or \n     aggression; and\n       Whereas, The President of the United States has authorized \n     the call-up of 50,000 reservists; and\n       Whereas, More than 35,000 reservists have been activated \n     for homeland defense in order to permit troops to engage in \n     other duties; and\n       Whereas, Those soldiers, sailors and Marines now being \n     deployed have our complete support, unending thanks and \n     countless prayers; and\n       Whereas, We pray that our men and women in uniform will be \n     comforted and given strength to perform the very difficult \n     tasks ahead of them; and\n       Whereas, The Pennsylvania Division of the National Guard, \n     known as the 28th Infantry Division, is the oldest division \n     in the Army in continuous service; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania has the largest National Guard unit \n     in the United States; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's National Guard has played a crucial \n     role in every major conflict since the early days of our \n     nation; and\n       Whereas, The valiant citizen-soldiers of Pennsylvania's \n     National Guard, all 22,000 men and women, are properly \n     trained and stand ready to do whatever is needed in the \n     defense of our Commonwealth, our nation and our freedom; \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania and the people of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania commend and support the President of the United \n     States as the Commander-in-Chief of our armed services; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate send its support, prayers and \n     gratitude to all our military service personnel as they \n     undertake the difficult tasks that may lie ahead; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the presiding officers of \n     each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-211.

A bill to establish grant and scholarship programs to enable \nhospitals to retain and further educate their nursing staffs; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the \nHospital Based Nursing Initiative Act, a bill that will create new and \ninnovative incentives to lessen the impact of the critical shortage of \nnurses in our Nation's hospitals. I am very pleased that my respected \ncolleague, Senator John Ensign, is joining as sponsor of this \nlegislation/\n  Before I get into the specific about the bill, I'd like to talk about \nthe overall condition of nursing in America for a moment. Several \nstudies have been completed in the past year that show troubling trends \ndeveloping in this historic profession. Take for example, the study \nthat reflects a 41 percent dissatisfaction rate among nurses in \nAmerica, higher than the dissatisfaction rate in most other countries \nthroughout the world. Think about that for a moment, 4 out of 10 nurses \nin America are dissatisfied with their profession.\n  Another study reveals that nearly one third of nurses under the age \nof 30 plan to leave the nursing profession within the next year. In \naddition, the average age of nurses in America is 45, with many nurses \nheaded toward early retirement. We cannot afford to lose both the older \nand younger nurses at the same time. Further, while the number of \npeople that are being hospitalized may continue to decrease, those \npeople who are being admitted are sicker and need more intensive \nnursing care. Not a very rosy picture for patients who are sick. We \nneed to ask will there be someone to provide care for them?\n  The shortage of nurses has severely affected the health care \nindustry. And hospitals have been hit the hardest since nearly 60 \npercent of nurses work in hospitals. Further, we know that when nurses \nhave more autonomy, greater control and input into the decision making \nprocess, and better communication with physicians and hospital \nadministration, they are more likely to experience greater job \nsatisfaction and stay in their jobs longer. These very tenets make up \nthe American Nurse Credentialing Center's ``Magnet'' accreditation \nprocess of nursing services at hospitals. As a result, Magnet hospitals \nlead the way in attracting and retaining nurses.\n  Many hospitals have begun to take these steps already. But more must \nbe done. There must be incentives for hospitals to revise their \nmanagement principles to improve the quality of the work environment in \nthe hospital, initiate aggressive retention programs for nurses \ncurrently working in the hospital setting, and create the types of \nprograms that will increase personal and professional satisfaction for \nthe nurses in their facilities.\n  That is why I am introducing the Hospital Based Nursing Initiative \nAct of 2001. This bill will create innovative incentives for hospitals \nthat have taken the first steps in developing aggressive retention \ntechniques and develop a scholarship program for hospital-based nurses \nto return to school on full tuition scholarship to complete a nursing \ndegree.\n  The first component of this bill will create a competitive grant \nprogram that would provide funds to hospitals of up to $600,000 based \non staffed bed size for nursing services to use to bolster their \nretention efforts and improve the work environment for the nursing \nstaff in the hospital. These grants would be made available every two \nyears on a competitive basis. Several major nursing and hospital \norganizations, such as the American Hospital Association, American \nNurses Association, American College of Health Care Executives, the \nAmerican Organization of Nurse Executives, the American Academy of \nNursing, the Pennsylvania State Nurses Association and the American \nFederation of Hospitals have wholeheartedly endorsed this bill. I am \npleased that legislation which incorporates a number of ideas in this \nbill is moving toward markup in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee. I appreciate the cooperative spirit with which \nmembers of the committee have worked together on these ideas.\n  The second part of my bill would allow nurses who work in hospitals \nto return to school on a full tuition scholarship in order to complete \na Bachelor of Science in Nursing. This ``Bridge'' scholarship program \ntargets the nearly 55 percent of the nursing workforce who hold an \nAssociate's Degree in Nursing or Diploma in Nursing. Under the Bridge \nprogram, nurses will have up to three years to complete the Bachelor's \ndegree. In turn, nurses who accept the scholarship must agree to work \nin the sponsoring hospitals for the same number of months that they \nreceive scholarship funding. This program is a win-win situation: It \nprovides ongoing advanced education for nurses who seek a higher level \nof training and we keep skilled nurses working in our hospitals.\n  We have the opportunity to make a difference. With the bill that \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11200]]\n\nEnsign and I are now introducing, we can take the necessary steps to \nthwart the nursing shortage and provide the critical incentives for \nhospitals to retain their nurses. We must do all we can to improve job \nsatisfaction for nurses, provide them with opportunities for advanced \neducation, and keep nurses on the job. The Hospital Based Nursing \nInitiative is the right bill at the right time. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation and help ease the burden on hospitals and \nnurses in our hospitals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. I further ask unanimous consent that letters supporting this \nlegislation and its approach from each of the organizations I cited \nabove likewise be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and additional material was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1585\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hospital-Based Nursing \n     Initiative Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a Department of Health and Human Services study found a \n     correlation between the number of registered nurses on the \n     staff of a facility and patient health outcomes;\n       (2) studies have shown that hospitals that promote greater \n     autonomy for nurses, greater nurse control and input into the \n     decisionmaking process in the hospital setting, better \n     communication between nurses and physicians, and input from \n     nurses at the executive level in the hospital lead to \n     increased retention of and satisfaction for nurses;\n       (3) the job dissatisfaction rate among nurses in the United \n     States, 41 percent, is higher than in most other countries;\n       (4) \\1/3\\ of nurses under the age of 30 are planning to \n     leave the nursing profession within the next year;\n       (5) hospitals employ nearly 60 percent of the entire \n     nursing workforce;\n       (6) while the number of inpatient hospitalizations is \n     expected to continue to decrease, the acuity of those \n     patients requiring hospital stays is expected to increase;\n       (7) the projected supply of registered nurses is \n     anticipated to grow at a rate of less than 1.5 percent per \n     year through the next 8 years, while the demand rate (growth) \n     is projected to be over 21 percent per year;\n       (8) there must be incentives for hospitals to revise \n     management principles to improve the quality of the work \n     environment in hospitals, initiate aggressive retention \n     programs for the nurses currently employed in hospital \n     settings, and employ aggressive recruiting tactics to attract \n     nurses back to hospital settings; and\n       (9) while numerous hospitals have begun to take the \n     necessary steps to address these issues, Congress recognizes \n     the need for intervention and stimulus.\n\n     SEC. 3. NURSE GRANT AND SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS.\n\n       Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 296 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n             ``PART H--NURSE GRANT AND SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM\n\n     ``SEC. 851.

Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: The American Hospital Association \n     (AHA) commends your efforts to address the nursing workforce \n     shortage in your bill, The Hospital-Based Nursing Initiative \n     Act of 2001, and is pleased to endorse your legislation. We \n     believe your bill is an important component in the overall \n     strategy of addressing the national nursing shortage.\n       The AHA represents nearly 5,000 hospitals, health systems, \n     networks and other health care provider members.\n       Hospitals and health care facilities across America are \n     experiencing a critical shortage of nurses. A recent AHA \n     survey of the workforce shows that there are currently up to \n     126,000 Registered Nurses (RNs) needed by hospitals today. \n     Over the past five years, enrollments in nursing programs \n     have declined and this trend is expected to continue for the \n     foreseeable future. The average age of a working RN is now \n     over 43 years old, and is expected to continue to increase \n     before peaking at age 45.5 in 2010, when many RNs will\n\n[[Page S11202]]\n\n     begin to retire. And, the need for nurses will be further \n     compounded by the potential health care demands of the \n     looming 78 million aging ``baby boomers'' who will begin to \n     retire over the next 10 years.\n       The current nursing shortage is creating an environment \n     with the potential to jeopardize hospitals' ability to \n     provide timely access to non-emergency, as well as emergency, \n     services. An inadequate number and mix of personnel has \n     caused some facilities to close beds, put emergency rooms on \n     ``divert'' status, delay elective surgeries, and pare down \n     hospital services.\n       Hospitals have enlisted many strategies and creative \n     approaches to address the nursing shortage, but this is a \n     complex problem that cannot be solved by hospitals alone. The \n     role of the federal government is critical in the support and \n     funding of an adequate nursing workforce.\n       ``The Hospital-Based Nursing Initiative Act of 2001'' \n     provides significant incentives for hospitals to examine and \n     revise management principles to improve the quality of their \n     work environment, and to foster effective RN retention \n     programs. It establishes incentives for hospitals to develop \n     and implement aggressive recruitment programs to attract \n     nurses into the hospital setting. The legislation also \n     creates bridge programs for RNs currently employed in \n     hospitals to move up the career ladder, a significant \n     recruitment and retention tool.\n       Helping alleviate the critical shortage of nurses is a \n     priority for health care providers. As we debate this and \n     other measures to address the nursing shortage, we hope \n     Congress will recognize the important of investing in this \n     critical area of need. We applaud your effort and pledge to \n     work with you to address this very important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             American Organization\n\n\n                                          of Nurse Executives,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: On behalf of more than 3800 members \n     of the American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE) \n     representing nurses in executive practice, I would like to \n     express our strong support for the ``Hospital-Based Nursing \n     Initiative Act of 2001,'' legislation that you have authored \n     and plan to introduce to address the critical nurse shortage.\n       During the past year, AONE has played a pivotal role in \n     addressing the nursing shortage. In October 2000 we published \n     the first comprehensive monograph on this critical issue \n     entitled Perspectives on the Nursing Shortage: A Blueprint \n     for Action and have continued to provide both education and \n     advocacy for the nursing profession on a number of different \n     fronts. Your bill will provide important management \n     incentives for hospitals to revise their management of \n     nursing services in order to foster retention and promote \n     recruitment of nurses back into the inpatient delivery \n     system.\n       The majority of AONE's membership are leaders in the day-\n     to-day management and delivery of direct patient care \n     services, as a result, we understand firsthand the impacts \n     and consequences of the growing nursing shortage both in this \n     country and internationally. Our support of the ``Hospital-\n     Based Nursing Initiative Act of 2001'' is based on the \n     positive contributions that this legislation will make to \n     nurse-directed efforts to foster retention and promote \n     recruitment of nurses within the inpatient settings of our \n     federal, community, and private hospitals. This legislation \n     will also establish important bridge programs for registered \n     nurses currently employed in hospitals to move from diploma \n     and Associate Degree levels of education on to a Bachelor of \n     Science degree within three years.\n       AONE applauds your efforts to address the nursing shortage \n     through this innovative grant and scholarship program. We \n     look forward to working with you to solve this critical \n     health manpower problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Pamela A. Thompson, MSN, RN,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                          Dianne Anderson, MS, RN,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: I am writing you on behalf of the \n     American Nurses Association (ANA) to express support for the \n     Hospital-Based Nursing Initiative Act. We applaud your hard \n     work on this important issue. ANA is the only full-service \n     association representing the nation's registered nurses (RNs) \n     through its 54 state and territorial member nurse \n     associations. With more than 160,000 members, the ANA \n     represents RNs in all practice settings throughout our \n     nation.\n       ANA understands that a major contributing factor to the \n     current and emerging nursing shortage is dissatisfaction with \n     the work environment. The Congressional Research Service, \n     General Accounting Office, academic research, and recent ANA \n     surveys of American nurses have all revealed startling levels \n     of frustration with working conditions. This dissatisfaction \n     is leading experienced nurses to leave the bedside, and \n     hindering recruitment efforts.\n       Fortunately, we know what can be done to address this \n     growing problem. There are proven best practices for nursing \n     that improve patient outcomes, and enhance nurse recruitment \n     and retention. The American Nurses Credentialing Center, an \n     ANA affiliate, recognizes facilities that have met these best \n     practices by granting the `Magnet' designation. Magnet \n     facilities have consistently outperformed their peers in \n     nursing services, even in times of national nursing \n     shortages. In fact, average nurse retention in Magnet \n     facilities is twice as long as that of non-Magnet \n     institutions.\n       ANA is pleased to endorse your efforts to further the \n     implementation of these best practices through the Hospital-\n     Based Nursing Initiative Act. The quality of work environment \n     and nurse retention grant program, and the continuing \n     education scholarships contained in your bill will greatly \n     aide in the adoption of Magnet criteria. ANA looks forward to \n     working with you and your staff to support this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Rose Gonzalez, MPS, RN,\n     Director, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  American College\n\n\n                                     of Healthcare Executives,\n\n                                  Chicago, IL, September 18, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: Thank you for inviting the American \n     College of Healthcare Executives to review and provide \n     comments on the ``Hospital-Based Nursing Initiative Act of \n     2001.''\n       Upon reviewing the bill, ACHE wishes to endorse it. This \n     legislation offers a comprehensive approach to the crisis \n     facing our nation's healthcare system--a shortage of nurses. \n     The bill attempts to address this important issue by \n     supporting hospitals in a number of ways, including: \n     retaining nurses; improving the work environment for nursing \n     staff; fostering nursing leadership; providing continuing \n     education programs for nurses; creating recognition and \n     reward programs for nurses who obtain nursing-related \n     certification; and finally, offering educational assistance \n     for nurses to earn their Bachelor of Science Degree in \n     Nursing. We believe this bill encompasses the various \n     elements to make a genuine difference and increase the \n     nursing population.\n       Thank you for your work in developing this legislation. If \n     there is anything ACHE can do to assist further in this \n     endeavor, please contact Susan M. Oster, CAE, Vice President, \n     Administration at (312) 424-9340.\n           Sincerely,\n                               Thomas C.

Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Congress, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: The Pennsylvania State Nurses \n     Association (PSNA) would like to commend you for the \n     excellent legislation you plan to introduce, which is meant \n     to establish grant and scholarship programs enabling \n     hospitals to retain and further educate their nursing staffs. \n     The bill contains excellent ideas and creative solutions to \n     entice nurses to join or remain a member of a hospital \n     nursing staff.\n       The focus on nurses having opportunities to participate in \n     decision-making regarding nursing care and maintaining \n     autonomy in the delivery of care are especially important \n     attractants for nurses. Also, the emphasis on having a system \n     for measuring outcomes is imperative for quality patient \n     care.\n       The organization welcomes the opportunity to work with you \n     in ensuring the passage of the legislation that will greatly \n     benefit the profession of nursing and the quality of care \n     provided to consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Jessie F. Rohner, DrPH, RN,\n                                  Interim Executive Administrator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1587. A bill to provide improved port and maritime security, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, along with Mr. Kerry, Chairman of the \nOceans, Atmosphere and Fisheries Subcommittee, and Mr. Hollings, \nChairman of the Commerce Committee, I rise today in support of the Port \nThreat and Security Act of 2001. I believe this legislation will help \nUnited States' authorities identify and counteract maritime threats \nfrom terrorist actions. Importantly, these provisions are designed in \npart to protect U.S. citizens and property from terrorist attacks \nbefore they reach our shores.\n  As Chairman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee, I held several oversight hearings on transportation \nsecurity, including one on maritime security three weeks after the \nterrible attacks of September 11. The maritime security hearing \nsolidified an opinion that I, and others on the Commerce Committee, had \nlong held, the need for increased maritime security was important \nbefore September 11, and is absolutely crucial following the terrorist\n\n[[Page S11203]]\n\nattacks on New York city and Washington, D.C. The Oceans, Atmosphere \nand Fisheries Subcommittee, of which I am a member, followed with \nanother hearing that underscored this message. Luckily, because of the \nforesight of Chairman Hollings, we had a head start on improving \nmaritime security. S. 1214, the Maritime and Port Security Improvement \nAct, of which I am a proud cosponsor, was introduced in July and was \nreported out of the Committee in August. S. 1214 establishes a regime \nthat will go a long way towards creating a safe and secure maritime \ntransportation system. However, since much of it was crafted before \nSeptember 11, it is only natural that additional measures are needed to \nensure that our maritime system is as safe as possible.\n  The bill we are introducing today is based on the testimony that was \npresented at the hearings before the Commerce Committee in the first \ntwo weeks of October. Administration and industry witnesses testified \non the need to improve certain areas of S. 1214. This bill intends to \nfill the gaps identified by our witnesses. We will work with Committee \nmembers to ensure these provisions are included in S. 1214 before the \nSenate sends it to the House.\n  A constant theme following the September 11 attacks has been the need \nfor better information. Testimony at our hearings confirmed this theme \nin the maritime realm, we need to increase our information collection \ncapabilities immediately and we need to hold our trading partners to \nthe same standards to which we hold our maritime industry. This \nlegislation requires the identification of nations that have inherently \ninsecure or unsafe vessel registration procedures that can pose threats \nto our national security. It requires the Secretary of Transportation \nand Secretary of State to prepare an annual report for the Congress \nthat would list those nations whose vessels the Coast Guard has found \ndon't play by our rules. For example, investigations by the Department \nof Transportation reveal that it is common practice for vessels to \npossess false, partial, or fraudulent information concerning cargo \nmanifests, crew identity, or registration of the vessel. This \nlegislation will allow us to get a handle on these practices by \nidentifying the most egregious violators of maritime law. However, the \nadditional information collection required by this bill is just a \nstart; the bill also requires the Administration to recommend to this \nCommittee additional actions that can be taken, either domestically or \nthrough international organizations such as the International Maritime \nOrganization, that will increase the transparency of \nvessel registration procedures.\n\n  One of the responses following the highjackings has been to \ndramatically expand the air marshal program on air carriers, a step \nwhich I fully support. However, there is no similar program for \nmaritime vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard recently established a \nsea marshal program in the port of San Francisco where armed personnel \naccompany maritime pilots aboard vessels that cause security concerns. \nThis legislation expands that small project into a national sea marshal \nprogram to help prevent terrorists from using maritime vessels as \nweapons of mass destruction. This legislation directs the Secretary to \nanalyze vulnerability of ports and place sea marshals in ports that \nhandle materials or vessels that make them potential targets of attack.\n  Expansion of the sea marshal program is strongly supported by our \nNation's sea pilots. Many people do not know that almost all maritime \nvessels that enter U.S. ports are accompanied by a U.S. sea pilot that \nhas intimate knowledge of port and navigational channels, a living \nnautical chart, so to speak. They are an integral part of our maritime \nsystem that help to keep our ports and waterways safe. Pilots are often \nthe first U.S. citizen to board inbound foreign vessels and may be the \nonly U.S. citizens on vessels bound for U.S. ports; thus, they can be a \nvaluable source of information. This legislation requires the Secretary \nof Transportation to use them more effectively in the war on terror. \nThe Secretary is directed to investigate secure and reliable methods in \nwhich sea pilots can aid the Coast Guard and other U.S. authorities in \nan expanded maritime domain awareness program. The pilots themselves \ncame forward to this Committee suggesting this idea, and I think it is \ncritical that these pilots be provided with methods and equipment that \nwill allow them to safely provide the authorities with information on \nillegal or terrorist activities while there is still time to prevent a \ncatastrophe. One such example is the Vessel Traffic System, VTS, in the \nPort of  New  Orleans and the excellent partnership between the Coast \nGuard and the Crescent River Pilots Association. Under this \npartnership, vessels entering port are boarded by pilots carrying \ntransponders. As the vessel transits the Mississippi River, inbound and \noutbound, the operations center manned by Coast Guard and pilots know \nthe exact position of the vessel, as well as the course, speed and \nother important information. While already considered a model VTS \nprogram, once additional transponders are acquired, this program will \ncontinue to serve as a template for other ports.\n  This legislation also greatly improves the information collected on \nthe safety and security of foreign ports. With regards to foreign \nseaport assessments, the bill aligns the authority of the Secretary of \nTransportation with authorities that currently exist for foreign \nairports. The Secretary of Transportation is required to conduct 25 \nforeign port vulnerability assessments each year and to ensure that \nU.S. citizens are informed about the results of these assessments in \nadvance of embarking on their travel plans. Testimony before the \nCommerce Committee emphasized that in order to ensure that our shores \nare as safe as possible, we must view foreign ports as the outer \nboundary of our ``maritime domain.'' Much as the first provision in our \nbill provides for the collection of better information on vessels and \ncountries that do not follow international standards, this provision \nprovides for the collection of information on foreign ports that \npresent potential security threats to the United States. By requiring \nthe Secretary to conduct annual assessments of 25 ports, we not only \ngain a valuable source of information, but we also put foreign ports on \nnotice that they will be held responsible for actions to secure their \nports.\n  If the assessments reveal that foreign ports do not have or maintain \nadequate security measures, the President is authorized to prohibit any \nvessel, U.S. flagged or foreign, from entering the United States from \nthat port. Vessels that transit unsafe and insecure ports should not be \nallowed unrestricted access to United States ports. I would like to \nremind everyone that similar security protections were enacted for \nforeign airports, and I see no reason why the President should not have \nthe same powers with respect to foreign maritime ports.\n  We must begin to think of a maritime security program that begins \nwell before a ship enters U.S. waters and certainly before they enter \nU.S. ports. I believe that the measures in this bill along with the \nport security program of S. 1214 will provide much better tools to \nguard against maritime threats to our Nation and our citizens.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, As Chairman of the Oceans, Atmosphere and \nFisheries Subcommittee, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nidentify and reduce maritime threats from criminal or terrorist action, \nparticularly those originating from foreign ports and vessels. I am \nparticularly pleased to be joined by the Chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee Mr. Hollings of South Carolina and the Chairman of the \nSurface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee Mr. Breaux of \nLouisiana.\n  Senator Breaux and I recently held oversight hearings before our \nrespective Subcommittees on the Coast Guard and its role in improving \nmaritime security after the terrible attacks of September 11. As \nSenators Hollings and Breaux well know, even before September 11 our \nmaritime and port security was in sorry shape. Senator Hollings had \nalready recognized the need to rectify these deficiencies and authored \nS. 1214, the Maritime and Port Security Improvement Act, which was \nreported out of the Committee in August, and which I am proud to \ncosponsor. However, the attacks on New York and Washington made it \nclear we need to go farther afield to guard against terrorism and other \ncrimes.\n  Today's legislation is intended to supplement the security provisions \nof\n\n[[Page S11204]]\n\nS. 1214 by improving our ability to detect and prevent maritime \nterrorism and crime before it has the chance to sail into U.S. ports. \nWe intend to work with Committee members to ensure these provisions are \nincluded in the final bill the Senate sends to the House.\n  At our October 11 oversight hearing, Coast Guard Commandant James Loy \nand other witnesses gave some thoughtful testimony that is the backbone \nof this legislation. The hearing also brought to light the challenges \npresented to the Coast Guard in securing our maritime border from such \nthreats. In addition to introducing this legislation, we also will \naddress glaring Coast Guard resource shortfalls through increased \nauthorizations in our FY 2002 Coast Guard authorization bill, which we \nwill bring to the floor shortly. The Port Threat and Security Act is \nfocused on giving the Coast Guard the tools and the information they \nneed to do the job right.\n  First, we need to improve our base of information to identify bad \nactors throughout the maritime realm. This legislation would help us \nidentify those nations whose vessels and vessel registration procedures \npose potential threats to our national security. It would require the \nSecretaries of Transportation and State to prepare an annual report for \nthe Congress that would list those nations whose vessels the Coast \nGuard has found would pose a risk to our ports, or that have presented \nour government with false, partial, or fraudulent information \nconcerning cargo manifests, crew identity, or registration of the \nvessel. In addition the report would identify nations that do not \nexercise adequate control over their vessel registration and ownership \nprocedures, particularly with respect to security issues. We need hard \ninformation like this if we are to force ``flag of convenience'' \nnations from providing cover to criminals and terrorists. Mr. \nPresident, this is very important as Osama bin Laden has used flags of \nconvenience to hide his ownership in various international shipping \ninterests. In 1998 one of bin Laden's cargo freighters unloaded \nsupplies in Kenya for the suicide bombers who later destroyed the \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania. To that end, the bill requires the \nAdministration to report on actions they have taken, or would \nrecommend, to close these loopholes and improve transparency and \nregistration procedures, either through domestic or international \naction--including action at the International Maritime Organization.\n\n  My legislation would also establish a national Sea Marshal program to \nprotect our ports from the potential use of vessels as weapons of \nterror. A Sea Marshal program was recently established in San \nFrancisco, and is supported strongly by the maritime pilots who, like \nairline pilots, are on the front lines in bringing vessels into U.S. \nports. Sea Marshals would be used in ports that handle materials that \nare hazardous or flammable in quantities that make them potential \ntargets of attack. The Coast Guard took a number of steps including \nusing armed Coast Guard personnel to escort a Liquid Natural Gas, LNG, \ntanker into Boston last evening. This was the first delivery of LNG to \nBoston since September 11 and a number of people were concerned about \nthe safety of bringing LNG into the port. Prior to September 11 these \nvessels were escorted by Coast Guard vessels into the port but no armed \nguards were present on the vessel. I strongly believe that having armed \npersonnel, such as Sea Marshals, on these high interest vessels is very \nimportant and will considerably increase security in our nation's \nports, including Boston. The ability of terrorists to board a vessel \nand cause a deliberate release of LNG or gasoline for that matter is \nvery real. Sea Marshals will make it much more difficult for this to \nhappen. The Secretary of Transportation would be responsible for \nestablishing qualifications and standards for Sea Marshals which could \nbe comprised of Federal, State or local law enforcement officials.\n  This legislation also aims to make use of unarmed pilots as yet \nanother way to combat terrorism in our ports. Nearly every vessel that \nenters a U.S. port is first boarded by a sea pilot to assist the crew \nin navigating the harbor. Many times these pilots are the first set of \nU.S. eyes on vessels that may be headed to our ports bearing criminals \nor contraband from overseas. They are our eyes and ears, but cannot be \nexpected to be a line of physical defense, that is the job of the Sea \nMarshals. This legislation would require the Secretary of \nTransportation to use these ``eyes and ears'' effectively in the war on \nterror. The Secretary is directed to investigate discrete ways in which \nsea pilots can provide information to warn of a possible terrorist \nattack or other crime. It is important that we explore secure \nmechanisms to allow these pilots to contribute to our maritime domain \nawareness, including notifying law enforcement officials of suspicious \nactivity on a vessel. I am convinced there are a number of ways that \nthese pilots could safely provide the authorities with information that \ncan thwart illegal activities without alerting the vessel's captain or \ncrew, or potential terrorists.\n  This legislation would also require the Secretary of Transportation \nto conduct 25 foreign port vulnerability assessments each year, and \nplaces on foreign ports the same reporting and assessment requirements \nwe use for foreign airports. This is essential to ensure that U.S. \ncitizens are protected from harm in foreign ports, and are informed \nabout any risks before leaving U.S. soil. It is also absolutely \nnecessary to use foreign ports as our first defense against threats to \nU.S. ports. We cannot expect to protect U.S. borders by erecting a \nfence only at our own ports. As one of our witnesses said, ``the \nleading edge of our boundary for homeland defense is, in fact, foreign \nports.'' In many instances, such defenses would be fruitless because of \nthe sheer volume of cargo that passes through our ports daily. We need \nadvance warning long before these vessels appear at our harbor \nentrances. Critical information that can help the Coast Guard identify \nthese risks can only be collected at foreign ports where cargo and \npersons are first placed aboard the vessel. Despite this obvious need, \nwe have fallen behind on our assessments of foreign ports. I firmly \nbelieve that the only way we can make U.S. ports and harbors safe is by \ngoing to the source and ensuring appropriate measures and facilities \nare in place to guarantee the safety of U.S. citizens visiting foreign \nports as well as the safety of cargo bound for the United States.\n  In order to pay for these inspections this legislation authorizes the \nSecretary of Transportation to collect a 50 cent user fee on all cruise \npassengers that depart the United States for a foreign port. Quite \nfrankly, 50 cents is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that \ncomes with knowing that a port vulnerability assessment has been \ncompleted prior to a cruise ship with as many as 5,000 U.S. citizens as \npassengers, docks in a particular country. U.S. citizens should not be \ndisembarking in ports that have not been scrutinized for security \nviolations. One witness pointed out that in many circumstances U.S. \ncruise ship passengers are passing through ports that could not be \nassessed because they were deemed too dangerous for military personnel! \nThis is ludicrous. I am sure those passengers had no idea of this \npotential danger, and we need to make sure that they are both safe and \ninformed.\n  Lastly, this legislation would allow the President to prohibit any \nvessel, U.S. flagged or foreign, from entering the United States if the \nvessel has embarked passengers or cargo from foreign ports that do not \nhave adequate security measures as determined by the Secretary of \nTransportation. Recently inspectors in Italy checking a container bound \nfor Canada discovered a member of the al-Qaida terrorist organization \nhiding in a shipping container equipped with a bed and makeshift \nbathroom. The suspect, an Egyptian in a business suit, had with him a \nCanadian passport, a laptop computer, two cell phones, airport maps, \nsecurity passes for airports in three countries and a certificate \nproclaiming him an airplane mechanic. We cannot allow any country to \nhave such poor security such that terrorists can stow away in a \nshipping container. I would like to remind everyone that a similar \nprovision exists in the airline industry and I see no reason why the \nPresident should not have the power to suspend commerce from a port \nwith inadequate security, just like he can now do with international \nairports.\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\n  I believe that these provisions, when combined with the strong port \nsecurity program of S. 1214, will ensure that the United States has the \ntools, the information, and the personnel to guard against waterborne \nthreats to our nation and our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The report \n     should specifically address necessary improvements to both \n     reporting procedures and equipment that could allow pilots to \n     be integrated more effectively in an maritime domain \n     awareness program.\n\n     SEC. 5. SECURITY STANDARDS AT FOREIGN SEAPORTS.\n\n       (a) Assessment.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall assess the \n     effectiveness of the security measures maintained at--\n       (A) each foreign seaport--\n       (i) served by United States vessels;\n       (ii) from which foreign vessels serve the United States; or\n       (iii) that poses a high risk of introducing danger to \n     international sea travel; and\n       (B) other foreign seaports the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n       (2) International cooperation and standards.--The Secretary \n     of Transportation shall conduct an assessment under paragraph \n     (1) of this subsection--\n       (A) in consultation with appropriate port authorities of \n     the government of a foreign country concerned and United \n     States vessel operators serving the foreign seaport for which \n     the Secretary is conducting the assessment;\n       (B) to establish the extent to which a foreign seaport \n     effectively maintains and carries out security measures; and\n       (C) by using a standard that will result in an analysis of \n     the security measures at the seaport based at least on the \n     standards and recommended practices of the International \n     Maritime Organization in effect on the date of the \n     assessment.\n       (3) Report.--Each report to Congress required under section \n     2 shall contain a summary of the assessments conducted under \n     this subsection.\n       (b) Interval.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \n     conduct assessments under subsection (a) of this section of \n     at least 25 foreign seaports annually until all seaports \n     identified in subsection (a)(1) are completed.

A bill to provide a 1-year extension of the date for \ncompliance by certain covered entities with the administrative \nsimplification standards for electronic transactions and code sets \nissued in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am happy to join Senator Dorgan in \nreintroducing legislation regarding the administrative simplification \nprovision of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. \nWe originally introduced legislation five months ago and have worked \nsince then with members from both the Finance and HELP committees to \nnegotiate a compromise. The bill we are introducing today is the \nproduct of those discussions. It provides for one additional much-\nneeded year for providers, State health programs, health plans and \nothers to implement the transactions and code set provision of \nadministrative simplification. Importantly, this new version also \nincludes language to clearly differentiate between this provision and \nthe privacy provision of HIPAA. It was our intention all along that the \nmedical privacy regulations not be affected by our legislation, and we \nbelieve this bill accomplishes that goal. My colleague and I have the \nbenefit of being joined on this bill by many of the cosponsors of the \noriginal bill, and we are happy to have their support.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Like Senator Craig, I appreciate the \ncooperation of our colleagues in helping us to work through this issue. \nWe have arrived at a solution that is agreeable to the majority of \nparties involved, while at the same time reaching our goal of providing \nrelief to small providers and plans and public health programs that are \nstruggling to prepare their systems for this cost. Senator Craig and I \nwould have preferred that this bill go further in providing more time \nand coordination for affected entities. On the other hand, we \nacknowledge that others would prefer no action in this area. Since we \nare just one year from the scheduled compliance date, however, we \nrecognize that all those affected need some certainty as they move \nforward with complying with the transactions and code sets regulation. \nGiven that this bill does provide needed relief for our states and \ngiven the time constraints we are facing, we believe this compromise is \nappropriate and do not feel an additional extension can be acquired.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1589. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand medicare benefits to prevent, delay, and minimize the \nprogression of chronic conditions, establish payment incentives for \nfurnishing quality services to people with serious and disabling \nchronic conditions, and develop national policies on effective chronic \ncondition care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I join several colleagues today to \nintroduce the Medicare Chronic Care Improvement Act of 2001. Although \nwe in Congress are focused on helping the Nation recover from the \nhorrific attacks of September 11, we must also stand tall against the \nterrorists who wish to sabotage our domestic policy agenda and continue \nto work on the issues that affect the everyday health and well being of \nAmerican citizens. With this conviction, I believe it is time to \naddress the leading health care problem of the 21st century, chronic \nconditions.\n  Chronic conditions account for an astounding 90 percent of morbidity, \n80 percent of deaths, and over 75 percent of direct medical \nexpenditures in the United States. Nearly 125 million Americans have \nchronic conditions, and this number is expected to increase to 157 \nmillion, approximately half the population, by 2020.\n  Chronic conditions encompass an array of health conditions that are \npersistent, recurring, and cannot be cured. They include severely \nimpairing conditions like Alzheimer's disease, congestive heart \nfailure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, depression, \nhypertension, and arthritis. Certainly in West Virginia, many of our \nworkers, especially coal miners and steelworkers, suffer from chronic \nconditions.\n  Treating serious and disabling chronic conditions is the highest cost \nand fastest growing segment of health care. Direct medical costs for \nchronic conditions reached $510 billion in 2000 and are projected to \nreach $1.07 trillion by 2020.\n  An estimated 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries suffer from at \nleast one chronic condition and those beneficiaries account for an \nastounding 95 percent of Medicare spending. But Medicare does not \nprovide many of the health care services that people with chronic \nconditions need. For example, current Medicare data show that, on \naverage, people with chronic conditions see eight different physicians. \nMedicare does not compensate these physicians for communicating with \none another, nor are they paid for care coordination, monitoring \nmedications, early detection, or for educating or counseling patients \nand caregivers. As a result, few of these services, which are critical \nto people with chronic conditions, are provided.\n  To meet the needs of these individuals, our health care system must \nembrace a person-centered, system-oriented approach to care. Payers and \nproviders who serve the same person\n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\nmust be empowered to work together to help people with chronic \nconditions prevent, delay, or minimize disease and disability \nprogression and maximize their health and well being.\n  Over 10 years ago, I served as Chairman of the Pepper Commission. Our \nfinal report recognized that people with chronic conditions have \nspecial needs requiring multidisciplinary health care or social \nservices to compliment or augment their health care. The Commission \nfurther recognized that medical care cannot be fully accessible or \neffective for this segment of the population unless it is accompanied \nby education, outreach, and systems to coordinate a broad range of \nservices. The Commission identified these needed changes over ten years \nago. And, as I stand before you today, not a single one of these \nrecommendations has been made.\n  I am here to propose a long overdue and much needed solution, The \nMedicare Chronic Care Improvement Act of 2001. This bill establishes a \ncomprehensive plan to update and streamline the Medicare healthcare \ndelivery system to better meet the needs of people with chronic health \nconditions.\n  First, the Medicare Chronic Care Improvement Act of 2001 helps \nprevent, delay, and minimize the progression of chronic conditions by \nauthorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand \ncoverage of preventive health benefits. The bill permits providers to \nwaive deductibles and co-payments for preventive and wellness services \nand streamlines the process of approving preventive benefits.\n  Second, this bill provides a person-centered, system-oriented \napproach to care for this extremely vulnerable segment of our \npopulation by expanding Medicare coverage to include assessment, care-\ncoordination, self-management services, and patient and family \ncaregiver education and counseling.\n  Third, this legislation improves Medicare fee-for-service and managed \ncare financing for plans that serve beneficiaries with multiple, \ncomplex chronic conditions. The Secretary is directed to develop a plan \nto refine payment incentives to ensure appropriate payment for serving \nthese high-cost individuals.\n  And finally, the Medicare Chronic Care Improvement Act of 2001 \nrequires the Secretary of HHS to report to Congress on chronic \ncondition trends and costs as a foundation for establishing national \nchronic care policies.\n  For more detail, I am also entering a section-by-section bill summary \ninto the Congressional Record following this statement.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by a variety of health \norganizations representing consumers and providers including:\n  Chronic Care Coalition, comprising the American Association of Homes \nand Services for the Aging, American Geriatrics Society, Catholic \nHealth Association of the United States, Elderplan Social HMO, National \nChronic Care Consortium, National Council on the Aging, and National \nFamily Caregivers Association;\n  National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association;\n  Association for Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare; American Lung \nAssociation; American Academy of Neurology; American Neurological \nAssociation; and United Seniors Health Cooperative.\n  The Medicare Chronic Care Improvement Act of 2001 provides a \ncomprehensive solution to improving the quality of life and health for \nmillions of Americans who are struggling with serious and disabling \nchronic conditions. It improves benefits for people with chronic \nconditions, it empowers providers to better care for these people, and \nit provides us with the research we need to better address chronic \nconditions in the future.\n  And last, but not least, this legislation has the potential to save \nthe Medicare program money, by better managing and treating chronic \nconditions before costly complications result. That is good for seniors \nand good for Medicare, a win-win situation. It is time to step up to \nthe plate and fulfill our obligation to our Nation's most vulnerable \ncitizens. This bill should stimulate the debate, and when Congress \nreturns to business not related to the September 11th attacks, I intend \nto advance this legislation in the Finance Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the summary be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprohibit Federal funds from being used to provide payments under a \nFederal health care program to any health care provider who charges a \nmembership or any other extraneous or incidental fee to a patient as a \nprerequisite for the provision of an item or services to the patient; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nMedicare Equal Access to Care Act. I am jointed by my colleagues \nSenators Durbin and Edwards. This legislation is designed to address a \ndisturbing development which may make it harder for some seniors to \nhave access to Medicare.\n  I have recently become aware of a practice, an early example if which \ntook place in Florida, in which doctors assess their existing patients \na $1,500 membership fee in order to receive continued care. In some \nStates, these fees have been as high as $20,000. By charging these \nextraneous and unwarranted dues, the doctors can shrink their practice, \nyet maintain their profits. Another version of this arrangement is to \nrequire that patients seek and pay for non-Medicare covered services \nfrom their doctors as a condition for joining or remaining in the \npractice. Tragically, the patients who can't afford these large sums \nfor the privilege of medical care or who choose not to purchase non-\nMedicare covered services are simply told to find another doctor. In \nareas where there is already a shortage of doctors, this practice could \nseverely hamper Medicare beneficiaries' access to health care.\n  Then, in addition to membership fees the doctors bill Medicare for \nthe cost of the covered services they provide.\n  Were Medicare a private insurance company, this practice would not be \nallowed. Private health insurance companies do not permit their \nproviders to charge an ``access fee'' as a condition to being accepted \nas a patient. The Federal Government, the American taxpayers, should \nnot hold its providers to a looser standard, thereby supporting a \ndistasteful division of Medicare beneficiaries into haves and have-\nnots. This situation is unacceptable.\n\n[[Page S11214]]\n\n  The Medicare Equal Access to Care Act bill will put a damper on such \nagreements. This legislation is simple: it will prevent any federal \nhealth program, like Medicare, from reimbursing doctors who charge \ntheir patients membership fees, as defined by the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, or who require that their patients purchase non-\nMedicare.\n  I want to emphasize that this legislation does not interfere with the \nright of the doctor and patient to enter into private arrangements. A \ndoctor may forego Medicare reimbursement and charge patients a \nmembership fee of any amount, and patients have the choice of whether \nto accept that condition. Likewise, a doctor is free to charge a \npatient for any service that is not reimbursed under Medicare.\n  Though they present a carefully crafted loophole, these arrangements \nviolate the intent and spirit of the Balanced Billing Act.\n  Clearly, our health care system is not working for patients. \nAdditionally it's not working for doctors, if they must resort to these \ntypes of practices. Also, hundreds of thousands of our nation's seniors \nhave been informed that their managed care company will be withdrawing \nfrom the Membership program. We need to adequately reimburse doctors, \nto provide the incentive to continue to participate in the \nMedicare+Choice program. Just as we don't want Medicare beneficiaries \nto be told their HMO is unavailable, we don't want them to be told \ntheir doctor is unavailable, unless they pay a fee. These are among \nthese reasons that Congress needs to complete and pass a Patient's Bill \nof Rights and send it to the President. But in the meantime, we must \nprotect our seniors and ensure that their access to Medicare is not \nsubject to hurdles and conditions.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Medicare \nEqual Access to Care Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1592\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish a grant program to support research \nprojects on critical infrastructure protection for water supply \nsystems, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, I rise before you \ntoday to introduce the Water Infrastructure Security and Research \nDevelopment Act. This legislation authorizes the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency to provide funding to support research projects on \ncritical infrastructure protection for water supply systems.\n  Our Nation's water supply system is truly unique. It uses a \ndecentralized, community-based approach to provide superior water \nservices to all citizens of the United States. Here, we turn on the tap \nin our homes and receive clean, fresh water without giving it much \nthought. This not the way water systems operate throughout the world.\n  A 1997 United Nations report on the state of water resources \nworldwide states that at least one-fifth of all people do not have \naccess to safe drinking water, and more than one-half lack adequate \nsanitation. Quoting from the report:\n\n       The World Health Organization estimates that a total of \n     more than five million people die each year just from \n     diseases caused by unsafe drinking water, and a lack of \n     sanitation and water for hygiene. Provision of safe drinking \n     water and sanitation could reduce the amount of illness and \n     death by as much as three-quarters, depending on the disease.\n\n  In this country, we often take our water system for granted. When \nconsidered in the international context, the true value of our water \nsystem becomes more apparent. We truly have something to protect.\n  During my tenure as Chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, we have been evaluating the state of our Nation's water \ninfrastructure, both drinking water and wastewater. It is clear that we \nhave work to do to modernize our existing systems and ensure that we \ncontinue to provide clean, safe water to our citizens into the future. \nOur discussions in the Committee tend to focus on infrastructure \nreplacement needs, the funds that will be required, and the extent of \nthe federal role. I am committed to this process, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues on legislation that we plan to \nintroduce early next year.\n  However, today, I rise to speak to you about another aspect of our \nNation's water infrastructure--security. Since the events of September \n11, I have worked with the members of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that we are \ntaking the steps necessary to protect our nation's water infrastructure \nsystem during these times. There are many short term actions that have \nalready been taken.\n  Based on the recommendations of Presidential Decision Directive 63, \nissued by President Clinton in 1998, the Environmental Protection \nAgency and its industry partner, the Association of Metropolitan Water \nAgencies, have established a communications system, a water \ninfrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, designed to \nprovide real-time threat assessment data to water utilities throughout \nthe nation.\n  Through this partnership, the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nAssociation of Metropolitan Water Agencies are working to develop \ngeneric assessment tools that individual water utilities can use to \nassess their facilities for potential physical and cyber threats. I \nbelieve that the rapid completion of both these tools and the \nindividual assessments is imperative. In early October, I sent a letter \nto the President with Senators Smith, Graham, and Crapo and \nRepresentatives Tauzin, Dingell, Gillmor, and Pallone requesting that \nhe use a portion of the $20 billion of discretionary funds provided to \nthe Administration by Congress this year to provide assistance for \nthese assessments to water utilities.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Smith will take \nus one step further by authorizing support of both ongoing efforts \nunder Presidential Decision Directive 63 and new research to assess \npotential threats to our water supply system and develop solutions.\n  This legislation authorizes twelve million dollars per year from 2002 \nto 2007 for the Environmental Protection Agency to use for grants to or \ncooperative agreements with research institutions. Projects conducted \nunder these agreements will be used to conduct research addressing \nphysical and cyber threats at water supply systems, improvements in \ninformation sharing and analysis efforts, and technical assistance and \ntraining. These projects will address both drinking water and \nwastewater systems that make up our nation's water supply \ninfrastructure.\n\n[[Page S11215]]\n\n  Eligible research institutions will include public and private \nentities, including national laboratories that perform research that \nwill improve the security of water supply systems. Our legislation \nincludes a provision to ensure that those entities conducting this \nresearch have the ability to effectively safeguard sensitive \ninformation.\n  Individual projects will fall into a series of categories designed to \ndevelop the information we need to protect our water supply system \nnationwide.\n  First, projects will assess the security issues for water supply \nsystems by conducting assessments and developing and refining \nvulnerability assessment tools.\n  Second, projects will protect water supply systems from potential \nthreats by developing technologies, processes, guidelines, standards, \nand procedures for the purpose of protecting water supply systems. \nProjects will also develop real-time monitoring systems to protect \nagainst chemical, biological, or radiological attack.\n  Third, projects will develop technologies and processes for \naddressing the mitigation, response and recovery of biological, \nchemical and radiological contamination of water supply systems.\n  Fourth, projects will implement requirements of Presidential Decision \nDirective 63 by refining and operating the Information Sharing and \nAnalysis Center to capture and share threats, events and best \npractices.\n  Finally, projects will test and evaluate new technologies and \nprocesses by developing regional ``pilot facilities'' to demonstrate \nupgraded security systems, assess new technologies, and to determine \noperational and cost impacts due to enhanced security.\n  Individual awards may not exceed one million dollars. Test and \nevaluation projects will be cost-shared on a 50-50 basis.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation and \nother efforts to enhance the security of our Nation's water \ninfrastructure in the weeks, months, and years to come. We truly have \nsomething to protect; clean, safe, fresh water is worth our investment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Kennedy, \n        and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1594. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nprograms to improve nurse retention, the nursing workplace, and the \nquality of care; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today the Nurse \nRetention and Quality Care Act of 2001 and to speak about the \nimportance of nurses and the work they do. On September 11, nurses were \namong those who were on the front lines of the battle against \nterrorism. With courage, skill and determination, they were on the job, \ntreating the injured, helping to save lives.\n  To this day, nurses are defending America. In clinics, hospitals and \noffices around the country, they are working to detect and treat actual \nor suspected cases of anthrax. Should our Nation face other biological \nthreats or terrorist attacks, nurses will be there for us.\n  Today's news that a woman who works in the Manhattan Eye, Ear and \nThroat Hospital is in critical condition with possible inhalation \nanthrax is a reminder of the hazards faced by health care workers. And \nit is a reminder of how important it is that our public health system \nbe fully staffed with trained health care professionals.\n  Sadly, America is facing a nursing shortage at a time when the need \nfor more nurses is so clear. Our nurses are facing an emergency of \ntheir own and they need our help. The nursing shortage imposes \nincreasing hardship on hospitals and nurses alike, and threatens the \nability of our health care system to provide basic patient care, much \nless respond to health crises and terrorism.\n  Not only is the number of individuals entering the nursing profession \nfalling, but hospitals are also facing difficulty retaining the nurses \nalready on staff. Fifty percent of nurses say they have recently \nconsidered leaving their jobs for reasons other than retirement, and \napproximately half a million licensed nurses are not currently \npracticing nursing. Many of the nurses who have considered leaving the \nprofession cite their low level of overall job satisfaction.\n  While we must do more to improve the number of nurses in training, we \nmust also take steps to enhance the workplace to retain current nurses, \nand that is what the bill that Senator Gordon Smith and I will be \nintroducing today would address.\n  One way to retain nurses is to follow the example of those hospitals \nthat have become nursing ``magnets.'' They are successful because they \ninvolve nurses in decision-making, encourage collaboration among health \nprofessionals, give nurses the opportunity to pursue continuing \neducation and advancement, and they organize care to improve patient \noutcome.\n  Our bill is designed to encourage more hospitals to follow these \nleads. And I am pleased that hospitals and nurses support this bill. It \nhas been endorsed by the American Nurses Association and the American \nHospitals Association.\n  It is also a good bill for patients and their quality of care as \nwell. Research has shown that magnet hospitals have lower mortality \nrates, shorter lengths of stay, higher patient satisfaction and cost-\nefficiency.\n  As our Nation faces increasing threats of terrorist and biological \nattack, our health system must be stronger than ever before. One of the \nbest ways we can do this is by taking steps to reverse the nursing \nshortage, and ensure that nurses on the front lines are well-prepared \nto respond to emergencies.\n  Our bill does both. First, it creates demonstration programs to \nencourage states to adopt magnet hospital practices, which will help \nattract and retain the nursing staff our hospitals need so they can \ncope with surges in patient volume.\n  And, second, our bill encourages nurses to pursue continued \neducation. That is so important today, when we need more health care \nprofessionals who can detect the early signs of a bioterrorist attack. \nThis legislation will promote the kind of training that the New York \nState Nurses Association, Bellevue Hospital and New York College \nprovide for nurses in my state.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nfrom New York, Senator Clinton, in introducing the Nurse Retention and \nQuality of Care Act of 2001. As most of my colleagues already know, our \nNation is facing an unprecedented nursing shortage. A Northwest Health \nFoundation study released this year found that Oregon alone will have \n3,200 nursing vacancies in 2010. It is critical that we act immediately \nto address this shortage, and we must start by retaining the highly \nskilled nurses that already constitute the foundation of our health \ncare system.\n  Our Nation's nursing shortage is not merely the result of poor nurse \nrecruitment, this shortage exists in large part because nurses are \nleaving the profession altogether. Half a million licensed nurses are \nnot currently practicing. These nurses represent some of our Nation's \nmost compassionate and experienced health care professionals, but they \nfeel compelled to look elsewhere for work, and we must do something to \nchange this disturbing trend.\n  The Nurse Retention and Quality of Care Act will give hospitals \nincentives to develop and implement model practices for retaining \nnurses, such as the methods used by ``magnet hospitals''. Magnet \nhospitals have been in existence for a number of years, and share \ncertain characteristics designed to make these hospitals attractive \nworkplaces for nurses. These hospitals promote nurse participation in \ndecision-making, collaboration and communication among health care \nprofessionals, opportunities for nurses to pursue education and career \nadvancement, and a balanced and accommodating work environment for \nnurses.\n  Nurses in magnet hospitals stay twice as long on average as those in \nnon-magnet hospitals, and consistently report greater job satisfaction. \nPatients also express higher satisfaction in magnet hospitals. There is \none such hospital in my home state of Oregon, Providence St. Vincent \nMedical Center in Portland, OR, and I am not alone in hoping this \nlegislation will lead to additional magnet facilities. Our legislation \nwill authorize $40 million in demonstration grants for health care \nfacilities to implement the model practices\n\n[[Page S11216]]\n\nutilized by magnet hospitals, and I believe that this will be an \nimportant step toward fixing our Nation's impending nursing shortage.\n  Nurses are the human face of medicine, but the demands on them are \nincreasingly difficult to bear. The Nurse Retention and Quality of Care \nAct paves the way for hospitals to implement practices that will \nimprove the morale of nurses and encourage them to stay in the nursing \nprofession. Now, more than ever, with the current health and safety \nconcerns facing our Nation, we must let nurses know that they are \nimportant to us and that we value their expertise and compassion. By \npassing this bill, we can do just that, and take important steps to \nensure an adequate supply of highly qualified nurses for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11216-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 80--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n REGARDING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE FEDERAL WATER \n                         POLLUTION CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Jeffords, and \nMr. Crapo) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 80\n\n       Whereas clean water is a natural resource of tremendous \n     value and importance to the United States;\n       Whereas there is resounding public support for protecting \n     and enhancing the quality of the rivers, streams, lakes, \n     wetland, and marine water of the United States;\n       Whereas maintaining and improving water quality is \n     essential to protecting public health, fisheries, wildlife, \n     and watersheds, and to ensuring abundant opportunities for \n     public recreation and economic development;\n       Whereas it is a national responsibility to provide clean \n     water for future generations;\n       Whereas substantial progress has been made in protecting \n     and enhancing water quality since the date of enactment, in \n     1972, of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n     1251 et seq.) due to concerted efforts by Federal, State, and \n     local governments, the private sector, and the public;\n       Whereas serious water pollution problems persist throughout \n     the United States and significant challenges lie ahead in the \n     effort to protect water resources from point sources and \n     nonpoint sources of pollution;\n       Whereas further development and innovation of water \n     pollution control programs and advancement of water pollution \n     control research, technology, and education are necessary and \n     desirable; and\n       Whereas October 2002 is the 30th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1251 et seq.): Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That, as the United States marks the 30th \n     anniversary, in October 2002, of the enactment of the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), \n     Congress encourages the people of the United States and all \n     levels of government to recognize and celebrate the \n     accomplishments of the United States under, and to recommit \n     to achieving the goals of, that Act.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to submit a \nconcurrent resolution with the House of Representatives to commemorate \nthe 30th anniversary of the Clean Water Act next October 2002. \nRepresentative Sherry Boehlert is introducing the House version and \njoining me in the Senate are Senators Crapo, Graham, and Voinovich.\n  Every time we look out onto a river, swim in a lake, or cast a line \nin search of a fish, we have the Clean Water Act to thank. Streams that \nwere once devoid of fish and other aquatic life now support numerous \nand varied aquatic populations. Lakes that were once choked by \npollution are now vastly improved. Wastewater discharges from municipal \nand industrial sources are being controlled.\n  One of the first and most successful national environmental laws to \nbe passed by the Federal Government, the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act, commonly known as the Clean Water Act, was enacted in 1972 \nand set the goal of restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, \nand biological integrity of the nation's waters. In the nearly three \ndecades since its enactment, Clean Water Act programs have yielded \nmeasurable improvements in water quality.\n  We have come a long way, yet much remains to be done to achieve the \nActs' goals of ``fishable'' and ``swimmable'' waters. Nonpoint sources \nof pollution from urban, suburban and rural areas are remain a \nsignificant threat to the nation's water resources. Science has given \nus the ability to detect pollutants in ever decreasing amounts. \nTechnological advances, while providing solutions to pollution \nproblems, also pose new pollution concerns.\n  Therefore, while commemorating a successful 30 years in clean water, \nwe must also recommit ourselves to solving remaining clean water \nproblems. The time until the 30th anniversary on October 18, 2002, will \nprovide us a year to renew our commitment to clean our waters. As it \ndid in 1992, America's Clean Water Foundation, ACWF, will coordinate \nthe Year of Clean Water with activities: 1. highlighting the need to \nenhance collective appreciation for the importance of our water \nresources, 2. educating our nation's youth 3. building a better \nunderstanding of remaining challenges and solutions, and 4. rekindling \nthe stewardship ethic begun in the 1970's.\n  The Year of Clean Water activities, scheduled throughout 2002, will \nprovide the opportunity for citizens and governments to come together \nin support of clean water and water resource protection programs. For \nexample, program planning is under way for a World Watershed Summit, a \nYouth Watershed Summit, a National Stormwater Conference, a Legal and \nEconomic Issues Forum, and a national water quality monitoring effort \nto gather water quality data from around the country. Please join me in \nsupport this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11216-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 174--EXPRESSING APPRECIATION TO THE UNITED KINGDOM \n FOR ITS SOLIDARITY AND LEADERSHIP AS AN ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES AND \n     REAFFIRMING THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES\n\n  Mr. MILLER (for himself and Mr. Helms) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (referred \n     to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') is the primary Federal \n     program available to help low-income households, the elderly, \n     and individuals with disabilities pay their home energy \n     bills.\n       (2) Congress provided $300,000,000 in emergency funding for \n     LIHEAP in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2001 because \n     regular appropriations were insufficient to help States \n     offset the increase in high utility bills from November 2000 \n     through February 2001 (referred to in this section as the \n     ``winter of 2000'').\n       (3) Congress directed that half of the emergency funding \n     would be made available for\n\n[[Page S11234]]\n\n     targeted assistance to States with the most critical needs, \n     and half would be given to help States address unmet energy \n     assistance needs resulting from the extraordinary price \n     increases in home heating fuels and residential natural gas, \n     experienced during the winter of 2000.\n       (4) In the winter of 2000 there was a 30 percent increase \n     in households receiving LIHEAP assistance in large part due \n     to the high price of home energy and severe weather.\n       (5) In the winter of 2000, the LIHEAP program was only able \n     to serve 17 percent of the 29,000,000 households eligible for \n     LIHEAP assistance.\n       (6) In the winter of 2000, heating oil prices were 36 \n     percent higher than from November 1999 through February 2000 \n     (referred to in this section as the ``winter of 1999''), and \n     residential natural gas cost 42 percent more per cubic foot \n     than in the winter of 1999 even though the weather was 10 \n     percent colder than the winter of 1999.\n       (7) In the winter of 2000, record cold weather and high \n     home energy bills took a financial toll on low-income \n     families and the elderly who spend, on average, 19.5 percent \n     of their annual income on energy bills, as compared to 3.7 \n     percent for all other households.\n       (8) Families in the United States need emergency LIHEAP \n     funding to pay home energy bills from the winter of 2000 and \n     restore heat as the succeeding winter approaches.\n       (9) More citizens will need LIHEAP assistance in fiscal \n     year 2001 due to the recent increase in unemployment and the \n     slowing economy.\n       (10) States are being forced to draw down fiscal year 2002 \n     LIHEAP funds in order to address unmet needs from fiscal year \n     2001 and help low-income households pay overdue home energy \n     bills.\n       (11) Emergency LIHEAP funding will provide States with \n     critical resources to help provide assistance to residents.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should immediately release the \n     $300,000,000 in emergency funding for LIHEAP provided by the \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2001.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 2027.

Madam President, the Senate, even though we had a number of \nmatters that took a lot of time on and off the floor, did make \nprogress. We have a finite list of amendments that has now been placed \nin the Record. We have paper to work from, in effect. Beginning \ntomorrow, at 10:30, we are going to start working our way through these \namendments. It would be possible to complete the bill by tomorrow \nevening or maybe late afternoon. But regardless of when we are going to \ncomplete it, we are going to complete it, and it is going to be done at \nthe earliest possible date.\n  All Senators should understand that there could be some late nights \nthe next couple of nights. The majority leader has told me I should \nrelay this to all Senators: that if we are going to complete the \nbusiness we have prior to the Thanksgiving recess, which I think is the \n16th--I am not sure of that date--we have a lot of work to do. We have \nthis appropriations bill to do, and two others, one of which is a very \nbig Defense appropriations bill. We have bioterrorism. We have a \nstimulus package. We have a number of bills that are going to take some \ntime. So everyone should understand there could be some votes into the \nevening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/30/senate-section/article/S11248-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
