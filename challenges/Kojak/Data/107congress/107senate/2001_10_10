Madam President, I want to talk this morning a bit, as we \nhave for some time, about energy. Energy, of course, is something we \nhave talked about for some time--a good long time, as a matter of fact. \nOur experiences last summer in California emphasized the need for some \nchanges in our energy policy so that we have more stability and \nreliability in energy. Of course, we also became aware of some of the \nthings we must do in terms of energy, and we have worked on it for a \nvery long time.\n  Now, since September 11, I think we find some very compelling \nadditional reasons that we need to do some things with energy. \nObviously, we have not had an energy policy that we need to have in \nplace over the years, and that is what we are seeking to do--to develop \nenergy policy.\n  Partly because, I suppose, of the lack of a policy and a real \ndirection where we want to go over time, we have become very dependent \non overseas oil sources. We are nearly 60 percent dependent on OPEC and \nothers. So now, in terms of some of the uncertainty in the Middle East \nand around the world, I think we find ourselves with more concern about \nwhere we need to be in terms of energy.\n  We have at least two compelling reasons, it seems to me, that make \nenergy development and energy security even more important. One is to \nsupport our military activities. We have to have the energy to do that. \nThe other is that we are talking about a stimulus for the economy, \nabout building our economy. Obviously, fuel and power and energy are \nkey to that, in whatever means they are used. So I believe we find \nourselves now with even more reason to move to developing an energy \npolicy that will ensure we have the energy necessary for all the needs \nwe have.\n  We have talked before about the need for research so we can find \nbetter ways to produce energy, so that we can find better ways to \nconserve our energy. Those things are possible, and we can do them. We \nhave talked more about how we find diversity in a policy so we don't \nbecome dependent on one source of energy--and that we can look toward \nnuclear--whether it be renewable, gas, or coal, and to have diversity \nthat helps strengthen those sources.\n  We have talked a good deal about renewables. That is obviously \nsomething we need to pursue. Most important of all, I imagine now as we \nlook at where we are, is production. We need to ensure we can have \ndomestic production, and that we can increase our domestic production, \nso we become less dependent upon the supply from overseas.\n  So I believe very strongly that we had compelling reasons to deal \nwith energy before, and certainly September 11 has added to the \nnecessity for us to do that. We have worked hard in the Energy \nCommittee, of which I am a member, to respond. We have had hearings, we \nhad marked up a title in our energy bill, and we are moving forward on \nthat bill that was quite broad.\n  In the meantime, the House has passed an energy bill which has a good \ndeal of the things in it about which we have talked. So they moved \nforward with that over in the House. It has great support from labor \nunions and from many environmentalists, and it certainly has strong \nsupport from the administration. That bill is passed and available for \nus to deal with now.\n\n  Unfortunately--or fortunately--there has been some change in what we \nare doing. The chairman of the committee has indicated that he has been \nasked to not have any more committee activities, and there will be a \nbill put together, apparently, by the majority leader to bring before \nus. Unfortunately, we have talked about this before and have not \narrived, I don't believe, at any commitment as to when that will be \ndone and how it will be done. Of course, some have considerable concern \nthat there would not be input from all of the folks in the Senate. \nThere is some concern about that. I believe what we need more than \nanything is the assurance that there will be an energy bill before we \nadjourn.\n  There are a number of things that are very important to us. One is \nairline security. I think it is very important that we do that. We are \nalso working on changing the rules and the law on terrorism so that our \nagencies can work more efficiently and our law enforcement and others \ncan do that. We are working on a stimulus for the economy in the \nFinance Committee, and I think that has to be one of the high-priority \nitems. We need to do our appropriations, which is our normal duty and \none that needs to be moving along.\n  So we have a full plate. But I believe strongly that energy now--\nparticularly because of the threats of the overseas intervention--\nbecomes one of the items we must add to our list to complete. I am \nhopeful that changes that apparently have been suggested will result in \nyet some way for us to get on the floor with the issues we think are \nterribly important for energy--to get the bill out that we can work on \nso we can develop and have an energy policy that will be supportive of \nthe economy and supportive of our war on terrorism. I think it is \nnecessary we do that.\n\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to find a way to bring together \nthe needs of this country, supported by the White House, supported by \nboth sides in this body, and already has been supported by the House, \nand that prior to finishing our work, we complete work on an energy \npolicy that will meet this country's needs.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10404-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10404-S10405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SETTING THE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I was not fortunate enough to have \nlistened to the entire statement of our friend from Wyoming. I have \nworked with Senator Daschle and Senator Bingaman on energy legislation, \nand no one feels more strongly than Senator Daschle, our majority \nleader, that we need to bring forward legislation at the earliest \npossible date dealing with the energy problems.\n  He and Senator Bingaman, who is the chairman of the Energy Committee, \nhave worked hard on this, and we will have something as soon as \npossible.\n  I have to say, we have been trying to get to airport security for \nover a week. There have been objections to that. We have had to jump \nthrough a series of hoops: A motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed, and now it appears we are going to have to file a motion to \ninvoke cloture on the bill itself. During this time, we could be doing \nother things. We have tried to move to appropriations bills which have \nnot been considered, and there have been objections to that by the \nminority.\n  Senator Leahy has worked night and day on terrorism and other issues \nas a result of the events of September 11, and we are still doing just \nfine with judicial nominations and nominations generally, but that is \nnot good enough for some people. Therefore, they have put a stop on all \nlegislation.\n  It seems somewhat unusual to me to have the minority saying why \naren't we moving legislation when they will not let us move it. We are \nin the majority. They may not like it. Senator Daschle is the majority \nleader and determines what legislation comes to the floor. They cannot \ndo that anymore. Because they only want energy does not mean that is \nwhat they are going to get.\n  We have many other items, and the majority leader has made a decision \non with what we are going to deal. They will not let us do that. We \nhave 13 appropriations bills we have to pass every year. They will not \nlet us get to those bills because they do not believe enough judges are \nbeing approved.\n  At home, I have not had a single person ask me about judges. We have \ntwo Nevada judges who are waiting to go through the funnel, and they \nwill get here. Those judges know Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch are \ndoing\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nthe very best they can on their nominations.\n  There is always talk about energy proficiency. Isn't it funny they \nalways bring up ANWR? That seems to be the button on the pin they are \nalways concerned about--ANWR. Madam President, this situation is one \nwith which we have to be very careful. Just last week somebody with a \nrifle shot some holes through a pipeline in Alaska, and 250,000 gallons \nof fuel spilled before they could stop the leakage. That was just one \nman. I do not know if he was target practicing or shooting at caribou. \nI do not know what he was doing, but with a rifle he put holes through \nthat pipe.\n\n  The energy situation is very complicated. The majority leader has \nindicated time and time again he is aware of that and wants to work on \nthis. I wish the minority would let the legislation that is important \npass. We need to do something about airport security. We need to do \nsomething about terrorism. We need to do something about many other \nthings that they will not let us get to. We are in the majority now. \nThe majority leader has the right and the ability to set the agenda for \nthis Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The idea of being able to object is not a brand new idea. \nIt was exercised by you when you were in the minority; isn't that true?\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I could not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The idea that we in the minority ought to be involved is \nsomething we learned from you when you were in the minority. So it is \nnot a brand new idea. When the majority brings bills forward, they need \nto work with everyone here so we can pass something.\n  I am just surprised at what the Senator said, that this is a brand \nnew idea.\n  Mr. REID. I do not recall, I say to my friend from Wyoming, talking \nabout a brand new idea. I was in the minority for a number of years in \nmy present position and worked very closely with Senator Lott in moving \nlegislation. I worked very hard in moving legislation, and we did not \nhold up legislation based on judges. We did not do that. We felt we \nwere treated unfairly. I think the last administration certainly did \nnot get the judges who were in the pipeline who should have been \nconfirmed. But we said early on this is not payback time; we are going \nto move them as quickly as we can, and we have. We have moved out \nscores of nominations that President Bush felt he needed. We moved \nscores.\n  Somebody on the side of the Senator from Wyoming--I do not know who \nit is; even if I did, I would not announce it here--believes we are not \nmoving enough judges through.\n  I say to my friend from Wyoming, we did not do that. We did not hold \nup legislation based upon judges. On a comparative basis, we had a \nright to do so, but I felt, and Senator Daschle felt as minority \nleader, that we had an obligation to move legislation.\n  We worked extremely hard to move appropriations bills. We worked \nextremely hard to move legislation that the majority then felt was \nimportant. We had very little downtime as a result of objections from \nour side. We made sure there were not even long periods of time when \nthere were quorum calls.\n  I say to my friend, I did not use the term it was a new idea. I am \njust saying what is happening is unfair. We have been trying to move to \nthis legislation dealing with airport security for more than a week, \nand we are a long ways from being able to do it now if colleagues make \nus jump through all the hoops.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I understand that. I agree with the Senator that we need \nto move forward. Another point. When there are bills with a special \npurpose, such as airport security, and provisions are added that have \nnothing to do with it, when you are in the minority, you have to have \nsome opportunity to participate in the decision. I say to the Senator \nfrom Nevada that it is the leadership's role to find some compromise so \nwe can move forward. I know the Senator has done that, and I admire \nwhat the Senator is doing.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I appreciate his presence in the \nChamber and attempting to work with us. On airport security, there are \nthree problems that can be resolved in a matter of a few hours: No. 1, \nthere are some who believe not only is airport security important but \nalso that there be security on our passenger trains.\n  There are also those who believe we should protect workers who have \nbeen displaced as a result of these terrible acts on September 11. We \nshould be able to work our way through that. We should bring these \nissues up, vote, and go to something else.\n  I say to my friend from Wyoming, I had a number of meetings yesterday \nwith Senator Lott in the presence, of course, of Senator Daschle, and \nhe is attempting to help us work through some of this. I appreciate \nthat very much.\n  Maybe today we can do something on terrorism. It would be helpful if \nwe could get that out of the way. There are things about which I feel \nstrongly. I had a Republican in the House today tell me: Did I hear you \nright when you said you think the things we do in this bill should not \nbe sunsetted?\n  I said: You heard me right. If it is good now, it will be good later.\n  They asked me if I believed, for example, if there should be roving \nwiretaps on terrorists. I said to a friend, a Member of the House from \nConnecticut: Yes, I do. There are some basic items in this \nantiterrorism legislation we need to do, I say to my friend from \nWyoming. I hope we can work that out before the day is through.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I hope so as well. One other observation: We have these \nitems now that are of such high priority that have to do with security, \nand I think we need to be very watchful that we do not find ourselves \nusing security as a vehicle for doing some things that have very little \nattachment to security.\n  I thank the Senator for his response.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10405-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10405-S10407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I speak not only as part of the Republican \nleadership in the Senate but as a member of the Energy Committee, a \ncommittee on which I have served for the 11 years I have been in the \nSenate. During those 11 years, I have had the opportunity to serve \nunder three Presidents. For 8 of those years, I served under a Democrat \nPresident. During that time, he, I, his administration, and certainly \nall Members, attempted to shape a national energy policy for our \ncountry that never really got accomplished. During that time, we \ncontinued to grow very rapidly as a nation. We continued to consume up \nto a 2\\1/2\\ to 3 percent increase in energy each year, although our \ncountry was only producing a 1\\1/2\\ percent increase of total need.\n  Of course, we know what happened as a result of that timeframe over \nthe last 8\\1/2\\ years: We grew increasingly dependent upon foreign \nsources of energy for our existence, at least in oil. Our \ninfrastructure grew older, our transmission lines and pipelines; our \nability to generate electrical energy did not increase very rapidly. \nBut workers found the demand of the new high-tech economy even required \ngreater abundances of electricity and energy than we originally \nsuspected.\n  It is why it became an issue in the last presidential campaign and it \nis why this President, George Bush, immediately developed a national \nenergy task force to began to work on a national energy policy. They \ncompleted their work and sent their information to the Hill.\n  While that has been going on, the Energy Committee, now chaired by \nSenator Bingaman, once chaired by Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska, \nhas been working on a national energy policy. We have spent the last \n3\\1/2\\ to 4\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\nyears in hearings, looking at all sides of this issue. We clearly have \na vision as to what we need and what we need to do. It is really not \nvery difficult, although it is politically contentious. We need to \nproduce more energy, in electricity and in gas and oil. We need to put \nmore research behind new technologies and continue to advance the \ntechnologies for electronic cars and alternative forms of electrical \ngeneration--wind and solar. We have invested millions of dollars in \nthose alternatives over the last couple of years. We need to continue.\n  At the same time, there is no question for the next 15 to 20 years we \nwill be increasingly dependent upon foreign sources for oil--\npredominantly oil--ultimately the greatest form of energy that moves \nthe American economy, whether it is the cars we drive, the trucks that \ndeliver the goods and services to our communities, the trains that run \nupon our tracks, the airplanes that fly across our skies, or our ships \nat sea, our aircraft carriers and the planes that are now flying day \nand night over Afghanistan. All of those are driven by oil, by energy. \nWhen we started this debate a decade or more ago, we were around 50 \npercent dependent upon foreign sources of that energy. Today we are at \ntimes over 60 percent dependent. We understand the issue. We clearly \nunderstand the urgency.\n  We awakened to that energy problem last year when the lights went out \nin California. We all said: My goodness, why is that happening? What \nhappened that caused all of this--for elevators to stop operating and \ntraffic lights to stop operating, for the economy of California to \nnearly go in the tank as a result of not having the energy base they \nneeded to feed their growth and demand? We knew they had launched a \npolicy some time back that was not allowing them to produce. While it \nwas a wake-up call for California, it truly was a wake-up call for our \nNation.\n\n  As a result of that, this Senator's effort, the committee's effort, \nand the President's effort, the House moved an energy bill and was able \nto pass a fairly comprehensive new policy toward production and \ninfrastructure development and the kind of refinement that a new, \ndynamic energy policy for our country needs. They did their work. They \ngot that work done before the August recess.\n  We were working, and with credit to Chairman Bingaman, although we \nhad the transfer of leadership in the Senate, he continued to work. He \nwas looking at a much broader bill to deal with the issue of energy \nthan the House produced. We were working with him in a very bipartisan \nmanner. Sure, there were differences of opinion. Yes, there are several \nissues on which we clearly disagree. But in the general sense, we were \nmoving toward a national energy policy.\n  Along comes September 11. We all know that day now; It is seared into \nour minds, our world stopped for a time and thousands of Americans lost \ntheir lives. We began to rethink who we were and what we were all about \nas a country. Up until that time Americans, if they were polled, said \nthat, yes, a national energy policy was necessary because it meant the \nstrength of our economy and the growth of our economy and it meant that \nfuture generations would have an opportunity to have a supply of \nenergy. But about third or fourth on that list of reasons for a \nnational energy policy was national security. It did not register but \nthird on some polls, or fourth.\n  September 11--the world changes; the American mindset changes. All of \na sudden, by nearly a 60 percentile polling factor, energy and energy \npolicy and energy supply for our country--reliable, abundant, stable--\nbecame the No. 1 issue. National security, national security, national \nsecurity.\n  Why, then, do I read in a press release from Chairman Bingaman \nyesterday that the majority leader of the Senate has directed the \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to suspend any \nfurther markup on energy legislation for this session of Congress?\n  What? A No. 1 national energy policy, being now a No. 1 national \nsecurity policy in our country, and the leader of the Senate is saying \nstop, don't go forward? The House has done its work, but the Senate \ncannot do its work?\n  He says he wants to write his own bill. OK. I have been involved with \nthis issue for a long time. I know why he wants to write his own bill. \nI understand the politics of the issue. I understand the other side \nlost a component of the battle on September 11. Actually, they had lost \nit much before then. They lost it when the House voted to include oil \nexploration in the Alaskan Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in August. \nThey were not willing to admit it at that time. They thought they still \nhad the votes, but the House had already made that decision because \nAmerica was sensing a need for a broader national energy policy.\n  But on September 11 that issue was gone. When it says down here that \nSenator Bingaman went on to say, ``the Senate leadership sincerely \nwants to avoid quarrelsome, divisive votes in the committee,'' what the \nchairman is saying is he can't control his own people anymore in the \ncommittee because September 11 convinced them that we have to have a \nnational energy policy because national security and energy is \nparamount.\n  So he went to his leader and said: Leader Daschle, I can't give you \nthe energy bill that I thought I could. I have lost the votes on a \ncouple of key issues and you won't like what comes to the floor.\n  Some on the other side are saying if you bring that kind of a bill to \nthe floor, we will filibuster, we won't let it pass, and we don't want \nto see that kind of partisanship on the floor post-September 11. So \nthey are stopping any effort to develop a national energy policy and to \nallow the Senate to address the issue.\n  I come to the Chamber today because this is not only a distressing \npress release from the chairman of the Energy Committee, I am amazed \nthe majority leader has pulled that authority away from the authorizing \ncommittee chairman who has, over the last good number of years, truly \nbecome an expert in the energy issue. He and I do not always agree, but \nwe think it is the responsibility of that committee to produce a bill, \nnot for the majority leader to go into his back office and write a bill \nthat is politically correct for his side of the aisle.\n  Is that--will that be--could that be a comprehensive national energy \npolicy? I don't think so. But let's say it could be.\n  I ask unanimous consent for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am going to give the majority leader the benefit of the \ndoubt at this moment--because I should. I am going to say to the \nmajority leader at this moment: OK, if that is your decision--and I \nunderstand the timing here; I understand we are in the last month to a \nmonth and a half of this session of Congress and that national energy \npolicy is truly a national security issue and all Americans now believe \nthat. All the polls show that. It is something the House has dealt with \nand we should deal with. So I say to Leader Tom Daschle at this moment: \nIf you are going to craft an energy bill in your office and bring it to \nthe floor as the prerogative of leadership, get on with it. Do it now. \nDon't tell us you are going to do it and then wait 3 or 4 or 5 weeks, \nknowing that it cannot get done and it cannot get conferenced with the \nHouse. That way you have given your people a vote, but you have not \nfaced the issue and you have not put a bill on the President's desk. \nThat is not leadership. That is politics.\n\n  The majority leader and the chairman of the full committee say they \nwant to avoid quarrelsome, divisive votes. They don't want to allow \npartisan politics to come to the floor.\n  I suggest if he crafts a bill and brings it to the floor, he avoids \nthat. But if this is a ploy, if this is simply rhetoric to get the bug \noff their back--because it is now squarely on the majority's back; they \nhave canceled the committee from acting; the majority leader has said: \nI'll do it. So if we do not have a national energy policy for the \nenergy security and the national security of this country by the close \nof business of this first session of this Congress, then it is Tom \nDaschle's fault.\n  I believe that is quite clear. I think that is plain and I think that \nis simple and I think he has said it just that way when he has said \nthat he will craft a bill and bring it to the floor under the\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\nleadership prerogative. Comprehensive, balanced energy legislation can \nbe added by the majority leader to the Senate calendar for potential \naction prior to adjournment: so speaketh the leader of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am going to support my leader. But I am going to \ninsist, as all other colleagues will, or at least many will, that he \nact and that he act in a timely fashion so it can be conferenced with \nthe House and put on the President's desk. It is an issue of national \nsecurity. It is every bit as critical as an airport security bill--and \nthe ranking member of the Commerce Committee is on the floor now trying \nto get that bill up. It is every bit as important as an antiterrorist \nbill.\n  If we get into a greater warlike problem in the Middle East and our \nflow of oil is cut off from the Arab nations, from Iraq--believe it or \nnot--from Iran, from which we are now getting oil, and if we do not \nhave a national energy policy that begins to move us toward a higher \ndegree of national energy independence, then shame on us but, more \nimportant, shame on the majority leader of the Senate, who has chosen \nto take away from the authorizing committee the authority to craft a \nbill and bring it to the floor, if the majority leader himself does not \nhonor the commitment he has now made to us, that he will divine--define \nand maybe divine--a balanced energy policy and bring it to the floor \nfor a vote. That is an obligation that the Senate of the United States \nshould deal with before we adjourn or before we recess this first \nsession of this Congress.\n  I recognize the importance of this issue, as do many of our \ncolleagues. I am phenomenally disappointed in the form of leadership \nthat says we cannot let our committees work in this instance because \nthis is not something new, as I said. We have been at the business of \ntrying to write a bill for 3\\1/2\\ years. We have held 25 or 30 hearings \non it. It is not a new issue, but it is a timely, critical issue to our \ncountry. I hope the statements of the majority leader represent the \nclear intention of bringing the bill to the floor within the next \nseveral weeks, that we can deal with it and move it off to conference \nand have a national energy policy on our President's desk by close of \nbusiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, can you tell me the parliamentary \nsituation as it exists presently?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the motion to proceed to S. \n1447, under cloture.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time remains on the 30 hours of postcloture \ndebate of which there has been none that I have seen?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time will expire at 4:57 this afternoon.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If there is no one on the floor to engage in postcloture \ndebate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will put the question on the motion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10407-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10407-S10412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AVIATION SECURITY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are now engaged in so-called \npostcloture debate of 30 hours. I have not paid total attention to what \nis going on on the floor of the Senate, but clearly there has been no \ndebate on postcloture on the Aviation Security Act. This is rapidly \nturning into a farce. We need to act. We need to act on aviation \nsecurity. If there are differences of opinion, such as those held by \nthe Senator from Idaho about federalization, let's have debates and \nvotes.\n  If there is consideration of nongermane amendments, then let's have \nthose debated and voted on as well. The chairman of the committee, \nSenator Hollings, and I have agreed to oppose all nongermane \namendments. But for us to sit here for 30 hours in so-called \npostcloture debate--yesterday there was a near tragedy because of a \nderanged individual who broke into a cockpit of an airplane nearly \ncausing another catastrophe. Part of this legislation, S. 1477, \nrequires the Department of Transportation to take steps to strengthen \ncockpit doors.\n  There is another case in my own home State where some individual \nobviously smuggled in a weapon which caused the shutdown of the Phoenix \nairport for some 10 hours. The list goes on.\n  I don't agree with the statement that was made by the administration \nthat there was a 100 percent chance of retaliation because of our \nmilitary actions in Afghanistan. I don't agree with that statement, \nalthough I will admit that I don't have the knowledge of the members of \nthe administration who made that statement. But here we are now going \ninto our second week without addressing the issue of aviation security.\n  No, I don't agree with the Senator from Idaho that an energy bill is \nof the same emergency as the Aviation Security Act right now. No \nrational observer that I know of would agree with that statement. The \nfact is we need to act. We don't have to wait until 4:57 this \nafternoon. We should be debating, amending, and passing this \nlegislation before we go out of session this weekend. I am embarrassed \nthat both sides of the aisle for reasons less than national security \nare not agreeing to take up and pass this legislation.\n  I don't think the American people, who have been very pleased with \nour performance up until now, are very pleased. In fact, they are very \ndispleased with our failure to take up this legislation in a normal \nparliamentary fashion--debate, vote, and give the American people what \nthey don't have today; that is, the sense that a lot of Americans don't \nhave today, that they can get on an airliner with comparative safety \nand security.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop what we have been doing for the last 2 \nweeks, get on with moving this legislation, and perform our duties for \nthe American people, for the men and women right now who are in harm's \nway performing their duties for the American people. It seems to me it \nwouldn't be a great deal to ask us to move on this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield to the distinguished majority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, every time I hear the Senator from Arizona \nspeaking, I think of pilots taking off from aircraft carriers and \ntaking off from military bases around the country and, as we know, \nspecial forces--I believe I know--certainly nothing confidential has \nbeen told to me; I figured it out on my own. We have special operations \npeople there doing all kinds of things. It is extremely dangerous. \nThere is no one in the Senate who has more personal information about \nwar than the Senator from Arizona. I personally appreciate, speaking \nfor the people of the State of Nevada, his passion for this \nlegislation.\n  There is no perfect legislation. The legislation before us is \nimperfect. The Senator from Arizona and Senator Hollings worked and \ncame up with what they thought could pass this Senate.\n  Will the Senator agree that this legislation--no matter how anyone \nfeels about it--should at least be able to get consideration?\n  There was a motion to invoke cloture which was filed 1 week ago. As I \nsaid earlier today, we may disagree with this legislation, but let's \nget it here and get it completed. The people of Nevada and the people \nof the rest of this country want this passed.\n  I say this to my friend from Arizona. There are important things we \nshould do, but shouldn't airport security be one of them?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think so. It is obvious. I understand the day before \nyesterday on Wall Street there was a meeting between the Speaker of the \nHouse, the Democrat leader in the House, 20 business and economic and \nlabor leaders, and Alan Greenspan. Their message was, pass the aviation \nsecurity bill so confidence will be restored on the part of the \nAmerican people so we can have an economic recovery. On other side of \nthe Capitol, they refuse to take up the issue. On this side of the \nCapitol, for nearly 2 weeks we have failed to have one moment of debate \non this issue, and no amendment has been proposed. I just find that, \nfrankly, incomprehensible.\n  I am not really renowned for my patience, but I believe I have shown \na lot of patience. I believe that Senator Hollings, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, has also gone through these machinations \ntrying to work out agreements. I must have had 100 meetings on this \nissue. We had the idea of taking up the antiterrorism bill first and \nthen moving to this legislation. We\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\nthought everybody had an agreement. Then there was one Member on the \nother side who insisted on amendments. We thought we could get it up \nwith perhaps an agreement that all Members would vote against \nnongermane amendments. That doesn't seem to have worked.\n  I have literally exhausted almost every option. Our meetings with the \nWhite House have been fruitless. I have not been around here--in fact, \nthe Senator from Nevada and I have been around here the same number of \nyears. I have never had the White House cancel two meetings in 1 day \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the committees--two in 1 day.\n  Here we are telling the American people that we are working together \nand we are dedicated to the proposition that we will take whatever \nmeasures are necessary in a bipartisan fashion to assure their security \nand safety, both home and overseas. There is no expert who doesn't \nbelieve we need to act on the issue of airport and airline security. \nHere we are nearing the end of our second week mired in such a \nsituation on which we have made no progress.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I ask one more question of my friend?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. To indicate the patience and integrity of the Senator from \nArizona, he could have moved forward on this legislation. But because \nof his patience--and most of us wouldn't want to do anything that \nsomebody might object to--he acknowledged when he came to this floor \nthat he could have moved forward on this legislation. I know the \nSenator from Arizona stands for what is good about this country, having \ndevoted a large part of his life in a prison camp for American \ncitizens. If we can't hear him speaking, then we can't hear anybody.\n  We have to move forward on this legislation. As I have said privately \nto the Senator from Arizona--and I say now publicly--what he is saying \nis absolutely full of veracity. One only needs to look at who is saying \nit to understand that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield to the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona knows that he and \nI are not too far apart on the issue on which he is speaking. I had \nhoped we would come to the floor this week and deal with two critical \nnational issues: Airport security and antiterrorism. I think we were \nvery close to being ready to do that. I had hoped we could deal with \nthem cleanly and up front--airport security and terrorism issues.\n\n  Generally, I have supported the Senator from Arizona on this issue, \nand continue to do so, and will work with him. I did not come to this \nChamber today to suggest a national energy policy go in front of this. \nI suggest we do airport security, and we ought to be doing it right now \nin this Chamber. The Senator ought to be down there at the lead desk on \nthis issue carrying the debate on this side, but he is not being \nallowed to do so. And it is not his fault; that is very clear.\n  But what I am suggesting is that in the next month that this Congress \nwill be in session, instead of sitting here marking a clock, with the \nlights on, the staff engaged, and nothing happening, we ought to also \nbe debating and voting up or down on a national energy policy. I \nbelieve it is of high priority. Is it as high as airport security in \nthe current blend of things? No, it isn't.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona. We have to get the confidence \nbuilt back in the American people on airport activity and security on \nairplanes, and get them flying now for the long-term economy, but also \ninto the holiday season. It is critical for our airlines and their \neconomic stability, no question about it. We need to give our Attorney \nGeneral, and others in law enforcement, greater tools to track the \nterrorists, to track the criminals. And that is ready to go now.\n  I do not understand why we were not able to switch over and double \ntrack. The Senator from Arizona agreed to that. But that is not the \ncall of the minority; that is the call of the majority. They have not \nlet us do that or we could be dealing with both of those critical \nbills--get at least one of them done this week. The clock is now \nrunning out. Having been able to do both of them--as we should have \ndone--there would be ample time to do a national energy policy bill, to \nengage for 2 or 3 days on the floor, if need be, in the debate of that \nissue, because I have to think when you scratch the surface of all of \nthese, you get to the bottom line: Airplanes do not fly without fuel; \npeople do not get to the airports without it; our ships that are at sea \nat the moment, and our pilots who are flying those aircraft off those \ndecks, work with a huge chunk of energy underneath them. We all know \nthat. That is my point.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona. It is not a matter of shoving \nin to the front; it is a matter of this Senate being capable of dealing \nwith all three of these issues in a timely fashion. That was the point \nI wanted to make to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  I appreciate his passion on this very important issue to our national \nsecurity. But since it appears that everybody is in agreement that we \nneed to move forward on this legislation--and there has been no debate \nthat I know of on the specific issue of airport security in the \npostcloture mode, and I see no reason we should waste the entire \nafternoon in a postcloture parliamentary situation and yet not debating \nthe issue--I tell our leadership on both sides of the aisle, I intend \nto come, after lunch, in the early afternoon, and move to proceed to S. \n1447. That way, we will not have wasted another entire day. I hope \nthere will be no objection at that time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just so everyone understands, my friend from \nIdaho talks about the need to move forward on airport security. Let us \nmove forward. There is no one preventing us from moving forward on this \nside of the aisle. We want to move forward. We have been trying, for a \nweek, to get to this bill, but we are having to jump over all kinds of \nhurdles.\n  We invoked cloture with a vote of 97-0 yesterday. And they--the \nminority--have said, OK, we are going to use the whole 30 hours \npostcloture. We have been stymied. We have tried to move to other \nthings. They will not let us.\n  Last week, we tried to move to a matter dealing with appropriations. \nWe have Agriculture appropriations we tried to get to. No thanks. We \ntried to get to foreign operations. No thanks. Why? Because of some \nunrelated issue. That unrelated issue is that we are not moving enough \njudges for them.\n  The people at home in Nebraska or in Nevada, I bet they are not \ncoming to you, I say to the Presiding Officer, asking: How many judges \nis the Senate moving this week? They are concerned about the ability to \nfly out of Omaha to Las Vegas and back. That is what they are concerned \nabout.\n  We want to move forward on airport security. We are not stopping \nanyone from moving forward to airport security. We should have been on \nthat last Wednesday. Here it is a week later, and we are still not on \nit. We are postcloture on the motion to proceed to airport security.\n  What are the problems with airport security? There are some people \nwho believe we should get rid of minimum-wage people checking bags, and \ndoing other things, to make these airplanes safe; that there should be \nsome standards; that it should not go to the lowest bidder, as now \nhappens; that we should add, in addition to the hundreds of thousands \nof other Federal employees we have, about 28,000 employees who would \nhave the stamp of approval of the Department of Energy or the Justice \nDepartment--it really does not matter who it is--one Federal agency \nthat oversees them. That is one problem on which they will not let us \nmove forward.\n  Maybe they can say that is wrong. Have a debate in this Chamber for \nan hour or so, vote up or down on it, and determine whether they should \nbe federalized or not. That is how things work around here. But they \nwill not let us move to it. They will not let us have a debate on \nwhether they should be federalized or not.\n  Another issue they are concerned about is whether we should have a \nvote on Amtrak safety and security--not putting rubber tires on Amtrak \ntrains or putting monitors in all the trains so\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\nthat you can listen to nice music, no; just so that when you travel on \nan Amtrak train, you can be safe. Let's have a debate on that: Yes, you \nwant it; no, you don't. They will not even let us talk about it.\n  The other issue is whether the employees who were displaced as a \nresult of the terrorist acts are entitled to extended unemployment \nbenefits. That does not sound too outrageous to me. And if it is, let's \ndebate it and vote it up or down.\n  So that is the big hangup on airport security, those three issues.\n  Everyone would feel better if we passed this legislation. It would \ndetermine how airports would be handled. There would be a Federal rule \nthat everyone could see, not a hit-or-miss proposition.\n\n  My friend from Idaho is the second person to come to this Chamber and \ntalk about the need to do energy legislation. And the words were: And \nshame on Tom Daschle if it doesn't pass. That is a good reversal role. \nSenator Daschle is here every day trying to move legislation. Although \nthey do not like to acknowledge it, he is the majority leader of the \nSenate, and he feels an obligation to do some of the things our country \nrequires, such as pass the 13 annual appropriations bills. He has this \nwild idea--Senator Daschle--that you should pass the 13 appropriations \nbills. They will not let us move to those bills. We have five that have \nnot passed.\n  They are not going to let us move. Why? Because you are not moving \nenough circuit judges. We have listed all the people we have in the \npipeline who will move, hearings will be held, the votes will be taken \nhere. But that is not good enough. Senator Leahy has worked weekends on \nterrorism, helped with airport security, and many other things prior to \nthis legislation. He set times for hearings for judges. But that is not \ngood enough.\n  So we do not need lectures in this Chamber about what Tom Daschle \nisn't doing. He is doing everything humanly possible to move the agenda \nof the Senate forward, and we are being prevented from doing so.\n  We believe that energy policy is important, critically important. I \nbelieve we should become less dependent on fossil fuel. That should be \npart of an energy bill. We need to develop exploration in this country. \nWe need to become less dependent on foreign oil. There is no question \nabout that. We need to move quickly into more solar, more wind, and \nmore geothermal, alternative energy sources.\n  I believe we need to have an energy policy in this country. Senator \nDaschle believes that. And if we are able to get these emergency \nmatters out of the away, we are going to move to another vitally \nimportant thing. That is energy policy.\n  We always hear these speeches about the need for ANWR. There was a \nhearing last week during which one of the experts was asked a question \nthat the person who asked it probably wishes he hadn't. The question \nwas: How long would it take to start bringing oil out of ANWR? The \nanswer: About 10 years.\n  We know the quantity of oil is very limited. Somehow in their minds, \nthis drilling in the pristine wilderness of Alaska is going to solve \nall the world's problems, when we know if we pumped all the oil that is \nthere now, it would be a 6-month supply for the United States.\n  There are a number of other problems we have with ANWR. Just last \nweek, a person with a rifle decided to use the pipeline as a target. He \nshot some holes in the pipeline. By the time they figured out what was \nhappening, 250,000 gallons of oil had dumped out on the Alaskan tundra. \nThat is a very long pipeline. It goes hundreds of miles. I am not sure \nwe need more pipeline in this pristine wilderness.\n  My friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho, stated that \nthis situation in Alaska would solve lots of the problems of the world. \nIt wouldn't solve many problems at all. We know there are lots of \nenergy problems in the world today. They will not be solved by this \nsituation in Alaska.\n  There are so many things we need to do, and we need to get to that \nlegislation. We need help from the minority to get to that legislation. \nThey are not letting us move forward on legislation that has to be \ndone.\n  The first conference they have allowed us to do on an appropriations \nbill is going to take place this afternoon. I am fortunate enough to be \non that conference. At 2:30 p.m. today, there will be a Senate-House \nconference on appropriations for Interior. I hope we do that. That will \nbe the first of 13 appropriations bills we have been able to finish. \nBut they won't let us move on the five that haven't even passed the \nSenate.\n  Using words such as ``shame on Tom Daschle'' isn't senatorial. It is \nan unfortunate choice of words. Senator Daschle understands the \nimportance. I have been in meetings with him just this week, and with \nSenator Bingaman, talking about how important it is to move this \nlegislation. We need to move the legislation. We just need a little \nhelp to do it. We have not received the help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I listened with some interest to my \ncolleague from Nevada and previously my colleagues from Arizona and \nIdaho in their presentations. I compliment my friend from Nevada. Let \nme also say how much I admire the Senator from Arizona who came to the \nfloor about 20 minutes ago and asked the question: Why are we not \nmoving? Why is the Senate not doing its work on the issue of aviation \nsecurity? He, of course, knew the answer and answered it himself. We \nare held up by people who believe somehow that this is not an \nemergency, this is not a priority, and that there are other issues more \nimportant. So they hold the Senate up.\n  It has been that way now for nearly 2 weeks. We don't vote, we have \nno debate on the floor, and now we have a colleague today who comes to \nthe Chamber and decides the problem is the majority leader, Senator \nDaschle. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The problem is we have a handful of people in the Senate who are \nintent on serving as human brake pads to stop this place dead in its \ntracks. They have succeeded. While the country is worried about the \nemergency situation that exists as a result of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks, as a result of an economy that clearly has serious \nproblems, the Senate stands at parade rest. Why? Because a handful of \npeople in the Senate have decided we should not move forward on the \nissue of aviation security.\n  It is the easiest thing in the world to take the negative side of \nanything. All of us understand that. This bill, authored by Senator \nHollings and Senator McCain--and I am proud to be a cosponsor of it \nfrom the Commerce Committee--deals with aviation security, a whole \nrange of issues: The creation of a large cadre of armed sky marshals to \nput in American commercial airliners; the development of perimeter \nsecurity at America's airports; the hardening of cockpits on commercial \nairliners; and the change in the method of screening luggage and people \nat airports. All of these things are important. There is much more in \nthis legislation as well. That is the positive side of what we are \ntrying to do on an emergency basis.\n  There are some who have held it up, and continue to hold it up even \nnow. I am reminded of Mark Twain, who I have mentioned before. When \nasked one day to get involved in a debate, he said: Of course, as long \nas I can take the negative side.\n  They said: Well, we have not told you what the subject is.\n  He said: It doesn't matter. It doesn't take any preparation to take \nthe negative side.\n  That is the case in the Congress as well. It takes no preparation to \ncome here and be opposed to almost everything. It takes no skill to be \nopposed to everything. We have a few folks in my hometown like that. I \ngrew up in a county of 3,400 people. We have several of them who have \nopposed everything, all along the way, all the time. This Senate is a \nlot like my hometown, regrettably. The problem is in the Senate a \ncouple of determined people can stop things.\n  In this country we face real emergencies at this point. Our economy \nis in serious trouble. Commercial airline service is integral to an \neconomy and its recovery. Going into September 11 and the tragic acts \nof terror committed against this country, we had a very\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\nsoft economy. The economy was in trouble even then. One of the leading \neconomic indicators of the economy is airline travel because it is one \nof the first places people and businesses cut back.\n\n  All of our major airline carriers were hemorrhaging in red ink on \nSeptember 10 going into the September 11 terrorist attacks. On \nSeptember 11, the Federal Government ordered all commercial aircraft--\nin fact, all aircraft in this country--to land immediately, and they \nwere grounded. That industry was forced to stay on the ground. There \nwere no airplanes in the sky anywhere.\n  So this is an industry already hemorrhaging in red ink that was \nforced to suspend all operations. Then the FAA, under certain \ncircumstances, allowed the restoration of commercial airline flights. \nWhat the airlines are discovering is that there are people in this \ncountry who have canceled events, conferences, trips, and vacations \nbecause there is concern about getting back on an airplane.\n  I understand that concern. I flew last weekend to North Dakota, and I \nhad also flown the weekend before to North Dakota. But I understand \nthat people are concerned about getting back on an airplane. They and \nevery American saw over and over and over and over again those images \nof the 767 commercial airliners being flown into the World Trade Center \nTowers. That is an image most people will not soon forget. So people \nwere concerned and leery about going back to commercial air travel.\n  This Congress, therefore, must act if it is going to try to restore \nsome health to this economy and give a jump start back to commercial \nair travel. To do so, this Congress has to put together legislation \ndealing with aviation security and airline security. That is what we \nhave tried to do. Senator Hollings and Senator McCain, Senator Kerry, \nmyself, and others, have worked on a piece of legislation that makes \ngood sense. We brought it to the floor understanding that this is an \nemergency, that this is urgent legislation that needs to get done. And \nguess what. This Senate is brought to parade rest. Nobody is doing \nanything and nothing happening because we have a couple of people who \nsay: We won't let anything else continue.\n  You know, we have some people who are crabby about some amendments. \nMy theory is, in a situation like this, if you have some amendments you \ndon't like, stand up and oppose them. If you have some you want to \noffer, stand up and propose them. Let the Senate vote. Let the Senate \nmake a decision. Do you have good ideas or not? If you don't, tough \nluck. But don't hold up the Senate and hold up this issue of an urgent \nneed to pass an aviation security bill just because you are a little \ncranky and have stayed cranky for a couple of weeks. You put the \ncountry at risk by doing that.\n  Now, my friend from Idaho is in the Chamber. He and I have worked \nclosely together. I admire his work. I fundamentally disagree with what \nhe did this morning. He is upset with something Senator Daschle has \ndone with respect to an energy bill. Frankly, that energy bill, as \nSenator McCain said, is separate and distinct from the aviation \nsecurity bill. We are going to do an energy bill, and we ought to, but \nthe energy bill is going to come together from several sources in the \nSenate. It is going to come to the floor and we are going to have an \nopportunity to offer amendments and discuss it. I don't disagree with \nthe notion that central to this country's security is an energy policy. \nWe haven't had an energy policy, under Democratic or Republican \nadministrations, for 30 or 40 years that has meant very much to this \ncountry. We need to produce more and find more oil and natural gas. We \nneed to conserve more and, yes, we need to find renewables and a \nlimitless supply of energy, to expand our supply. We need to do all of \nthat, and we need to do it soon.\n  Let me just say this with respect to security: Security, it seems to \nme, starts at this moment on the floor of the Senate with passing an \naviation security bill. That is where it starts. We will work on a \npiece of legislation dealing with energy policy. We should do that and \nthat also is urgent. But that ought not hold up an aviation security \nbill. It should not hold this up. We have a responsibility at this \npoint not to go back to business as usual. Business as usual in the \nSenate is to have two or three or four or five people hold up the work \nof the entire Senate. That didn't mean very much under most \ncircumstances because we didn't have a situation that was urgent --not \nwith most pieces of legislation. But if you don't think post-September \n11 and the challenges we have to the American economy and the \nchallenges we have in air travel and with respect to providing security \nfor this country at home and abroad--if you don't believe that is an \nurgent situation, somehow you have slept through the last month.\n  This country faces an urgent need to do a series of things --\nimportant things--that will strengthen its future. Central to those at \nthis moment is a piece of legislation dealing with aviation security. \nIt is past the time--long past the time--when this Senate should have \nbeen debating that and voting on it. It simply makes no sense to have a \ncouple of people holding up the Senate because they got out of bed on \nthe wrong side and have a permanent case of ill temper on things about \nwhich they are concerned. As a result, they hold up the rest of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If Senator Dorgan isn't cranky, and I am not cranky, \nwherein lies the problem? He and I agree on the importance of airport \nsecurity. We ought to be debating it right now, right here in this \nChamber. Are there some disagreements? Yes, there are some \ndisagreements. Are they big? To some, they are. I don't happen to \ndisagree with all of them. The Senate is working its will, and the \nleader from the other side who is speaking on the floor right now is \ndoing what he ought to be doing. But he also knows how the Senate \nworks.\n\n  At this very moment, we are very close to coming to the floor now \nwith an agreement that cleans up and allows us to focus on airport \nsecurity. I hope it is sooner rather than later.\n  The American people deserve an airport security bill. But what I was \nsaying on the floor a few moments ago--quoting from the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee on which the Senator serves--he no longer can craft a \nbill. He has been disallowed by your leadership from doing so. He is \ngoing to, therefore, submit a bill to the majority leader and the \nmajority leader is going to bring it to the floor for our \nconsideration.\n  What I said on the floor--and I will repeat it--is this: Please do \nthat. Bring that bill to the floor, and sooner rather than later. I \nwill say that it is no longer the responsibility of the chairman of the \ncommittee. I serve on that committee along with the Senator from North \nDakota. We know that.\n  The majority leader has spoken. The burden is on the majority leader \nto get an energy bill to the floor. I believe it is third in the line \nof actions that should be taken up on the floor. Airport security ought \nto be done right now. I hope we can do it this week and also do the \nantiterrorist bill this week. The Senator and I are in total agreement \non that. I hope we sort this out sooner rather than later. But once \nthose two bills are done, my guess is that I will be on the floor every \nday saying: Majority Leader Daschle, where is your energy bill? Where \nis your energy bill? You have taken the authority away from the \ncommittee. If you are going to produce a bill, do it, and we will \ndebate it. Agree to get it to the floor with a couple of amendments on \neither side, or with no amendments, and then get it to conference, get \nthe conferees appointed so we can get a bill on the President's desk. I \nbelieve and the public believes if we get into a shooting war in the \nMiddle East and we sever our ties to our dependency on Middle East oil, \nwe send this economy into another tailspin that should be avoidable, \nbut it is not. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand the point the Senator made. I say this: The \nburden that might exist on anybody in this Senate--and especially a \nmajority leader of the Senate--is a burden to get the work of the \nSenate done. We can't do the aviation security bill because we have a \ncouple of people holding it up in the Senate. Why? Because they don't \nagree with some things. They have decided aviation security isn't \nurgent for this country. They could not be more wrong. The burden of \nthe Senate is to\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\npass appropriations bills. We have appropriations bills--in fact, we \nhave more than a half dozen--I believe nine of them--some of which have \nyet to come to the floor of the Senate to be passed. In fact, very few \nappropriations bills have been completed at all.\n  The appropriation subcommittee that I chair had the conferees \nappointed this week from the House on a bill they passed in June. Think \nof that. Months and months of stalling, not even appointing conferees \nto an appropriations bill.\n  The point is that the majority leader can't bring an appropriations \nbill to the floor of the Senate. You want to know why? These are bills \nthat were supposed to have been done by October 1--through the House \nand the Senate. They are not done and he can't bring them to the floor \nbecause we have the same few people who object, object, object, and \nthen say to me that the majority leader has a burden.\n\n  I will tell you what the burden is. The burden is these objectors who \nsit on our shoulders all day long and won't let this Senate do its \nbusiness. We ought to be doing the things that are important at this \npoint and saying to the American people that the Senate understands \nthis situation is urgent in America, that security is an urgent \nsituation, that the threat of terrorism is something we should respond \nto with great urgency.\n  Our economy is in an urgent situation. We need to work together to do \nsomething about that. But to have this Senate essentially stop in its \ntracks for 2 weeks is almost unforgivable. I don't handle well people \ntelling me what the burden of the majority leader is. The burden of the \nmajority leader is to get this Senate to get its business done. We have \nfour, five people thumbing their suspenders and saying: No, I object to \neverything. Well, take your suspenders outside the Chamber, in my \njudgment, and let's do the work the American people want us to do.\n  Aviation security is job No. 1. Senator McCain talked about the need \nto get to this bill. He will be here at 2 o'clock. When he comes to the \nfloor, I am going to be here as well. When he asks unanimous consent to \ngo to the bill, I want to support him. It is unforgivable that hour \nafter hour and day after day this Senate is not doing the business it \nis intended to do. People talk about the burden of the majority leader. \nThe majority leader has too large a burden, in my judgment, with \nrespect to a few folks who want to hold the Senate up. We know what we \nought to do. Let's do it. For those who don't agree--and there are \nthree or four who have deep disagreement with the issue of screening at \nairports, the screening of luggage--the screening of luggage. If you \ndisagree with that, then offer an amendment. If you win, good for you. \nYou will not, in my judgment, but if you do, fine. Why hold up the \nSenate and prevent us from passing a bill that is so urgent? It does \nnot make any sense to me.\n\n  This really is business as usual, regrettably, at a time when the \nlast thing America needs is business as usual from the Senate. They \nneed a Senate that is engaged and that has its priorities straight and \nin which everybody steps back a bit, takes a deep breath, and says: We \nare part of the same team. There is now just us and them. There are the \nterrorists and the rest of us. The rest of us are trying to do what we \ncan to respond to these heinous acts of mass murder. That is our \nresponsibility.\n  I remember a story about a person who opened a small retail business \non a small Main Street. He had a large glass fish tank installed in the \nfront window for his grand opening. He put out a huge sign that said: \nThis fish tank contains 63 invisible Peruvian man-eating fish. Crowds \ngathered on Main Street to look at this fish tank. Of course, there was \nnothing in it, just a sign about invisible fish.\n  We could perhaps have a sign in the Senate, not about fish, but about \ninvisibility. We are doing nothing. In a time of great national \nconcern, in a time of national emergency, in a time when there are \nurgent requirements and needs for us to do the right thing, this Senate \nis doing nothing.\n  It is not the majority leader's fault. The majority leader has a \nplan. He has an aviation security bill. He has a national security \nbill. It is not his fault. It is the fault of two, three, four, or five \nMembers of the Senate who decided for their own reasons they want to \nshut this place down for a while. What an awful signal to send to the \nrest of the world.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Our friend from Idaho stated the airport security bill is \nNo. 1, terrorism is No. 2, and energy is No. 3. I say to my friend from \nNorth Dakota in the form of a question, doesn't the Senator believe we \nhave an obligation to do what is required, and that is pass \nappropriations bills?\n  Mr. DORGAN. In response, I say, absolutely. In fact, our colleague \nfrom Idaho is on the Appropriations Committee. The first thing you have \nto do is appropriate the money for the agencies--the FBI, the CIA, the \nNational Security Agency, all the law enforcement functions--and then \nall of the other functions of the Federal Government. We have to pass \nthe appropriations bills.\n  We are now operating under a continuing appropriations bill because \nwe in Congress did not get our work done by October 1. It is not as if \nwe are not trying. Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, the chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee, are pushing very hard, \nand we cannot get the appropriations bills to the floor of the Senate.\n  Do my colleagues know why? Because there is an objection to a motion \nto proceed to an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator know the reason for the objections \nsupposedly?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The objections have nothing to do with appropriations. \nThe objections, as I understand it--there are several different \nobjections to different bills around here; it is one of those pick-\nyour-flavor objections to people who professionally object. As I \nunderstand, they do not want appropriations bills to move forward \nbecause they are concerned about nominations.\n  Mr. REID. About judges.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, nominations of judges. My understanding--the Senator \nfrom Nevada might correct me--my understanding is it has taken a \nsubstantial amount of time for the administration to move judges to the \nCongress for consideration. I believe something like 25 or 29 of them \ncame just the first part of August. They are now going through the \nhearing process.\n  With respect to judges, as far as I am concerned--and I hope every \none of my colleagues feels the same way--let's get judges moving; let's \nget all the appointments and confirmations moving. As far as I am \nconcerned, the same burden rests on myself. If I object to someone, \nbring them out and I will vote against them.\n  By and large, I think most of these nominations are pretty good \nnominations, but I do not think anybody is trying to hold these up. \nWhat has happened is it has taken a great deal of time to get names \nhere, and now the Judiciary Committee is sifting through them to get \nthe hearings in place. The fact we are not even allowed to go to \nappropriations bills has nothing to do with appropriations; it has to \ndo with some other issue.\n  Mr. REID. May I ask another question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. On the Senator's trips back home--and I know he was home \nthis past weekend--has anybody come up and asked the Senator about how \nthe judges were coming in Washington?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, I say in response to Senator Reid, most people are \nconcerned at this moment about the Senate moving very quickly with some \nurgency to deal with situations such as aviation security, to deal with \nthe issues of national security and international security responding \nto terrorism, the antiterrorism bill. Most people are concerned about \nthat.\n\n  Obviously, the lingering effects of the September 11 terrorist acts \nwill probably last forever, and it means people are very concerned \nabout this country's response to those specific threats.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, our friend from Idaho listed 1, 2, 3, \nhis priorities. In listing the priorities of the people from the State \nof North Dakota, where does the Senator think our moving judges through \nthis system would list in ranking? Does the Senator think they would be \nin the top 100?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Probably the top 100. Moving judges is just something we\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\nshould do. It is not a case that we are not moving judges. That is, in \nmy judgment, a false charge.\n  If we are talking about what are the priorities, what is the urgency \ntoday on Wednesday, first, as Senator McCain said, the urgency is an \naviation security bill; second is an antiterrorism bill that has been \nworked on and largely agreed to; and third, we ought to finish the \nappropriations bills. We have a responsibility to do that.\n  The Senator from Idaho is not wrong about energy being a significant \nissue. It is an issue. I agree with that. I talked today about the \ncommercial airlines and their component part of this economy and their \nimportant part of this economy. So, too, is energy. We will not have \nany economy without energy.\n  I do not disagree with the notion that energy is a significant issue. \nI would not necessarily say Senator Daschle has the burden of making it \nthird. We have to do the appropriations bills before we do the energy \nbill. If we can get rid of a few of the objections, we can move these \nthings quickly. There is no reason we should not pass an aviation \nsecurity bill and send it to the President by tomorrow night. We can \npass it today and resolve our differences with the House and move it to \nthe President. There is no reason we cannot do that for this country. \nWe should do that.\n  The antiterrorism bill I think is about completed. There is no reason \nwe cannot do that as well. What a great signal to the American people.\n  The interesting thing is--and the Senator from Nevada asked me about \nwhat I heard back home--what I heard all weekend in North Dakota was \nhow pleased people were that finally the pettiness seems to be gone \nfrom the politics in this country, and good riddance. Finally, people \nare working together. Finally, it is not so much that you are a \nDemocrat or a Republican. It is not that there is a my side and a your \nside, it is just that there is an our side. There is only one side in \nthis country, and that is the side that all of us choose to stand on in \nthe fight against terrorism. There is only one side, and it is our \nside.\n  That is why I hope that at 2 o'clock this afternoon when Senator \nMcCain comes to the floor with this bipartisan bill on aviation \nsecurity, that this is something we can clear, move to the floor, offer \namendments, and get it done for our side.\n  Again, it is not Republicans and Democrats. Senator McCain is a \nRepublican. Senator Hollings is a Democrat. They have worked together, \nI have worked with them and others to put this bill together. This bill \nrepresents a response by our side, the American response to an \nemergency, to an urgent situation. I hope we can avoid the kind of \ndifficulty we have been seeing in recent days.\n  I ask those who put us in this position of being, as I said, at \nparade rest day after day when there are so many urgent things to do to \nrethink that. I can think of several things that make me a bit upset \nabout this body and probably object to one thing or another. I do not \nintend to do that.\n  I had an amendment on a bill in the subcommittee I chair. When I \nbrought my subcommittee bill to the floor, I had an amendment that was \nvery important to me and very controversial. I was fully intending to \npush that amendment and have a big debate and a vote on it. Then \nSeptember 11 happened, and I brought the bill to the floor after \nSeptember 11 and said: I do not think it is in the country's interest \nfor me to push this very controversial amendment.\n  Although it means a lot to me and it is very important to me, I am \nnot going to do it because I do not think that is the way we ought to \nsend signals to the American people about who we are and what we are \ndoing at this point.\n  I ask others, especially those who have held up the work of the \nSenate for now about 2 weeks on this issue, think along the same lines \nand see if we cannot come to some understanding of the urgency of \npassing an aviation security bill.\n  We on the Commerce Committee spent a lot of time working on these \nissues. The leadership of both Senator Hollings and Senator McCain has \nproduced excellent legislation, legislation that will provide real \nsecurity to commercial airlines and to those who fly in this country, \nand I hope we are able to do that soon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10412-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10412-S10413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE VALUE OF THE FAMILY FARM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I actually came to this Chamber to talk \nabout something else, which I want to do now for about 3 or 4 minutes. \nBut, I was inspired by my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, who \nwas talking about the urgency of the aviation security bill and wanted \nto comment first about that.\n  I want to speak for a moment about another priority. When I was \ntalking with the Senator from Idaho about priorities, let me describe \nanother one that ranks right near the top, in my judgment. As soon as \nwe finish the legislation dealing with aviation security, the \nantiterrorism bill, and the appropriations bills, we need in this \nCongress to turn to the farm bill. If one does not come from farm \ncountry, they may not understand the need for a farm bill, but let me \ndescribe the urgency of this Congress passing a decent bill that gives \nfamily farmers a chance to make a living.\n  We have been living with a farm bill called the Freedom to Farm Act, \nwhich has been a terrible failure for family farmers. It literally has \npulled the rug out from under family farmers in our country.\n  Last Friday, the House of Representatives passed a new farm bill, and \ngood for them. The bill that was passed by the House of Representatives \nis better than the current farm bill that is now in place. We can make \nit even better. It shortchanges wheat and barley, for example, on loan \nrates, and there are some things that I would change.\n  I say this: The bill the House of Representatives passed is better \nthan the current farm bill. Now the Senate has an obligation to take up \na farm bill and pass it before we finish our work this year. We must do \nthat. We do not have the choice. If we do not pass a new farm bill this \nyear and accept the challenge with the House having passed its bill, we \nwill shortchange American farmers in a significant way. There are many \nfamilies hanging on by their financial fingertips wondering whether \nthey are going to be around to plant the crop next spring. I hope this \nCongress will say to them that family farmers matter to this country, \nthey strengthen this country, and we are going to give them a farm bill \nthat provides countercyclical help when prices collapse so they can \nstay around and be part of our country's future.\n  Now why is that important? Two reasons. One reason is one I have \ntalked about a long time in this Chamber, and that is from both an \neconomic and social standpoint, family farms are important to this \ncountry's character and its future. Family values have always rolled \nfrom family farms to small towns to big cities, nurturing and \nrefreshing the value system in our country. Having a network of family \nfarm producers producing our food in this country produces more than \nfood. It produces communities, it produces a lifestyle, it produces \ncharacter in rural America that adds to this country and who we are and \nwhat we are.\n  Even more than that, if one does not care about that--and I do \ndeeply--we could have, perhaps, a country in which we farm from \nCalifornia to Maine with giant agrifactories in which no one lives out \non the land. It is just a bunch of corporate bookkeepers. That, in my \njudgment, erodes and detracts from the culture that has helped make \nAmerica great. So even if one does not care about family farming--and I \ndo very deeply--even if one believes that agrifactories are the way of \nthe future--and I really disagree with that--from a national security \nstandpoint it makes good sense to have wide dispersal of \nfood production in America.\n\n  There was a report the other night on a national television program \ntalking about feedlots that feed 200,000 head of\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\ncattle. This report talked about the real possibility of the \nintroduction of bioterrorism through the food supply in concentrations \nof agriculture production of that size. It is true. How difficult would \nit be, however, to do that to a food production system which you have a \nwide network of family farms on America's land producing America's \nfood? From a national security standpoint, it is important that we have \nsupport for family farmers.\n  Europe does it. Europe does it for another reason. Europe has been \nhungry and decided never again to be hungry and never again to be \ndependent on concentrations of food producers. So they, in Europe, have \na network of producers, small farmers, dotting the landscape of Europe \nbecause they have been hungry once and have determined never to do that \nagain, and the best defense against hunger is to have family farmers \nall across Europe producing their food supply.\n  The same is true in this country, in my judgment. Exactly the same is \ntrue. Add to that the national security implications of having broad \ndistribution of food supplies in this country produced by family farms. \nAgain, as I said when I started, I think family farms produce something \nvery enriching and very important to who we are as a country. Much more \nthan that, they also contribute to this country's national security.\n  The House of Representatives has passed its farm bill. We have a \nresponsibility in the Senate to pass ours. The difference between the \nHouse and the Senate farm bill that would amend or change the Freedom \nto Farm Act will be hundreds of millions of dollars to farmers in North \nDakota alone.\n  The Freedom to Farm bill was passed when the price of grain was quite \nhigh and it collapsed almost immediately, and family farmers have lived \nnow for 4 or 5 years with commodity prices that are far below the cost \nof production. The result is a whole lot of families are struggling. \nMany have lost that struggle and have moved from the family farm \nbecause they went broke. Others are hanging on, just hoping.\n  The only thing farmers have ever been able to live on is hope; hope \nthat somehow next spring they would be able to find somebody who would \nlend them the money to plant a crop; hope if they put the crop in that \nperhaps it would rain enough so that the crop would grow; hope that it \nwould not rain too much and drown out that crop; hope they did not have \ninsects; hope they did not have hail; hope that crop disease did not \ndestroy the crop.\n  If beyond all of those hopes they finally raised a crop, hope when \nthey combined or harvested that crop and put it in a truck and drove it \nto an elevator that there would be a price that was decent. With that \nkind of hope, farmers deserve our help during the tough times, and it \nis my hope the Senate will understand its responsibility right now in \nthe next several weeks to take up the challenge of the House and pass a \nfarm bill, a good farm bill, that says to family farmers we are \nstanding with them, we are standing behind them, and we want to provide \na bridge over price valleys to try to help them through these tough \ntimes. If we do that, it also will strengthen our country. That also \nwill strengthen our economy.\n  We will not have economic recovery in this country if we say it does \nnot matter what happens to those who live on the land; it does not \nmatter what happens to family farmers.\n  Economic recovery also begins by helping those who produce America's \nfood supply, and I hope the Senate will take up this challenge in the \nnext couple of weeks.\n  I conclude by saying this: I come from rural America. I was raised in \na town of 300 people. We raised horses, had some cattle. When I left my \nhome county--it was a fairly large county geographically--there were \n5,000 people living there. There are now 3,000 people living there. \nLike most rural counties, it is shrinking. The Lutheran minister in one \nof the communities in my home county told me she has four funerals for \nevery wedding at which she officiates.\n  There is this movie ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' This is the \nopposite: four funerals for every wedding. Why is that the case? \nBecause in those small towns and those rural areas, people are getting \nolder, the population is aging. Very few new people are moving in, very \nfew young people are taking over the farms, because they can't make a \nliving.\n\n  As the age increases, the economies of the communities are shrinking. \nWhat used to be a plum is now a prune--my home county and thousands \nlike it across this country.\n  If one just thinks this is about numbers and balance sheets, let me \nagain describe how it is not. It is about dreams, about people's lives. \nThere was an auction sale, which happens too often in my State. A \nfellow named Arlo was the auctioneer. He told me he was auctioning a \ntractor at the auction sale. People bid and bought the tractor. At the \nend of the auction sale, where he auctioned many things from the family \nfarm because the farmers could not make it, a little boy, about 9 years \nold, came up to him. He was the son of the farmer who was being sold \nout. He grabbed the auctioneer around his leg, and he kind of shouted \nat him. He said: You sold my dad's tractor. Arlo kind of patted him on \nthe shoulder to try to calm him down. This little boy had tears in his \neyes. He looked up and said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I got \nbig.\n  This is about dreams, about families, about kids. It is about the \nfuture. Family farming is much more than just business, it is part of \nour culture. Our country needs to understand that. We have a \nresponsibility to write a new farm bill, one that works, one that works \nfor family farmers.\n  In conclusion, as I have said before, if writing a farm bill is not \nabout investing in families who farm in this country, retaining a \nnetwork of families across the prairies of this country, then we don't \neven need a farm bill. We don't need a farm bill to help the giant \nagrifactories. If someone wants to buy 3,000 milk cows and milk them 3 \ntimes a day, God bless them. They don't need Uncle Sam's money. But a \nfamily with a family yard and a light that shines over where that \nfamily sleeps, where the dreams reside, cannot make it through tough \ntimes and price depressions. The only way to save family farms when the \nprices collapse is that the Government say: This part of our economy \nmatters; we hope you get through the tough times--we will build a \nbridge over the valleys. If the Government is willing to do that, it \nwill retain a food supply network populated on average by family farms \nthat produce that food supply.\n  In a world desperately hungry, where so many people go to bed at \nnight with an ache in their belly, when thousands die every day from \nhunger and hunger-related causes, it is unthinkable to me that what we \nproduce in so great abundance somehow has no value. They take it to the \nelevator, and farmers are told their grain has no value. It has value \nto the people in the world who are starving. It has value to the 500 \nmillion people who go to bed at night hungry. But our farmers are told, \nthat which you produced, which rested on your hope in the spring to \nproduce a crop, has now no value in the fall when it is harvested.\n  There is a major disconnection in this country about the value of \nagriculture, its worth to family farmers, its worth to the world and \nwhat it contributes to the stability of the world. We had better think \nthrough in a more clear way how all of that fits together. Food is an \nenormous asset. Those families who produce it are a significant asset \nto this country. It is time the Congress understands that.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10413-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10413-S10416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ANWR\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have spoken several times today about \nenergy policy. I will spend a few more minutes talking about something \nthat has created a lot of confusion and controversy and in some \nrespects bad feelings; that is, what we should do about ANWR.\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\n  The majority leader has indicated the volume of the business to be \ncompleted by the Senate is heavy. The subject of national energy policy \nis important. But we also acknowledge the jurisdiction of national \nenergy policy cuts across several committees, all of which have a hand \nin charting the future of that policy. Of course, that is one of the \nmain reasons Senator Daschle yesterday indicated we need to do an \nenergy bill. If we are going to do it sometime in the next few months, \nit has to be done by bringing it to the floor directly. When it comes, \nit will occupy much of the Senate time.\n  I hope, however, we will not devote the Senate's precious time to a \ndebate on drilling in ANWR. That debate, if we choose to have it, will \nbe divisive, as it has been. Many do not believe you can drill in ANWR, \nand if you do so, it fundamentally changes the character of this \nnational treasure, this pristine wilderness. We also believe whatever \nthe size of the footprint of ANWR, it opens the possibility of a \nlarger, more destructive footprint in the form of an oil spill. It is \ntough, very difficult to prevent accidents. It is very difficult and \ntougher still to prevent those who may be out to cause problems in the \nwilderness. It is not a speculative threat.\n  At the Trans-Alaskan pipeline last week, as most of my colleagues are \naware, a lone rifleman shot some holes through the pipeline. This \nappears not to have been an act of terror but an act of one person out \nto do some damage to a critical part of the Nation's infrastructure. \nThis action, where holes were shot in the pipeline, rupturing an 800-\nmile-long pipeline which spans from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, gushed oil \nfrom 2:30 in the afternoon to 3 a.m. the following Saturday morning. \nThat is 36 hours. They thought something was wrong but couldn't find \nwhere the leak was.\n  It took 36 hours to locate, plug the hole, and stop the rush of oil. \nI referred earlier to 250,000 gallons, but it was actually 285,000 \ngallons of crude oil spewed over many acres surrounding this pipeline. \nThe cleanup crews have worked hard to capture about 88,000 gallons of \nthat crude oil, leaving 200,000 gallons over that pristine area.\n  When you go to the gas station--and most of us have to pump our own \ngasoline because they are almost all self-service stations--if you fill \nthat tank a little bit too full, the gas runs all over the pavement. \nWhen I was a younger man, I worked for Standard Oil and later Chevron. \nI pumped gas. One of our jobs was to put as much gas as you could in a \ncar, but if it spilled out, just a little, it ran all over, and it was \nembarrassing. People thought you wasted 25 cents' worth of gas when it \nwas probably half a penny or a penny's worth. Think what 250,000 \ngallons of crude oil would do to any environment.\n  It is unclear how we will clean this up. The Environmental Protection \nAgency and the Alaska Department of Environmental Protection estimate \nthey may leave the oil-soaked land in place and try to treat the land. \nOthers say maybe they have to remove all this oil-soaked brush and \ntrees and even treat the soil. So it is not clear how they are going to \nclean it up, but it is clear it is terribly difficult to prevent lone \nacts of ignorance, terrorism, and simply accidents involving our energy \ninfrastructure. I think we would all be well advised to not have \nanother 800-mile pipeline.\n  Madam President, I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a number of editorials. I just picked up a few here. We were on \nthe Defense authorization bill when various Senators on the other side \nheld up this legislation because they wanted the energy bill on it. \nThese editorials from the Philadelphia Inquirer, Los Angeles Times, New \nYork Times, Charlotte Observer, Chicago Tribune, and the Charleston \nGazette --just to pick a few newspapers--the last one is the \nAlbuquerque Journal--say this is wrong; you cannot tie energy policy to \nthings that have no bearing, no relation to it.\n  I hope, as important as energy policy is, that we move forward at the \nright time and the majority leader understands the importance of it. We \nare going to do that. But we recognize the divisive nature of ANWR.\n  I ask unanimous consent these articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Philadelphia Enquire, Oct. 1, 2001]\n\n                             Back to Normal\n\n\n             energy issues signal a return to partisanship\n\n       Brief though it was, the hiatus from political hijinks has \n     begun to wane in Washington.\n       Under the guise of national security, some elected \n     officials have started to slip pet projects into unrelated \n     legislation, grinding progress to a halt.\n       Last week, the worst offender, Sen. James Inhofe (R., \n     Okla.), stalled an urgent $345 billion defense authorization \n     bill by hitching it to the notion of drilling in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.\n       Talk about poisoning a bipartisan well. Few issues are more \n     divisive.\n       One amendment to the defense bill contains the entire House \n     energy bill, which was passed in July. Rather than debate it \n     on its merits, Sen. Inhofe suggested the Senate rubber-stamp \n     it as an after thought to needed defense appropriation.\n       This is no way to do business--even in wartime.\n       The energy bill has been shelved all summer, waiting behind \n     faith-based initiatives, campaign-finance reform and a \n     patients' bill of rights. As U.S. policy-makers rightly focus \n     on the Sept. 11 attacks, energy probably should move up on \n     the domestic agenda.\n       But realize that, since the attacks, gas supply and prices \n     have been stable. The organization of Petroleum Exporting \n     Countries agree Thursday to maintain its current production \n     level, despite a precipitous drop in the price of crude oil. \n     Unlike last fall, the supply of winter heating fuel is \n     stable, with lower prices expected.\n       A growing consensus among energy analysts, government \n     officials and economists predicts that the Sept. 11 attacks \n     will have no short-term impact on energy supply. Even if the \n     immediate supply were threatened, drilling in the Arctic \n     refuge isn't the answer. No oil would flow for 10 years--the \n     time needed to construct oil fields and a delivery route.\n       And even if the most optimistic estimates were correct. \n     Arctic refuge oil would reduce imports only a few percentage \n     points. Nearly half of U.S. demand would still be met by \n     foreign oil. The country will remain vulnerable to the world \n     market as long as demand for fossil fuels keeps rising.\n       The United States needs an energy overhaul, not just more \n     oil. The long-term supply-and-demand problems outlined by \n     Vice President Cheney's energy team last spring haven't \n     changed. Remedies must include new technologies and \n     conservation, as well as improvements in conventional fuels.\n       An energy program it too important to be passed as a \n     tangential political maneuver. The Senate should reject these \n     amendments.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Sept. 28, 2001]\n\n                      Arctic Drilling Is Still Bad\n\n       The United States needs to take decisive steps to improve \n     its security against terrorism but should be wary of attempts \n     to use the crisis to stampede Congress into bad policy \n     decisions. In one such attempt some lawmakers are trying to \n     rush through legislation to open the Alaska National Wildlife \n     Refuge (ANWR) to oil exploration and drilling.\n       ``We can't wait another day,'' House Republican Whip Tom \n     DeLay of Texas raged at a press conference.'' This country \n     needs energy produced by Americans in America for America,'' \n     declared Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin (R-La.). Hold on. \n     Drilling in the Arctic refuge was a bad idea before Sept. 11 \n     and is just as bad today. Rushing the energy bill through the \n     Senate wouldn't make the ANWR provision better.\n       The facts are unchanged. The refuge is estimated to contain \n     3.2 billion barrels of oil that can be pumped without \n     economic loss, enough to supply the nation for about six \n     months. It would take roughly 10 years for these supplies to \n     reach gasoline pumps. We could save five times as much oil by \n     raising the fuel efficiency standard of new autos by three \n     miles per gallon. There may be just as much oil in other \n     parts of Alaska, including the 23-million-acre National \n     Petroleum Reserve, now open to the oil companies. Domestic \n     production can and should expand where it is economically \n     feasible and does not threaten special areas.\n       The wildlife refuge, on the north slope of Alaska between \n     the Brooks Range and the Arctic Ocean, is the home of the \n     129,000-head Porcupine caribou herd, which migrates more than \n     400 miles to the coastal plain to calve. The refuge also has \n     polar and grizzly bears, Dall sheep, musk oxen, wolves, foxes \n     and myriad bird species.\n       Once the first drill pierces the tundra, the refuge will be \n     changed forever, despite the denials of drilling proponents. \n     Would we harness Old Faithful for its geothermal energy? Put \n     a hydroelectric plant at Yosemite Falls? You could not \n     measure the potential cost to the environment in Yellowstone \n     or Yosemite, nor can you in the Arctic.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Charlotte Observer, Sept. 28, 2001]\n\n                          Hard Times, Bad Laws\n\n       Congress shouldn't be stampeded by terrorist attacks. Don't \n     get the idea that politics has been suspended while \n     Washington focuses on terrorism. In fact, supporters of some \n     politically controversial proposals are reshaping them to \n     make it appear they're necessary to help win the struggle \n     against terrorism.\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\n       Take the Bush Administration's proposal to drill for oil in \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, for instance. Some \n     proponents of drilling say Congress should move quickly to \n     allow to it in order to lessen U.S. dependence on oil from \n     the politically unstable Middle East.\n       Baloney. Drilling in Alaska wouldn't make a dime's worth of \n     difference in U.S. dependence on imported oil. At present the \n     United States produces less than half the petroleum it \n     consumes. Economist Paul Krugman, writing in the New York \n     Times, notes that drilling in the wildlife refuge, at its \n     peak, would supply only about 5 percent of our consumption. \n     Even with drilling there going full steam, we'd still depend \n     on imports for 45 percent of our needs.\n       The quest for a cut in the capital gains tax is irrelevant \n     to the present crisis. Some Republican backers of a rate cut \n     say it's necessary to pump money into the economy to pull the \n     nation out of a recession.\n       More baloney. The way to jumpstart the economy is to put \n     money in the hands of people who are likely to spend it \n     quickly. Simply rebating the federal payroll taxes would do \n     that quicker and better than tinkering with the capital gains \n     tax. And a one-time rebate would be in keeping with Federal \n     Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's caution against making \n     long-term changes to deal with short-term problems. ``It's \n     better to be smart than quick,'' he said. While Mr. Greenspan \n     favors reducing or eliminating the capital gains tax over \n     time, he does not favor doing it now.\n       The disaster of Sept. 11 didn't change the arguments for \n     and against drilling in the wildlife refuge or cutting the \n     capital gains tax. Politicians who suggest otherwise are \n     attempting to use the terrorist attack to advance an \n     unrelated political agenda. Congress rightly feels a need to \n     do something, but it shouldn't be stampeded into doing \n     something wrong.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 2, 2001]\n\n                    Strong-Arm Tactics in the Senate\n\n       Members of Congress have largely resisted the temptation to \n     exploit this moment of national crisis to promote pet causes. \n     One exception is a small group of senators and House members, \n     led by Senator James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, who \n     favor opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil \n     drilling. Last week Mr. Inhofe threatened to take the energy \n     bill passed earlier this year by the House and add it as an \n     amendment to the high-priority Defense Department \n     authorization bill. The energy bill includes a provision \n     opening the refuge to drilling.\n       Tom Daschle, the majority leader, has scheduled a cloture \n     vote for this morning. If successful, the vote would make it \n     impossible to attach non-germane amendments like Mr. Inhofe's \n     to the bill. Senators who care about sound legislative \n     procedure--not to mention a rational approach to the \n     country's energy problems--will vote for cloture.\n       Drilling in the Arctic is a contentious issue on which the \n     Senate is closely divided. Railroading the idea through \n     without proper hearings defies elementary standards of \n     fairness. There is also no evidence that drilling in the \n     refuge will significantly reduce America's dependence on \n     foreign oil. The House bill that includes the drilling \n     provision is itself an ill-conceived mishmash of tax breaks \n     that would do a lot for the oil, gas and coal industries \n     without putting the country's long-term energy strategy on a \n     sound footing.\n       Reducing America's dependence on foreign sources of energy \n     is a complicated business, and there are many experts who \n     believe that the surest road to energy security is to improve \n     the efficiency of our cars, homes, factories and offices, and \n     to invest heavily in non-traditional sources of fuel. Before \n     the terrorist attack, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee had begun extensive hearings aimed at producing an \n     energy bill that would balance exploration and conservation. \n     This measured process should now be allowed to resume, free \n     of pressure from partisan maneuvering.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Oct. 2, 2001]\n\n                   The Greasy Politics of Alaska Oil\n\n       In a display of unity and statesmanship seldom seen in \n     Washington, most politicians have put aside partisanship and \n     personal squabbles to concentrate on helping a traumatized \n     nation recover from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.\n       Then there's Sen. Frank Murkowski, a Republican from \n     Alaska.\n       Last Wednesday, he threatened to bring all Senate business \n     to a halt unless there was a vote on the Bush \n     administration's energy bill, which contains a provision to \n     open Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling--a pet \n     project of his and a few others in the Senate.\n       ``If I have to hold up normal legislative business, I will \n     do that,'' he said.\n       Way to go, senator: Your sense of national priorities is \n     about as keen as your timing. What better moment to push your \n     agenda than now, when your colleagues and the nation are \n     still mourning the dead and pondering how to prevent another \n     terrorist attack?\n       Though drilling was approved by the House earlier this \n     summer by a comfortable margin, it faces much tougher going \n     in the Senate. Indeed it's a short-sighted proposal that \n     would damage one of the few pristine wilderness areas left in \n     the country. It ought to be defeated; the terrorist attacks \n     don't change that.\n       Yet, Murkowski and a few others--Sens. James Inhofe (R-OK) \n     and Larry Craig (R-ID)--are using the national crisis to \n     grease the drilling proposal through the Senate with a \n     minimum of debate.\n       Murkowski's office says the oil could start gurgling \n     through the pipelines as soon as a year from now--if only the \n     Senate would pass legislation to dispense with lawsuits, \n     environmental studies and other inconveniences.\n       In other words, forget the details and let'er rip.\n       Any responsible plan to drill in Alaska will take anywhere \n     between 7 and 10 years of study, planning, engineering and \n     construction. At that, the oil from there would have just a \n     small impact on the amount of oil the nation needs to import. \n     In the short or the long term, drilling in the refuge has \n     little to do with the terrorist challenges the country faces.\n       What an astonishingly crass move, to manipulate the Sept. \n     11 tragedy to get the energy bill approved.

James Inhofe, R-Okla., is attempting to amend the \n     controversial House energy bill into the unrelated defense \n     appropriations bill. That energy bill includes billions of \n     dollars in subsidies to oil, gas and coal interests, and it \n     would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploration \n     and drilling.\n       Coincidentally, Inhofe is Congress' top recipient of \n     campaign money from the oil and gas industry. He's already \n     received $56,200 this year from drillers, according to the \n     Center for Responsive Politics--nearly $20,000 more than he \n     received in the entire 1999-2000 election cycle.\n       Inhofe says this is a natural time to talk about the \n     security implications of the nation's dependence on foreign \n     oil. Fine. What does that have to do with giving billions of \n     dollars to polluting industries? What does that have to do \n     with despoiling the nation's last pristine ecosystem?\n       If the United States wants to lessen its dependence on \n     foreign oil, there are better ways. Congress could finally \n     raise the gas mileage standards for cars, and apply passenger \n     car standards to minivans and SUVs.\n       Congress could encourage alternative energy sources that \n     cause less environmental damage.\n       This debate was poised to happen before the Sept. 11 \n     attack. But energy industry lackeys like Inhofe want to use \n     that tragedy to sidestep Senate debate and get what they \n     want.\n       This shameful attempt to use the deaths of thousands of \n     Americans is grotesque. West Virginia senators Robert C.

The maneuver makes a \n     mockery of the touted bipartisanship to deal with the \n     situation left in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n       There have been bipartisan calls for quick action on the \n     $345 billion defense bill.\n       ``Our troops are counting on it; the Pentagon needs it,'' \n     said Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle, D-S.D. ``I can't \n     think of a more urgent piece of legislation than this right \n     now under these circumstances.''\n       Sen. Inhofe, however, sees the urgency only as a rare \n     opportunity for a a bit of political war profiteering--if he \n     can get a majority in the Senate to go along.\n       The question of drilling in ANWR is a contentious issue \n     Congress will have to deal with at some point. But, blocking \n     an essential defense bill in an effort to slip it past \n     without debate on its merits is a reprehensible tactic in \n     these troubled times.\n       To his disgrace, Inhofe has already blocked action on the \n     defense bill until next week. Senate colleagues should reject \n     his maneuver and get back to unity of purpose in addressing \n     the urgent task at hand.\n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\n       Time enough to pick up on the contentious and important \n     ANWR debate on its own merits after Congress has done all it \n     can to provide for the anti-terrorism effort ahead.\n\n  Mr. REID.

I was hoping the assistant majority leader would stay on \nthe floor so I could tell him I was very pleased with what happened \nlast night. I have dealt with the assistant majority leader and \nmajority leader for several weeks now in an attempt to get an energy \nbill to the floor. I understand an agreement has now been announced \nthat the majority leader and assistant majority leader will bring one \nto the floor.\n  I started to say to Senator Reid, when I saw him walk out--I wanted \nhim to be here so he could hear me compliment him on this action. I \nthink it is critical.\n  I believe we should have gone through an extensive committee markup. \nOn the other hand, as the weeks go by and we get closer to adjournment, \nI think this would be an impossible thing to do at this point.\n  Second, I am hoping when this bill comes to the floor--and there is \nnow a commitment from Senator Daschle to bring it to the floor during \nthis Congress, before adjournment--that we get it in time to be very \ndeliberative, in time to consider all the amendments.\n  I do not know what this energy bill will look like when it comes to \nthe floor. I will read this now to make sure it is in the Record in \ncase someone else hasn't done so:\n\n       At the request of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman today suspended any further markup of energy \n     legislation for this session of Congress. Instead, the \n     chairman will propose comprehensive and balanced energy \n     legislation that can be added by the majority leader to the \n     Senate Calendar for potential action prior to adjournment.\n\n  While it did not have a chance to go through the committee process, \nwhich I would have preferred, when it became apparent that it was not \ngoing to go through, I thought the next best thing was to go ahead and \nsend it straight to the floor; let us work on it here. We need to put \namendments on it. We need to be in a position where we are able to \noffer the amendments to make sure it has the necessary provisions to do \nsomething about an energy policy for the future.\n  I do not say this in at all a partisan vein because I started, in the \n1980s, trying to get the Reagan administration to have an energy \npolicy.\n  Then I tried to get the Bush administration, the Bush I \nadministration, to have an energy policy for this Nation. They would \nnot do it. I thought surely he would, coming in from the oil patch, but \nhe did not.\n  Then of course we tried during the Clinton administration, and they \ndecided they were not going to do it.\n  So this is our chance right now. As long as we have lip service, \nsaying, yes, it is important; yes, it is important for our national \nsecurity to have an energy policy, but not doing anything about it, we \nare doing a great disservice to our Nation.\n  Here we are in two wars for all practical purposes right now. In Iraq \nyou may have noted this morning another one of our Predators was shot \ndown, and of course what is happening in our war on terrorism around \nthe world. This is no time to be playing around with what is probably \nthe single most important aspect of our ability to defend America, and \nthat is our current reliance upon foreign sources for our ability to \nfight a war.\n  When Don Hodel was Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Interior, \nback during the Reagan administration, he and I went around the Nation \ngiving speeches as to why our dependence on foreign countries for our \nability to fight a war is not an energy issue; it is a national \nsecurity issue. We went, I remember, to New York and Chicago and \ndifferent places to try to explain to people we cannot be dependent \nupon foreign sources for our oil and still be able to fight wars and \ndefend America as the American people expect of us.\n  At the time that Don Hodel and I went around the Nation, we were 37 \npercent dependent upon foreign sources for our ability to fight a war. \nToday that is now 56.6 percent.\n  What I am saying is we are importing 56.6 percent of the oil we are \nusing to run America and to fight wars. Today, in this current \nenvironment, it costs much more, in terms of amounts of oil, to fight a \nwar than it did in the past.\n  Of the 56.6 percent that we are dependent upon for our ability to \nfight a war--we have to say it in that way--half of that is coming from \nthe Middle East. Do you know who the largest contributor to our \ndependency is, in the Middle East? It is Iraq. Here we are at war with \nIraq. They just shot down one of our Predators, a third one, this \nmorning. We are sending battle groups over there to defend America, \nsending them into combat situations with Iraq, yet we are dependent \nupon Iraq for our ability to fight a war against Iraq. That \nis preposterous. It is not believable that this could be happening.\n\n  That is why I say we have to get out of this position. We have to \nestablish a national energy policy that is comprehensive, that does \nhave as one of its cornerstones the maximum that we are going to be \ndependent upon foreign sources for our ability to fight a war. And that \nis not just the Middle East; that is other parts of the world also.\n  To be in a 56.6 percent dependency--and, incidentally, by the end of \nthis decade, if we don't do something to dramatically change it, it is \ngoing to be 60 percent. That is 60 percent dependent upon foreign \ngovernments for our ability to fight a war.\n  What happened last night is a major breakthrough because we now have \nthe majority leader stating that he will have a comprehensive bill \nbefore us to vote on before we adjourn. That is major. We are going to \nhave to consider all aspects. I don't want to see something coming down \nthat is not comprehensive. It is going to have to talk about where our \nuntapped resources are in this country.\n  I can see right now all the lobby of the far left environmental \nextremists are going to say this is an ANWR bill. It is not an ANWR \nbill. Of the comprehensive bill, H.R. 4, from the House of \nRepresentatives, that passed--and that is the one we will probably go \ninto conference with--out of 200 pages, only 2 pages talk about ANWR. \nThat is a very minuscule part of it. It covers a lot of items. For \nexample, we have untapped resources in the United States other than \nANWR. We have some offshore opportunities, where we have tremendous \nreserves.\n  I happen to be from the State of Oklahoma. We had huge stripper well \nproduction. When we talk about stripper wells, we are talking about \nsmall wells, shallow wells that only produce 15 or fewer barrels a day.\n  But if you had producing today, right now, all of those stripper \nwells, or marginal wells that we have plugged in the last 10 years, \nthen it would equal more oil than we are currently importing from Saudi \nArabia. That shows it is out there.\n  Why can't they do it? They can't do it because to lift a barrel of \noil out of the ground, it costs us 10 times as much in the United \nStates in marginal production as it does in Saudi Arabia, for example. \nSo it is not the price of the oil so much as, when they make this \ndecision as to whether or not to explore for these marginal wells, they \nhave to have some idea of what the price of a barrel of oil is going to \nbe when it is ultimately produced--and that will be a period of a year. \nWe have jumped around from $8 to $35 a barrel in less than a year, so \nhow can they predict that? That has to be included in a comprehensive \nenergy policy so we can exploit all of these opportunities.\n  The other day I was on a program with one of our well-respected \nSenators, and I made the comment almost in jest that you can't expect \nto run the most highly industrialized nations in the history of the \nworld on windmills. He said, in fact, you can. He talked about this \nwind technology. Fine. We want to go after these other technologies and \nexploit other opportunities out there--hydroelectric, the sun,\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\nand the wind. But until that comes along, we have to look very \nseriously not just at oil and our dependency upon foreign nations but \nalmost nuclear.\n  I can remember back in the 1960s when people would protest nuclear \nplants. Now they realize there is a serious problem with the quality of \nour air. A lot of those people are saying: Let's go back and reexamine \nnuclear energy. No. 1, it is the cheapest; No. 2, it is the cleanest; \nand, No. 3, it is the most readily available.\n  I think we should address that in a comprehensive energy policy. That \nis what I hope will be on the floor.\n  We have something that is very significant. I am sure the American \npeople, since the days of my going around the Nation with Don Hodel \nback in the 1980s, and since we went through a very large Persian Gulf \nwar in 1990, now realize we can't be dependent upon the Middle East. \nThat is the hotbed. That is where the problems are today. We are \nconcerned about North Korea and Afghanistan and about many areas, but \nthe Persian Gulf region is where there is a tremendous threat--yes, \nalmost a terrorist threat.\n  I commend the majority leader for making the agreement to bring up a \ncomprehensive bill. But I am asking him, since it is in his lap--he is \ntotally responsible for keeping his word on this--that he bring \nsomething to the floor early enough so we can go through the process, \ndebate it, and have amendments. Then we can go to conference with the \nHouse. They have already passed theirs way ahead of us. We can come up \nwith an energy policy, which we have been trying to get through. The \nPresident, I am sure, will be happy and anxious to sign it. He already \nstated that he would this year before we adjourn.\n  It is something that we must do. It is something that is long \noverdue. But the opportunity is here today.\n  I feel very strongly that this is an opportunity we cannot bypass. I \ncommend the majority leader and am anxious to see what that product \nlooks like. I hope we are able to work on that product and get it to \nconference so we get an energy policy and get it signed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton).

Mr. President, almost exactly 1 month ago to the day \nthis Nation was rocked by the most horrific act of terrorism ever \nleveled against the United States. Following the events of September \n11, we resolved as a nation to work together to secure our borders and \ndo all in our power to prevent a repeat of the kind of assault that \nshook this country 30 days ago. Key to the security of America is our \nability to quickly put in place enhanced security measures at our \nairports and on our planes to ensure that our skies are safe and that \nAmericans are no longer afraid to fly. Yet the legislation that is key \nto ensuring that America's aviation system is secure--the very measure \nthat is our most direct legislative response to the hijacking of four \nU.S. airliners--has been stalled now for a week. This body is in \nagreement on many issues in this bill and we have compromised on \nothers. It is time that we bring this critically important bill to the \nfloor and openly debate the differences which remain.\n  Whether or not to ``federalize'' airport security personnel is an \nissue that still deeply divides this body. I also attended the briefing \nby El Al officials which the distinguished Chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee and others have referred to throughout this debate. We are \nall aware of the extraordinary security measures the Israeli airline \nhas put in place and the extraordinary success of those measures. \nBecause of the constant threat of terrorism to Israel and the Israeli \npeople, El Al has taken the following steps to ensure the safety of its \npassengers and the integrity of its operations: armed, plain-clothes, \nin-flight guards; extensive passenger questioning and Interpol \nbackground checks; extensive luggage inspections, both visual \ninspection by employees and high-tech explosive detection, including \nthe placing of luggage and cargo in decompression chambers; and secure \ncockpit doors that remain locked from the inside. Since the \nimplementation of these measures, no Israeli airline has ever been \nhijacked. This record speaks for itself.\n  In that briefing the El Al officials were asked if airport security \npersonnel were government workers or contract workers. The response was \ntelling. The El Al officials did not even know what contract workers \nare. They want government workers on the front line to enforce the \ntightest security measures possible. As others have pointed out, we \nwant Secret Service, government employees to provide the greatest \nprotection possible to the President of the United States. We want \nFederal law enforcement officers to protect the elected members of the \nHouse and Senate. Why would we want any less for the people of this \nNation?\n\n  There was a recent article in the Atlanta Constitution about an \nAtlanta-based security company which provides baggage screening for 17 \nof the 20 largest airports in the country, including baggage screening \nfor Dulles and Newark airports--where two of the four hijacked planes \noriginated on September 11. According to the Atlanta Constitution:\n  The company has 19,000 employees and provides security for office \nbuildings, colleges and Federal facilities. In the past year, it pled \nguilty to allowing untrained employees--including some with criminal \nbackgrounds--to operate checkpoints in Philadelphia International \nAirport. Its parent company was fined $1.2 million. In addition, the \ncompany is also said to have falsified test scores for at least 2 dozen \napplicants and hired at least 14 security screeners with criminal \nbackgrounds ranging from aggravated assault and burglary to drug and \nfirearm possession. The highest advertised job at this company pays $7 \nto $8.50 an hour.\n  Mr. President, to repeat, these workers are paid $7 to $8 an hour. \nWith minimum wage pay like this, no wonder many of these screeners look \nat going to work at a fast-food restaurant as a promotion. Clearly we \ncannot have this attitude as our first line of defense.\n  In the El Al briefing, there was a slide describing the onion-like \nlayers of security in their aviation system. At the outer layer was the \nlayer of intelligence--key to any effective protection of our skies and \nborders. In Israel, when there is knowledge of a possible security \nthreat, there is immediately a line of intelligence communication from \nthe highest levels of government down, and in that intelligence loop \nare the security officers at Ben Gurion Airport. This is a compelling \nreason why we should have Federal workers at the airport checkpoints in \nthis country. There are over 700 of these checkpoints at over 420 \nairports. We need a domestic version of the Customs Service as our \nfirst line of defense against hijackers.\n  The General Accounting Office in assessing our aviation \nvulnerabilities stated that ``the human element is the weakest link in \nthe chain.'' We saw that on September 11. The airline industry is in \nfavor of federalizing airport security personnel. More importantly, \nthe American people support it.\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\n In a recent national poll, 82 percent of the people surveyed said they \nwould support having the Federal Government take over security \nscreening at U.S. airports even if it cost $2 billion a year.\n\n  All of us appreciate the value of rapid response in combating \nterrorism. It is time to bring the aviation security bill to the floor \nand fulfill the number one responsibility of Congress: to work to \nensure the safety and protection of the Nation and its citizens. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the Senator from Oklahoma is not in \nthe Chamber, so I will withhold until he reaches the floor. What I \nintend to do when he does reach the floor is ask unanimous consent that \nwe vitiate the remaining hours on postcloture and proceed to immediate \nconsideration of S. 1447.\n  Today there was an ABC news poll that showed 42 percent of the \nAmerican people are still concerned about flying on an airliner.\n  The day before yesterday there was a meeting in New York City between \nthe Speaker of the House, the Democrat leaders, Representative \nGephardt, and 20 business and labor leaders, as well as Alan Greenspan, \nChairman of the Federal Reserve. According to published media reports, \nthere were strong recommendations by all these individuals to move on \nairport security so the confidence of the American people could be \nrestored and the economy would have a chance to recover.\n  For 2 weeks we have been trying to get this bill considered. \nMeanwhile, we have American men and women who are in combat, putting \ntheir lives on the line for the safety of American citizens and we \ncannot even act on an airport security bill. I don't feel like running \nthrough the litany of all the things that have happened, all the \nmeetings the Senator from Texas and I have had, and not had, the \nscheduled meetings and the unscheduled meetings, the canceled meetings, \nand the negotiations. This legislation is being held up for reasons \nthat have nothing to do with airport security. There are legitimate \ndifferences of opinion on this issue. I respect those differences.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma was going to state when he objects that he \nis afraid a nongermane amendment or nonrelevant amendment may be added \nto the bill. I oppose, as does the distinguished chairman, Senator \nHollings, nonrelevant and nongermane amendments, but, at the same time, \nthat is not reason to block the legislation from being considered.\n  Because there are objections that are related or nonrelated to this \nlegislation, we are blocking the legislation because of certain select \ninterests or concerns. That is not the way we should do business. The \nway we should do business is to take up bills, vote on them, have \ndebate, have amendments, and vote on them. That is the way the process \nis supposed to work.\n  Is this an issue that is a minor policy disagreement? Is this an \nissue that has to do with only a small number of Americans, maybe the \nState of Arizona or just the State of Texas? No. This is an issue of \ncompelling requirements. Very few Americans, if any, will ever forget \nthe sight of those airliners flying into the World Trade Center. All of \nus will remember it as long as we live. Every time they see it, they \nwill want to know that their Government, working with the elected \nrepresentatives, not by Executive order but by working with their \nelected officials, has taken every measure possible to ensure the \nsafety of the flying public, which is a large number of Americans.\n  Supposedly at 4:57, as a result of my parliamentary inquiry before \nlunch, we will be going to the bill, but the reason I propose a \nunanimous consent request now is by the time there are opening \nstatements tonight, we will have killed another day. Perhaps we may \neven use all of tomorrow. Usually we don't do a lot of work around here \non Friday. And we would then have expended another week before we could \nget on this legislation.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for all of her hard work on this \nissue. I know the Senator from Oklahoma will object and give his well-\nthought-out reasons for doing so. I know the Senator from Texas will \nmake her comments. The time for backroom negotiations and conversations \nand proposals and counterproposals is over. We have a bill. We had \nhearings in the Commerce Committee on airport and airline security. \nThis legislation is a direct result of those hearings. This is not \nsomething made up in the backroom. This legislation was \nproduced through thoughtful consultation with the best minds in America \nthat we could find. We think it is vital we move forward with this \nlegislation.\n\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent we vitiate the remaining hours \nin postcloture and move directly to the consideration of S. 1447, the \nAviation Security Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if my colleague \nand friend from Arizona would be willing to modify his unanimous \nconsent request, that he amend it to say that all amendments be \nrelevant to the underlying airport security bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. In response to the Senator from Oklahoma, that would be a \nhighly unusual request, as he knows, because the normal procedure in \nthe Senate is to take up legislation. If there is a concern about \nnongermane or nonrelevant amendments, then a cloture motion is filed, \nas has already been filed in one case.\n  So, no, I do not agree to modify my request for that because I think \nit would be depriving Members, at least temporarily, of their voice and \ntheir concerns and their amendments that they might want to propose. I \npromise the Senator from Oklahoma I will object and vote against and \nargue against, as the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee \nstated, any nonrelevant and nongermane amendment. I hope that satisfies \nhis concerns.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Further reserving the right to object, I appreciate the \nremarks of my friend and colleague. If we can keep the bill itself \npretty much to relevant amendments, I think and believe we can get this \nbill passed this week.\n  For the information of our colleagues, we are very close to \nconcluding the antiterrorism package. I appreciate the patience of my \nfriend and colleague from Arizona. We have been trying to pass two \nbills this week: one, an antiterrorism package, and the other an \nairport security package. I hope and believe we can pass both this \nweek. The antiterrorism package is much closer to being there. In fact, \nit is our hope we can pass it today. We are in the process of trying to \nconclude a unanimous consent request to pass the antiterrorism package \ntoday that will be in agreement and hopefully have the vote by 6 \no'clock tonight.\n  With that in mind, the fact we are so close to doing the \nantiterrorism package and getting it to conclusion at this point, I \nobject to the unanimous consent request proposed by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am getting as frustrated as the \nsenior Senator from Arizona. We have been working on aviation security \nsince September 12, 2001. I introduced the bill that would increase the \nnumber of sky marshals that very week. I could see the traveling public \nwas going to be stunned. Of course what has happened is even worse than \nthat. The impact on the economy of having people stay out of airplanes \nand airports is staggering. It was a domino effect. The airlines are \nflying at half capacity. They are not flying as many flights. Hotels \nare not full. Rental cars are not being rented. The cancellation of \nconventions all over the country is being reported.\n  We can do something about this. We have been working on it in a very \nbipartisan way. There are very few disagreements on the bill--things we \ncan work out or have amendments, vote them up or down, and we can send \na decent package to the President.\n  What is holding the legislation up is extraneous amendments. These \namendments may have merit, but they are not worked out yet and they are \nnot relevant to aviation security. We are dealing with some very \ncomplicated matters. Antiterrorism is complicated. We have tried to \nkeep that clean so that the disagreements are on the bill and \ndisagreements on other issues don't encroach on that bill.\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\n  We need to do the same thing for aviation security so we are not \ntalking about differences on an unemployment bill in the middle of \nother differences on the relevant bill and not be able to come to the \nconclusion on the aviation security bill because of something that does \nnot relate to aviation security.\n  The President wants to deal with unemployment. We want to deal with \nunemployment. We can do that in the economic stimulus package or in a \nfreestanding bill. That would be the responsible thing to do, \nparticularly when we know if there are going to be other jobs \navailable. Right now we have a huge loss of jobs in the aviation \nindustry. But we are trying to add jobs in aviation security. We are \ntrying to add jobs in the defense industry because we are going to be \nratcheting up our defense needs. So let's give our employees a chance \nto seek other jobs before we pass something when we are not even sure \nhow much we are going to need or if that is relevant by the time we see \nif these other jobs can be filled.\n\n  But it is a whole different issue. So why not talk about aviation \nsecurity? I see the distinguished Commerce Committee chairman, Senator \nHollings. He has worked with Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of the \nAviation subcommittee. I am the ranking member of the Aviation \nsubcommittee, and Senator McCain is the ranking member of the full \ncommittee. We have worked on this bill.\n  We have worked with the White House trying to come to the agreements \non this bill, and we are very close. We are going to strengthen the \ncockpit doors. You would think that after what happened just yesterday \non the airplane where the deranged man fought his way into a cockpit--\njust yesterday--there would be an impetus to take up this bill.\n  We are going to add air marshals in the bill that I introduced the \nweek of September 11, because we know people will feel safer if there \nare air marshals on airplanes. We know the more we can get in, the more \nlikely people are to fly and the less likely we are to have incidents, \nbecause we will have on those airplanes trained law enforcement \npersonnel.\n  We are trying to upgrade the screening. Everybody who has been \nthrough an airport knows there have been holes in security, in the \nscreening process. Today in many airports there are long lines at the \nscreening stations. We want to regularize that process so people know \nwhat to expect and so we can get through on a more expedited basis \nusing trained people with good equipment.\n  Those are the things we are trying to do with this bill. So I support \nSenator McCain's motion. I think we need to proceed to the bill, and I \nthink we need to keep extraneous amendments off, and that should be a \nbipartisan agreement. Then we can argue legitimately about the bill \nitself and how much federalization we have and where it goes and what \nthe dollars are. All of that is legitimate disagreement. Let's get to \nthe bill. Let's do what we must do to get people back into airplanes \nfeeling safe and secure. Let's give them that security, and let's help \nthe economy strengthen.\n  We must do that. We are wasting valuable time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, and our ranking member, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, \nMr. McCain.\n  We did not come to our particular bill for the federalization of \nairport and airline security in America in a casual fashion. The truth \nof the matter is that having been on this committee for over 30-some \nyears, I can say we have been trying to beef up security for quite some \ntime.\n  I could go back to the 1970s in speaking on this topic, but I will \nbring you right up to 1988. When Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over \nLockerbie, Scotland, we heard of security breaches there--which have \nnow been proved in court. As a result, we had hearings, we had \nconferences with the White House and the leadership and the airlines \nand everyone concerned, and what did we come up with?\n  We wanted to keep it just the way it is with privatization, but what \nwe were going to do is have higher standards, more training, more \nsupervision, more money: The same old same old after 1988.\n  Then, of course, they had the TWA Flight 800 disaster in 1996, 5 \nyears ago. Following the disaster, we had the Gore commission, and what \ndid we come up with? We came up with more training, higher standards, \nmore supervision, more money--the same old same old.\n  So I determined, along with Senator McCain, that bygones were bygones \nwith all this fetish about privatization. In a time of war we can't \nrelegate security and safety to any kind of low-cost bidder.\n  You can put in the words, is my point, of higher standards and more \nsupervision and more training and more money, but you have to fix the \nlack of accountability and standards, as they have in Israel.\n  Right to the point, while the distinguished Senator from Texas was \ntalking about just the screeners, I believe we must focus on the whole \nsecurity picture, including the outer perimeter or rim in the Israeli \nonion ring plan--the outer ring is intelligence.\n  Incidentally, I have just been in a discussion where they were \ntalking about too many leaks of classified information to the public. \nLet me say this, the war on terrorism is not a military war, it is an \nintelligence war, and intelligence operates on a need-to-know basis.\n  You do not have to tell the Senator from South Carolina anything. \nJust tell me what we have done. Don't tell me you are backing up \naircraft carriers and you are going to do this and you are going to \njump from the helicopters like they have in the headlines, or that you \nare working with this group and that group--they don't know how to run \na war, particularly against terrorism.\n  Mr. President, this war is not the hundred-yard dash. This is going \nto be an endurance contest, and it is going to be off the front pages \nif there are going to be any successes.\n  Back to the screeners, they have to have the highest security \nclearance. When we get terrorist watch lists from international \nsecurity, we might get it from the Brits, we might get it from the \nFrench, we might get it from one of the Muslim countries themselves. \nBut these watch lists are not going to be effective prevention tools to \nthat screener who is being paid $5 or $6 an hour and has only been on \nthe job for 3 weeks.\n  We must have the highest type of personnel, not only as screeners, \nbut as trustworthy security professionals. That is what we are talking \nabout. That not only relates to the screener but to the person who \nvacuum-cleans the rug in the airplane. Don't worry about somebody going \nthrough with a pistol in an airport to get on a plane. What they are \ngoing to do is have someone working the tarmac, with a loaded gun \navailable, and I call up ahead of time, and I say I have seat 9-A, and \nyou tape the weapon underneath the seat. We must address these types of \nsecurity weaknesses.\n  You have to understand, you are in a war with a clever bunch of \nrascals, absolute fanatics. In this kind of war you can't have 20 \npercent of security personnel privately contracted, for instance. \nSomeone came to me late last evening and said: How about 20 percent of \nthe screeners? Go out there and tell that to the Pentagon--let's have \nthe privates and the corporals and the sergeants privately contracted.\n  They have 669,000 civilian civil service security personnel in \ndefense. But they are wrangling about 18 plus 10, or 28,000 new \ngovernment airport security personnel. It is not money. We have paid \nfor it.\n  I have mentioned ad nauseam the $917 round-trip coach class ticket to \nCharleston, SC. I will willingly pay a fee to know my life is safe and \nthere is no chance ever again of using a flight in the United States of \nAmerica as a weapon of mass destruction. The pilots ought to be able to \nseal that cockpit door, which should have been done--they ought not \nhave to be waiting for legislation. The airlines should not have to \ndelay safety because of bureaucracy. They have pilots to fly \nairplanes--not to fight--once they go on and secure that cockpit door. \nAs the chief pilot of El Al told this Senator: If my wife is being \nassaulted back in the\n\n[[Page S10420]]\n\ncabin, I do not open that door. So everybody will know that, hereafter, \nno matter if they are hijacking a plane to run it into the Golden Gate \nbridge, or into a building, or into the Sears Tower, or anyplace else--\nthey are picking out all kinds of targets in people's minds--airplane \nhijackings are not going to happen; that is done with.\n  We have to move along to protect other terrorist targets, because \nthat is how the terrorist's mind moves. They can maybe get 100 trying \nto wrestle the plane down. I don't believe they can get the plane down. \nOnce the pilot hears a disturbance, yes, people can be hurt, someone \ncan be killed, but he immediately knows his orders. Rather than open \nthe door and say, ``Do you want to go to Cuba? Let's go''--no; now the \ndoors stay closed, and he immediately lands the plane. He wires ahead, \nand the FBI and security is there to take charge. They are not going to \nget very far trying to hijack the plane.\n  Having taken these preventive steps, the Israelis knew, almost proof \npositive, when the plane that came out of Israel and went down with an \nexplosion over the Black Sea, that a bomb had not been put on that \nplane. You have to go through those parameters of defense, of security \nand safety, in Israel. There is no way to get a bomb on the plane \nunless you have the pilots and everybody conspiring together.\n  That is not going to happen. The security system that we have set up \nand planned to pay for was approved by whom? By the pilots. We have \ntheir official approval of our approach in this particular bill. The \nflight attendants approved of it, and begged for it. The executives of \nthe airlines are for it. The municipal associations, the tourism \nassociations--I am getting boiled up.\n  We have held this bill up on the floor for 1 week on the motion to \nproceed. Why? On account of procedural Mickey Mouse nonsense, or--there \nis no better word--constipation. Everybody wants to add this or that \nmeasure onto it. We have to get Amtrak. No. We have to get benefits. \nNo. We have to have a stimulus bill. No. We have to get this. Sure, \nlet's take care of all those issues, but in order.\n  It is unforgivable to stand around here now for a week just on a \nmotion to proceed. Objection just occurred when the distinguished \nranking member of the committee and chief cosponsor said let's move to \nit, debate it, and listen and learn about these amendments, and vote \nthem up or down; that is all. But we apparently have a minority. I am \nready to vote, because I think I have some votes. Being in the minority \ndoes not surprise me, with all the undercurrents and the lobbying going \non by the contractors. We read in Roll Call yesterday that when I am \ntalking on the floor to an empty Senate, the lobbyists are back talking \non individual treatment to the Senators.\n  Should I have to go around and call on the 99 other Senators and \nexplain this bill to them and get past the lobbyists? What has the \nGovernment come to in a time of crisis? Let's move on. Don't wait until \n5 o'clock and maybe then file some amendments and maybe have some more \ncloture and some more delay.\n  This bill, from its origin, should not have been called airline \nsafety but airline stimulus. Ironically, this crowd will go forward \nwith any kind of stimulus.\n  We are under limited time. We are on the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is informed that his 1 hour of \ncloture has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that I continue with an \nadditional hour from any other Senator, that I proceed for another few \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will conclude with a thought I just \nexpressed about stimulus.\n  This measure would stimulate the airline industry--exactly what we \nare trying to do all over America. When you get people traveling, when \nyou get them on the airlines, when you get them in the hotels, when you \nget New York going again, and when you get all of these other places \nback to normalcy, the best way to stimulate the airlines is to get \nsafety for them.\n  What the bureaucracy has done up here with the procedural hangups is \nto give $15 billion to keep the airlines alive and then guarantee that \nthey go broke by not giving them the safety and, therefore, ensure that \nthe traveling public is not on the planes.\n  This is the best way I know of to not just stimulate the airlines and \nair travel but to stimulate the economy. Please come forward. Let's \nmove on this particular bill.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware and the Senator from \nAlaska for indulging me the extra moments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10420-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10420-S10421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEVELOPING A BALANCED ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I will try to be \nbrief to accommodate my colleagues who are seeking recognition.\n  I would like to call attention to a release that came out of the \nmajority and the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senator Jeff Bingaman, indicating that at the request of the \nmajority leader, Senator Daschle, the chairman of the Energy Committee, \nSenator Bingaman, suspend any further markup of energy legislation for \nthis session of Congress. I emphasize ``this session of Congress.'' \nThat sounds pretty definitive to me. Instead, I quote the release:\n\n       The chairman will propose comprehensive and balanced energy \n     legislation that can be added--\n\n  I emphasize ``can be added.'' It doesn't say ``will be added;'' it \nsays ``can be added''--\n\n     by the majority leader to the Senate Calendar for potential \n     action--\n\n  It doesn't say ``action;'' it says ``potential action.''\n  I certainly have the highest respect for the majority leader. I \nnotice that this is very carefully worded. It says that it ``can be \nadded;'' it doesn't say ``will.'' Not that there is a proposed action \nbut ``potential action.''\n  Very frankly, that is not good enough for me. I will ask the majority \nleader to specifically respond as to whether or not he intends to \ndevelop a balanced energy bill. I question the word ``balanced'' \nbecause that means no input from the minority, no input from the \nRepublicans, an effort to circumvent the committee of jurisdiction, the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, of which I am the ranking \nmember. I question how it could be balanced.\n  So I urge the leader to address specifically whether he will take up \nand introduce an energy bill, and whether or not it will be placed on \nthe calendar, and whether or not we will have sufficient time to offer \namendments on the issue of fairness and equity in the contribution of \nthe minority.\n  I would also add, the reason for this action, apparently, is twofold. \nOne is the question of jurisdiction. In other words, there are other \ncommittees involved. There is the Committee on Finance, on which I \nserve, relative to tax implications associated with an energy bill. And \nas you tax forgiveness, accelerated depreciation, here is obviously the \nrole of the Committee on Environment and Public Works in certain \nareas--perhaps the Committee on the Judiciary. But clearly, the \nmajority of the jurisdiction is within the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  We have been working a long time on this. We began and introduced a \nbill early in the session, early in February, as a matter of fact. We \nhave been working with Senator Bingaman on his comprehensive bill. We \nwere committed to try to report out, tomorrow, Senator Bingaman's \nexpedited bill on energy infrastructure, which I support.\n  I do not know the rationale. I can only assume that perhaps the \nleadership thought there was not the votes in the committee to block \ncertain amendments that might come up or perhaps the majority thought \nthere is not the support in the Chamber to stop an energy bill.\n  I think it is interesting to note that the public polling indicates \nabout two-thirds of the individuals polled nationwide support an energy \nbill; polling on the contentious issue of ANWR is about 64 to 36 in \nfavor.\n  So as we address what is behind this shroud of sudden reluctance to \npursue an energy bill, one can only deduce that perhaps they did not \nwant to give the President a victory. The President,\n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\nas we know, presented an energy package very early, an energy task \nforce report, and it worked to try to get that through.\n  We have held numerous hearings. We have had hundreds of witnesses. We \nare about at the altar, so to speak, and suddenly the rug has been \npulled out from under the authorizing committee.\n  Another point that was brought up is that this might be contentious; \nthere might be differences of opinion. That is what the amendment \nprocess is all about. We need a vote. We need a vote, an up-down vote \non an energy package. We need an up-down vote, in a democratic manner, \non the proposed amendments that would be offered.\n  So I would first encourage the majority leader to reconsider his \naction and let the committee do its work and report out a bill and \nschedule it for action on the floor. If he does not, I would ask that \nhe consider giving us the assurance that his bill will go on the \ncalendar prior to adjournment; that we will have time to take up \namendments and debate it in its entirety.\n  Mr. President, I am going to conclude my remarks--and I see another \nSenator seeking recognition--but I will be directing further remarks \nlater on tying in, if you will, how terrorism is funded, and the \nrealization that written statements from bin Laden, who we all agree is \nthe perpetrator, to a large degree, behind much of the terrorism, are \ndirectly related to his appeal to many of the Muslims relative to the \nissue of our increased dependence on Mideast oil and his belief that \nthe United States owes Muslims $36 trillion as a payback for ``the \nbiggest theft in history,'' and that is the purchase of cheap oil from \nthe Persian Gulf.\n  Bin Laden claims that the United States has carried out ``the biggest \ntheft in history'' by buying oil from Persian Gulf countries at low \nprices. According to bin Laden, a barrel of oil today should sell for \n$144. And based on that calculation, he said the Americans have stolen \n$36 trillion from Muslims; and they owe each member of the Muslim faith \n$30,000.\n  There might be some motivation there, but there is certainly a \ncommunication of consideration.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague who is seeking recognition, \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and that my time will count against cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, as it turns out, I am pleased to be \nspeaking immediately after the Senator from Alaska and thank him for \nthe sentiments he shared with all of us. It is not the first time we \nhave heard these sentiments, but it is a message he has delivered \nconsistently.\n  I have been in this body less than a year, as a new Member of the \nSenate. I came to the Senate as an old Governor, as did the Presiding \nOfficer. And we, as Governors, tend to be more anxious to get things \ndone. We are not so much interested in rhetoric, not so much interested \nin symbolism; we want results. We are not interested in process. We \nwant product.\n  Before I ever got into politics, before I moved to Delaware, I was a \nnaval flight officer. I finished up my tour of duty in 1973. I moved to \nDelaware to go to the University of Delaware Business School on the GI \nbill.\n  One of my first memories being in Delaware, 28 years ago, literally \nthis month, was sitting in line to buy gasoline for my car because we \nwere in the midst of an energy crisis--embargo--at the time and it was \ntough to buy gasoline.\n  I thought, 28 years ago, we needed an energy policy for our country. \nTwenty-eight years later, we still need an energy policy for our \ncountry. We did not have one then; and we do not have one now.\n  We have learned a number of difficult lessons coming out of the \ntragic events of September 11, but, for me, one of them is that, more \nthan ever, we need a comprehensive energy policy that will reduce our \nreliance on foreign oil, that will enable us to provide more energy \nfrom within our own country--some of it from corn that is grown in \nIndiana, some of it from soybeans that are raised in Delaware, some of \nit from wind, and even some that is harvested from the Sun. We should \nseek energy from a variety of sources, as well as from the over 500 \nyears of coal beneath the ground of this country, and from nuclear \npowerplants that provide roughly 20 percent of the electricity in this \ncountry.\n\n  And in addition to producing new energy sources, we need to conserve \nenergy. There is so much we can do to conserve energy, and not just \nwith moving from internal combustion engines in our cars, trucks, and \nvans to hybrid-powered vehicles, to eventually, this decade, fuel \ncells. We can literally go out today and buy, off the shelf, air-\nconditioners that use half the electricity that most of the air-\nconditioners in our homes use. The same is true for the furnaces that \nwill warm our homes this winter.\n  The question before us now is, How do we proceed to an energy bill? \nHow do we take it up? I have been urging my leadership, for months now, \nto take up an energy bill. My guess is, before I finish, my leader will \nregret having ever put me on the Energy Committee, but I want us to \ndebate and report to this body, and to debate in this Chamber, an \nenergy bill. I want to have a chance to do it this month. I want us to \nhave a chance to vote up or down on Senator Murkowski's proposal of \nopening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I want us to have a \nchance to vote on a whole host of other issues. But I want us to debate \nthem, and vote on them, and move on. I do not want the debate to be, in \nwhat form do we bring the bill to the floor? Do we go through the \nEnergy Committee? Do we then go through the Finance Committee, and then \nthe Environment and Commerce Committees because they have jurisdiction \nover different parts of the bill.\n  I want to get the bill to the floor. And as we do, I want to make \nsure that the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Delaware, the \nSenator from Indiana, and others, have every opportunity to amend that \nbill in ways that are germane to the legislation that is before us. \nDebate them, vote them up or down, and move on.\n  As it turns out, there is probably a lot more on this front that we \nagree on than we disagree on. One of the ways to find that out for sure \nis to have the debate.\n  I pledge to my colleague from Alaska and my colleague from Indiana to \ndo my dead-level best within the Democratic caucus, within the Energy \nCommittee itself, and with my own leadership to make sure we have the \nopportunity to have fair and open debate on the amendments and a policy \nthat we can then work out with the House and send something to the \nPresident to sign.\n  We may actually have a chance of coming closer to producing a \ncomprehensive energy policy by taking the approach Senator Daschle has \nnow suggested. We may actually have a better chance of getting to the \ndebate and the adoption of an energy bill than we would have had if we \nhad gone to regular order. I was not so sure of that 24 hours ago, but \nhaving thought it through, I think we may enhance the chances for those \nof us who want a comprehensive energy policy.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to work across the aisle, within the \ncommittees of jurisdiction, and in the Chamber, and have a good debate \nthis month or next month and be ready to cast the tough votes and to \nmove on.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10421-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10421-S10423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ANWR\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I call attention to some of the \ncomments made in this Chamber earlier today relative to the issue of \ntaking up a national energy security bill before this\n\n[[Page S10422]]\n\nbody. I spoke a little earlier on the floor today and indicated that, \nclearly, it is in the national interest that we in the Senate proceed \nwith an energy bill--report it out, bring it to the floor, and vote on \namendments in an orderly manner.\n  As I further indicated earlier, the majority leader has indicated \nthat it is his intent to develop an energy bill--in his words, a \n``balanced bill''--and it would be introduced by the majority leader. \nOf course, this excludes the process associated with the committee \nreporting out a bill.\n  Further, in the discussion that has taken place today, the issue of \nANWR came up as the bone of contention. I want to address a couple \npoints because there is a good deal of misunderstanding around this \nissue. There was a reference today that the accident that occurred when \na bullet penetrated the pipeline earlier this week was proof that we \nshould not rely on increasing the supply of oil that would traverse \nthrough that pipeline.\n  I remind my colleagues that that pipeline is about 28 years old. It \nhas provided the Nation with 25 percent of the total crude oil produced \nin the United States for that period of time. That volume has dropped \nfrom 25 percent to 17 percent. The pipeline capacity was a little over \n2 million barrels a day previously, in the early development of the \nPrudhoe Bay oil fields, that flowed through that pipeline. Today, with \nthe decline in Prudhoe Bay, it has dropped a significant amount, to \nroughly 1 million barrels a day. But it still supplies this Nation with \n17 percent of the total crude oil produced in this country.\n  Now, to suggest that this firing by a very high-powered rifle \npenetrated the pipeline is not quite accurate because it has been shot \nat numerous times. It is half-inch, high-tensile steel. It is my \nunderstanding that this particular firing--a blast of five bullets--\npenetrated an area where there is a valve and, as a consequence, \nbecause of pressure in the pipeline, there was a significant leak, a \nspillage. The question of whether there is any permanent damage done \nhas been addressed in the cleanup. There was no movement of any oil \ninto any water or streams in the area. The security group of Alyeska \nfound the incident as a consequence of the notification of a drop in \npressure. They went out with helicopters and not only found the leak \nbut identified and arrested the perpetrators. You can criticize \nanything, but the system did work. Everything is subject to, obviously, \nthe exposure of terrorist activity, but in this particular instance \nthis was a fellow who was extremely drunk, bored, or he lost his mind, \nand he simply decided it would be fun to start firing at the pipeline.\n  That pipeline has been bombed; bombs have been wrapped around it. It \nhas been wrapped with hand grenades, shot at, and it suffered exposure \nof numerous earthquakes over the 27 years and it continues to be one of \nthe wonders of the world. So to suggest that somehow this bullet-\npiercing accident is somehow questionable relative to the integrity of \nthat pipeline is an expression of very little knowledge--factual \nknowledge--on behalf of those who suggest that somehow the pipeline \ncan't be trusted for additional flowthrough if indeed ANWR is \ndeveloped.\n  I am going to conclude, as I promised my friend from Pennsylvania \nthat I would be brief, with an explanation of some of the more common \nmyths associated with the ANWR issue. I hope we can get ANWR up before \nthis body and vote on it up or down in conjunction with an energy bill. \nThat is the democratic process. Clearly, that did not prevail in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee because I can only assume the \nvotes were there to report out a bill with ANWR in it. I can only \nassume the votes are in this body to pass an energy bill with ANWR in \nit. Polling seems to indicate nearly 60 percent of the American public \nsupport opening ANWR as a significant contributor to reducing our \ndependence on imported oil.\n  Some say there is an insufficient amount of oil. Some say it is only \na 6-month supply and not nearly enough to justify exploration. That is \nnonsense. The U.S. Geological Survey, experts who have studied the 1002 \nANWR area, estimate that between 6 and 16 billion barrels of oil are \neconomically recoverable; 10 billion barrels is equivalent to what we \nwould import from Saudi Arabia over a 30-year period; 10 billion \nbarrels is the equivalent of what we import from Iraq for a period of \n50 years.\n  We are importing a million barrels a day from Iraq and enforcing the \nno-fly zone. We are taking the oil, putting it in our airlines, bombing \nsome of the targets in Iraq, and have for some time. They take our \nmoney, pay the Republican Guard, develop a missile capability, and aim \nit at our ally, Israel.\n  Maybe that is a short synopsis of foreign policy, but nevertheless I \nthink one can conclude that is the ultimate outcome.\n  We do not know what is in ANWR because we have never been allowed to \ndetermine through modern exploration, through seismic exploration, \nspecifically what is available. Only Congress can authorize it.\n  What is the extent of the area? It is interesting because ANWR is \nabout 19 million acres--about the size of the State of South Carolina. \nThe proposal is to allow exploration on 1.5 million acres. The House-\npassed bill, which is H.R. 4, has limited that to 2,000 acres. That is \nthe size of a small farm in the entire State of South Carolina--the \nwilderness, if you will, as a comparison.\n  Prudhoe Bay was supposed to produce 10 billion barrels. It is on its \n13 millionth barrel today. It is absurd to think ANWR is only a 6-month \nsupply of oil. That is to assume ANWR is the country's only source of \noil; that there is no oil produced in Texas, or Louisiana, offshore, or \nno other oil is being imported into the country. The American people \nare wise enough to see that argument just does not hold oil, if you \nwill.\n  Clearly, the potential for this country's domestic supply is ANWR, \nand the abundance associated with the likelihood of a major discovery \nis second to none identified in North America. It is almost like \nwondering if you have a strategic petroleum reserve in your own \nbackyard, but if you do not know, and if you do not have the ability to \ndevelop it, you really cannot use it.\n  What is required in development? Very little. We need authorization \nby Congress. The House has done its job. The House passed a bill. H.R. \n4 includes ANWR. It is a challenge to the Senate to do its job.\n  Some say it will take as long as 10 years before the oil is flowing \nand that is too long to make a difference. If the previous President \nhad not vetoed the budget reconciliation bill in 1995, today ANWR would \nbe open, or if the oil was not there, it might have been a park. We \ncould have been less dependent on foreign oil, and our energy future \nwould look a lot more certain if, indeed, we had taken that action back \nin 1995, but we could not overcome a Presidential veto.\n\n  We built the Pentagon in 18 months. We built the Empire State \nBuilding in a year. Industry says if they make a discovery, they can \ndevelop and get oil online in somewhere between 18 months and 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, depending on our will to give them the authority within the \nenvironmental parameters to do it safely.\n  Some people say our energy policy is misguided; we need to focus on \nnatural gas. We found 6 trillion cubic feet. Let's use gas. Recognize \nthat America moves on oil. Our planes, our ships, our trains move on \noil.\n  In response to the September 11 attack, we are preparing now for a \nlong, sustained war. Are we going to count on unstable governments in \nthe very part of the world where we are fighting to assure our energy \nsecurity? We need to begin at home with energy solutions found within \nour borders, and if we make the commitment to authorize the opening of \nthis area, I assure my colleagues it will be very symbolic. It would \nsend a very solid message to that part of the world were we to continue \nto increase our dependence on imported oil.\n  About 67 percent comes from foreign sources, a majority of that from \nthe Mideast. Fighting a war uses a lot of energy. Mr. President, \n450,000 barrels of petroleum products were estimated to be used daily, \nand that was through 582,000 soldiers in the Persian Gulf war. It is \nestimated we are using over 500,000 barrels a day currently in this \nconflict.\n\n[[Page S10423]]\n\n  Some say it is America's Serengeti, its mountains; it is deserted; it \nis beautiful. Again, it is the size of the State of South Carolina. It \nis 19 million acres. Can we open it safely? Yes.\n  Some say we can get the energy from the National Petroleum Reserve in \nAlaska; that is why it was established. That is wishful thinking \nbecause actually just 15 percent of that entire coastline is open for \nexploration. Just 3 years ago, the Federal Government closed vast \namounts of NPR to protect the birds that live in the lakes. If you look \nat the model and lakes over NPR, that is where bird life is. There are \nvery few lakes associated in the ANWR area.\n  Finally, there is a concern of the Porcupine caribou and the \nGwich'ins, but no one mentioned what is happening on the Canadian side \nand involvement of the Gwich'ins who are participants in putting up \nland for lease.\n  There was an extraordinary article in the Vancouver Sun newspaper \nindicating the Gwich'ins are benefiting greatly from oil and gas \nexploration because Canada expanded its oil and gas leasing program to \ninclude testing exploratory wells, et cetera.\n  The bottom line is there seems to be a great fear suddenly to take up \nan energy bill, with no particular explanation, particularly when the \nadministration has encouraged Congress to take it up, particularly when \nthe House has done its job, and now we are advised by the majority \nleader that the committee of jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, is going to suspend any further markup on energy \nlegislation for ``this session''--this session.\n  I have a press release that states that instead the chairman will \npropose comprehensive and balanced energy legislation. The chairman \nwill. It does not say with the participation of the committee or the \nminority or the Republicans. It says the chairman outside the \nparameters of the committee.\n  It further says ``the comprehensive and balanced legislation that can \nbe added''--it does not say ``will be added;'' it says ``can be \nadded''--``by the majority leader to the Senate calendar for,'' it \nsays, ``potential action.'' It does not say ``action.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the press release be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Energy Committee Suspends Mark-Ups; Will Propose Comprehensive and \n             Balanced Energy Legislation to Majority Leader\n\n       At the request of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman today suspended any further mark-up of energy \n     legislation for this session of Congress. Instead, the \n     Chairman will propose comprehensive and balanced energy \n     legislation that can be added by the Majority Leader to the \n     Senate Calendar for potential action prior to adjournment.\n       Noted Bingaman, It has become increasingly clear to the \n     Majority Leader and to me that much of what we are doing in \n     our committee is starting to encroach on the jurisdictions of \n     many other committees. Additionally, with the few weeks \n     remaining in this session, it is now obvious to all how \n     difficult it is going to be for these various committees to \n     finish their work on energy-related provisions.\n       Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Bingaman said, the \n     Senate's leadership sincerely wants to avoid quarrelsome, \n     divisive votes in committee. At a time when Americans all \n     over the world are pulling together with a sense of oneness \n     and purpose, Congress has an obligation at the moment to \n     avoid those contentious issues that divide, rather than \n     unite, us.\n       Bingaman will continue to consult and build consensus with \n     members of his committee, with other committee chairs and \n     with other Senators as he finalizes a proposal to present to \n     the Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I encourage again the majority leader to reflect on \nthis action, give us the assurance he will take it up during this \nsession and allow sufficient time for Members to provide for \namendments, provide us with an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote \non contentious issues, and that we meet our obligation as the Senate, \nas the House of Representatives has done, in addressing what is in the \nnational security interests of our Nation, and that is the passage of \nthe comprehensive energy bill.\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for allowing me this extra \nopportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer thanks and praise \nfor a world leader who has been as stalwart and as loyal an ally for \nthe United States as anyone could ever ask.\n  These past few weeks, British Prime Minister Tony Blair has gone \nabove and beyond the call of duty for America. He has left no doubt \nthat we will be able to count on him and his country over the long \nhaul.\n  To paraphrase his own words, he was with us at the first and he will \nstay with us to the last.\n  He was there in the gallery of the House of Representatives when \nPresident Bush made his moving and forceful speech to this Nation in a \njoint session of this Congress.\n  He was there at Ground Zero in New York City, witnessing the \ndestruction with his own eyes and mourning what he called ``the \nslaughter of thousands of innocents.''\n  He was there in Pakistan, near the dangerous heart of this war, \nreassuring a nervous Pakistani President that he made the right \ndecision in choosing the United States over the Taliban regime.\n  Since September 11, Tony Blair has served valiantly as our voluntary \nambassador to the world.\n  In London, Berlin, Paris, New York, Washington, Brussells, Moscow, \nIslamabad, New Delhi, and Geneva, Blair has rallied international \nleaders and built a coalition of support for the United States. He has \ndone so with a diplomacy, eloquence and strong resolve reminiscent of \nWinston Churchill during his finest hours.\n  In his latest brilliant stroke, Blair acted swiftly when he saw Osama \nbin Laden's videotaped speech Sunday night. Blair immediately summoned \na reporter from the Arabic network to his office at 10 Downing Street \nand taped his own strong rebuttal to bin Laden. It aired on the same \nday, on the same Arabic network.\n  It should not be surprising that Blair would rise to the occasion as \nably and powerfully as he has. The British have a tough, resolute \nattitude when it comes to defending themselves. They are willing to \ntake risks on the battlefield. They are willing to risk casualties for \nthe greater good. They are the ones you want on your side in times like \nthese.\n  He was with us at the first, and he will stay with us to the last, he \nsaid. For that, we owe Tony Blair our deepest gratitude. We could not \nask any more of him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator \nseeking recognition, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to \nspeak up to 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10423-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10423-S10427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS STRUCTURAL REORGANIZATION OF THE FEDERAL \n                               GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \npending emergency caused by the horrific terrorist attacks on September \n11. There is a need for some structural reorganization of the Federal \nGovernment in accordance with the recommendations of a number of \ndistinguished commissions which have studied these problems and in \naccordance with our own findings, as we have worked through the matters \nin the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. There is also the need for legislation to expand the powers \nof law enforcement on terrorists.\n  With respect to the newly created Office of Homeland Security, it is \nmy thought there needs to be a structure whereby the position is made a \nCabinet position. The Federal Government is fortunate to have secured \nthe services of former Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania to take on \nthis responsibility. For the moment, the office has been created in the \nexecutive branch by an Executive Order, and I believe former\n\n[[Page S10424]]\n\nGovernor Ridge is correct when he says, even though other Government \nofficials may not necessarily listen to him if there are turf battles, \nthey certainly will listen to the President. That, I do believe, is \ntrue, as former Governor Ridge has represented it.\n  When we talk about homeland security and that function, we are \ntalking about something which needs to be institutionalized in order to \ngo beyond the term of any President, to go beyond the term of any \nperson who is in charge of that Department, and that, in accordance \nwith our structure of Government, requires legislative action, in my \njudgment. This is something which we will have to work through with \nPresident Bush, with former Governor Ridge, and with the executive \nbranch. However, I offer these thoughts as many Members of Congress are \nnow considering this issue and considering legislation.\n  Representative Thornberry has already introduced legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives. Senator Lieberman is working on similar \nlegislation. Senator Robert Graham of Florida is working on \nlegislation, as well. My staff and I have been in the process of \nworking on legislation which I am not yet prepared to introduce, but at \nthe conclusion of these remarks I will ask that draft copies of two \nbills be printed in the Record.\n  We have had a number of very distinguished commissions analyze these \nproblems. We have had the Hart-Rudman Commission analyze the problems \ndirected to a secure national homeland. That commission pointed out \nthat the keys to prevention are the following tools: 1. diplomacy; 2. \nU.S. diplomatic, intelligence, and military presence overseas; 3. \nvigilant systems of border security and surveillance. In order to \nenhance the effectiveness of the third key, the Hart-Rudman Commission \nrecommended creating a national homeland security agency which would \nconsist of the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, the Border Patrol, and \nFEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The legislation I am \nsubmitting today, which is in draft form, would adopt the \nrecommendations of the Hart-Rudman Commission.\n  There has been another distinguished commission, the Brown-Rudman \nCommission, which has studied the issues of intelligence and has come \nup with a method and a procedure for streamlining and restructuring the \nintelligence community.\n  One of the considerations is that in many Departments of the Federal \nGovernment, there are smaller intelligence agencies, for example, in \nthe Departments of Treasury, State, Agriculture, and many other \nDepartments.\n  At the present time, there is no effective way for dealing with all \nof these various Departments. The recommendation of the Brown-Rudman \nCommission was to consolidate and centralize, to give greater authority \nand power to the Director of Central Intelligence. The Director is \ncharged not only with the operation of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nbut also with the oversight of all the intelligence functions in the \nUnited States.\n  Now, there has admittedly been some gaps and some failures--some \nmajor gaps and some major failures--in these turf battles. During the \n1995-1996 session of Congress, I had the privilege of serving as the \nChairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I served in that \nposition for 2 years, in addition to the 6 other years of service on \nthe Intelligence Committee. There is a term limit of eight years on the \nIntelligence Committee. During the course of that work, I saw the turf \nbattles among the various agencies and became very deeply involved in \nthe issue of weapons of mass destruction, finding that there were \ndozens of agencies dealing with that issue.\n  In the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, a \ncommission was created to study weapons of mass destruction. The \ncommission was chaired by former CIA Director John Deutch, and I served \nas the Vice Chairman of that commission. During the course of the \ncommission work--work that was very similar to that of the Hart-Rudman \nCommission, the Rumsfeld Commission, and the Brown-Rudman Commission--\nwe noted the difficulties accorded to all of these important \nactivities. It was the judgment of that commission that the structure \nbe given to the Vice President of the United States on the ground that \nhe or she--whoever the Vice President may be--would be the only \nindividual, except for the President, who could handle intelligence \ncoordination and the kinds of turf battles which are inevitable when \nthere are numerous intelligence agencies at the Departments of State, \nDefense, Treasury, and Justice.\n  So, it is my thought that we need to address the intelligence \nfunction so that we have the appropriate coordination and so that we do \nnot have somebody on the FBI Watch List who enters the United States, \nbuys an airplane ticket, and later becomes a terrorist, such as those \nthat were part of the massive attack on September 11.\n  The legislation which I suggest seeks to accomplish a structure for \nhomeland security and also revises the intelligence functions of the \nU.S. Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent to submit the text of a draft bill--and I \nemphasize that it is a draft because we are working on this with quite \na number of Members--entitled ``Homeland Defense Act of 2001.'' I ask \nthat this draft bill be printed in the Congressional Record at the \nconclusion of these remarks. I further ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of a draft bill--and again, I emphasize draft because we are still \nworking on it entitled ``Intelligence Reform Act of 2001'' be printed \nin the Congressional Record at the conclusion of these comments.\n  There being no objection, the draft bills were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. --\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I will further discuss briefly the \nterrorism legislation which we expect to come to the floor later today. \nI have a reservation of some 30 minutes on the unanimous consent \nagreement which will be propounded later by the majority leader, but I \nthink a few comments are in order at this time.\n  I have no doubt that there is a need for expanded law enforcement \nauthority. That has been demonstrated by the fact that offenses of \nterrorism do not have the availability of electronics surveillance \nwhich other offenses can employ. This is demonstrated by the fact that \nthere have been significant failures under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act and that the Attorney General has represented a need \nto have additional detention for aliens who are subject to deportation.\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\n  When the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing two weeks ago \nyesterday, I questioned Attorney General John Ashcroft on the record \nabout the scope of the Anti-Terrorism bill. The bill did not delineate \nthe Attorney General's needs for law enforcement. Attorney General \nAshcroft commented that what the Department of Justice had in mind was \nthe detention of aliens who were subject to deportation. It may well be \nthat there is existing authority for the Attorney General to accomplish \nthat, but if additional authority is necessary, then I think the \nCongress is prepared to give that additional authority. However, the \nbill as drafted, did not so delineate the detention to those subject to \ndeportation.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft further made representations about the need \nto change the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He said before \nlooking to use content there would be a statement of probable cause. \nAgain, in reviewing the specific legislation, that was not present in \nthe bill, so there had to be a revision of the text of the bill.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee had only an hour and 20 minutes of \nhearings, two weeks ago yesterday. The Constitutional Law Subcommittee \nhad hearings last Thursday morning. I have grave concerns that there \nhas not been sufficient deliberation that would establish a record and \nwithstand a constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. I will expand upon this point during the course of the \nconsideration of the bill later today or tomorrow morning and will cite \nthe Supreme Court decisions which have struck down acts of Congress \nwhere a sufficient showing of the deliberative process has been \nlacking.\n  In my judgment, that has been an overextension, a usurpation, by the \nSupreme Court of the United States of the separation of the powers. For \nthe Supreme Court of the United States, in effect, to tell Congress \nthat Congress has not ``thought through'' legislation that is part of \nthe congressional function, that legislation violates a specific term \nor provision of the Constitution, that it is vague and ambiguous in \nviolation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, or that \nCongress has run afoul of some other constitutional provision, then so \nbe it. However, it seems to me an extraordinary stretch of judicial \nauthority for the Supreme Court to say that the Congress has not been \nsufficiently deliberative, and that only the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States can gauge what is sufficiency on the deliberative \nprocess. That is the case law.\n  In the absence of hearings and in the absence of a record, there is a \nconcern on my part that the legislation will withstand constitutional \nmuster. There is no doubt there is a need to act with dispatch.\n  In my judgment, and I have communicated this to the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we could have held a \nhearing three weeks ago. We could have worked on a Friday or Saturday. \nThat is not beyond the workload of the Senate. Perhaps, we could have \nheld closed sessions on confidential material. Also, we could have \nmarked up the bill, undergoing the usual deliberative process--the \nSenate Judiciary Committee works on bills of much lesser importance--\nand then have had it reported to the floor. Instead, the bill lay \nunproduced and held at the desk for action under Rule 14 without that \ncustomary committee hearing process, committee deliberation, and \ncommittee markup in executive session.\n  I thought, in the absence of any other Senator in the Chamber, that \nit would be appropriate to make a few comments in that regard at this \ntime.\n  But there is no doubt that there is a very heavy overhang on \nWashington, DC, at the present time as a result of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. That very heavy overhang really exists, as I see it, \nacross the country. I felt this when Senator Santorum and I went to \nSomerset County, Pennsylvania on September 14, 3 days after the \nSeptember 11 attack. Although there had been no casualties on the \nground, 40 Americans had lost their lives in that ill-fated plane, and \nthere was a great urgency in hearing from Washington, D.C. alongside a \ngreat sense of concern.\n  Earlier today I went to Pennsylvania to meet with the Pennsylvania \nBusiness Roundtable. Again, there is a sense in the air of a heavy \ncloud over America, which we have to work through. I am confident that \nwe will. I believe the Bush administration has done an excellent job in \norganizing an international coalition and not acting precipitously, but \nrather, acting very carefully. I believe Osama bin Laden will be \nbrought to justice.\n  In the interim, as we look through the kinds of problems which law \nenforcement faces, I think it is important for Congress to have acted \nwith dispatch--really even earlier than that. However, that could be \ndone only with appropriate regard for constitutional rights. We can \nhave deliberation, with hearings and analysis, get the job done for law \nenforcement, and protect constitutional rights at the same time. As we \nwork through the very important issue of homeland security and the \nissue of reorganization of the intelligence community, I welcome \ncomments from my colleagues on the draft legislation which I am \nsubmitting into the Record. It is going to require collaboration from \nmany Members.\n  As I have said, Congressman Thornberry has already introduced \nlegislation in the House; Senator Lieberman and Senator Robert Graham \nof Florida are working on it, as am I. I think from this we can \nstructure some legislative changes which can better protect America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was not able to be here prior to the \nstatement of the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. I would note \nboth on the Intelligence Committee and on the Judiciary Committee his \nhas been one of the most consistent and most clear voices on these \nissues. In fact, one of the things that disappointed me when we brought \nup the terrorism bill is the Attorney General was able to stay there \nonly for part of the hearing. I was glad he was able to stay long \nenough for what was intended to be the first round of questioning, \nquestioning from the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. He has a way of \ngetting to the crux of the matter. I would have liked to have gone \nfurther on that.\n  These are serious matters. I get concerned when we have to rush \nthings through without the kind of deliberation and scrutiny they \ndeserve. The Senator from Pennsylvania has raised the obvious fact of \nmaking, for constitutional purposes, a record demonstrating legislative \nintent. Among all the suggestions he made, this is one to which we \nshould pay the most attention. Sometimes as we rush--I say that as one \nwho wants to get a terrorism bill up here and voted on, and hoping the \nHouse can do the same and we can get on to conference. But, frankly, we \ncan spend a lot of time on this floor sometimes debating matters that \nare of minuscule moment and we would be better off if we did the kind \nof long-range thinking that he and others have discussed.\n  I think in the report, our former colleagues, Senator Rudman of New \nHampshire and Senator Hart of Colorado, after September 11, after the \nfact, made everybody come and dust them off and say a lot of what \nhappened was predicted here, and how we respond to it.\n  I worry sometimes also we think by passing a new law we will protect \nourselves. We will go back, the Senate will go back--and I am sure the \nHouse will, too--and review the files of the Department of Justice, the \nFBI, and others for information that was there and perhaps not looked \nat nor acted upon prior to September 11. That is not to find scapegoats \nbut to say: Was this a mistake? Had it been done differently would we \nhave stopped this terrorist attack?\n  Sometimes we close the barn door after the horse has been stolen. We \nspend billions of dollars around this country so you cannot drive a car \nbomb into the lobby of buildings. In this case, the bomb came through \nthe 80th floor of the building.\n  We should look at this matter very carefully, find out where mistakes \nwere made prior to the 11th--and there were--find out what is needed, \nand I suspect it will not be just new laws but new ways of doing things \nto take care of it.\n  On the question of better use of computers, certainly the better use \nof translators, if you have after the fact\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\nthe Attorney General and the FBI Director having to go on public \ntelevision saying, please, we need some people and we will pay $35 or \n$40 an hour to translate Arabic material or whatever other languages, \nsomebody has to ask the question: Why weren't you doing that before?\n  There are so many things we have to do.

Mr. President, today is one of the days I have had kind of \na bittersweet experience. For me, the bittersweet experience was going \nto the funeral of the former distinguished majority leader of the \nSenate for 16 years, Mike Mansfield; bitter because you never want to \nsee such a person and such a giant's life come to an end; sweet though \nbecause he had 98 very fulfilling years.\n  At the end of those 98 years, we listened to the tales from his \nfamily, associates, and others who reminded all of us what a great man \nhe was. The irony is that Senator Mansfield would not have let any one \nof us talk on at such length and be so praiseworthy about him here on \nthe floor. He was very modest. But I thought of the wonderful moments \nthat could remind each other--those of us who had the privilege of \nserving with Senator Mansfield and those of us who came later--of what \na great man he was.\n  I first met Mike Mansfield when I was Senator-elect. I came in here \nas a 34-year-old prosecutor. The terms actually overlapped. I came into \nthis building I used to visit as a law student. But now I carried this \nmantle of U.S. Senator, and I was probably far more nervous than I once \nwas as a law student.\n  Senator Mansfield was one of the first people I got to see. I \nremember him inviting me into his office. He asked if I wanted some \ncoffee. My nerves were shaky enough at that point, I didn't need it, \nbut I said: Of course. He poured it out and handed it to me. He asked \nme about my life, and all that. I was trying to ask questions.\n  I always called him Mr. Leader. But I remember one thing he said was: \nYou are going to be here at least 6 years. You may be here a lot \nlonger. But remember, in the Senate we keep our word. And if you commit \nto something, if you tell another Senator you are going to do \nsomething, then always keep your word, even if it turns out that \npolitically it is not going to be helpful for you because it is the \nonly way we can operate in this body. We do it on trust.\n  He also said: The other thing is, if you vote on something, and \nafterward you think you cast the wrong vote, don't worry about it. I \nguarantee you, the issue will come up again, and you will get to vote \nthe right way.\n  He was right on both occasions. I have cast votes that afterward I \nthought: That was kind of a dumb thing to do. I will wait for another \ntime to bring it up. It will come back up, and I can vote the right \nway.\n  But I do remember what Senator Mansfield said: Keep your word. You \nalways keep your word.\n  We had some real giants serving in the Senate at that time. I \nremember Senator Mansfield, when things would get bogged down in this \nChamber, would come through and sort of tap a few people on the \nshoulder and suggest they come in the back room; and then we would pass \na great deal of legislation in that back room, as Senator Mansfield \nwould puff on his pipe, and with very few words he would get warring \nparties to seek peace and move on with the Nation's business.\n  He was very nice to my family. He used to give a speech every year to \nthe caucus, saying: There is no seniority. There is no juniority. We \nare all equal. He gave that speech one day, and Senator Abourezk of \nSouth Dakota, who, like me, was one of the most junior Members here, \nstood up and said: Mr. Leader, I was so impressed with that speech, \nespecially as one of the most junior Members, that there is no \nseniority, no juniority. Senator Mansfield thanked him for his \nstatement, and Senator Abourezk said: Because of that, could I borrow \nyour limousine and driver tonight? Senator Mansfield took the pipe out \nof his mouth and, with a quiet smile, said: No.\n  There were certain limits, but then, when I was a young Senator, he \nloaned that limousine to my wife Marcelle and me and our three children \nto go to a movie premier and then to drive elsewhere to meet the cast \nafterward.\n  I recall so many times, when I was stuck here late in this Chamber \nand I could not get home to my family, that my children would remind \nme, when I came home and apologized: Remember that wonderful evening \nSenator Mansfield let us take his car and even use the telephone in it.\n  He would do things like that. He cared very much about those of us \nwho had young children. One, he remembered the names of the children \nwho would come in here with us. Even a few months ago, when I ran into \nhim at an event, we started talking, and he immediately asked: How is \nMarcelle? He started naming the children. What a remarkable person.\n  He taught Senators that you have certain responsibilities. There are \nonly 100 of us at any given time to represent the country, but within \nresponsibilities you can have personal relationships across the aisle.\n  I remember Hugh Scott, traveling with both of them on the plane and \nthem puffing on their pipes. But those personal relationships made the \nSenate work so well.\n\n  I remember the great speech he gave in the Leader's Lecture Series in \nthe Old Senate Chamber. It was the speech\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\nhe was going to give on a Friday afternoon on November 22, 1963. As he \nwalked in this Chamber to give it, he was told that President Kennedy \nhad been shot. But he gave it in the Old Senate Chamber, and it was \njust as new as it would have been then, just as responsive.\n  He said: We have to lower the level of partisanship. We have to work \ntogether--of course, not give up our principles--this is not a unibody \nof opinion--and have the personal relationships that make it work.\n  He spoke in many ways. He was from a different era of the Senate, but \nin many ways a better era, where individual Senators, person to person, \nwould work out problems. I think today, as I have seen so many Senators \ncome together on some of these problems since the terrible events of \nSeptember 11, Senator Mansfield would be proud of us for doing that.\n  People sometimes ask me what I consider the greatest thing about \nbeing a U.S. Senator. I always say one of the greatest was having \nSenator Mansfield here as leader when I came to the Senate. I have \nserved wonderful leaders in both parties, but what he did to help all \nof us, as new Senators--to talk with us, to advise us, to work with us, \nto make us feel we belonged; and then to ask us to make sure others \nfelt they belonged--was unique. The country was better for his service \nin the Senate.\n  I think life has shown that each one of us, whether we are leader or \nnot, has the privilege of being 1 of the 100 people in this Chamber who \nserve our Nation of a quarter of a billion people. And we owe great \nresponsibilities to each other and to the country. That is a great \nlegacy.\n  So I say it was bittersweet to be there. But it was wonderful to \ncelebrate such a full, full life, a life that so few people ever equal. \nSo I bid adieu to a dear friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life \nof a great American, former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, who \npassed away on October 5 at the age of 98.\n  Senator Mansfield's legacy as a Member of Congress will leave a \nshadow as long as his very life. Born in New York, the son of Irish \nimmigrants, in 1903, Michael Joseph Mansfield experienced tragedy at an \nearly age when his mother died when he was only 3. Sent to live with \nrelatives in Great Falls, MT, Senator Mansfield soon began a lifetime \nof hard work, first in the family grocery store, then enlisting in the \nNavy before his 15th birthday, and later, when the Navy discharged the \nyoung Senator Mansfield after discovering he was underage, serving in \nthe United States Army and Marine Corps, all before the age of 20. In \n1922, Senator Mansfield returned to Montana and began working as a \n``mucker'' in the copper mines near Butte, MT. Five years later, he met \nMaureen Hayes, to whom he would be married from 1932 until her death \njust last year.\n  It was his wife that encouraged Senator Mansfield to continue his \neducation, first at the Montana School of Mines then completing his \nhigh school education through correspondence courses. In 1930, he left \nthe copper mines and enrolled in the University of Montana where he \nlater became a professor of Far Eastern and Latin American history and \npolitical science after completing graduate work at the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley.\n  Although he did not follow a traditional path, Senator Mansfield's \neducation provided him with the background that would allow him to \nbecome one of Congress' foremost experts on foreign affairs. After \nlosing his first bid for elected office, Senator Mansfield was elected \nto the House of Representatives in 1942 and was immediately assigned to \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee. Just two years later, then-\nRepresentative Mansfield was sent on a confidential fact-finding \nmission to China by President Franklin Roosevelt, returning in 1945 to \nreport on the state of that nation. In 1952, he narrowly defeated an \nincumbent to win a seat in the Senate where he was again called upon to \nuse his expertise on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, completing \nanother fact-finding trip, this time to Indochina, and serving as a \nrepresentative to the Manila Conference.\n  Outside the realm of foreign affairs, Senator Mansfield quickly rose \nthrough the ranks of Senate leadership, first as party whip in 1957 and \nbecoming the Democratic Majority Leader just four years later in 1961. \nIn his 16 years as Majority Leader, Senator Mansfield helped steer the \nNation through some of our most difficult times. After President \nKennedy's assassination in 1963, Senator Mansfield delivered a eulogy \nat a Capitol Rotunda memorial service that was broadcast across the \ncountry and helped all Americans mourn the loss of our great President. \nSenator Mansfield was a vocal critic of our Nation's involvement in the \nVietnam War, and warned three administrations, from Eisenhower to \nJohnson, about the extent of U.S. military actions there. Although his \nposition on the Vietnam War strained his relations with the Johnson \nadministration, he was able to work with the President on passage of \nlandmark civil rights legislation. The turmoil of that era was \nimmediately followed by the Watergate scandal that resulted in the \nresignation of President Nixon and shook the faith of some Americans in \nour government. But throughout all of these trying times, Senator \nMansfield led the Senate with quiet determination that exemplified his \nservice in Congress.\n  And that truly is how we will remember Senator Mansfield. Through the \nmost difficult of times, Senator Mansfield led this great body with a \nsense of purpose and integrity. He put his trust in the rules and \nprocedures of the Senate to reach a result that was right for the \nAmerican people. He encouraged Committee Chairmen to lead Senate debate \non bills under their jurisdiction, and inspired young Senators to make \ntheir voices heard on the floor. He delegated responsibility to others, \nmaking the Senate a more democratic place, instead of a body dominated \nby the ``old guard.'' And when the Senate failed to live up to the high \nideals embodied in the Constitution, Senator Mansfield would say so. It \nhas been reported many times in the past few days that Senator \nMansfield nearly resigned his position as Majority Leader in 1963. \nFollowing President Kennedy's assassination, Senator Mansfield put that \nspeech aside, but delivered the remarks in 1998 as part of a lecture \nseries in the Old Senate Chamber. We would be wise to remember those \nwords now, and to follow Senator Mansfield's example of thoughtful \nconsideration and respect for others in the difficult times we face \ntoday.\n  Senator Mansfield's service to our Nation did not end with the 16 \nyears he spent as Majority Leader. His expertise on Far East matters \nled very different Presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, to \nchoose him as their ambassador to Japan. Ambassador Mansfield spent 11 \nyears in this difficult diplomatic post. After leaving Tokyo in 1987, \nthe Japanese ambassador to this country predicted the Ambassador \n``could have run for prime minister and won.'' Leaving public service, \nSenator Mansfield would still not retire and served as a senior advisor \non East Asian affairs to Goldman, Sachs until his recent death. He \nremained active in policy matters and the Senate remained close to his \nheart as he attended the Senate's weekly prayer breakfasts on a regular \nbasis.\n  Mike Mansfield brought to the United States Senate some of the best \ncharacteristics of Montanans, he addressed issues in a straight-\nforward, honest way, never forgot the people that put him in office, \nprovided a calming influence in good times and bad. In a turbulent and \nuncertain time, Senator Mansfield was a beacon of dignity, common \nsense, intelligence, and above all, wisdom. I would like to offer my \ncondolences to his daughter, Anne, his granddaughter, and his many \nfriends and admirers here in Washington and in his beloved home State \nof Montana.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10430-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10430-S10431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONSIDERATION OF AN ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I want to just make a few brief points \nregarding an announcement I made last evening about how we would try to \nproceed through the remainder of the session to get consideration of an \nenergy\n\n[[Page S10431]]\n\nbill. I indicated in that announcement that the majority leader had \nasked me to work with other Senators on the Energy Committee, as well \nas Senators on other committees, to put together a proposal that could \nbe brought to the floor by the leadership for consideration, and that \nin light of that, we would not proceed to try to mark up a bill in the \nEnergy Committee, as I expect probably there will not be markups of \nother portions of a proposed energy bill in some of other committees \nthat would have jurisdiction.\n  First, as I understand it, the majority leader's assignment was \nclear. He wants the Senate to be in a position to move to consideration \nof an energy bill in a timely fashion. And it was his view that this \nprocess of putting a bill together, and hopefully on a consensus basis, \ninvolving input from all Senators--Democrats and Republicans--was the \nbest way to do that.\n  We will now have an opportunity to deal with some of the energy \nissues that cross committee jurisdictional lines; and there are many of \nthose. I think it is clear to people that many of the energy issues \nalso involved the Environment and Public Works Committee. There are \nclearly issues involving the Finance Committee regarding energy-related \ntax incentives or incentives for use of particular types of energy. All \nof that, of course, would be expected to be part of a larger piece of \nlegislation with which the Senate would deal.\n  Second, I want to respond to a couple of the comments that were made \nearlier in this Chamber by some of my colleagues, particularly on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, indicating that they believed this was \npartisan and this would make the consideration of energy in the Senate \na partisan issue.\n  I see it as just the opposite. I am interested in the input from all \nSenators. I think those on the committee know I have invested a \nsubstantial amount of time, in the past several months, seeking and \nhaving individual meetings with Senators on both sides of the aisle to \ndiscuss some of these difficult issues.\n  My hope is that we can put together a piece of legislation that will \nreflect the provisions around which we can form a consensus; and some \nof those will come from the Republican side of the aisle and, \ncertainly, some will come from the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  My colleagues on the committee are aware we have made that effort to \nwork in a bipartisan way. I see no disadvantage to any member of the \ncommittee from the procedure the majority leader has proposed. If there \nare good ideas related to energy policy, of course, the first choice \nwould be to try to have them included in the bill the majority leader \nbrings up for consideration. If those ideas are not included in that \npackage, for whatever reason, any Senator, whether Democrat or \nRepublican, would be in a position to offer those as an amendment.\n  I don't see anyone being disadvantaged by the procedure the majority \nleader has proposed. I was disappointed to hear in one of the \nstatements this morning a somewhat colorful account of how this \ndecision was supposed to have been made. That purported account was not \naccurate in any respect, as far as I know. The decision was simply made \nby the majority leader that if we proceeded in this way, in his view, \nthis process would hold out the best chance for us to get an energy \nbill considered by the Senate and passed in a timely fashion. On that \nbasis, it is advisable for all Senators to support the decision of the \nmajority leader to try to move ahead on a bipartisan basis. That will \ncertainly be my best effort in the committee.\n  I look forward to working with all colleagues, both on the Energy \nCommittee and with other committees that claim jurisdiction and have \njurisdiction on different aspects of a comprehensive energy bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address \nthe Senate for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10431-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10431-S10432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRANSPORTATION SAFETY\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I am sensitive to the desire of \nMembers of the Senate to avoid extraneous issues in this debate. The \nneed for airline security is self-evident. The failure of confidence in \nour Nation's airlines is having a devastating economic impact on the \ncountry and its economy.\n  I am certain Members of the Senate will understand that to those I \nrepresent, indeed to millions of other Americans around the country, \nrailroad or bus or other modes of transportation safety are not only \nnot extraneous, they are central. Three hundred thousand residents of \nNew York and New Jersey cross the Hudson and East Rivers every day to \ntheir homes and places of business. Indeed, a significant multiple of \nthe number of people who fly on airplanes every day is on these \ncommuter trains. I cannot suggest to them that somehow their lives or \ntheir fortunes are less important than those who are on airplanes.\n  It appears to me the debate in the Senate to concentrate exclusively \non airplane safety is based on the assumption that terrorists will \naccommodate us by choosing the same means, employing the same strategy \nto strike our country that they used previously. Why is it that I doubt \nthey will be so accommodating?\n  There is nothing about an airplane that somehow makes it more \nvulnerable than a bus or a train or, for that matter, a powerplant or a \nreservoir. But as this legislation is focused on transportation and the \nassurance of safety and security, it must, therefore, by necessity, \ninclude other modes of transportation, particularly when those other \nmodes are utilized by millions and millions of Americans and where the \nexposure to potential danger is so enormous.\n  I will use for illustration simply those that are utilized by my own \nState of New Jersey because I know them so well. I suspect the \narguments I will share with the Senate could be made by the Senators \nfrom California or Massachusetts or Illinois or Florida, Missouri, or a \nhost of other States that have large metropolitan areas.\n  In Penn Station in New York, through which hundreds, thousands of New \nJersey residents travel every week, there are six tunnels that began \nconstruction in 1911. The four tunnels under the East River and those \nunder the Hudson are 2\\1/2\\ miles long. As I suggested, they \naccommodate 300,000 people.\n  In August the State of New York, by a strange coincidence, issued a \npublic report which concluded the tunnels are ``woefully inadequate to \ndeal with a major fire, accident, terrorist attack or other emergency \nsituation.''\n  The report went on to explain that the tunnels lack escape routes for \nthe up to 2,000 people who can ride on a single commuter or Amtrak \ntrain. They are without anything but the most basic of ventilation and \ndo not even have standing water pipes which today would be required in \neven the most modest of such facilities under current construction \nrules.\n  The chart on my left illustrates for a major tunnel that can \naccommodate up to 2 trains and can have 2,000 people on every train, \nthe kind of ventilation that is used is small, singular fans. If there \nwere for some reason a fire on this train because of a terrorist act, \nit would not begin to be adequate to help the escaping passengers.\n  The second chart illustrates something even more troublesome: For the \n2\\1/2\\-mile tunnel under the Hudson River, accommodating tens of \nthousands of commuters every day, a single spiral staircase through \nwhich 2,000 people would have to climb 90 feet while firefighters were \nusing it as the only entrance to get to a burning train. It would not \nhappen. Indeed, they would be lost.\n  The greatest illustration of this is that the published plans of the \nfire department call for using a locomotive to tow the burning train \nout of the tunnels with passengers on board. It is assumed they could \nnot exit.\n  I use New York and New Jersey as the illustration. Were I to speak \nabout train access from southern New Jersey to Philadelphia, I could \nmake the same arguments. There would be the same vulnerability; only \nthe numbers would be lower. Indeed, I could also make the same \narguments about the Baltimore tunnels, built in 1877, tunnels for which \n150-mile-per-hour trains must now slow to 30 miles per hour to \ntraverse.\n  I could be talking about Washington, DC, itself, where the tunnels \nalong\n\n[[Page S10432]]\n\nUnion Station by the Supreme Court annex, carrying 50 to 60 trains a \nday, were constructed with the safety designs of 1907.\n  In response to these concerns and those of Chicago and San Francisco \nand St. Louis and a host of other cities, Amtrak has proposed a \nmultibillion-dollar security and safety plan.\n  First, $471 million for additional police, bomb-sniffing canine \nunits, and bomb detection systems for luggage. It is essential to get \nto even the minimum standards we are now using for the airlines.\n  Second, $1 billion for the structural and safety improvements that I \njust outlined in tunnels across the Nation.\n  Third, $1 billion in capacity enhancements to rail, bridges, and \nswitching stations, which are necessary to support the massive increase \nin ridership that rails are now receiving across the country.\n  The daily Acela Express in the Northeast alone has had an increase in \nridership of 40 percent to 50 percent per day. It cannot be \naccommodated as people move from airlines that are not operating at \nfull capacity, to trains that are now operating beyond capacity.\n  For example, Amtrak has had to add 608 seats on 18 Metroliners and \nAcela trains just to accommodate this demand between Boston, New York, \nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, and Washington alone.\n  Madam President, like my colleagues, I understand our obligation to \nthe Nation's airlines. They are the backbone of our economy. We owe it \nto the American people to put an armed Federal marshal on every \nairplane that flies in this country. We dare do no less. I believe the \nnecessity of federalizing the check-in and inspection system is now \nmanifest. It is also clear to me that in every aspect of air \ntransportation, the need for security needs to be enormously enhanced. \nBut it would not be responsible--indeed, I could not in good faith \nrepresent my constituents in New Jersey--to not simultaneously demand \nthat all other modes of transportation receive equal protection. To \nprotect our aircraft and leave vulnerable targets on other major \ntransportation that carry not as many people but more people, not with \nthe same degree of vulnerability but potentially greater vulnerability, \nwould not be right. It would not be defendable, and I could not explain \nit to the people of New Jersey, who have already lost 2,000 or 3,000 \npeople from the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. We refuse \nto lose yet another citizen, and I refuse to have another citizen of \nNew Jersey live in vulnerability such as those who lost their lives on \nSeptember 11.\n  I want my colleagues to know--and indeed I put them on notice--that \nwe will insist that this Senate deal with the broader issue of \ntransportation security in this country.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, reserving the right to object--I do \nnot intend to object--I thank the leader and the leadership for working \nwith me to make it possible to take up some amendments on the floor. \nThese amendments directly address issues that were brought up at the \nonly hearing on this issue in the Senate Judiciary Committee, a hearing \nheld in the Constitution Subcommittee which I chair. I think it is good \nfor the body, and the bill, that we consider the issues that were \nraised in the hearing. We should have the debate, have the votes, and \nresolve these issues in public.\n  I thank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority leader, \nin light of the fact it is very unusual in a unanimous consent \nagreement to say after consultation between both leaders and managers, \nthen they move to the antiterrorism bill, why not just have a unanimous \nconsent agreement to go to third reading and final passage of the bill, \nand then go to the antiterrorism bill?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could respond to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, we would get bogged down on the aviation security bill again. \nIf there is time in which we are in quorum calls, it seems to me we \ncould more productively use that time, given the time constraints under \nwhich we now have agreed to take up the counterterrorism bill, to use \nthat time more productively.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I continue to ask the majority leader, suppose we \njust had a scenario, for example, out of my imagination, that \nimmediately a so-called Carnahan amendment is proposed which would then \noccasion a filibuster or a cloture motion. Then we might be in that \nscenario almost immediately. Is that possible, I ask the majority \nleader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is possible, certainly, I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In fact, it may be even likely. I am very concerned about \nthis unanimous consent agreement.

Details about tomorrow's schedule \nwill be made available a little later in the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I spoke yesterday about the need for \nthe Senate to act on behalf of the workers in the airline industry--\nthose men and women who lost their jobs as a result of the September 11 \nattacks. The time to act is here and now.\n  My amendment is designed to provide assistance to those who were laid \noff as a result of the September 11 attacks and the corresponding \nreductions in air service. They include employees of the airlines, \nairports, aircraft manufacturers, and suppliers to the airlines.\n  Using the framework of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, this \nlegislation provides income support, job training, and health care \nbenefits for these laid off workers.\n  This amendment extends unemployment compensation for 20 weeks, after \neligible employees have exhausted their State's unemployment benefits.\n  It also provides for job training, so that those unable to return to \nthe airline industry can acquire new skills.\n  Many laid-off workers and their families will face the frightening \nprospect of losing their health insurance. The legislation that I am \nproposing would enable families to continue their health insurance by \nreimbursing COBRA premiums for 12 months.\n  We know that some workers may not be eligible for extended health \ncoverage through COBRA. Therefore, my proposal also enables States to \nprovide Medicaid coverage for those workers and their families.\n  Lastly, my amendment acknowledges that the unemployment compensation \nprogram is imperfect. Many workers who lose their jobs are not eligible \nfor any assistance under current law.\n  Under my proposal, those who are ineligible for their State's \nunemployment insurance programs would receive 26 weeks of income \nsupport. These payments are designed to mirror unemployment \ncompensation.\n  This legislation is not a panacea. It is a first step. We acted \nquickly to shore up the airline industry. That was appropriate. But \nthat legislation did nothing for the 140,000 who are being laid-off \ndespite the assistance provided in the stabilization package.\n  There are other Americans who have also lost their jobs due to the \nslowing economy. Their needs should be addressed as part of the \neconomic stimulus package. But, we must act now to assist employees of \nthe airline industry who have suffered immediate, abrupt layoffs of \nenormous proportions.\n  The amendment I have proposed has broad support. The nation's \nGovernors have asked Congress to pass it.\n  The major airlines support this assistance for their former \nemployees. Republican and Democratic Senators support it.\n  Now is the time to act. The Senate ought to pass this measure now and \nmove on to our other pressing business.\n  I have reached across the aisle in crafting this proposal. The \namendment has three Republican co-sponsors: Senators Brownback, \nFitzgerald, and Gordon Smith.\n  I have also scaled back my original legislation to make it more \nattractive to my colleagues. The total cost is $1.9 billion--half the \ncost of the original package.\n  The amendment includes an offset so this package of benefits is \nentirely paid for.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that it is not my intention to slow \nconsideration of the important airline security legislation. I am a co-\nsponsor of the airline security bill and am eager to see it pass the \nSenate. We need to institute permanent security measures and restore \nAmericans' confidence in the safety of air travel.\n  I have been ready, and eagerly awaiting the opportunity, to debate \nthis amendment for the past week. And I am ready to go to a vote right \nnow.\n  So for those concerned about delay of the airline security bill I \nhope that you agree we should vote on this proposal tonight. I am not \ninterested in delay. I am interested in helping workers. I would have \nliked both the airline safety bill and the worker relief packaged \ncompleted last week instead of being subjected to a filibuster.\n  I am aware of comments that some believe that this amendment should \nnot be considered as part of the airline safety bill, but rather should \nbe considered later, as part of other legislation. But that is \nprecisely what I was told over two weeks ago. I originally proposed to \nprovide relief to laid off airline workers at the same time as we \nprovided relief to the airlines.\n  I did not offer my amendment then because the leadership of both \nhouses of Congress had reached agreement on the airline package and we \nhad to pass the bill immediately.\n  We all agree that airline security legislation is extremely urgent. \nSo is relief to airline workers. It is time to show some urgency on \nbehalf of the men and women in the airline industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee for the usual cooperation and bipartisanship which he has \ndisplayed on many occasions in the past in his duties as chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee. It has also been my pleasure to have had the \nopportunity to work with him, including on this very important piece of \nlegislation. Perhaps the distinguished chairman and I have not worked \non a bill that is more important and significant as this one.\n  This bill would significantly enhance aviation security by making the \nFederal Government directly responsible and accountable for the \nscreening of airline passengers and their baggage. Although there are \nmany other parts of this bill that are intended to improve security, \nthe shift in responsibility for passenger screening is the most \nprofound. But nothing less is required given that the events of \nSeptember 11 have forever changed how we view air\n\n[[Page S10434]]\n\ntravel. Unfortunately, we have learned a hard lesson that we face an \nenemy that is willing to sacrifice itself and thousands of innocents to \nobtain its ends. Aviation security has now become a critical element of \nnational security, and this requires a fundamental change in our \napproach. Congress must act to ensure that safety and security remain \nour foremost concern.\n  To handle and coordinate all aviation security matters for the \nFederal Government, including the new screening functions, the bill \ncreates a new, high-level position within the Department of \nTransportation (DOT). Nevertheless, there would be close coordination \nwith other Federal agencies, particularly those involved in law \nenforcement, intelligence and national security. Cooperation among \nFederal agencies will be just as important to our effort to safeguard \naviation as it will be in our larger battle to root out and destroy \nterrorist networks. Accountability is also important, and when it comes \nto aviation security, there will not be one Federal official to serve \nas the focal point for all our efforts.\n  This bill includes numerous other provisions designed to improve \naviation security. For example, the Federal air marshal program is \nbroadly expanded, and airports are required to strengthen control over \naccess points to secure areas. In addition, cockpit doors must be \nstrengthened and flight crews would be given up-to-date training on how \nto handle hijacking situations. The bill would also take steps to \nensure that our Nation's flight schools are not being used by \nterrorists. For the current fiscal year, airports would be given the \nflexibility to use Federal airport grants to pay for increased costs \nassociated with new security mandates.\n  I know that some of my colleagues may have concerns about the Federal \nGovernment assuming the burden of screening hundreds of millions of \nairline passengers each year. As a proud fiscal conservative, I do not \nadvocate this move lightly. But the attack last month was an act of \nwar, and we must respond accordingly. As a matter of national security, \npassenger screening can no longer be left to the private sector. I am \none of the most ardent proponents of free enterprise and the \nentrepreneurial spirit of America. However, this is not an area where \ndecisions should be driven by the bottom line. The Federal Government \ndoes not contract out the work of Customs agents, the Border Patrol, \nthe INS, and many other agencies that perform functions similar to the \nscreening that we are dealing with here. We should not contract out the \nscreening of airline passengers.\n  By the way, recently there was a CNN poll taken where people could \ninstantly respond as to whether screening employees should be done by \nFederal employees or contracted out. Eighty-seven percent of the \nhundreds of thousands of people who responded to that CNN poll said the \nFederal Government should assume that responsibility.\n  It is also a question about whether the Department of Justice or \nDepartment of Transportation should have the authority in this matter. \nIn all candor, one of the reasons is because of the lack of success in \nthe past of some of the programs and implementation of some of the \nrecommendations that were made by the Department of Transportation \nInspector General, the GAO, and others. That will be a subject of \ndebate as we consider this legislation.\n  The present legislation gives DOT the authority to fire or suspend \nany screener and prohibit him or her from returning to screening duties \nregardless of any civil service employment laws to the contrary. \nFurthermore, screeners would also be prohibited from striking. To \noffset some of the additional costs to government, airlines would be \ncharged a security fee based upon the number of passengers they carry.\n  Because there are many small airports across the country that may not \nneed a full complement of screeners throughout the day, the Department \nof Transportation would have the option of requiring smaller airports \nto contract out the screening work to State or local law enforcement \nofficials. This could only be done if the screening services and \ntraining of local officers are the same and the Federal Government \nreimburses the airport. There would also be some flexibility for DOT to \nadopt different security measures at smaller airports depending upon \nairport conditions and the level of airline activity.\n  I know that some people may be concerned about the transition period \nif we do move to full Federal control over the screening process. Some \nbelieve that screening services may suffer if current employees and \ncompanies know that they will be phased out in the coming months. The \nbill addresses this concern by giving DOT the flexibility to make \nwhatever arrangements are necessary to ensure security in the interim. \nFor example, DOT could enter into new, short-term contracts with \nscreening companies that provide for upgraded services while at the \nsame time compensating the companies, and perhaps employees, for the \ntemporary nature of the new arrangement.\n  I would also point out that the average turnover, because of the low \npay in salary and benefits, at major airports is 125 percent per year. \nAt one airport it is as high as 400 percent per year, but that is \nbecause the people who now are employed as screeners can make more \nmoney by going down and working at a concession at the same airport.\n  So let's have no doubt about the transience, the documented \ntransience of these people who work there, who are good and decent, \nfine American citizens, but they are low paid, and they are ill-\ntrained. That is not their fault. I want to make that perfectly clear.\n  The Commerce Committee has held several aviation security hearings \nover the last few years, including one 3 weeks ago. We have repeatedly \nbeen told by the DOT Inspector General, the General Accounting Office, \nand many others that there are flaws in our aviation security systems, \nespecially in the area of passenger and baggage screening. Although we \naddressed some of these concerns in legislation enacted last year, we \nclearly must go much farther now. Anything approaching the status quo \nis no longer acceptable. It is vital that aviation security be provided \nby professional individuals who are well paid, well trained, and well \nmotivated.\n  The events of the past few days underscore the need for us take \naction immediately. Our military strike against terrorist bases \nincreases the risk of another terrorist attack on our own soil. While \nmore than aviation is threatened, we know all too well it is an area \nthat terrorists have targeted before and something they have gone to \ngreat lengths to learn about.\n  Aviation is more important than ever to our economic and social well-\nbeing. We cannot avoid the tough choices when it comes to security. The \ntraveling public needs to have its confidence restored in the safety of \nflying. Federal control of the passenger screening process and greater \noversight of other aspects of aviation security can get our aviation \nindustries back on track. Anything less than a full Federal effort \nwould be an abrogation of our duties as lawmakers.\n  There was a poll taken yesterday by ABC which I would like to refer \nto, ABC News.com. The question was: Are you worried traveling by \nairplane because of risk of terrorism? Forty-two percent of the \nAmerican people today still are worried about traveling by airplane \nbecause of risk of terrorism.\n  There was a meeting in New York City the day before yesterday. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Lawmakers are eager to resolve the dispute partly because \n     they are being told by business leaders and even Federal \n     Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that airline security is \n     central to restoring consumer confidence and getting the \n     economy back on track. In a meeting at the New York Stock \n     Exchange yesterday, about 20 executives urged Mr. Hastert and \n     House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri to take \n     drastic action quickly. ``The consensus was that the whole \n     system has to be federalized,'' one House aide said.\n\n  It is very clear that we need to act. I am very disappointed it has \ntaken us a couple weeks before we could get this bill up on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Senator Hollings and I would be more than happy to consider \namendments, in addition to the present ones. I want to point out that \nthere would be some added expense associated with increasing security, \nbut I would also like to point out that security has obviously become \nparamount.\n\n[[Page S10435]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, I again thank Senator Hollings, the chairman of \nthe committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina, the chairman \nof the committee.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the events of September 11 forever \nchanged how we feel about the security of our world, our Nation, and \nour families. We are wrestling with tough issues here: Balancing safety \nand security--against convenience and the tradition of our free, open, \nand democratic society.\n  But one thing is clear. We need to make our skies safe. The American \npeople deserve it--and they demand it.\n  Securing our skies is becoming a Federal responsibility that needs \nthe full resources of Federal law enforcement, immigration services, \nand intelligence agencies. Making our skies safe is a complicated \nendeavor that we cannot leave just to the airlines and the private \nsector.\n  We do not contract out our Nation's defense or law enforcement to \nprivate security guards. Likewise, we must not contract out the \nsecurity of our nation's skies or the vulnerable structures and people \non the ground.\n  The American people are willing to contribute to the cost of making \nour skies safe. A recent poll of 900 people found that 68 percent of \nAmericans are willing to pay $25 per airline ticket to increase \nsecurity.\n  By those standards, airline passengers will find our plan to be quite \na bargain.\n  I have worked closely with Senators McCain, Rockefeller, Hutchison, \nand many others in a bipartisan effort to fix what has been a long-\nstanding problem in aviation security. I believe the legislation we \ndeveloped will close our current vulnerabilities and create new \nsafeguards to stop those that would harm our American way of life.\n  Our legislation will professionalize the more than 18,000 screeners \nin our Nation's airports who are now employees of the airlines and \nprivate screening companies. We will give the screeners better training \nand advanced security equipment.\n  Our bill will increase the number of Federal Air Marshals on both \ninternational and domestic flights. It will enable the Transportation \nDepartment to deploy Federal Air Marshals on every flight.\n  Our legislation mandates cockpit doors and locks that cannot be \nopened during flight by anyone other than the pilots. The new cockpit \ndoors will be able to withstand forced entry. With our pilots safe, \nthey can better keep our nation's passengers safe.\n  These measures also will help restore Americans' confidence in the \nsafety of our airlines. When passengers feel safe, they are more likely \nto fly, which will revitalize tourism in America--and the local \neconomies that rely on it.\n  The terrorist attacks last month demonstrated that airline safety is \nan issue of national security. Other countries have had extraordinary \nsuccess using the tactics called for in this legislation. Our American \ncitizens deserve the same.\n  Mr. President, right to the point, let me thank Senator McCain, our \nranking member, Senator Hutchison of Texas, who is the ranking member \non our Aviation Subcommittee, and Senator Rockefeller. We have banded \ntogether in sort of an emergency situation.\n  Right to the point, a lot of this could be done, and should be done, \nand was to be done under present law. For example, you could get an \norder for securing the cockpit. I called the distinguished Secretary of \nTransportation 2 days after the 11th--on that Thursday--and I said: I \nam going to have a hearing. But do not wait for hearings. Let's secure \nthat cockpit. You can order that immediately. You can order marshals.\n  Now, what have we seen? Three weeks after 9-11 we find a plane being \napparently taken over on its way from Los Angeles to Chicago. The \nfellow was distraught and upset, mentally sick, but he charged the \ncockpit. So the cockpit was opened, and the pilot immediately called \nabout a hijacking, and the passengers had to overpower him.\n  First, why weren't there marshals on that plane? We have an authority \nright now for marshals. What I am trying to say is, somehow, somewhere \nthis administration has to work just as diligently--and they are to be \ncommended on their diligence on correlating a coalition abroad--they \nhave to correlate a coalition here in the country; and we have not done \nthat.\n  This bill, in other words, is absolutely urgent because they \nseemingly want to wait for this intramural to work its way out with \nrespect to the fixing of accountability and authority here. And that is \nwhat we are all for, in a bipartisan fashion agreed upon. We do not \nwant to just hire a bunch of people. That isn't the problem. The \nproblem is absolute security.\n  This war is not a military war. And the headlines are misleading: so \nmany aircraft carriers; so many B-2 bombers; so many this; so many \nhelicopters; so many that. The truth is, if you are going after \nterrorists who are spread amongst 50 countries--and they are zealots, \nthey are fanatics--if you are going after them, you have to go on sort \nof an individual way; and it is an intelligence war.\n  Now, No. 1, if we had secured that cockpit, then you save the F-15 \nthat was necessary. Are we going to have F-15s flying all over \neveryone's domestic flight; have military flights on top, domestic \nflights on the bottom? Is that America? Is that what we are going to \nhave? Absolutely not.\n  So how do you forestall that? Secure the cockpit. But they have not \ndone it. Boeing said within 2 weeks they could retrofit all the doors \nin their airplanes, until you get a steel or a kevlar door put on such \nas they have in Israel. But they are waiting on studying and studying \nand everything else.\n\n  Our first conference--I say this advisedly--dismayed me, when we \nconferred with the administration authorities on this particular bill. \nThey were talking about its implementation 9 months to a year--can you \nimagine that--literally. That is what has gotten this Senator disturbed \nand exercised, along with the Senator from Arizona, about the urgency. \nWe don't want to have F-15's and everybody in the Guard and everybody \nin the Air Force flying over all the domestic flights in America.\n  So you secure that cockpit and there is one thing they know: They are \nnot going to run it into a building. And if it is a hijacking, that \npilot doesn't open the door but he calls wherever he is going to land \nimmediately, and have law enforcement there. You wipe out the expense \nand the calling up of the F-15 pilots and the expense of the F-15 \nplanes.\n  These are the kinds of things that ought to be done immediately, but \nthey are not being done. I am introducing and pressing for it on this \nbill. I don't want to have to agree to any set-aside for another bill. \nThere is too much procedural intramurals going on. We have been \nagreeable, agreeable, agreeable.\n  And in that context, I guess I have to, with a smile, say I don't \nmind being a little disagreeable in order to get this one done.\n  I emphasize again the intelligence. Suppose you had someone and you \nwere with the intelligence of one of these Middle East countries, be \nthey Muslim or not, and you had information, you know it, whatever it \nis, but if you finger ``X'' on a watch list and know if it can get \nthrough now, that is the communications, it isn't high tech--high tech, \neverybody wants to get bam, bam, bam and you have the computer, and it \nimmediately goes in. No. You have the Central Intelligence Agency not \ntelling the FBI because they are afraid of a leak, and it will reveal \ntheir source.\n  I saw this 40 years ago when I served on the Hoover commission \ninvestigating the Central Intelligence Agency. That is just inherent. \nWhat you want to do is protect your sources. So do you give the \ninformation ahead and give it to unreliable sources and everything? \nWhile the FBI is absolutely reliable, certainly the screeners aren't, \nthe ones we have. Everybody will agree to that. So you have to have \nhigh-tech personal, professional. It has to be a federalization where \nwe can check these people, recheck them, not have any labor \ndifficulties.\n  I supported President Reagan on the controllers. You can't have them \nstriking and negotiating and everything else. This is a war of \nintelligence. The people at the airports, if they are going to stop \nwould-be terrorists, have to be positioned to receive that watch list\n\n[[Page S10436]]\n\ninformation. And they are not going to be giving it to them until our \nGovernment can guarantee they are secure. That is just bluntly put.\n  In that light, the President of the United States has to get in not \nwhether we are going to get first the Amtrak, no; we have to do the \nseaports, no; we have to do benefits, no; we have to do \ncounterterrorism and get into all of these procedural things. He has to \ntell the country to bug off, relax. You are not going to get a heck of \na lot of information. I am your President. I have a team and we are \nworking and if we can get this bin Laden fellow, you might know of it \ndays or weeks afterwards. We might get him but we might not want to \nreveal how we got him for a period of time.\n  That is the kind of war we are in. You don't have to satisfy this \nmedia crowd and everything else like that that wants the story of the \nday, the headline. This is a war not to be run on the 7 o'clock news. \nThey can relax, take weekend leave and everything else of that kind \nand, like the President says, go to Disney World. But forget about all \nthis information to be had.\n  We need this bill. We can't tarry around. We need professionalism in \nit. It is not like the Israelis have, where intelligence is the outer \nrim, but it goes all the way down, as I have said before, to the person \nvacuuming the carpet in the middle of the aisle of the plane, because \nthat person, with access to the plane itself, could put in a weapon \nlike we found a bunch of these cardboard cutters and everything else of \nthat kind, as we are finding in some other planes now on a diligent \ninspection.\n  My distinguished colleague from Texas is here. I will yield because \nshe has been a leader for several years on this particular score. I am \ngrateful for her leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for all the work he has done. He is chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee; I am the ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee. We \nhave worked very well together and crafted a bipartisan bill that would \naddress the issues of aviation security.\n  As Senator McCain said earlier today, the people of our country are \nnot going back to the airlines. This is causing a rippling effect \nthroughout our economy. We need to stem the flow of job losses by \ngetting the airlines back in business so the hotels will fill up, \npeople will rent cars again and people will be able to go about their \nbusiness in as normal a way as possible.\n  The last thing on Earth we want is to have the economy be so shaky \nthat we are unable to gear up the national defenses that we know we \nneed.\n  We have men and women putting their lives on the line as we speak for \nour country, for our freedom. For us not to do the right thing and get \nour country back on an even keel after this terrible incident of \nSeptember 11 would be unthinkable. That is why all of us are working to \ncome to an agreement on this bill.\n  We are 95 percent in agreement. There are a few issues on which we \ndisagree. Most people know what these are. But what we cannot afford in \nthis legislation is to put extraneous amendments on it. This is not the \nkind of bill that should be a Christmas tree where you have this \namendment and that amendment and somebody's pet project. This is too \nimportant. This is aviation security for our country. It is for the \npeople who are going to airports, people who are flying. People are \nafraid right now. I don't think they should be, because in all the \nflying I have done since September 11, and it has been every single \nweekend and also flying around during the weekend, I have been on a lot \nof flights that are half full. These flights were very safe. People are \ngoing all out to make flying safe.\n  The bottom line is, the people are not coming back. The planes are \nhalf full. It is going to take aviation security legislation to get us \nback on track.\n  We need to stop the process arguments. We need to stop the extraneous \narguments. We need to say: I understand Senator Carnahan wanting her \nbill. I do understand that. It is a very important bill. At some point \nin the next few weeks, we will take up her bill. We will take up other \nkinds of legislation also. I want to support Amtrak security, but if it \nis not going to be agreed to totally, it is not going to go on this \nbill. I hope it can. But if it can't, then we are going to complete \naviation security. That is the bottom line.\n  I am very pleased to work with Senator Hollings, Senator McCain, \nSenator Rockefeller, and many others who have taken the position that \nwe must do aviation security.\n  What this bill is going to do is give us more air marshals. I \nintroduced the bill for air marshals the week of September 11, but we \nstill have not acted on adding air marshals. The President has done it \non his own with emergency powers, but that is not an answer. We want a \nlong-term solution. We want people to know there is a stable, seamless \naviation security system in our country with air marshals, with \nscreeners who are qualified, with supervisors who are qualified, all of \nwhich are law enforcement personnel. And we want to reinforce cockpit \ndoors so that no pilot will have to worry about security in the cabin. \nThe pilot should be focused on flying the airplane safely. We should \nnot ask him to do anything else.\n\n  Now is the time to act. We need to finish this bill. I hope we can go \nto cloture right away. If we are going to go to cloture, let's do it \ntomorrow, or even tonight. Let's stay and finish all of the extraneous \nthings and get on with this bill. We have legitimate disagreements. \nLet's get on with it and determine how much is going to be federalized. \nI have one position, and maybe someone else has a different position. \nThose are legitimate. Let's argue it, debate it, vote and go on.\n  The bottom line is that we are 95 percent in agreement; it is time to \nhave aviation security for our country, for our citizens, and for our \neconomy.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nfollow Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee for bringing this bill to the floor. Aviation security is a \ncritical measure. I agree with the Senator that we have to do this \nright and we need to pass this bill. It is critical. It is critical to \nthe American public that we bring this bill up, move it forward, and \nget it passed, and reassure our constituents in the country that air \ntravel is safe because we have done our part as well.\n  I have come to the floor to speak on behalf of the more than 100,000 \nAmerican workers who are now facing layoffs as a result of much of what \nhas happened in the last month. For weeks, these workers have been \nwaiting for this Senate to pass a workers assistance package, and today \nwe finally have an amendment on the floor to help them. I have come to \nthe floor to speak on behalf of that amendment and encourage its \nimmediate passage.\n  For many of our workers, the clock is ticking. In fact, this Friday, \n10,000 Boeing workers are going to receive notice that they are going \nto lose their jobs. They are very concerned about how they are going to \nfeed their families, get health care, and how they are going to pay \ntheir mortgages. They need the Senate to take action.\n  Just look at the layoffs that have been announced so far. On \nSeptember 15, United Airlines announced it was laying off 20,000 \nworkers. On the same date, Continental announced it was laying off \n12,000 workers. On September 17, US Airways announced it was laying off \n11,000 workers. On September 18, the Boeing Company announced up to \n30,000 layoffs. On September 19, American Airlines announced 20,000 \nlayoffs. On September 26, Delta announced another 13,000 layoffs. These \naren't just layoffs; these are people--people with families, people who \nare in our communities, people who are very frightened and insecure \nabout their future. They are workers who are losing their jobs every \nday, and they need our help.\n\n  In my home State of Washington, we are really feeling the impact \nbecause of these layoffs in the aviation and aerospace industry. The \nBoeing Company\n\n[[Page S10437]]\n\nplans to lay off 30,000 employees, as I said: That is 30 percent of its \nworkforce. By the Christmas holiday season, I will have at least 10,000 \nof my constituents out of work. And it is not just Boeing; hundreds of \nsuppliers across the Nation will be impacted as well.\n  The clock is ticking. This Congress has still not passed a workers \nassistance package. I urge my colleagues to support the Carnahan \namendment so we can help those workers. Congress, as we all know, has \ntaken care of the airlines by passing $15 billion in assistance. I \nsupported that package because it was the right thing to do. Getting \nthe airlines back up and running quickly helped us avoid further \nlayoffs.\n  We have also recognized that we have a responsibility to help the \nmany workers who are losing their jobs through no fault of their own. \nSo far, this Congress has not provided any help for the 110,000 airline \nworkers and their families who will be laid off or the 30,000 Boeing \nworkers who will be laid off. These workers have to put food on the \ntable; they need to make car payments and pay their rent or their \nmortgage. They are losing their jobs, and they need our help. The \nCarnahan amendment will help them.\n  In fact, these efforts are even more important today given the \nunderlying problems we are having with the U.S. economy. Before \nSeptember 11, our economy was teetering on the edge of recession. \nUnemployment is currently at 4.9 percent, and that is the highest level \nin over 4 years. Some economists are now predicting that unemployment \nwill reach 6.5 percent by the middle of next year. Every one of us will \nhave families in our States who will be impacted by this.\n  Even worse, these economic problems are affecting workers in all of \nthe related industries, and we have heard from them--the travel agents, \nhotel and restaurant employees, caterers, car rental companies, and \nmany more; the slide will keep moving. We are now working with the \nSenate and the House on a stimulus package that is intended to help our \nbroader economy. Some predict the pricetag will be as high as $75 \nbillion.\n  I want to make sure we meet the needs of the men and women, the moms \nand dads, who are facing layoffs right now. We need to adopt the \nCarnahan amendment to assist our displaced workers.\n  The amendment will provide an additional 20 weeks of cash payments to \nairlines and aircraft manufacturing employees who lost jobs directly as \na result of September 11. For individuals who are laid off but who do \nnot qualify for State unemployment assistance, our bill will provide \nunemployment benefits for 26 weeks. This will mean so much to those who \nare very worried about losing their homes and feeding their families in \nthe coming weeks and months. Our amendment will also provide worker \ntraining benefits for laid-off employees and for those threatened by \nlayoffs, so that they are better equipped and more confident and can \nfind a new job as we see the economy and where it develops in coming \nyears.\n  Finally, this amendment will provide 12 months of COBRA health \ninsurance payments for our affected workers. This is really critical \nfor our families who need to know that their loved ones are not losing \ntheir health care along with their jobs. No one in our country should \nlive with that fear right now.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this much-needed amendment. The clock \nis ticking, and these workers facing layoffs cannot wait. We have to \nmove forward and get these workers the help and give them the \nconfidence they need now. I urge our colleagues to vote for this \nworkers assistance package, to move the underlying bill and do what we \nneed to do to get this economy back on track so that our country can be \nconfident again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be brief. I feel as though every \nday I have been speaking on the same issue. I think I am a cosponsor of \nthe Hollings airline safety bill. It is a fine bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent, in case I am not, to be a cosponsor of the Carnahan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I say to Senator Hollings \nI can do this in 1, 2, 3 order.\n  Senator Murray, I appreciate her statement. She has an awful lot of \nhard-pressed workers in her State. I appreciate her advocacy for \nworking families in Washington.\n  To Senator Hollings, he has given enough speeches to deafen all the \ngods about how the industry gets back on its feet when people feel safe \nto fly, and aviation safety is the first priority. He is absolutely \nright, and this is a critically important piece of legislation. I look \nforward to passing it. We will have passed an important piece of \nlegislation for our country.\n  Then the third point I want to make is that I heard the Senator from \nTexas--and I am sorry she is not here now, so I won't go into big \ndebate. I heard her talk about the need to not have extraneous \namendments, and then I heard her reference the Carnahan amendment. I \nwill tell you something. The 4,500 Northwest employees who are out of \nwork right now believe they are extraneous. They believe they are \ncentral--central to their families, central to our communities, central \nto Minnesota, and central to our country.\n  I would like to say to Senators who are opposed to this amendment or \nblocking this amendment, if you were to have a poll--I am just about \npositive of this--anywhere in the country and asked whether or not \npeople think in addition to our helping the industry we ought to help \nemployees, 90 percent of the people would say, ``Of course.'' Of \ncourse, you should help working families. You helped the industry; now \nyou should help the employees and, of course, this should be a \npriority. As a matter of fact, one of the biggest criticisms--and there \nare not a lot of criticisms people have right now about what we are \ndoing in the Congress--one of the criticisms is how can you bail out \nthe industry and not help the employees? When I hear my colleagues say \nthis is an extraneous amendment--tell that to the men, women, and \nchildren who are hurting right now.\n\n  We help people when they are flat on their backs. We provide the \nsupport to them. The Carnahan amendment does three things scaled down. \nI wish it was even more comprehensive, but it is extremely important. \nIt extends the unemployment benefits, it provides the job training, and \nit provides--the Senator from Massachusetts is always the leader on \nhealth care issues--up to 12 months 100-percent payment of COBRA \npayments, which employees cannot afford when they are out of work \notherwise.\n  This is a lifeline for these employees. It is extremely important. It \nis the right thing to do. Frankly, if this is the dividing line between \nDemocrats and some Republicans, so be it. I would rather there be 100 \nSenators who are for this. I sure do not mind having a spirited debate \nabout whether or not we should be helping these employees. I sure do \nnot mind being on their side. That is what they expect from us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, it is somewhat \nextraordinary that so many weeks after the events of September 11, in \nthe immediate days thereafter, almost all of the relevant personnel \nwithin the aviation industry--the people who fly the planes, the \nscreeners, the people at the airports responsible for security, the \nflight attendants--all of them came forward and said we need a Federal \nsystem with Federal employees and Federal standards that guarantees the \nsafety of our aircraft access and our airways.\n  Here we are, after this extraordinary outpouring of emotion and \ngenuine bipartisanship within the Congress that came together to pass \n$40 billion immediately, and that united to provide a clear statement \nof the will of the American people expressed through the Congress with \nregard to our reaction to those events in a series of measures on which \nwe found the capacity to come to the floor of the Senate and vote as \none, here we are now weeks later still procrastinating over when we are \ngoing to have a final vote, or how we are going to get to a final vote \non the question of aviation security.\n  It seems to me extraordinary that at a moment when we are trying to \nprove to a lot of countries the virtues of democracy we are struggling \nin the greatest deliberative body on the face\n\n[[Page S10438]]\n\nof the planet--as we are often referred to or even like to call \nourselves--we are struggling to find the capacity to have a vote, to \nlet the votes fall where they may. Let them fall where they may.\n  Some people do not like the Carnahan amendment. I am amazed that they \nwould call extraneous assistance to people who went to work on one \nmorning and found out a few hours later their jobs were gone. I wonder \nhow one can call extraneous a flight attendants who got on a plane \nafter the events of that day to help people get back to their homes or \nlocations from where those planes flew, to return them, and then got \nhome and found after taking that risk they got a pink slip, their job \nno longer existed.\n\n  Mr. President, 140,000 aviation employees have lost their jobs since \nSeptember 11. How anybody can suggest that for those people who did not \nhave the opportunity to plan for a layoff, for those people who did not \nhave the savings put away because of these events that clearly altered \ntheir lives in such a dramatic way, that we are not going to find it in \nour capacity, even as we bail out the airlines to the tune of billions \nof dollars, that we somehow are not prepared to extend health care \nbenefits to them by paying their COBRA premiums or making training \navailable to them to find another job or find additional unemployment \ncompensation once the State unemployment compensation has run out.\n  That is not extraneous. That is fundamental to who we are as a people \nand to the kind of reaction we ought to spontaneously summon as a \nconsequence of the events that happened.\n  I also hear my colleagues talking about the need to have some kind of \nboost to the economy. We have had a rather sizable tax cut which \nenormously benefited those people at the upper end of the income scale, \nbut for some 28, 29 million Americans who pay most of their taxes \nthrough the payroll tax, they did not get any break.\n  For a lot of Americans, the best way to begin to bring back the \neconomy as fast as possible is to give people the ability to spend \nmoney, to give them the ability to pay their bills and do the things \nthat people do which will have the most profound impact in terms of \nstimulus at this point in time.\n  For those who look at the tax cut side of the ledger--and we have all \nembraced those tax cuts over the course of the past months in one form \nor another--the fact is certain kinds of business tax incentives and \ncertain kinds of monetary efforts--for instance, lowering the interest \nrates at this point in time--are simply not going to make a difference \nin the rapid restoration of the economy. We could lower the interest \nrates to zero at this moment and it is not going to affect the creation \nof a new plant or the investment in some new business where that \nbusiness is already affected by an intense overhang of excess capacity. \nFor somebody who built their plant in the last year and a half, of \ncourse, that has a negative effect.\n  What you have to do is use up that capacity. Most of that, most \npeople would agree, is going to take place on the demand side and the \nconsumer side, and we have to face that.\n  It seems to me, both as a matter of fairness and common sense about \nhow we are going to deal with the economy under these circumstances, \nproviding assistance under the Carnahan amendment is the proper way to \naddress the needs of 140,000 people who were summarily thrown out of \nwork as a direct consequence of the events that took place, and I might \nadd not just as a direct consequence but also to some degree as a \ncalculated effort by some of the airlines to position themselves \ndifferently from where they were positioned prior to September 11.\n  Every one of us on the Commerce Committee and on the Aviation \nSubcommittee, those of us who have been following this issue for a \nperiod of time, know the aviation industry was already a significant \npercentage off, maybe 30 percent and in some cases more, prior to \nSeptember 10. What we are seeing now, even after we have taken taxpayer \ndollars and provided billions of dollars to help bail out the airline \nindustry, they are reducing capacity and adjusting the numbers of \nflights and the number of personnel well beyond the impact of September \n11.\n  So if it is okay and appropriate--and many of us believed it was--to \nhelp bail out that industry because of the impact that industry has on \na whole set of other downstream industries: the car rental industry, \nthe restaurant industry, hotel, entertainment, a lot of things are tied \nto getting people back into airplanes, at the same time as the health \nand long-term welfare of that industry is being sought, we ought to be \nlooking at the health and long-term welfare of those employees who have \nsuffered as a consequence of both of those linked facts.\n  I think it is critical we pass the Carnahan amendment, as a matter of \nfairness to those workers.\n  Let me also say something about the aviation bill itself. I have \nheard from a number of pilots who have privately contacted me in the \ncourse of the last weeks to tell me stories that have not necessarily \nreached the public about why it is so critical to have this national \nstandard applied to our employees. When you walk up to any counter \nanywhere in the country and talk to the people who check you in and \ntalk to them about why they think it is important, you will really gain \na much stronger understanding of the virtue of having this national \nsystem of employees who are accountable to one standard, accountable \nacross the country to one system, and who work with an esprit de corps \nand with an expertise that provides those people flying on our aircraft \nthe sense of safety they both want and deserve.\n  I think most of us who have been following this issue for a long time \nare convinced it is only when you have that kind of system and not a \nsort of disparate, multiheaded effort that stems from the contracting \nout of various airports all across the country to the low bidders for \nthose particular airports, we know that by virtue of the imperatives of \nthe bottom line and the structure of the airlines themselves and the \nway in which that has been managed that there has been an incentive to \nfind employees that do not cost a lot, that do not require a huge \namount of training, do not require a huge amount of supervision because \nthat costs a lot more money for airlines that have already been in \ndifficult straits. Unless we raise the pay level of those employees, \nthe training level, the supervisory level, and the standards to which \nthey are supervised and under which they have to work, we are not going \nto have that kind of control.\n\n  Senator Hollings, again and again, has referred to El Al. El Al is a \nclassic example of a security system that has escaped the kind of \nterror we witnessed on September 11. It does so because of the layered \nstructure of government input that guarantees a standard which can be \nadhered to and which is accountable to those standards.\n  If we want to get people back in our airplanes to the levels they \nwere previously and to even greater levels as we go down the road, we \nneed to make certain we have the highest standards possible, the \ngreatest accountability possible, and the broadest supervisory \nstandards, with accountability, that we could put into place. The \nAmerican people demand nothing more and they deserve nothing less.\n  Ultimately, if we are doing less than that, we leave ourselves open \nto the possibility that not in the next weeks--I do not believe that \nwill happen in the next weeks or even the next months--but when people \nbegin to relax a little bit, as is normal, when you begin to back off \nbecause you have these different companies and you do not have the kind \nof standardization that we are seeking, that is when someone will once \nagain look to find the weakness in the system.\n  Even as we talk about the airlines, I want to reiterate what a number \nof us have said on a number of different occasions. It is not just the \nairlines that require standards with respect to security. Our trains \nare exposed and our buses, as we have seen, other forms of \ntransportation. If we are truly in the kind of conflict we have \ndescribed to the American people--and we are--and if indeed threats are \npossible down the road as we proceed forward--and they are--and all of \nus know that, then it behooves us to try to minimize the potential \nexposure to the American people with the maximum return in \neffectiveness.\n  We currently have the National Guard, the FBI, marshals. You walk\n\n[[Page S10439]]\n\ninto an airport today and you have this conglomerate of people who are \nthere. Why? Because everybody knows what we have before them in terms \nof that screening system is inadequate. What we need to do is guarantee \nthose marshals can be on the aircraft not waiting at a screening \nsection; that the Guard can be doing what the Guard may be called on to \ndo in the course of the next months; that the FBI and the other \npersonnel can be following up on leads and preventing rather than \nguarding our airport entrances, and the only way we will ultimately \nhave the kind of esprit de corps that we need is to build the \nsupervisory capacity and supervision and accountability that we have \nwithin the INS, within the Border Patrol, the Coast Guard and all of \nthose other security measures that we take at other levels.\n  I hope the Senate, within the next 24 hours, will finally vote on \nthis legislation. I thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for their leadership on this on the Commerce Committee. \nI am pleased to be an original author and cosponsor with them of this \nlegislation, but I am frustrated we cannot have a series of votes and \nlet the votes fall where they may. If the Carnahan amendment deserves a \nmajority of support from the Senate, then it should receive it. If it \ndoes not, then we move on, and we have a final vote on the question of \naviation security. We need to get this done, and we need to get it done \nnow. We should have had it done previously. I hope in the next hours \nthe Senate will end this process of procrastination and restore the \nsense of unity and purpose and urgency that has guided us to this \nmoment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Carnahan's \namendment regarding assistance for airline workers. As Senator Carnahan \nhas described, her amendment would provide much needed help to workers \nin the airline industry who have been laid off as a result of the \nhorrific events of September 11, and such help is desperately needed.\n  The need to help these workers is an issue that we failed to address \nwhen we gave $15 billion in aid to the airlines. Yet these airline \nworkers need immediate temporary assistance in order to find new jobs. \nDelta Airlines, based in my home State of Georgia, has already cut \n13,000 jobs. And this is not the end of the layoffs; many more \nAmericans are going to be affected.\n  The approach to this problem outlined in Senator Carnahan's amendment \nis a measured and moderate one. It addresses only the most immediate \nneeds of these workers: The need for unemployment benefits, the need \nfor continued health insurance coverage, and the need for job training \nso that they can begin to again contribute to our Nation's economy. In \naddition, the benefits provided in this package are temporary; they in \nno way would be taking on permanent responsibility for a new group of \nAmericans. Finally, the provisions of this amendment are narrowly \ncrafted to apply only to those workers who lost their jobs as a direct \nresult of the attacks of September 11 or due to security measures taken \nin response to the attacks. We would, therefore, not be providing \nassistance to those who are the victims of the general economic \ndownturn.\n  In short, this is a sensible, middle-of-the-road approach to one the \nmost pressing problems we face as a result of the September 11 attacks. \nIt makes good sense to address this issue now, and I urge my colleagues \nto do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the distinguished manager and I have a \ncouple of amendments, if I could ask the indulgence of the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask that the pending Hollings-McCain \namendment be considered agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, that the amendment be considered original text for the \npurpose of further amendments, and that the Daschle-Carnahan amendment \n1855 remain in its current status as a first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I'm not sure I understand \nthe unanimous consent request. Could you repeat it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask consent that the pending managers' amendment, the \nHollings-McCain amendment be considered agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, that the amendment be considered \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendments and that the \nDaschle-Carnahan amendment No. 1855 remain in its current status as a \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1854) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1857\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have an amendment on behalf of the Senator from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mr. \n     Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 1857.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To amend title 49, United States Code)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Immunity for reporting suspicious activities.\n``44939. Sharing security risk information.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will accept my \namendment to improve aircraft and passenger safety by encouraging \nairlines and airline employees to report suspicious activities to the \nproper authorities.\n  In addition, this amendment requires the Department of Justice and \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation to share security risk information \nwith the Federal Aviation Administration and airport or airline \nsecurity officers.\n  I want to commend Senator Hollings and Senator McCain for their good \nwork on this airport security legislation. I support the Hollings-\nMcCain Aviation Security Act and believe this amendment improves an \nalready excellent bill.\n  The Leahy amendment provides civil immunity for airlines and airline \nemployees who report information on potential violations of law \nrelating to air piracy, threats to aircraft or passenger safety, or \nterrorism to the Department\n\n[[Page S10440]]\n\nof Justice, Department of Transportation, a law enforcement officer, or \nan airline or airport security officer.\n  This civil immunity would not apply to any disclosure made with \nactual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate or \nmisleading or any disclosure made with reckless disregard as to its \ntruth or falsity.\n  In other words, this amendment would not protect bad actors.\n  According to press reports, two of the suspected September 11, 2001, \nterrorists were on an FBI watch list. Both the Secretary of \nTransportation and the Attorney General, however, testified before \nCongress that the FBI, the INS, and the Department of Justice do not \ncurrently supply these watch lists to the FAA or to the Nation's \nairline carriers to match up passenger lists with potential threat \nlists.\n  It is time for that policy to change. This amendment requires the \nAttorney General to establish procedures for notifying the FAA of the \nidentity of known or suspected terrorists.\n  Monday's Wall Street Journal reported that the National Commission on \nTerrorism has stressed the importance of more effective coordination \nand dissemination of security information including the FBI's watch \nlist of potential terrorists and their associates.\n  Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reported:\n\n       A government-created task force recommended ways to plug \n     what historically has been one of the most glaring loopholes \n     in aviation security: a lack of clear-cut procedures to \n     circulate timely information about potential threats to \n     airlines and airports.\n\n  My amendment will put those needed procedures into place by requiring \nthe Attorney General, in consultation with the Deputy Secretary for \nTransportation Security, which is created in the underlying bill, and \nthe Director of the FBI, to establish procedures to notify the FAA and \nairport or airline security officers, of the identity of persons known \nor suspected to pose a risk of air piracy or terrorism or a threat to \nairline or passenger safety.\n  Finally, the amendment requires the Attorney General to report to \nCongress on the implementation of the procedures to identify these \nsuspected or known hijackers or terrorists.\n  I believe the Leahy amendment will improve aircraft and passenger \nsafety and provide the flying public with greater security. Indeed, \nthis amendment has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce among \nothers.\n  I thank Senator Hollings and Senator McCain for accepting this \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Wall Street \nJournal, entitled, ``U.S. Task Force Proposes Ways For Sharing \nSecurity-Risk Data With Airlines, Airports,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 8, 2001]\n\n   U.S. Task Force Proposes Ways for Sharing Security-Risk Data With \n                           Airlines, Airports\n\n                           (By Andy Pasztor)\n\n       A government-created task force recommended ways to plug \n     what historically has been one of the most glaring loopholes \n     in aviation security: a lack of clear-cut procedures to \n     circulate timely information about potential threats to \n     airlines and airports.\n       The recommendations submitted to Transportation Secretary \n     Norman Mineta urge, among other things, creation of a \n     ``federal security agency'' that would ``fundamentally'' \n     improve integration of ``law enforcement and national \n     security intelligence data.''\n       The proposed entity, supported in concept by the White \n     House as well as congressional leaders, would be responsible \n     for directly passing on such threat information to senior \n     security personnel at each airline and airport. Officials of \n     the Federal Aviation Administration have acknowledged that \n     they only received partial information from the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation.\n       ``We have access to the names that the FBI gives us,'' but \n     don't ``normally have access'' to the full ``watch list'' of \n     potential terrorists or their associates assembled by the \n     bureau, U.S. immigration officials and other law enforcement \n     agencies, Monte Belger, the FAA's acting deputy \n     administrator, told lawmakers last month.\n       Despite extensive debate over giving the FAA access to \n     certain intelligence data, there was no resolution of that \n     issue prior to Sept. 11. After the attacks, the FAA \n     instituted some makeshift security procedures. Before any \n     commercial jetliner can take off, airlines must check the \n     names of all passengers against a lengthy and continuously \n     updated ``watch list'' of names supplies by the FBI.\n       Paul Bremer, chairman of a blue-ribbon government panel \n     called the National Commission on Terrorism, has stressed the \n     importance of more effective coordination and dissemination \n     of security information.\n       Since the FBI ``is in charge of catching criminals and \n     prosecuting them,'' historically it has had some reluctance \n     to quickly pass on potential evidence to the FAA or airlines. \n     ``Part of the problem in the FBI is a cultural one,'' Mr. \n     Bremer has said, adding ``we need to find a way [such \n     information] can be disseminated'' more rapidly and \n     predictably.\n       But in certain of its conclusions, the task force also \n     appears to have been keenly interested in trying to minimize \n     delays.\n       Citing ``an urgent need'' to find more efficient methods of \n     moving people through the security system as passenger volume \n     ramps up, the panel recommended ``a nationwide program for \n     the voluntary prescreening of passengers.'' By issuing \n     frequent travelers special credentials or checking their \n     identities and backgrounds before they arrive at the airport, \n     such travelers would be subjected to less scrutiny. That \n     would allow security personnel to focus extra attention on \n     other passengers. Meanwhile, a companion task force appointed \n     by Mr. Mineta to recommend changes in onboard security \n     systems stopped short of supporting some concepts previously \n     proposed by the White House.\n       Members of this task force said ``while there may be \n     value'' in installing video cameras designed to show pilots' \n     activity in the cabin, ``we have no consensus on whether to \n     proceed with this technology.'' The panel concluded that \n     calls by President Bush to install double doors to cockpits \n     were premature. Such a ``design will have limited \n     applicability to most aircraft in the U.S. fleet'' partly \n     because there isn't enough room between the current door and \n     the flight deck to accommodate such a system, the task force \n     concluded.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The amendment is agreed to on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The amendment (No. 1857) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1858\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. On behalf of the distinguished Senator from Nevada, \nSenator Ensign, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mr. \n     Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 1858.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To permit the Secretary of Transportation to appoint retired \n           law enforcement officers to serve as air marshals)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the section relating to air \n     marshals, insert the following subsection:\n       (  ) Authority To Appoint Retired Law Enforcement \n     Officers.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Transportation may appoint an individual who is \n     a retired law enforcement officer or a retired member of the \n     Armed Forces as a Federal air marshal, regardless of age, if \n     the individual otherwise meets the background and fitness \n     qualifications required for Federal air marshals.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We agree with the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If we could withhold for 30 seconds to describe the \namendment of Senator Ensign, it allows retired law enforcement officers \nor retired armed forces personnel to serve as Federal air marshals if \nthe individual meets the background and fitness qualifications. I think \nthis is a good amendment that will provide some highly qualified, \ntrained and experienced individuals. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1858) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding, we now have of the \nunderlying bill the Carnahan amendment, which is a first-degree \namendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is correct.\n\n[[Page S10441]]\n\n                Amendment No. 1859 to Amendment No. 1855\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I send a second-degree amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1859 to amendment No. 1855.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.)\n  Mr. GRAMM. I'm not going to spend a lot of time tonight talking about \nthis amendment. We will have an opportunity to talk about it tomorrow. \nHowever, I do want to try to make a couple of points tonight.\n  First, I want to make a point we are trying to pass a bill on \naviation security. In my opinion, this bill is far from perfect. It \nseems to me there are 100 Members in the Senate who believe we need to \ndo everything we can do to act quickly and act efficiently in making \nair transportation safe again. We want the American people to be and \nfeel secure and we want to get planes flying. Our economy is very much \naffected by the ability of Americans to travel, and in the process, to \ngo about their business, because the business of America is business.\n\n  We now have a pending amendment, the Carnahan amendment, that has \nnothing to do with aviation security. I know some of my colleagues will \nargue that the amendment is meritorious. I have been somewhat amazed by \nthe argument that we took action to ``bail out'' the airlines, and now \nit is time we do something for the employees of the airlines. I beg to \ndiffer. For the last 140 years, the distribution of resources in the \nAmerican economy has been roughly 80 percent for labor and 20 percent \nfor capital. There is no reason to believe that of the $5 billion of \nassistance we provided to give emergency relief for the limitations \nplaced on the airlines on the 11th and the ensuing weeks, that \napproximately 80 percent of that money did not go directly to the \nbenefit of people who worked for the airlines. In fact, the whole \npurpose of the funding was to prevent weak airlines from going broke \nand to try to stabilize the situation.\n  Now to come back and say we need another bill dealing with special \nbenefits for people who work for airlines, it seems to me, approaches \npiling on. Quite frankly, I don't understand the logic that if you work \nfor an airline, and I work for a travel agent, and we are both out of \nwork, why you are more deserving of Federal benefits than I am. I don't \nunderstand the logic that treats people differently in unemployment \ncompensation, and to carry over their benefits based on who they work \nfor. That system makes no sense whatever to me.\n  I think it is important to note that the Carnahan amendment, at least \nby my rough and rugged calculations, would cost $95 billion a year if \nthe same benefits were applied to everybody in the American economy, \nrather than simply being applied to people who work for airlines.\n  To sum up the points I want to make about the Carnahan amendment: \nOne, people who work for airlines were the principle beneficiary of the \n$5 billion of direct aid and the $10 billion of loan guarantees. The \nwhole objective was to try to keep airlines operating so they could \nprovide service and so that employees would not be dislocated \neconomically by losing their jobs. I don't understand the logic of an \namendment that treats people who work for one private employer \ndifferently than people who work for other private employers, even \nthough both may have lost their job as a result of what happened on the \n11th.\n  I am not for the Carnahan amendment. I don't make any excuses for \nbeing opposed to it. I think it is bad policy. And quite frankly in \nthis era of bipartisanship it looks awfully partisan to me. It seems to \nme since the decision has been made that we are going to offer \nextraneous amendments on the Aviation Security Act, both sides can play \nthat game. My amendment is a straightforward amendment that opens up \n2,000 acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas \nproduction. In the process, it adds more oil reserves to America's \nproven reserves than 30 years of supply from Saudi Arabia. It would \nrequire the use of the best available technology for environmental \nprotection. The provision has been adopted by a fairly substantial \nbipartisan vote in the House of Representatives.\n  One might ask, what does energy security have to do with the Aviation \nSecurity Act? My answer is it has a lot more to do with the Aviation \nSecurity Act than the Carnahan amendment. If we are going to vote on \nextraneous amendments that our Democrat colleagues want to vote on, \nthen I want to vote on amendments that I think will benefit the \ncountry.\n  Quite frankly, I think nothing could do more to immediately bolster \nnational security than enabling us to produce more oil and gas here at \nhome at a price consumers can afford to pay to turn the wheels of \nenergy and agriculture. So I wanted to come over today and offer this \namendment.\n  Finally, let me reiterate, before I yield the floor and let our \ncolleagues speak, my concerns about the Aviation Security Act. I think \n100 Members are in favor of doing something here. But I think we should \nbe trying to do something within two constraints: No. 1, how can we \nprovide additional airport and aviation security in a way that will \nminimize the amount of time it takes to put it in place? And, No. 2, \nhow can we do it in such a way as to maximize the effectiveness of the \nsecurity we provide?\n  I personally believe we would have been well advised and the country \nwould have been well served if we had allowed the President, in \nimplementing this program, to decide when to use Government employees \nand when to use employees from the private sector and to pick and \nchoose in such a way as to implement a program as quickly as possible \nthat would be as effective as possible.\n  I think we have made a mistake by mandating that the people who are \nemployed under this act in our major airports all be Federal employees. \nIt seems to me that will add to the amount of time it takes to put the \nprogram in effect, and I think it is highly questionable that that kind \nof binding constraint on the executive branch of Government is aimed at \nmaking the system the most efficient possible.\n  I think we could have written a better bill had we allowed the \nPresident to do this within the two constraints of doing it as quickly \nas possible and having a system that is as effective as possible. The \ndecision was made not to do that, to move ahead even though the \nPresident expressed a preference to have flexibility. The decision was \nmade to move ahead by mandating Government employees.\n  I think that is not good public policy. I am not saying we would not \nbe better off having a bill that is non-optimal than not having a bill. \nBut I am simply saying, in this spirit of bipartisanship, it seems to \nme that the right way to have done this would have been to trust the \nPresident and give him the flexibility. That the bill did not do.\n  So in yielding the floor, let me reiterate where we are. We now have \nthe underlying substitute as the pending bill. We have a first-degree \namendment, the Carnahan amendment, and we have a second-degree \namendment which would open a very limited area of ANWR, 2,000 acres. It \nwould add to the oil reserves of the country the equivalent of 30 years \nof Saudi Arabian imports. And it would require that this oil and gas be \nproduced with the best available technology.\n  I am sure Senator Murkowski will speak about why this is something we \nshould do, as the former chairman of the Energy Committee, if we are in \nfact going to consider the Carnahan amendment. Let me say if we simply \ndecide to focus, as I believe we should, on aviation security, if we \nshould decide to drop the Carnahan amendment, I would be willing to \npull down this amendment. But if we are going to deal with extraneous \nmatters, then we ought to be dealing with extraneous matters, in my \nopinion, that are more related to the crisis we face than is the \nCarnahan amendment.\n  So if we are going to press ahead with that amendment, then I am \ngoing to press ahead with voting on ANWR. I understand the rules of the \nSenate. The majority leader has filed cloture on the Carnahan \namendment. I will vote against cloture. I hope cloture will be\n\n[[Page S10442]]\n\ndenied. But if cloture is adopted, then my amendment to the Carnahan \namendment will fall. But I will offer it again as a first-degree \namendment.\n  I want to reiterate, if we are going to get in this business of \ndealing with extraneous amendments, which I think is a mistake--I think \nunder the circumstances that, on a united basis, we ought to move ahead \nwith aviation security--but if we are going to get into these \nextraneous amendments, then I think everybody ought to have the right \nto get into them. I cannot imagine anything that would be more \nimportant that we could do tomorrow on the floor of the Senate than to \nadopt a House-passed provision that, on a very limited basis, would \nopen ANWR and would add more proven oil reserves to the Nation than 30 \nyears' supply from Saudi Arabia.\n  I appreciate the Chair's indulgence and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to join with \nSenator Carnahan in urging the Senate to provide some important relief \nfor workers and workers' families whose loss of jobs were directly \nrelated to the terrible terrorist attacks which took place here earlier \nin September.\n  I think all Americans have been struck by a variety of different \nemotions in these recent weeks. I absolutely found them inspiring, \nalmost beyond description in so many different ways. Obviously, the \nextraordinary loss of life was breathtaking in its scope and its impact \non so many families. But we saw absolutely extraordinary heroism by \nmany individuals who never, probably, considered themselves to be \nheroes or heroines. I think that has been emblazoned on the minds of \npeople all over this country, and really all over this world. It will \nbe a proud part of our Nation's character and history.\n  Something else we have seen is extraordinary acts of generosity \ntowards our fellow citizens. Americans are a generous people. I think \nall of us have seen, in small, personal ways as well as in large ways, \nthe scope of these contributions to the Red Cross, the contributions of \nblood, doctors running down to hospitals--so many different acts of \ngenerosity. That really is the background of the time we are meeting. \nIt is true of the time we are meeting here this evening.\n  In the immediate wake of the tragedy, this institution responded to \nthe challenge to our transportation system, our airline transportation \nsystem. In a very short period of time, because of the nature of the \nemergency, because there had been direct governmental intervention, \nwhere airlines were closed down, we took action in order to try to \nprovide some relief to that industry. We took those steps, and we are \nvery hopeful they will be enough to make sure that industry will \ncontinue to play an important role in our national economy.\n  Now we took care of management during those actions. They are going \nto make sure their salaries are going to be paid. The management of the \nairline industry was taken care of, some of them in extremely generous \nways. But we believed at the time we had to take that kind of action.\n  Now what are we being asked to do under the Carnahan amendment? All \nwe are saying is, fair is fair. We have taken care of the management in \nthe airline industry, we have taken care of the airline industry, now \nwe are talking about being fair to the workers in the industry. Fair is \nfair. The American people understand fairness. That is what the \nCarnahan amendment is basically all about. It is reflected in \nunemployment insurance, COBRA assistance and training. But it is about \nfairness.\n  Those workers include the reservation personnel, customer service \npersonnel, flight attendants, baggage handlers, mechanics who fix the \nplanes, the workers who clean the planes, the food service workers, the \nshuttle drivers--you could go on and on.\n  One hundred and twenty thousand of them have been thrown out of \nwork--not because of their failure to perform good services, not \nbecause they were not working hard, and not because they weren't \nproducing, but because of terrorist acts. On the one hand, we have \ntaken care of management. The Carnahan amendment says we are now going \nto try to take care of the limited group, the workers. Fair is fair. \nAmericans understand it. We are using the first vehicle to be able to \ndo it. Some of us would have preferred that we did it at the time of \nthe airline action, but so many of the voices that are opposed to this \ntonight said: Oh, no. We can't do that now. We shouldn't do that at \nthis moment. We have to look out for the airlines. When we bring it up, \nthey say: No. It is an extraneous matter.\n  Americans understand what is happening. More than 120,000 of these \nworkers expect someone to speak for them. And the someone who is \nspeaking for them will be the Members of Congress, the Senate, in a \nbipartisan way, I might add, with this amendment. In a bipartisan way \nwe are going to speak for those workers.\n  That is what this debate and discussion is all about. Let us get to \nthe business of voting on this measure. Let's get to the business of \ncompleting the action on airport security. Then let us go ahead and \ndeal finally, hopefully, in the next 2 weeks with the economic package \nto look after other workers who are also suffering.\n  I am always interested when I listen to voices on the other side \ncomplain about unemployment insurance. We should really understand that \nworkers have already indirectly paid into the unemployment \ncompensation. Do we understand that? Workers pay into unemployment \ncompensation. I am not sure how much management paid in and how much \nthey paid at the time that we took care of the airline industry. And I \nvoted for it and I support it. But we are talking about a major aspect \nof this program being extended unemployment compensation. Workers pay \ninto unemployment compensation over a long period of time. Because we \nhave been blessed with a strong economy, with strong price stability, \neconomic growth, and low inflation, there has not been the necessity \nfor unemployment compensation. But it is part of the safety net that \nhas been accepted and supported in our society.\n  I know there are people who are opposed to that in this body as well, \nand continue to be opposed to it. But it is there. Workers pay into it. \nThey need it. They need it at a time such as this when they have lost \ntheir jobs. This is a very modest program. It is unemployment \ncompensation where workers receive a small percentage of what they \notherwise would have received had they been able to retain their jobs. \nIt helps them to maintain health insurance.\n  All of us understand the dangers. Every family understands the \ndangers if they lose their health insurance and what kind of additional \npressure that puts on the families. For lower income families, it helps \nthem in terms of buying into Medicaid--a very modest program in terms \nof the training for those who understand, as the persons did whom I \ntalked with last night in Boston. They had been laid off when Eastern \nAirlines collapsed. They are now laid off by US Airways. They said they \nwere going to try as people in their middle years to take the training \nprograms that are out there to try to find a different sector. They \njust believe they have to start in a new area and a new career.\n  I look forward to the vote. The American people know this is \nrelevant. It is absolutely essential. They can understand when you take \ncare of the management, as we have, and take care of the industry, that \nworkers have been a part of that whole process. If it had not been for \nthose terrorist attacks, probably 95 percent of those workers would \nhave been working either today, tonight, or tomorrow. As a direct \nresult of that attack, these individuals have lost their livelihood.\n  The question is whether we are going to be responsive in a measured, \nmodest way that will permit them to at least hold their families \ntogether for a short period of time until they can either find the \ntraining or be recalled to work. That is the least we can do for \nworking families in this country.\n  I hope cloture will be obtained on this particular amendment.\n  The airline industry suffered enormously in the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. Congress has already made billions of dollars in \nfederal relief available to the airlines. And now it is time for us to \ngive urgently needed relief to the thousands of airline workers who \nhave also been financially devastated by this tragedy.\n\n[[Page S10443]]\n\n  The men and women who worked for the airlines and airports deserve \nour help today. We know that layoffs in the airline industry alone are \nexpected to total about 120,000 workers. American Airlines and United \nhave each announced layoffs of 20,000 workers. Continental, Delta, \nNorthwest, and US Airways have each announced layoffs of more than \n10,000 workers. Workers with smaller airlines have been hit even \nharder. Spirit has laid off 30 percent of its workforce while ATA is \nlaying off about 20 percent of its workers.\n  We need to do more for workers like Penny Bloomquist of Minnesota. \nShe was just laid off from her dream job as a flight attendant for \nNorthwest Airlines. After working a range of different jobs while \nraising her children, Ms. Bloomquist sacrificed mightily to enroll in \nNorthwest's six-day a week training program. Instead of living her \ndream today, she is instead selling off many of her belongings.\n  The Carnahan-Kennedy amendment will provide much-needed relief for \nMs. Bloomquist and thousands of workers like her. Extended unemployment \ninsurance benefits, job training benefits, and health care coverage \nwill be available to airline workers, for workers who build our \nairplanes, and for airport workers, including airline food service \nemployees. Only those workers who lost their jobs as a direct result of \nthe attacks of September 11 or security measures taken in response to \nthe attacks will be eligible for these benefits.\n  Fair is fair. Congress treated the airlines fairly, and now we must \ntreat the workers fairly. Tens of thousands of other airline employees \ndeserve unemployment insurance benefits. They deserve job training \nassistance. They deserve fair health care coverage, and they deserve it \nas soon as possible.\n  Under our amendment, workers who have exhausted their 26-week \neligibility for state unemployment insurance would be eligible for \nadditional weeks of cash payments funded entirely by the federal \ngovernment.\n  This amendment will also provide unemployment insurance benefits to \nairline workers who are not currently eligible for state unemployment \nbenefits. Workers who do not meet their State's requirements for \nunemployment insurance would receive 26 weeks of federally financed \nunemployment insurance.\n  The amendment will provide job training benefits to get people back \nto work. Workers who are not expected to return to their jobs in the \nairline industry will be eligible for retraining benefits. Other \nworkers who are not expected to return to their original jobs, but who \nmay find some alternative job in the airline industry, will be eligible \nfor training to upgrade their skills.\n  Our amendment will also provide health care benefits to laid off \nairline and airport workers. Too often families cannot afford to pay to \ncontinue their health coverage after layoffs. They are forced to choose \nbetween health care and other basic family needs. In fact, almost 60 \npercent of the uninsured today have lost their job in the past year.\n  For airline workers who are currently covered under their employer's \nhealth plan, the federal government will reimburse 100 percent of their \nCOBRA health care premiums. Workers who did not receive health care \nthrough their employers will be eligible for Medicaid, with the federal \ngovernment covering 100 percent of the premiums.\n  We also need to do more for workers in other industries--especially \nthe travel, tourism, hospitality, and restaurant industries that have \nbeen hit so hard. Last week, the Labor Department announced that \nunemployment claims climbed to the highest level in nine years. New \nclaims for unemployment increased by 71,000 to a total of more than \n528,000 in just one week.\n\n  Relief for these workers must be a significant part of the economic \nstimulus legislation that Congress will soon take up. These workers \nhave lost their jobs with little, if any, severance pay, and little, if \nany, health insurance. We cannot abandon these workers and their \nfamilies.\n  These attacks have also jeopardized the nation's overall economic \nhealth. In New York City alone, the overall cost of the World Trade \nCenter attack could be as much as $105 billion over the next two years. \nNationally, the Department of Commerce recently reported our worst \nquarter of economic growth in over 8 years.\n  Expanding Unemployment Insurance is one of the most effective ways to \nget our economy moving again. Unemployed workers have to spend every \npenny just to feed their families and pay their rent. So, for every \ndollar we give to unemployed workers, we expand the economy by more \nthan $2.15. We must do all that we can to strengthen our economy.\n  Helping workers during a slowing economy is good economic policy. The \nunemployment insurance system will be critical to the nation's recovery \nand economic strength.\n  Historically, Congress has ensured extended benefits for each \nrecession since the 1950s. Surely as we face this national crisis we \nshould do the same for today's workers. If we act soon to provide \nextended benefits nationally, we will avoid the mistakes of the early \n1990s. At that time, we waited the better part of a year to act. At the \nsame time, hundreds of thousands of workers exhausted their benefits.\n  This time must be different. We need to act now. Not only will \nmillions of workers be directly helped financially, but according to a \nrecent study commissioned by the Department of Labor, unemployment \ninsurance with the federally extended benefits reduces the number of \nworkers who become unemployed. By improving and extending unemployment \ninsurance, history shows that we will have a shorter, less severe \nrecession.\n  Good unemployment benefits will help workers bridge the gap between \njobs, and put money in their hands. Unemployed workers will spend these \nunemployment benefits, rather than save them. If fact, the DOL study \nconcluded that unemployment insurance, with its extended benefits, \nmitigates 15 percent of the loss of GDP that otherwise would occur \nduring a recession. We need this stimulus for the economy.\n  Every day we delay, more workers suffer. Working men and women are \nwaiting for this help. We owe it to them to act, and we will have the \nchance to do just that one the economic stimulus legislation that we \nsoon take up.\n  The issue before us now is relief for airlines workers. A strong \nairline industry is critical to the national economy. We need to keep \nthe airlines flying--but we also must provide critical assistance for \nthe airline workers who lost their jobs, and now is the time to do \nthat.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for airline workers by passing the \nCarnahan-Kennedy amendment to give these workers the genuine relief \nthey need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I came down to the floor this evening to \nreiterate the comments of my friend from Missouri, Senator Carnahan, \nand the comments that the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, made \nin expressing the frustration about the lack of progress on the \naviation security bill and the need to immediately consider worker \nassistance in this amendment.\n  We have spent a week now simply on the motion to proceed to \nconsideration of one of the most important bills that we need to pass \nthis year. Every day that we wait, critical measures to enhance the \nAmerican public's confidence in the aviation system are not enacted--\nand, thus, economic activity dependent on this sector is not generated.\n  We have no time to waste. The issues that divide us are not terribly \nfar apart. Like my colleague from Missouri, I don't want to slow this \nbill down. I had wanted to see both the security provisions and the \nworker assistance dealt with during the consideration of the airline \nassistance package that we passed several weeks ago. But people told us \nto wait, and do it after we pass that package.\n  So I think it's time that we all step back and reflect on the \nimportance of these measures. I call on my colleagues to reconsider \nthese differences that remain and get down to actual consideration of \nthis bill, and the Carnahan amendment.\n  I would like to thank Senators Hollings and McCain for putting \ntogether an aviation security measure that will give this country the \nconfidence to fly again. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, \nSenators Hollings and McCain began to work on this package immediately.\n\n[[Page S10444]]\n\n  The package they put together I call on my colleagues to support:\n  First, it expands the air marshal program, improves passenger-\nscreening requirements in our airports, and provides for hijacking \ntraining of flight crews.\n  It requires more background checks for flight school students, \nstrengthens cockput security, and increases perimeter security at our \nNation's airports.\n  And, it will bring the passenger screening function under Federal \ncontrol, something I believe is a necessity for restoring public \nconfidence that a well trained, well paid, and more integrated security \nworkforce is on duty at airports in every corner of this Nation.\n  We have a long way to go in bringing the passengers back, but I am \nconfident they will come back.\n  I would like to thank Senators Carnahan, Kennedy, and Majority Leader \nDaschle for their hard work on this legislation, particularly their \neffort to include airline worker assistance. It is a strong first step \nin easing the blow to workers in the aviation industry who will be \ngreatly impacted.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' leadership on this issue and their \nwillingness to include aircraft manufacturing workers who are about to \nsuffer the severe impacts of others in the industry. We should have \ndone this 2 weeks ago. That is why we cannot afford to wait.\n  The Carnahan amendment will help thousands of families who are facing \neconomic turmoil. These are people who are suddenly left holding \nnumerous household bills that they will soon be unable to pay. They \nhave mortgages, car payments, credit card debt, utility bills, and \nschool loans. What thousands of them won't have much longer is a job.\n  Major U.S. airlines expect to cut more than 100,000 jobs this year \nalone and tens of thousands have already received pink slips. The \nSeptember 11 attacks affected all of us very deeply. We should think \nabout the individuals who have directly lost their economic security as \na result of these events.\n\n  In my State, the Boeing Company recently announced it will be forced \nto lay off 20,000 to 30,000 workers by the end of 2002. Those are just \nnumbers of direct jobs that will be lost in the airline and aircraft \nmanufacturing industries. The overall economic toll will be far \ngreater.\n  For Boeing workers, notices will be sent on October 12--just 2 days \nfrom now--to inform them that in 60 days they will be out of a job. So \nthat means that on December 14--less than 2 weeks before Christmas--a \nsignificant number of workers in my State are going to be jobless.\n  While dealing with how to meet their bills, the average Boeing worker \nwho elects to continue to try to cover their health care coverage--\ntheir family medical and dental--will have to pay nearly $850 per \nmonth. That is $850 a month on top of other bills that unemployed \nworkers are going to have to face.\n  These layoffs will certainly mean hardship for thousands of \nindividual families, but they will also create a serious economic \nripple effect in my State--the State of Washington--and nationwide.\n  The Seattle Times recently reported that the Boeing layoffs alone \nwill take $1.76 billion out of the economy in regions of the country \nwhere the layoffs occur. More than 70 percent of those layoffs are \nexpected to happen in Washington, which means a loss of $1.29 billion \nto our region's economy.\n  The economy is already reacting with uncertainty resulting from the \nmany layoffs and the fear of layoffs. Consumer spending currently \naccounts for two-thirds of our economy. Yet consumer confidence in \nSeptember fell to its lowest level since January of 1996. We can take a \nstep--a giant step--in shoring up consumer confidence if we let the \nworkers in the most impacted sector know, by passing this legislation, \nthat they will not fall through the cracks.\n  The fact is, unless we do something to instill greater consumer \nconfidence in the aviation system, it will be difficult to sustain our \nlarger economic growth. That is why it is so important that we act now.\n  Our economy works best when people are working. When they lose their \njobs, they need help to manage their unemployment, train for new jobs, \nand make an easy transition to new careers. This amendment will provide \nthe financial assistance, job training, and health care coverage for \nthousands of workers in the airline and aircraft manufacturing \nindustries--workers who are losing their jobs as a result of terrorism.\n  The time to provide the workers relief is now, and in this bill. We \nhave already provided, as many of my colleagues have said, the airline \nindustry with billions of dollars to keep them flying. That was the \nright thing to do to bolster the economy and to maintain as many jobs \nas possible, but the workers who are the heart of the industry deserve \nequal treatment, and that includes the workers in the airline \nmanufacturing industry.\n  We cannot take care of the corporate needs and shareholder needs and \nnot the needs of American workers who are the backbone of our economy. \nOur economy was built by their muscle and their minds, and it is a \nproduct of their hard work and creativity that continues to drive us.\n  We cannot allow terrorism to transform our economy from a rising tide \nthat can lift all boats into a rising storm that threatens to capsize \nAmerican workers. We need to provide them with a lifeline to health \ncare coverage, unemployment benefits, and job training.\n\n  Again, I call on my colleagues to support the Carnahan amendment and \nthe overall airline security legislation. America is watching us and \nasking us to act now on both of these measures.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending Carnahan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1860\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Snowe of Maine and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Ms. Snowe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1860.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize national emergency powers of the Deputy \n                 Secretary for Transportation Security)\n\n       On page 5, line 13, strike the closing quotation marks and \n     the second period.\n       On page 5, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       ``(3) National emergency responsibilities.--Subject to the \n     direction and control of the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary \n     shall have the following responsibilities:\n       ``(A) To coordinate domestic transportation during a \n     national emergency, including aviation, rail, and other \n     surface transportation, and maritime transportation \n     (including port security).\n       ``(B) To coordinate and oversee during a national emergency \n     the transportation-related responsibilities of other \n     departments and agencies of the Federal Government other than \n     the Department of Defense and the military departments.\n       ``(C) To establish uniform national standards and practices \n     for transportation during a national emergency.\n       ``(D) To coordinate and provide notice to other departments \n     and agencies of the Federal Government, and appropriate \n     agencies of State and local governments, including \n     departments and agencies for transportation, law enforcement, \n     and border control, about threats to transportation during a \n     national emergency.\n       ``(E) To carry out such other duties, and exercise such \n     other powers, relating to transportation during a national \n     emergency as the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe.\n       ``(4) Relationship to other transportation authority.--The \n     authority of the Deputy Secretary under paragraph (3) to \n     coordinate and oversee transportation and transportation-\n     related responsibilities during a national emergency shall \n     not supersede the authority of any other department or agency \n     of the Federal Government under law with respect to \n     transportation or transportation-related matters, whether or \n     not during a national emergency.\n\n[[Page S10445]]\n\n       ``(5) Annual report.--The Deputy Secretary shall submit to \n     the Congress on an annual basis a report on the activities of \n     the Deputy Secretary under paragraph (3) during the preceding \n     year.\n       ``(6) National emergency.--The Secretary of Transportation \n     shall prescribe the circumstances constituting a national \n     emergency for purposes of paragraph (3).''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is a national emergency \nresponsibilities amendment, where the Deputy Secretary will have \nresponsibilities for coordination amongst various agencies. I think it \nis a good amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1860) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not see any more pending business, so \npending the appearance of the majority leader or the whip, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold suggesting the \nabsence of a quorum?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask colleagues to find out the \ndisposition of the leadership and how they want to wrap up because we \nare ready to go. But pending that, I will say a word about another \nconcern I have.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hollings are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I see the distinguished Senator from New York is here. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the chairman of the committee who has done such \na tremendous job of leadership in the wake of the terrible attacks of \nSeptember 11. I commend him and the ranking member, the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, and thank them for their tireless work and their \nconstant reminders of the challenges we face and the sacrifices that \nare needed.\n  I rise in support of the chairman's hard work on behalf of this bill, \nand I particularly appreciate the inclusion of the clear understanding \nthat we have to face a direct threat to our national security and we \nhave to do it by joining together and establishing a commonsense set of \nsolutions to the problems now before us.\n  The Aviation Security Act the chairman has worked so hard on is the \nresult of many years of his labors and understanding of the \ndifficulties we confront. I certainly commend him and thank him for his \nhard work.\n  I also rise as a cosponsor of the Carnahan amendment to provide \ncritical assistance to airline workers and those in aviation-related \nindustries who were laid off as a direct result of the terrorist \nattacks.\n  At the time we considered the so-called airline bailout bill, many of \nus made very clear in our statements on the floor that we were \ndisappointed that some concerns for the workers who were going to lose \ntheir jobs were not included in the bailout bill. We come today to \nreinforce our deep concern and to ask our colleagues to support the \nCarnahan amendment.\n  The numbers are overwhelming. We know that 100,000 workers have been \nlaid off in the airline industry. At least 30,000 more have been laid \noff in airline manufacturing. We are concerned that if the American \ntraveling public and visitors from overseas don't resume flying, as I \nurge everyone to do--I have flown numerous times already, and I \nencourage everyone to begin again to travel for business and pleasure--\nif for whatever reason that return to the air is delayed, then the \nnumbers will undoubtedly grow.\n  Many of these airline workers are based in New York. They have been \nsupporting our air transportation system out of JFK and LaGuardia. They \nhave been literally handling some of the busiest air traffic corridors \nin the world. We know that reductions in flight schedules at both of \nthese airports have put thousands of New Yorkers out of work: pilots \nand flight attendants, baggage and passenger service representatives. \nThis has had a ripple effect throughout New York.\n  For example, in Syracuse, in upstate New York, a call center for US \nAirways that had been there for many years was shut down, throwing more \nthan 400 employees out of work.\n  These airline and aviation-related industry layoffs are not just \nnumbers. They represent the lives and livelihoods of hard-working \nAmericans. I have heard many stories, as my colleagues have, of the \nhardships that are being imposed because out of the skies on September \n11 came these dreadful, horrible acts of terrorism, where people who \nwere willing to commit suicide brought about the deaths of thousands \nand thousands of our fellow citizens and people from all over the world \nand also wreaked havoc on our airline industry and the economy in \ngeneral.\n  I hope as we consider this Aviation Security Act, for which I support \nand again thank the chairman and the ranking member, we will also \nsupport Senator Carnahan's amendment. Her aid package for dislocated \nworkers is modeled after the successful trade adjustment assistance. It \nwill allow airline workers to extend their unemployment insurance while \nthey receive needed job training and support services or while, \nhopefully, they wait to be called back to work because we will all \nstart flying again.\n  This amendment will also enable families to receive health care \nbenefits as they go through this difficult period.\n  No story more sums up the anguish and pain of the losses we are \ndiscussing and the need to improve security than one that comes out of \nJFK. A TWA flight attendant at that airport received her furlough \nnotice while awaiting news of her husband, a New York City firefighter \nmissing at the World Trade Center. New Yorkers and Americans have paid \na very heavy price. We are summoning our resolve. We are preparing our \nresponses individually and throughout our Nation. We are following the \nleadership of our President. We are supporting our men and women in \nuniform.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the act that Chairman Hollings and \nSenator McCain have crafted and support the Carnahan amendment on which \nshe has worked so hard to pay some attention and provide assistance to \nthose Americans who woke up on September 11 thinking that it was any \nother workday and went to bed on that terrible day knowing that they \nmight lose their jobs as a result of this horrific attack.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, nearly one month has passed since the \nferocious attacks of September 11th. Words remain inadequate to \ndescribe or define the event. Analysts are beginning to assess the \nimmediate costs in economic terms. Someday, perhaps, historians will \nsucceed in cataloguing, analyzing and calculating the losses. But some \nlosses--families torn apart, communities devastated--will remain \nforever beyond calculation.\n  However, the tragic events of September 11th leave no question that \nour airport security system is in need of reformation. The ability of \nhijackers to ease through our Nation's airport screeners has created \nfear among the American public about flying and has led to a \nsignificant downturn in the travel and tourism industry. Around the \ncountry, air travelers now patiently wait in long lines after emergency \nsecurity procedures have been instituted to prevent further tragedies. \nThousands of employees, not only from the airline industry, but also \nwell beyond it, have lost their jobs. During these difficult times, it \nis imperative that Congress act to protect Americans from future \nterrorism and to provide economic assistance to those left unemployed \nbecause of the horrendous acts of September 11th. I strongly support S. \n1447 because it takes vital steps to strengthen our Nation's airport \nsecurity system, to ensure safety for crews and passengers, and to \nbolster our economy.\n  Among the most important provisions in this bill is the \nfederalization of airport security personnel. I support this plan \nbecause it is a clear solution to one of the most troublesome aspects \nof our current airport security operations: the failure of screeners to \ndetect dangerous objects. The atrocities\n\n[[Page S10446]]\n\nof the recent terrorist attacks highlight the inadequacies of the \ncurrent screening system. Under the system, airlines, subject to \nFederal Aviation Administration requirements, are responsible for \nadministering screening of passengers and their carry-on luggage. \nAirlines generally contract out their screening responsibility to \nprivate security companies, often awarding contracts based upon the \nlowest bid rather than superior security systems. Allowing airlines \nsuch authority has resulted in a system that too often promotes lower \ncosts over the safety of passengers.\n  Recent separate studies by the GAO and the DOJ's Inspector General \nrevealed the serious inadequacies of the current screening system and \ncauses for its failures. Among the problems noted by the IG report was \nthe frequent failure of the airlines to conduct background checks of \nemployees with access to secure areas and the ability of IG personnel \nto access secure areas without being challenged by security 68 percent \nof the time. The GAO report which concluded that screener performance \nin major U.S. airports was unsatisfactory, attributed the poor \nperformance of security screeners to a high employee turnover rate, \nmore than 100 percent per year at many airports--low wages, \ninsufficient training, and inadequate monitoring of screeners.\n  Federalizing security operations throughout U.S. airports is the best \nanswer for improving screener performance. It would raise wages, lower \nemployee turnover, promote career loyalty among screeners, create \nuniform training among security personnel, and, as a result, strengthen \nthe performance of screeners to discover dangerous objects. Once the \nFederal government ensures that screeners are performing their duties \nin strict adherence to the highest safety standards, the public will \ngain greater confidence in airport security. In light of the current \ncampaign against terrorism, now is the time to incorporate this change. \nAs a recent New York Times editorial stated, ``airports are a front \nline in the struggle against terrorism, and it no longer makes sense to \ndelegate their policing to the private sector, which emphasizes low \ncost as opposed to security.'' I agree with this assessment.\n  I also want to underscore my support for Senator Carnahan's amendment \nto provide much-needed relief for the thousands of hard-working \nemployees in the airline industry who have lost their jobs as a result \nof the horrific attack on our Nation on September 11th. This amendment \nwill provide unemployment benefits, health care and training to airline \nindustry employees who have been laid off due to the marked decrease in \nair travel in this country.\n  The airline industry has been most directly affected in the aftermath \nof the attack, but the ripple effect of the attacks is being felt \nthroughout other industries as well. Hotel, travel, and tourism \nemployees, who number in the hundreds of thousands, are at risk of \nlosing their jobs due to the nationwide decrease in travel. In \nMaryland, tourism is a $7.7 billion industry. It means jobs for our \npeople and revenues for our State and local programs. While we are \nmoving vigorously to encourage travelers to come to Maryland this fall, \na decrease in tourism is expected in the State, as it is nationwide. \nWhile it is crucial that we provide support to airline workers at this \ntime, we should also remember the plight of the hundreds of thousands \nof other workers across the State of Maryland and the country whose \nlivelihood may be affected.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11th were intended to create fear \nin Americans and our way of life, including air travel. This \nlegislation will help to ease fears about air travel and the state of \nour economy by strengthening our airport security system. In this \nregard, I urge the Senate to pass this legislation expeditiously.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller).

Somehow, Mr. President, we have to get a grip on \nourselves. We ended, at just the end of September, September 30--\nOctober 1 was the beginning of the fiscal year--with a deficit of $132 \nbillion. No doubletalk about on budget, off budget, or public debt and \nprivate debt, and all of that. We spent $132 billion more than we took \nin. We have been in a deficit position most of the year, when everyone \nwas talking surpluses.\n  In August we had a briefing from the Congressional Budget Office to \nthe effect that we were going to have a deficit of $104 billion for \nfiscal year 2002. And he updated that, some 10 days ago, and said: \nRather than $104 billion, I am going to have to add about $120 billion \nto $140 billion. So we are looking at a deficit of at least $224 \nbillion or $244 billion, for starters. That is without the $40 billion \nwe passed in one stimulus measure; $15 billion for the airline measure; \nso $55 billion there.\n  There is on course--and everybody is agreed to--an amount, in general \nterms, on defense, in education, and emergency supplementals, and so \nforth, agriculture, of around $25 billion. And now they are talking \nabout $75 billion; and that has been restudied, and rather than the \nPresident's $75 billion, it comes out to around $114 billion. So while \nwe are talking about stimulus, we are going into an election next \nNovember with a deficit in excess of $300 billion, at least.\n  I am for paying the bill. I cannot get any support for a value-added \ntax. But when we started other wars we put in a special tax. I was \nreminded, of course, that when President Nixon came into office, he put \nin a 10-percent surcharge on imports. And the distinguished majority \nleader, Mike Mansfield, took my dear wife Peatsy and myself on a \nhoneymoon to about nine countries in Europe to consult and console the \nheads of state on why this was necessary. So we went to Finland, \nDenmark, Norway, Sweden, France, England, Germany, Austria, Italy, \nSpain, Portugal, Morocco and we explained that.\n  We put on, in World War II, a tax. But we are going in two different \ndangerous directions. The right direction, of course, is to pursue the \nwar; along with that pursuit, a coalition at the homefront of \ndiscipline, restraint, and sacrifice. When you go to war, you can't ask \npeople to lay their lives on the line and then everybody else go to \nDisney World. We better sober up on our talk and particularly with \nrespect to tax cuts. Further tax cuts is not going to stimulate but \nenhance the rich. So they are all getting together in a fine cabal \nabout we are going to spend so much more and we are going to stimulate \nso much more with tax cuts. But they will have a motion to forgo and \ncancel out those tax increases in the outyears that they want to move \nfast forward. I want to put them on notice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10446-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10446-S10447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING U.S. CAPITOL POLICE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter addressed to the Senate from the Vice President, together with \ntwo appendices, on the subject of the interaction of the Vice \nPresident's staff with the General Accounting Office.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Vice President,\n\n                                       Washington, August 2, 2001.\n     To the Senate:\n       I am writing to inform you of certain actions undertaken by \n     an agent of the Congress, Comptroller General David M. \n     Walker, which exceed his lawful authority and which, if given \n     effect, would unconstitutionally interfere with the \n     functioning of the Executive Branch.\n       By memorandum of January 29, 2001, the President \n     established the National Energy Policy Development Group \n     (``Group''). The Group consists of six executive department \n     heads (Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, \n     Transportation and Energy), two agency heads (Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency and Environmental Protection \n     Agency), three officers of the White House staff (Policy, \n     Economic Policy, Intergovernmental), and the Vice President. \n     The memorandum specified that the Group's ``functions shall \n     be to gather information, deliberate, and as specified in \n     this memorandum, make recommendations to the President.'' It \n     called for the Group to submit to the President a near-term \n     assessment and then a report setting forth ``a recommended \n     national energy policy to help the private sector, and as \n     necessary and appropriate State and local governments, \n     promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound \n     production and distribution of energy for the future.'' The \n     Group issued its report on May 16, 2001. The President \n     approved the report's recommendations, now commonly called \n     the National Energy Policy.\n       The Comptroller General proposed to investigate the \n     workings of the Group and sought certain information from the \n     Vice President's staff. The first appendix to this Message is \n     a chronology of the interaction between the Comptroller \n     General and my staff on this matter. As a matter of comity, \n     my staff furnished substantial information regarding the \n     Group, providing written answers dated May 4, 2001 to \n     questions concerning the Group, a copy of the Presidential \n     Memorandum establishing the Group, and documents responsive \n     to the Comptroller General's inquiry concerning costs \n     associated with the Group's work. In response to separate \n     requests from the General Accounting Office, executive \n     agencies also have provided substantial responses concerning \n     the roles of their agency heads on the Group.\n       On July 18, 2001, the Comptroller General sent to me a \n     letter which stated that he was reviewing ``the process by \n     which the National Energy Policy was developed'' and that the \n     purpose of the letter was to ``demand'' certain documents. \n     With regard to documents not already provided that the \n     Comptroller General has demanded, statutory and \n     constitutional reasons for not providing them are set forth \n     in the second appendix to this Message. I am furnishing a \n     copy of this Message, including its appendices, to the \n     Comptroller General so that the copy will serve as the \n     response to his letter of July 18, 2001 that he would receive \n     under Section 716(b)(1) of Title 31 of the U.S. Code if that \n     provision were applicable in this matter.\n     Richard B.

That same day, \n     they asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to initiate an \n     investigation.\n       On May 4, 2001, the Vice President's counsel forwarded to \n     Messrs. Dingell and Waxman answers from the Executive \n     Director of the Group to their questions.\n       On May 8, 2001, a GAO Assistant Director faxed to the \n     Office of the Vice President a request to interview Group \n     officials and staff and for production of records and \n     information.\n       On May 15, 2001, Representatives Dingell and Waxman sent \n     another letter to the Executive Director of the Group, \n     expressing dissatisfaction with the answers to their \n     questions previously received and requesting more information \n     and records, including all of the following relating to the \n     Group:\n       ``. . . correspondence, memoranda, records, summaries of \n     personal conversations or interviews, minutes or records of \n     meetings or conferences, opinions or reports of consultants, \n     projections, statistical statements, drafts, contracts, \n     agreements, purchase orders, invoices, confirmations, \n     telegraphs, telexes, agendas, books, notes, pamphlets, \n     periodicals, reports, studies, evaluations, opinions, logs, \n     diaries, desk calendars, appointment books, tape recordings, \n     video recordings, e-mails, voice mails, computer tapes, or \n     other computer stored mater, magnetic tapes, microfilm, \n     microfiche, punch cards, all other records kept by \n     electronic, photographic, or mechanical means, charts, \n     photographs, notebooks, drawings, plans, inter-office \n     communications, intra-office and intra-departmental \n     communications, transcripts, checks and canceled checks, bank \n     statements, ledgers, books, records of statements of \n     accounts, and papers and things similar to any of the \n     foregoing, however denominated.''\n       On May 16, 2001, the Vice President's counsel wrote to the \n     GAO General Counsel, asking the Comptroller General to \n     determine whether the proposed GAO inquiry was appropriate, \n     in compliance with the law, and, especially in light of \n     information already provided, a productive use of resources, \n     and asking the GAO General Counsel for a statement of GAO's \n     legal authority to conduct its proposed inquiry.\n       On May 22, 2001, Representatives Dingell and Waxman wrote \n     to the Vice President's counsel stating that they were \n     ``astounded'' that the GAO's authority had been questioned.\n       On May 25, 2001, the Vice President's counsel wrote to \n     counsel for Messrs. Dingell and Waxman, reporting on the \n     status of correspondence with GAO in the matter.\n       On June 1, 2001, the GAO General Counsel wrote to the Vice \n     President's counsel, advising that the Comptroller General \n     wished to go forward with the inquiry and citing as authority \n     for the inquiry Section 712, 716, and 717 of Title 31 of \n     the U.S. Code. The letter said that GAO would \n     ``initially'' like to focus on:]\n       ``1. Previously, you identified 9 meetings conducted by the \n     NEPDG and indicated that each meeting was held in the White \n     House Complex. For each meeting, we want to learn the name of \n     each attendee, title, and office represented, as well as the \n     duration of the meeting.\n       ``2. Previously, you stated that 6 professional staff, \n     referred to as the Group support staff, were assigned to the \n     Office of the Vice President for the purpose of supporting \n     the NEPDG.

We are interested in obtaining the direct and indirect \n     costs incurred by both the Vice President and the Group \n     support staff.\n       ``After discussing these questions with you, we would also \n     like to arrange meetings with members of the Group support \n     staff to discuss meetings they conducted and the process they \n     used to develop information in support of the task force.''\n       On June 7, 2001, the Vice President's counsel wrote to the \n     GAO General Counsel, advising that Sections 717 (which allows \n     GAO to investigate agency implementation of statutes, but no \n     performance of constitutional duties) and 716 of Title 31 of \n     the U.S. Code\n\n[[Page S10448]]\n\n     (which provides information collection procedures for \n     otherwise-authorized investigations) provide no basis for the \n     GAO inquiry, and that the limited authority of Section 712 \n     (authorizing investigation of use of public money) would \n     provide support for only one of the questions asked, relating \n     to costs. The letter therefore stated that the Office of the \n     Vice President would search for documents responsive to the \n     GAO question regarding the direct and indirect costs of the \n     Group.\n       On June 21, 2001, the Vice President's counsel sent a \n     letter to GAO forwarding 77 pages of documents responsive to \n     the GAO question regarding the direct and indirect costs of \n     the Group.\n       On June 22, 2001, GAO sent to the Vice President's counsel \n     a letter claiming to have broad authority to investigate \n     under Sections 712 and 717 of Title 31 and indicating that \n     GAO may issue a ``demand letter'' under Section 716 of Title \n     31 that could lead to litigation.\n       On July 9, 2001, in response to the request of Executive \n     Branch lawyers for an opportunity to meet with the GAO \n     General Counsel to see if a proper accommodation were \n     possible, the meeting occurred, but no proper accommodation \n     was reached.\n       On July 18, 2001, the Comptroller General issued a letter \n     to the Vice President of the United States demanding \n     documents as follows:\n       ``1. Your counsel identified nine meetings conducted by the \n     National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG) in his May \n     4, 2001, letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members \n     of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House \n     Committee on Government Reform (hereinafter May 4 letter).

In the May 4 letter, your counsel indicated that six \n     professional staff, referred to as the group support staff, \n     were assigned to the Office of the Vice President to provide \n     support to the NEPDG.

Because the relevance of many of \n     these records is unclear, we continue to request all records \n     responsive to our request, including any records that clarify \n     the nature and purpose of these costs.''\n       The GAO has also made separate requests for information \n     relating to the Group to various executive departments and \n     agencies and has received responses.\n       On July 31, 2001, the Comptroller General and the Counsel \n     to the Vice President spoke by telephone regarding the \n     Comptroller General's letter of July 187, 2001 to the Vice \n     President.\n       On August 1, 2001, the General Counsel of the General \n     Accounting Office and the Counsel to the Vice President spoke \n     by telephone regarding the Comptroller General's letter of \n     July 18, 2001 to the Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Appendix Two: Reasons\n\n       With regard to documents not already provided that the \n     Comptroller General has demanded from the Vice President, the \n     reasons for not providing them are as set forth in this \n     appendix. The statutes under which the Comptroller General \n     purports to act, Sections 717, 712, and 716 of Title 31 of \n     the U.S. Code, do not grant the authority he purports to \n     exercise. Moreover, if his misconstruction of the statutes \n     were to prevail, his conduct would unconstitutionally \n     interfere with the functioning of the Executive Branch of our \n     Government.\n       Section 717 permits the Comptroller General at the request \n     of a House of Congress, a congressional committee of \n     jurisdiction, or on his own initiative to ``evaluate the \n     results of a program or activity the Government carries out \n     under existing law.'' The Comptroller General lacks authority \n     under Section 717 to investigate the President's exercise of \n     his constitutional powers. The National Energy Policy \n     Development Group and its work constitute such an exercise. \n     The Vice President and the other officers of the United \n     States who serve on the Group act not pursuant to statute but \n     instead only in relation to exercise of the President's \n     constitutional authorities, including his authority to \n     ``require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer \n     in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject \n     relating to the Duties of their respective Offices,'' to \n     ``take care that the Laws be faithfully executed,'' and, with \n     respect to Congress, to ``recommend to their Consideration \n     such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.'' \n     Further, the Comptroller General is not evaluating the \n     ``results'' of the Group's work; he is attempting to inquire \n     into the process by which the results of the Group's work \n     were reached. Finally, the Comptroller General has not \n     claimed that he is conducting the proposed investigation on \n     his own initiative, and has instead stated that he is \n     conducting it at the request of two Congressional committees, \n     yet no Committee (as distinguished from two individual \n     Members of Congress who serve as the ranking minority members \n     of two committees) has made such a request to the Comptroller \n     General.\n       Section 712, which permits the Comptroller General to \n     investigate matters related to the ``receipt, disbursement, \n     and use of public money,'' applies if at all only to his \n     question concerning the costs of the Group's work. Documents \n     that pertain to the costs of the Group already have been \n     produced to the Comptroller General as a matter of comity. \n     The narrow authority conferred by Section 712 does not \n     provide a basis for his other questions.\n       Section 716 allows the Comptroller General to seek to \n     compel production of documents only when he has the requisite \n     need for the documents for a lawful inquiry conducted in \n     accordance with Section 712 or 717. Because Sections 712 and \n     717 do not provide a basis for the Comptroller General's \n     inquiries, and because Section 716 is not an independent \n     source of authority to investigate, Section 716 provides no \n     authority to demand or compel production of the Vice \n     Presidential documents demanded. Moreover, the term \n     ``agency'' as used in Section 716 does not include the Vice \n     President of the United States, who is a constitutional \n     officer of the Government.\n       If the Comptroller General's misconstruction of the \n     statutes cited above were to prevail, his conduct would \n     unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning of the \n     Executive Branch. For example, due regard for the \n     constitutional separation of powers requires respecting the \n     independence of the President, the Vice President and the \n     President's other senior advisers as they execute the \n     function of developing recommendations for policy and \n     legislation--a core constitutional function of the Executive \n     Branch. Also, preservation of the ability of the Executive \n     Branch to function effectively requires respecting the \n     confidentiality of communications among a President, a Vice \n     President, the President's other senior advisers and others. \n     A President and his senior advisers must be able to work in \n     an atmosphere that respects confidentiality of communications \n     if the President is to get the good, candid advice and other \n     information upon which wise decisionmaking depends. Note that \n     while the Vice President is the President of the Senate, he \n     also has executive duties and responsibilities in support of \n     the President, as the Congress has by law recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10448-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10448-S10450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN CELEBRATION OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month \nin America, I believe it is utmost in our minds and hearts to remember \nthe horrendous attack on our nation's financial center in New York \nCity, and on the Pentagon, on September 11, 2001. Hispanic Americans I \nspeak with are anxious to support our nation's every effort to rid this \nworld of the incredible evil that carried out such an attack.\n  Hispanic Americans have answered our country's call to arms in every \nprevious war, and they have distinguished themselves as some of our \nnation's most heroic fighters. As President George W. Bush recently \nreminded us, ``Hispanic Americans served with heroism in every major \nAmerican military conflict.''\n  Many of my colleagues might not be aware of the fact that Hispanics \nin World War II were over-represented among Medal of Honor winners. I \nwould like to remember two of these distinguished medal winners from \nNew Mexico.\n  Joseph P. Martinez, born in Taos, New Mexico, gave his life for our \ncountry during World War II. In the Aleutians, finding himself in snow \ncovered trenches, he chose to advance against the enemy in the face of \nsevere hostile machine gun, rifle, and mortar fire. His example \ninspired others to advance in this difficult and dangerous climb.\n  After successfully and personally silencing several enemy trenches, \nhe reached the rim where he was fatally wounded. The U.S. Army \nrecognized Joe Martinez's valor beyond the call of\n\n[[Page S10449]]\n\nduty by awarding him the United States Medal of Honor.\n  In Vietnam, 22-year old U.S. Army Specialist Fourth Class Daniel \nFernandez of Albuquerque, New Mexico, sacrificed himself to save four \nof his comrades. Fernandez vaulted over his wounded sergeant and threw \nhimself on a grenade that was not noticed in time for the men around \nhim to save themselves. This action cost him his life. Fernandez also \nreceived the United States Medal of Honor.\n  There are many more stories about Hispanic Medal of Honor winners. \nOur nation is proud to have men and women like these in our ranks.\n  This month, I want Americans to remember Hispanic veterans from World \nWar I, World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam and Desert Storm. I can \npredict with great confidence that Hispanics in every service will earn \nmore Medals of Honor, Distinguished Service Crosses, and Silver and \nBronze Stars for valor in combat.\n  If these wartime contributions by Hispanics have been and will \ncontinue to be remarkable, those made on the homefront through lives \ninvested in communities are equally deserving of our recognition and \ngratitude. On August 15, President George W. Bush visited Albuquerque \nfor the grand opening of the Hispano Chamber of Commerce's Barelas Job \nOpportunity Center, a facility meant to help tear down barriers faced \nby Hispanics and others in finding employment or starting a new \nbusiness.\n\n  Helping open this business development center, the President drew \nattention to the spirit of the facility, that of citizens asking what \nthey could do to improve their community, and what they could do to \nhelp a neighbor in need. The President accurately and eloquently \nconcluded that this was ``the spirit of America, captured right here in \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico.''\n  I believe our President has it right. I am proud that the lives of \nHispanic New Mexicans are vital evidence of the spirit of America as \nthey invest themselves in families, schools, businesses, and churches. \nAnd New Mexicans recognize that these modern achievements build on a \ncenturies-long legacy of Hispanic history in our state, earning us a \npeerless role in our nation's diversity.\n  In New Mexico, we know that Hispanics were on the scene even before \nthe Mayflower set sail. The Hispanic influence in New Mexico shaping \nour architecture and culture has been significant since the arrival of \nSpanish explorer Don Juan de Onate near San Juan Pueblo in 1598, 22 \nyears before the landing at Plymouth Rock.\n  When the national media today talks and writes a lot about the recent \n``arrival'' of Hispanics on our national scene, they're recognizing a \ntalented, spirited people New Mexico has known for a long time.\n  I have mentioned the opening of the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of \nCommerce's Barelas Job Opportunity Center, marking the start of its \nimportant work to rebuild the economic viability of a deteriorated \nneighborhood and increase job opportunity.\n  I would like to mention other examples of commitment to community \naround our state, such as the Roswell Hispano Chamber of Commerce of \nRoswell, New Mexico. This group has been a unifying force in their \ncommunity's economic development issues, and have long supported the \nCharacter Counts program to see that the six pillars of character, \nRespect, Responsibility, Trustworthiness, Citizenship, Fairness, and \nCaring, are taught early in the classroom.\n  On September 24, Mr. I. Martin Mercado, President of Mercado \nConstruction in Albuquerque, received the national Small Business \nAdministration's Minority Small Business Person of the Year Award. The \nson of Mexican immigrants, Martin is a wonderful illustration of the \nAmerican dream, and of the important contributions that Hispanic-owned \nsmall businesses make to our economy.\n  Achievements of this kind throughout New Mexico have helped increase \nthe number of minority-owned businesses in our state by more than 50 \npercent in the last five years. There are now more than 22,000 \nHispanic-owned businesses in New Mexico.\n  As Hispanics gain long-overdue national recognition as a force that \ncannot, and should not, be ignored, we are reminded of countless \nstories like those I have mentioned. I believe that there is no better \ntime to work for federal policies that ensure that small businesses, \ncommunity organizations, and schools have the support they need to make \ndecisions in favor of economic success and strong families. This is the \nspirit of America.\n  Finally, I appreciate the opening for a new era in U.S.-Mexico \nrelations as Presidents Bush and Fox work to develop a partnership for \nprosperity across our shared border. Both nations have much to gain \nthrough the implementation of win-win policies on trade, immigration \nand the war on drugs. As we celebrate New Mexico's and America's \nHispanic heritage, I hope we will continue to capitalize on our common \nground with Mexico, making the most of new opportunities for trade and \ncooperation with our neighbor.\n  New Mexicans regularly enjoy and celebrate the centuries-long \ninfluence of Hispanic culture and traditions on our society. This month \nin which our nation recognizes the special contributions of Hispanic \nAmericans finds our country united as never before to rebuild and \ndefend this great land after a devastating attack. This in mind, there \ncould be no better time to honor Hispanic Americans for valiantly \nserving the needs of nation and community, defending our freedom, \nbettering our economy, and building strong families, for this is the \nspirit of America.\n  New Mexico's largest newspaper recently rendered a broad tribute to \nHispanic Americans. I ask unanimous consent that this September 23 \nAlbuquerque Journal article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, Sept. 23, 2001]\n\n           List a Source of Pride for Hispanics and Americans\n\n                            (By Dan Herrera)\n\n       The national celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, which \n     for some odd reason runs from Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, has \n     been obscured by the overwhelming shock and sorrow created by \n     the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.\n       But Hispanic Heritage Month has never been that big a \n     public spectacle, at least in these parts; instead, as \n     elsewhere, the weekend-long beer-company-promoted Cinco de \n     Mayo celebration has taken center stage among Hispanic-\n     oriented celebrations.\n       In fact, it's hard to find many special Hispanic Heritage \n     Month events in Albuquerque. Most notable is the free \n     Chautauqua series now under way at the National Hispanic \n     Cultural Center. Its opening performance, Jean Jordan as \n     Queen Isabella, had to be delayed because of the attacks on \n     the East Coast. History buffs can still catch several other \n     shows. Call the center at 246-2261 for more information. I \n     had a long conversation the other day with Ruben Salaz, \n     author of ``New Mexico: a Brief Multi-history,'' about \n     Hispanic Heritage Month. He believes New Mexico could reduce \n     its shamefully high Hispanic student dropout rate by putting \n     a greater emphasis in history classes on our state's long, \n     proud past.\n       He's got a point. Learning about important figures with \n     names like Juan de Onate, Diego de Vargas and Juan Bautista \n     de Anza, all early governors of the Spanish colony of New \n     Mexico who played especially important roles, alongside names \n     like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln \n     couldn't hurt. Students also might like learning more about \n     historically important Indians like Pope and Cuerno Verde \n     while they're at it.\n       New Mexico has always been much more than a stop along the \n     trail ultimately leading to California and Manifest Destiny. \n     But Hispanics also have played important roles in American \n     history outside of New Mexico.\n       So, in recognition of this special month, here is an \n     assortment of Americans you may not have known about or may \n     not have known were Hispanic. There was a time not too long \n     ago that nobody was counting, after all.\n       Most of the information was compiled using Salaz's \n     information-packed book and another wonderful book called \n     ``Hispanic Firsts: 500 Years of Extraordinary Achievement'' \n     by Nicolas Kanellos, which contains a 372-page listing of \n     accomplishments. Both belong in every library in New Mexico.\n       Joseph Hernandez: In 1822, the Whig party member from \n     Florida became the first Hispanic representative in the U.S. \n     Congress.\n       Octaviano Larrazolo: A New Mexico Republican, Larrazolo \n     became the first Hispanic U.S. Senator in 1928.\n       Dennis Chavez: In 1944, the New Mexico senator, a Democrat, \n     introduced the first Fair Employment Practices bill, which \n     prohibited discrimination because of race, creed or national \n     origin. The bill was defeated, but it was an important step \n     toward the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n       Bernardo de Galvez: A governor of Louisiana and brigadier \n     general during the Revolutionary War, he fought British \n     forces for\n\n[[Page S10450]]\n\n     three years along the Gulf of Mexico and captured Mobile and \n     Pensacola in 1781, forcing the British to fight the war on \n     two fronts. Galveston Bay in Texas is named after him.\n       Jorge Farragut: A Revolutionary War hero who fought at the \n     battle of Savannah and at the second defense of Charleston, \n     he would be outdone by his son, David.\n       David G. Farragut: He became the first admiral of the U.S. \n     Navy in 1866. As a Union commander during the Civil War, \n     Farragut gained immortality during the victory at Mobile \n     where, after being warned that the bay was filled with mines, \n     said, ``Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!'' Today, a \n     guided missile destroyer bears his name.\n       Philip Bazaar: In 1865, he became the first Hispanic \n     American to win the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n       Marcelino Serna: He was a soldier from Albuquerque who \n     became the first Hispanic to win the Distinguished Service \n     Cross in 1918 after single-handedly capturing 24 German \n     soldiers. He reportedly was not recommended for a Medal of \n     Honor because he was just a buck private and also could not \n     read or write English well enough to sign reports.\n       Guy Gabaldon: The 1960 movie ``Hell to Eternity'' is based \n     on this California's heroism in World War II, which led to \n     the surrender of 2,000 Japanese soldiers on Saipan Island.\n       Luis Walter Alvarez: Alvarez was one of the most \n     distinguished physicists in U.S. history. A member of the \n     Manhattan Project, he is credited with the development of the \n     triggering device for the first plutonium bomb. He flew in a \n     B-29 following the Enola Gay to observe the atomic bomb \n     explosion over Hiroshima. Among his many awards are the Nobel \n     Prize and the National Medal of Science.\n       George Santayana: The poet-philosopher in 1889 became the \n     first Hispanic writer to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard. In \n     1927 he became the first U.S. Hispanic to be awarded the Gold \n     Medal from the Royal Society of Literature in London.\n       Lucrezia Bori: She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera \n     in New York in 1912 and became an operatic diva. She led the \n     effort credited with saving the Met during the Depression.\n       Esteban Bellan: In 1871, Bellan became the first Hispanic \n     professional baseball player in the United States. He was a \n     black Cuban. Around the turn of the 20th century, when blacks \n     were no longer allowed to play in the majors, teams often had \n     to prove the ``racial purity'' of Hispanic players. Hispanics \n     from Vernon ``Lefty'' Gomez, to Juan Marichal, to Rod Carew, \n     to Sammy Sosa have long played star roles in professional \n     baseball.\n       Jim Plunkett: Of German, Irish and Mexican descent, \n     Plunkett was the first Hispanic Heisman Trophy winner and the \n     first to start as quarterback in the National Football \n     League.\n       Desi Arnaz: The first Hispanic television star and a \n     network broadcast pioneer, along with his wife Lucille Ball, \n     created one of the most popular series of all times: ``I Love \n     Lucy.''\n       The entertainment industry is packed with stars who either \n     had names that were not Spanish or changed their names to \n     mask their heritage during times of prejudice. Some are \n     Raquel Welch, Rita Hayworth, Anthony Quinn, Joan Baez, Linda \n     Ronstadt, Vicki Carr, Richie Valens, Mariah Carey and Freddy \n     Fender. I had one friend, a Deadhead, who never realized that \n     Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead was Hispanic until I told \n     him.\n       The list could go on and on, but you get the picture.\n       One thing to remember, though: While it may be Hispanic \n     Heritage Month, that heritage is being celebrated by \n     Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10450-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNITION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the evil acts perpetrated \non September 11, which took thousands of innocent lives in New York, \nWashington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, have brought out the best and worst \nin man. In the days following the terrorist attacks on the United \nStates, Americans gained a clearer picture of who our friends were by \ntheir sincere words and by their actions. In particular, I applaud the \nGovernment of the Republic of China on Taiwan which quickly offered its \nassistance, support, and strong condemnation of terrorism.\n  Recently, I learned that the Republic of China on Taiwan has canceled \nhere in the United States what should have been a great day of \ncelebration for the Taiwanese people living in this country. The \nRepublic of China's National Day was to have been held today, October \n10, in order to honor and remember those who perished in the September \n11 attacks. I am touched by the Republic China's actions and their \nsympathy for the victims.\n  Despite continual attempts by the People's Republic of China \npolitically and militarily to threaten the Republic of China on Taiwan, \nthat island nation has remained committed to democracy and has matured \ninto a prosperous nation. On Taiwan's National Day, I believe Taiwan \nneeds a greater international presence, and I support that island \nnation's desire to share its resources and ideas. This can only be done \nthrough Taiwan's inclusion into international organizations. As we \nstruggle to recover from the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001, \nlet us always be mindful of who America's true allies and friends are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10450-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10450-S10451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY EMPLOYEES WHO LOST THEIR LIVES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of seven \nemployees of the Defense Intelligence Agency who lost their lives in \nthe horrific terrorist attacks that befell our Nation on the morning of \nSeptember 11, 2001, and to pay tribute to the duty and sacrifice these \ncitizens have rendered in service to their country. Today, Vice Admiral \nThomas R. Wilson, Director, Defense Intelligence Agency, will preside \nover a memorial service at Bolling Air Force Base for these innocent \nvictims of terrorism. As part of the ceremony, the names of these brave \ncitizens will be added to DIA's Patriots Memorial at the Defense \nIntelligence Analysis Center at Bolling, joining other members of DIA \nwho were killed in service to their Nation.\n  As I read the biographies of these fellow countrymen, I was struck by \nthe picture they paint of our great Nation, young and old, ethnically \ndiverse, two veterans, family men and women. They represent the very \nfabric of America and embody the American values of opportunity and \nfreedom. They also represent the finest traditions of selfless service \nto family, community, and Nation to which we all aspire. We mourn with \ntheir families.\n  I now call the roll of those seven citizens, members of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, who died, in service to their Nation at the \nPentagon on September 11, 2001: Rosa Marie Chapa of Springfield, VA; \nSondra N. Foster of Clinton, MD; Robert J. Hymel of Woodbridge, VA; \nShelley A. Marshal of Marbury, MD; Patricia E. Michley of Springfield, \nVA; Charles E. Sabin of Burke, VA; and Karl W.

Foster served as a Senior Management Officer in the Office \nof the Comptroller, Deputy Comptroller for Force Structure and \nManagement. Ms. Foster began her civilian career with DIA on August 27, \n1978. Ms. Foster was responsible for conducting analysis and \nevaluations of the manpower and functional implications of plans and \nprograms, and developing and executing complex resource management \nactivities. Ms. Foster is survived by her husband, Kenneth Foster.\n  Robert J.

Mr. Hymel began his civilian career with DIA on March 7, \n1994 after retiring from the Air Force with over 23 years of active \nduty service. Mr. Hymel was responsible for DIA joint manpower issues \nthat focused on military human intelligence management and \norganization. Mr. Hymel is survived by his wife, Pat Hymel and \ndaughter, Natalie Connors.\n  Shelley A.

Ms. Mickley began her civilian career\n\n[[Page S10451]]\n\nwith DIA on August 2, 1998 after working as a Budget Analyst for the \nDepartment of the Air Force since 1980. Ms. Mickley was responsible for \nthe development, presentation, and execution of detailed budget \nestimates with a primary focus on infrastructure financial management \nand the program/ budget interaction process.

Mr. Sabin started his career with DIA in \nAugust 1981 as an Accountant in the Financial Policy and Accounting \nDivision, Comptroller. He was selected as a Defense Intelligence Senior \nLevel in August 1999. Prior to arriving at DIA, he served several years \nwith the Department of Army. He served for 31 years in Federal service. \nMr. Sabin is survived by two sons, Charles E. Sabin Jr. and Paul Sabin.\n  Karl W.

They all went about their daily lives \nthat day, striving to have an honorable, decent life and toiling to \nprovide for their families, their communities, and their country, each \nin their own way. None expected or deserved to experience the senseless \nterror that intruded upon our Nation on September 11.\n  There is an imperative that emerges from this tragedy. These brave \nmen and women of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and their compatriots \nthat also perished that day, must not be forgotten and must not have \ndied in vain. Today, their names are engraved on a DIA memorial to \ncourage and service. Today also, our Nation is united in purpose as \nseldom before in its history to rid the world of terrorism. It is a \nnoble cause, destined for success, largely because these tragic losses \nhave awakened a sense of justice and decency in our Nation and amongst \ncivilized peoples around the world.\n  On behalf of a mournful, but grateful Nation, I extend heartfelt \ncondolences to the families and loved ones of those lost, so \ntragically, on September 11. Together, we celebrate lives lived well \nand honorably. Together we mourn lives ended prematurely and families \ndevastated by loss and grief. Together we unite to remember and muster \nthe resolve to ensure, never again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10451-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S NATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

In a \nshow of unity and shared mourning over this tragic event, President \nChen Shui-bian ordered all government flags be flown at half mast for \ntwo days and asked all government offices in the United States to \ncancel their National Day celebrations.\n  Taiwan was one of the first countries to declare its unequivocal \nsupport and cooperation with the United States. Taiwan has also offered \nits resources to help in the worldwide fight against terrorism.\n  During this time of rebuilding and remembrance, it is important to \nrecognize that Taiwan will be marking its National Day on October 10. \nThe Republic of China on Taiwan is a true democracy which guarantees \nall the political freedom and civil liberty to its people. In addition, \nTaiwan is one of the most important economic players in the world. \nDespite its small population of 23 million people, Taiwan has financial \nresources surpassing those of many Western countries.\n  There are many challenges facing Taiwan and America. The United \nStates must continue to encourage productive dialogue between Taiwan \nand the Chinese mainland to promote peace and security in the region. \nAt the same time, Taiwan must be allowed to participate in \ninternational organizations that allow Taiwan's success to be emulated \naround the world. On Taiwan's National Day, I hope Taiwan and the \nChinese mainland will one day be reunited under principles of freedom \nand democracy, thus leading to lasting stability and prosperity in the \nAsian Pacific Region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10451-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10451-S10452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONDEMNING BIGOTRY AND VIOLENCE AGAINST SIKH-AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Throughout those years, America has attracted \nindividuals from around the world who found refuge from persecution for \ntheir religious beliefs. Sikh-Americans have made America their home \nfor over one hundred years, and in that time they have significantly \ncontributed to the vitality, prosperity, and harmony of the communities \nin which they live.\n  In the time that has passed since September 11, Sikh-Americans have \nbeen vocal in their support for Americans, both for those that lost \ntheir lives in the attack and those that now risk their lives in their \nattempt to bring to justice those that are responsible. But sadly, \nSikh-Americans have been among the initial and repeated victims of hate \ncrimes in the United States since the attacks, and they continue to \nsuffer daily from actual violence and threats of violence. This comes \nin spite of unambiguous remarks by President Bush and Attorney General \nAshcroft that any inappropriate activity emanating from either \nreligious or ethnic intolerance would be prosecuted to the fullest \nextent of the law. It is distasteful to me that in our search for \nterrorist schemes, necessary though it is, some Americans have looked \ntoward the most convenient and conspicuous available target to blame, \nthat being individuals of Middle Eastern or South Asian descent whose \nappearance is considered different than the norm. As we learn more and \nmore of the origins of these radical religious movements, it is \nimportant that we refrain from painting all religions and ethnicities \nwith a very broad and indiscriminate brush. Although radical religious \nmovements may share the name of a major religion, they clearly \nobfuscate the basic tenets and purposes of these religions, especially \nthose related to tolerance, understanding, and peace.\n  In my own State of New Mexico, I am proud to say we have a large, \nenergetic, and engaged Sikh-American population. They live throughout \nmy State and contribute significantly to the professional, economic, \nand spiritual vitality of the communities in which they live. The jobs \nthat they hold, whether they are doctors, lawyers, engineers, \nbusinessmen, educators, or social service providers, are essential to \nthe social and economic welfare of the people in New Mexico. They \nalways have been, and always will be, an integral part of their \ncommunities, and, accordingly, they have been treated in a manner that \nreflects their position in my State as friends, neighbors, and \ncolleagues. That treatment should continue today, tomorrow, and in the \nfuture.\n  Over the years, Sikh-Americans have done much to make New Mexico a \nbetter place to live. They have created the 3HO Foundation, a non-\nprofit organization dedicated to the service and teaching of the \nscience of Yoga and mediation. The organization has served in a \nconsultative manner to the Economic and Social Council of the United \nNations since 1994. Sikh-Americans sponsor the International Peace \nPrayer Day, part of their effort to recognize\n\n[[Page S10452]]\n\nall human beings as equals and to establish egalitarian and democratic \nsocieties across the world. They contribute to charitable organizations \nand establish businesses that have as their foremost motivation the \ndistribution of products and assistance to those in need. Sikh-\nAmericans are an asset to New Mexico in every way.\n  The resolution introduced by Senator Durbin and co-sponsored by \nmyself and many other colleagues states in unequivocal terms that: 1. \nbigotry and any acts of violence or discrimination against any \nAmerican, including Sikh-Americans should be condemned; 2. the civil \nrights and civil liberties of all Americans, including Sikh-Americans, \nshould be protected; 3. local and Federal law enforcement authorities \nshould work to prevent hate crimes against all Americans, including \nSikh-Americans, and; 4. local and Federal law enforcement authorities \nshould prosecute to the fullest extent of the law all those who commit \nhate crimes, including those against Sikh-Americans.\n  I support this legislation in the strongest possible manner and I \nstate in the strongest possible terms that the kind of violence Sikh-\nAmericans have suffered from since the September 11 attack must stop. \nFurthermore, I ask local, State, and Federal law enforcement to re-\ndouble their efforts to prevent these abhorrent actions and prosecute \nperpetrators of such actions to the full extent of the law. We need to \nmake it clear that acts of violence against other religions and \nethnicities as a means of exacting revenge for the recent terrorist \nattacks are unacceptable and will not be tolerated in this country.\n  America has long been a beacon of freedom and tolerance in the \ninternational system, but it goes without saying that it suffers in \nstature when the civil rights of Sikh-Americans, as well as Americans \nof Muslim, Hindu, or other religious persuasion, come under open \nattack. In my view, these individual abuses are not indicative of the \npeople we as Americans are, nor are they reflective of the society that \nwe aspire to be. But they have a cost and we cannot ignore them. It is \ntime that we acknowledge the contemptuous behavior that is occurring, \nunite as a country in our universal condemnation of hate crimes of any \ntype, and censure it to the fullest extent of the law.\n  There is no doubt that we are in a difficult moment in our country's \nhistory and we must take extraordinary steps to prevent further \ninjuries and loss of life. But even now we need to take care to not \nabandon the principles and the spirit of our Constitution and the Bill \nof Rights. Indeed, it is my hope that we use these unfortunate \ncircumstances as an opportunity to move forward with an even more \nsincere and collective commitment to the ideals that have made this \nNation so great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10452-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10452-S10454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FISCAL YEAR 2002 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to comment on \nthe passage of the fiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act \nthat passed the Senate last week by a vote of 99 to 0. The annual \nprocess of authorizing funding for our nation's armed forces and \ndefense activities is always a grave and important matter with profound \nimplications for our national defense and global security. In light of \nthe recent and vicious terrorist attacks on the symbols of our \nfinancial and military power and the murder of thousands of innocent \nAmericans, this process has become even more significant.\n  To that end, it is entirely appropriate and necessary that a major \nfocus of this legislation is combating international terrorism and \nother asymmetric threats such as terrorism involving weapons of mass \ndestruction, including the use of nuclear, biological, or chemical \nweapons. In my view, we ought to redouble our efforts and remain \nvigilant in our counterterrorism activities to prevent these tragedies \nfrom occurring and to deter those who contemplate such acts of \nbarbarism. The fiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act \ntakes a number of important steps in thwarting terrorism. It authorizes \n$5.6 billion to deter and defend against the threat of terrorism--an \nincrease of $1.0 billion over fiscal year 2001 levels. Specifically, it \nincreases funding by $217.2 million to the Department of Defense's \nCombating Terrorism Initiative--which is aimed at defending and \nresponding to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Another important \ninitiative includes a $10 million increase to the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff's Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiative Fund which \ntargets and identifies emerging threats from terrorist organizations \nand funds vital counterterrorism activities and training by our \nnation's armed forces.\n  This legislation also continues our efforts to cease the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In particular, this \nlegislation authorizes $403.0 million for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction program which has successfully helped destroy and \ndismantle more than 5,000 nuclear warheads and more than 1,000 nuclear \nmissiles in the former Soviet Union. One of the most critically \nimportant and innovative provisions of the Nunn-Lugar program--the \nInitiatives for Proliferation Prevention program--has helped prevent \nRussian scientists from exporting their knowledge of nuclear weapons or \nother weapons of mass destruction to rogue states.\n  Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Warner deserve to be commended for \ntheir efforts to find agreement on the missile defense issue. \nProvisions that would have sought to prevent the Administration from \nengaging in activities that would have violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty were dropped from the bill as part of the compromise \nreached by Chairman Levin and Senator Warner. Chairman Levin has \nindicated that these provisions--which have important implications for \nour national security--will be considered as a stand-alone bill at a \nlater time. In addition, $1.3 billion in funding that was cut from the \nPresident's missile defense budget request and targeted toward \ncounterterrorism activities will be used to fund--at the discretion of \nthe President--missile defense activities or counterterrorism \nactivities.\n  Certainly, we ought to do all we can--especially in light of the \nterrorist attack--to protect our nation from all threats, including \nballistic missiles. I support the testing and development of a limited \nnational missile defense system, so long as it is consistent with \ninternational arms control treaties and enhances global security. \nHowever, the unilateral abrogation of the 1972 ABM Treaty by the United \nStates would be highly destabilizing, in my view, and could expedite \nChina's nuclear modernization plans. It could also fuel an \ninternational arms race between India and Pakistan, which is not in any \nnation's interest. I hope that we can continue to debate these \nimportant issues that have profound implications for our nation's \ndefense and foreign policy.\n  The fiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization provides $343.5 \nbillion in funding for vital national security activities of the \nDepartment of Defense and certain nuclear non-proliferation programs of \nthe Department of Energy. All in all, this legislation represents an \nincrease of $32.9 billion--a 10 percent increase over last year's \nlevels and represents the largest increase in defense spending since \nthe mid-1980s. Much of the funding increases are targeted, rightfully \nso, to the men and women who serve in the armed forces, including: \nincreases in compensation to improve the quality of life of U.S. forces \nand their families; increasing military pay; and increasing housing \nallowances and educational benefits.\n  This legislation also includes a provision authorizing the \nAdministration to consider and possibly recommend an additional round \nof base closures and realignments, BRAC, in 2003. It authorizes the \nSecretary of Defense--in consultation with Congress--to appoint members \nto a bipartisan commission tasked with making recommendations on the \nclosure and realignment of military facilities. Their recommendations \nwould come before the President--en masse--who would either approve or \ndisapprove of the commission's report. If the President agrees with the \ncommission's recommendations, Congress would have an up-or-down vote on \nthe entire list of recommendations.\n  Since 1995, I have voted against additional rounds of base closures \nbecause I felt it was premature to authorize them without knowing the \nfull effect, costs, and savings associated with previous rounds. It has \nnow been six years\n\n[[Page S10453]]\n\nsince the last round of base closures were authorized, and Secretary \nRumsfeld has strongly supported an additional round of closures to free \nup funding for the modernization and transformation of our nation's \narmed forces to meet the security challenges of the 21st century. The \nDepartment of Defense has estimated savings of $14 billion dollars from \nprevious rounds of base closures and has maintained that the U.S. armed \nforces has 20 to 25 percent excess capacity resulting from too many \nmilitary bases. While we ought do all we can to streamline and improve \nthe efficiency of our nation's armed forces, I believe we should be \nvery careful and judicious about the closing of miliary bases. After \nall, once a military base is closed, it will most likely be gone \nforever. My home state of Connecticut has been particularly affected by \nprevious rounds, and I believe that decisions to close military \nfacilities must be done with the utmost care that is consistent with \nour national security needs. While I support the provision in this \nlegislation to authorize an additional round of closures, it does not \nnecessarily mean that I will agree with the recommendations. I will \nreserve judgment on the merits of their recommendations if and when the \ncommission's report is completed.\n\n  Overall, this legislation includes vital increases in military \nreadiness and preparedness, and represents an important first step \ntoward modernizing and transforming the military to meet the security \nchallenges of the 21st century. To that end, I am very pleased that \nthis legislation recognizes and rewards the ingenuity and technological \nacumen of Connecticut's highly skilled workforce, defense and aerospace \nfirms, and contractors.\n  Increases in funding for the procurement of Sirkorsky Black Hawk UH-\n60 helicopters reflect the critical importance that this aircraft holds \nfor the Army, Navy, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve. This \nlegislation authorizes funding for 10 additional UH-60 Black Hawk \nhelicopters for the Army National Guard--addressing a critical funding \nshortfall by meeting the Guard's number one unfunded priority. These \nhigh-quality, technologically advanced, utility helicopters provide \ncritical functions for the nation's armed forces, and this legislation \nrecognizes their importance to our national defense.\n  This legislation also provides $2.2 billion for the production of a \nnew Virginia-class submarine by Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut \nand authorizes $684 million in advanced procurement for two new attack \nsubmarines in fiscal year 2003 and 2004. This will allow Electric Boat \nto produce these state-of-the-art attack submarines in the most \nefficient and economical manner possible. The advanced funding also \nincreases the likelihood of increasing submarine production in the near \nfuture--perhaps by 2006--which is a critical component of meeting long-\nrange defense needs. Finally, this legislation authorizes $440 million \nfor the SSGN Trident conversion program, which will allow the U.S. Navy \nto convert four Ohio-class submarines to fire conventional Tomahawk \nmissiles and perform special and covert operations. These submarines \nhave 22 years of hull life left, and converting these submarines will \nprovide the U.S. Navy with invaluable stealth capability and fire \npower. I am pleased that much of the work for converting these \nsubmarines will be performed by talented, diligent workers in \nSoutheastern Connecticut.\n  This legislation funds many weapons programs that will play a \ncritical role in our national defense in the near future, including the \nF-22, the Joint Strike Fighter, and the Comanche helicopter. For the \nnear term, this legislation also provides funding to upgrade the \nengines of the aging fleet of F-15s and F-16s.\n  Joint STARS--the highly sophisticated and technologically advanced \nradar surveillance aircraft system--is fully funded at $283.2 million \nwith $46 million in advanced procurement of an additional Joint STARS \nplatform in the future. This advanced radar system is manufactured at \nNorthrop Grumman's Norden facility in Norwalk, Connecticut. Theater \nCommanders-in-Chief have consistently articulated the need for \nadditional Joint STARS aircraft, and these platforms have historically \nprovided vital surveillance and reconnaissance functions in the Persian \nGulf, Bosnia, and Kosovo.\n  I would also like to mention some other important programs authorized \nunder this legislation. Funding for fifteen C-17 transport airplanes--\npowered by Pratt & Whitney F117 jet engines--is provided under this \nbill for a total of $3.5 billion. In addition, funding for aircraft \ntraining systems for the U.S. Navy--also powered by Pratt & Whitney \nengines--is authorized for an additional $44.6 million dollars above \nthe President's request. And, $4.5 million is provided for important \nmilitary research projects conducted at the University of Connecticut \nin the area of medical vaccines and fuel cells.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to address two amendments that I \nplanned on offering to the FY 2002 National Defense Authorization bill. \nThe first amendment--which was adopted unanimously by voice vote--\nauthorizes funding for the FIRE Act through fiscal year 2004. This \ncritically important program provides federal grant funding for \nprofessional and volunteer fire departments to hire firefighters, \npurchase equipment, and invest in training. The tragic events of \nSeptember 11, 2001, only serves to underscore the critical role that \nthe brave men and women of fire and emergency response departments play \nin protecting and saving lives.\n  This amendment addresses a major funding shortfall for training and \nequipment for our local fire departments. Last year, while Congress \nappropriated $100 million in grant funding under the FIRE Act, local \nfire departments submitted nearly $3 billion in grant requests. This \nrepresents nearly $2.8 billion worth of unfunded requests under the \nFIRE Act program. My amendment addresses this funding shortfall by \nauthorizing up to $600 million in fiscal year 2002, up to $800 million \nin fiscal year 2003, and up to $1 billion in fiscal year 2004 to meet \nthe burgeoning demands of local fire departments as they seek to \nprotect communities and save lives.\n  I also filed an amendment on the critically important issue of \nelection reform. The National Defense Authorization bill included \nrequirements for state and local election officials to meet with regard \nto voting by military and overseas voters. While I strongly support the \nvoting rights provisions included in the National Defense Authorization \nbill, I would like to see these issues addressed in a more \ncomprehensive and meaningful way. I have authored legislation, S. 565, \nthe Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act--which passed the Senate \nRules Committee by a vote of 10 to 0--that would accomplish this by \nensuring that basic, federal standards to secure the right to vote in \nfederal elections are provided to all eligible American voters. In \norder to accomplish this in an expedited fashion, I planned to offer my \nelection reform bill as an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization bill in the hope that this would spur action to enact \nmeaningful, comprehensive election reform into law before Congress \nadjourns for the year.\n  However, in lieu of offering that amendment and in order to \nfacilitate swift enactment of the defense bill, I included language in \na bipartisan amendment--offered by Senator Allard--which recognizes the \nneed to ensure that all eligible voters have their vote counted. \nSpecifically, this sense-of-the-Senate language states that each \nelection administrator of a Federal, State, or local election should \nensure that all eligible American voters, regardless of race, \nethnicity, disability, the language they speak, or the resources of the \ncommunity in which they live should have an equal opportunity to cast a \nvote and have that vote counted. While this represents an important \nstep forward, I will continue to diligently work toward passing \nmeaningful and comprehensive election reform legislation during this \nsession of Congress.\n  As our nation embarks on what promises to be a long and difficult war \nagainst terrorism, our nation's armed services will need the full \nsupport and resources of the government and the American people. The \nfiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization bill represents the \nfirst step toward providing the men and women of the armed forces with \nthe resources they need to succeed in this endeavor, and I strongly \nsupport its passage.\n\n[[Page S10454]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10452-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10452-S10454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FISCAL YEAR 2002 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD.

In \norder to accomplish this in an expedited fashion, I planned to offer my \nelection reform bill as an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization bill in the hope that this would spur action to enact \nmeaningful, comprehensive election reform into law before Congress \nadjourns for the year.\n  However, in lieu of offering that amendment and in order to \nfacilitate swift enactment of the defense bill, I included language in \na bipartisan amendment--offered by Senator Allard--which recognizes the \nneed to ensure that all eligible voters have their vote counted. \nSpecifically, this sense-of-the-Senate language states that each \nelection administrator of a Federal, State, or local election should \nensure that all eligible American voters, regardless of race, \nethnicity, disability, the language they speak, or the resources of the \ncommunity in which they live should have an equal opportunity to cast a \nvote and have that vote counted. While this represents an important \nstep forward, I will continue to diligently work toward passing \nmeaningful and comprehensive election reform legislation during this \nsession of Congress.\n  As our nation embarks on what promises to be a long and difficult war \nagainst terrorism, our nation's armed services will need the full \nsupport and resources of the government and the American people. The \nfiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization bill represents the \nfirst step toward providing the men and women of the armed forces with \nthe resources they need to succeed in this endeavor, and I strongly \nsupport its passage.\n\n[[Page S10454]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10454-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 27, \n2001 at Kent State University, OH. Mikell Nagy, an openly gay \nuniversity student, was eating breakfast with friends when he heard \nsomeone make an anti-gay comment toward another friend across the room. \nHe went over to see if the friend was okay. The next thing he knew, a \nman walked up behind him, called him a ``faggot'' and punched him in \nthe face. According to witnesses, blood was pouring from cuts above his \nleft eye. His two front teeth were chipped in the incident and his \nright cheek stayed swollen for over a week. The incident resulted in an \non-campus rally against hate crimes.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10454-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, in July of this year, Governor Mike \nEasley of my State of North Carolina, issued a proclamation designating \nthe week of October 21-27, 2001 as ``World Population Awareness Week.'' \nThe proclamation draws attention to the serious issues associated with \nrapid population growth and urbanization, including infrastructure, \npollution, transportation, health, sanitation, and public safety \nproblems. I join Governor Easley in his recognition of World Population \nAwareness Week. I ask unanimous consent to have his proclamation \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   A Proclamation Designating World Population Awareness Week by the \n                Governor of the State of North Carolina\n\n       Whereas, the world population stands today at more than 6.1 \n     billion and increases by some one billion every 13 years; and\n       Whereas, the most significant feature of the 20th century \n     phenomenon of unprecedented world population growth was rapid \n     urbanization; and\n       Whereas, cities and urban areas today occupy only 2 percent \n     of the earth's land, but contain 50 percent of its population \n     and consume 75 percent of its resources; and\n       Whereas, the most rapid urban growth over the next two \n     decades is expected in cities with populations ranging from \n     250,000 to one million; and\n       Whereas, along with advantages and amenities, the rapid \n     growth of cities leads to substantial pressure on their \n     infrastructure, manifested in sanitary, health and crime \n     problems, as well as deterring the provision of basic social \n     services; and\n       Whereas, in the interest of national and environmental \n     security, nations must redouble voluntary and humanitarian \n     efforts to stabilize their population growth at sustainable \n     levels, while at all times respecting the cultural and \n     religious beliefs and values of their citizens; and\n       Whereas, the theme of World Population Awareness Week in \n     2001 is ``Population and the Urban Future'';\n       Now, therefore, I Michael F.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank Prime Minister of \nGreece Costas Simitis and President of Greece Kostis Stephanopoulos for \ntheir country's support of the United States in the aftermath of the \nSeptember 11 attack on America. Prime Minister Simitis declared \nGreece's solidarity to the American people, and President \nStephanopoulos expressed absolute condemnation of the attacks.\n  Greece once again came to the side of its NATO ally, the United \nStates, by fully committing its resources to combat and eradicate \nterrorism. Greece's solidarity reflects longstanding historical, \npolitical, and cultural ties based on a common heritage and shared \ndemocratic values. This solidarity is further evidenced by the fact \nthat Greece is one of only seven allies to join the United States in \nevery major conflict in the 20th century.\n  The start of the 21st century poses new challenges for the United \nStates and Greece. International terrorism attempts to undermine \ndemocracy and triumph over peace. I am pleased that Greeks and \nAmericans stand shoulder to shoulder with freedom-loving people around \nthe world in a united effort against the forces of terror.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10454-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MARGARET GODFREY\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, on behalf of countless \nthousands who have better lives because of her, I rise to pay tribute \nto an outstanding Oregonian: Margaret Godfrey. On November 2, 2001, \nMargaret Godfrey will be formally recognized for her life's work in the \nfield of immigration.\n  Margaret Pellischek was born in Austria in 1928 and soon exhibited a \ntalent for art and learning the English language. Margaret was 17 when \nWorld War II ended and was hired by the British to act as a liaison \nbetween the community and the British zone of occupied Austria. Given \nher excellent command of English, Margaret also worked with refugees to \nobtain military intelligence information.\n  Margaret continued her work with refugees and began assisting the \nUnited Nations and International Refugee Organization with the \nresettlement of almost 22 million ``displaced persons.'' This event \nbegan a five decade career in helping the world's refugees.\n  Margaret Pellischek met John Godfrey in 1952 and they were married on \nJuly 18, 1953. She arrived in the United States on November 1, 1953 and \nimmediately continued her refugee work. Mrs. Godfrey, as she became \nknown in Oregon, worked with Catholic Charities to resettle refugees \nfrom Indonesia, Uganda, Czechoslovakia, and Southeast Asia. In 1978, \nshe left Catholic Charities and joined Reverend Father Francis Kennard \nin founding the Immigration Counseling Service.\n  Since 1953, Margaret Godfrey has devoted her life to helping those \nwho have fled poverty, persecution, war, and political unrest. She has \naffected countless thousands of lives and I am humbled by her \ndedication to public service. Margaret Godfrey cannot sit in a \nrestaurant, walk into a hotel, or ride a bus without someone pausing to \nthank her.\n  Oregon is truly grateful for her work and her contribution to our \ncommunity. The author Alice Tyler once wrote, ``Some people come into \nour lives and leave footprints on our heart.'' Margaret Godfrey has \nleft her footprints on all our hearts, and we are deeply \nindebted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10454-5", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10454-S10455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BEA GADDY\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life \nand legacy of Mrs. Bea Gaddy--a great lady whose mission was to improve \nthe lives of our poorest citizens.\n  Bea Gaddy was a legend in Baltimore. Her life was one of service to \nthe poor. She worked tirelessly to provide food, housing, opportunity--\nand hope--to Baltimore's neediest citizens. She transformed her home in \nEast Baltimore into the Patterson Park Emergency Food Center. She \nworked tirelessly to provide housing to the homeless. She worked to \nimprove education and housing. She even made sure children had presents \nat Christmas. Thousands of people reached out to her for help. She \nhelped them all--and she did it with compassion and respect.\n  Mrs. Gaddy's Thanksgiving dinners are legendary--providing dinner to \nas many as 20,000 people. She showed us all that the best way to show \nthankfulness for the blessings of life was to share these blessings \nwith others.\n  She knew what is was like to be hungry, and to not have enough money \nto pay for heat. Because she knew what it felt like to be poor--she \nknew how to help people to help themselves.\n  I can't imagine Baltimore without her. Yet my hope is that she has \ntaught so many people what it means to care--that her work will \ncontinue.\n  Mrs. Gaddy received a lot of honors--including the ``Marylander of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10455]]\n\nYear,'' and one of former President Bush's ``Thousand Points of \nLight.'' Mrs. Gaddy certainly deserved these honors--but what mattered \nmore to her was that these honors helped her to help even more people.\n  Mrs. Gaddy's passing is a great loss--but her life was a triumph. My \nthoughts and prayers are with her many friends and family--and with the \nmany people whose lives she touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10455-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A TRIBUTE TO ``WOMEN OF INFLUENCE''\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nrecognize ten outstanding women in business who have been honored by \nthe Des Moines Business Record as ``Women of Influence.''\n  Each in their own way, these women have left a positive mark in the \nIowa business world and Iowa as a whole. More than 100 women were \nnominated for this honor and the selections were made based on lifetime \nachievements in the workplace and in the community.\n  I wanted to take a few minutes to recognize a group of women who have \nrecently been honored for their years of leadership in the Greater Des \nMoines area. They are: Mary Bontrager, executive vice president of the \nGreater Des Moines Partnership; Joyce Chapman, senior vice president of \nWest Des Moines Bank; Angela Connolly, Polk County Supervisor; \nChristine Hensley, Des Moines City Councilwoman; Elizabeth Jacobs, \nstate legislator and, assistant director of corporate relations to the \nPrinciple Financial Group; Jerilee M. Mace, executive director of the \nDes Moines Opera; Dr. Sheila McGuire Riggs, executive director of the \nWellmark Foundation; Dr. Rizwan Z. Shah, medical director of the Child \nAbuse Program at Blank Children's Hospital; Margaret Swanson, 50-year \nvolunteer and philanthropist; Margaret Toomey, activist for youths \nliving in poverty, community college teacher and former executive \ndirector of the Oakridge Neighborhood, a private non-profit subsidized \nhousing community.\n  I congratulate each of them on this notable achievement. In addition \nto their specific accomplishments, each of these women serve as an \ninspiration to young women in Iowa who hope to achieve great heights in \nbusiness and in the community. I applaud Connie Wimer and the Des \nMoines Business Record for recognizing their outstanding contributions. \nThese women are an integral part of the strength of Iowa's \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10455-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10455-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10455-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:28 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1749.

A bill to support community-based group homes for young \nmothers and their children; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nLieberman and Domenici in introducing the Second Chance Homes Promotion \nAct. This legislation would provide needed resources to expand and \nimprove the availability of community-based, adult-supervised group \nhomes for unmarried teenage mothers and their babies.\n  Although rates of teenage pregnancy in the United States have dropped \nin recent years, they remain higher than most industrialized nations. \nToday, four in 10 young women become pregnant at least once before \nentering adulthood. Teenage parents are less likely to graduate from \nschool and more likely to end up on public assistance than other \nadolescents. Also, children born to teenage mothers tend to fare more \npoorly in school, are less likely to receive needed health care \nservices, and are at greater risk for abuse and neglect. ``Second \nChance Homes'' help improve this situation by providing teen parents \nwith a safe, nurturing environment where they can receive guidance in \nparenting, child development, budgeting, health and nutrition.\n  The welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996 requires that minor \nteens live with an adult in order to receive welfare benefits. During \ndebate on this legislation, I worked with Senator Lieberman and others \nto allow second chance homes to qualify as an alternative residence for \nteenage parents who may be at risk for abuse, neglect or other serious \nproblems in their home. Since this time, we have learned that teenagers \nwho were provided the opportunity to live in second chance homes are \nmore likely to continue their education or receive job training, less \nlikely to have a second teenage pregnancy, and more likely to find \ngainful employment that allows them to leave the welfare rolls. I \nstrongly believe these are promising results.\n  Unfortunately, not all teenage parents who might benefit from second \nchance homes have access to these residences. Today, there are \napproximately 100 second chance homes nationwide, located in only six \nStates. This legislation would provide resources for improving the \nhomes that already exist and creating additional homes where none \nexist, particularly in tribal and rural communities where there may be \nfewer options for teenage parents and their babies to receive the \nassistance they need. Finally, this legislation would provide resources \nthat can be used to conduct further evaluations on the quality and \neffectiveness of second chance homes. It is my hope others will join us \nin supporting this important effort.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Conrad \nand Domenici to introduce the Second Chance Homes Promotion Act of \n2001. This legislation will promote the expansion of Second Chance \nHomes for parenting teenagers and provide needed resources for this \ninnovative and accomplished program.\n  The United States has the highest rate of teen pregnancy and births \nin the Western industrialized world. This costs the country at least $7 \nbillion annually. Four in 10 young women become pregnant at least once \nbefore they reach the age of 20, nearly one million a year. Teen \nmothers are less likely to complete high school, and more likely to end \nup on welfare. The children of teenage mothers have lower birth \nweights, are more likely to perform poorly in school, and are at \ngreater risk of abuse and neglect. But we know we can do something \nabout this. Second Chance Homes are an essential tool to improve the \nlife chances of these teenagers.\n  In the 1996 welfare reform legislation, I worked to develop the \nconcept of Second Chance Homes as an alternative for minor teen parents \nrequired by that law to live at home or under adult supervision. \nWelfare reform required states to provide or assist teen mothers in \nlocating a second chance home, maternity home, or other supportive \nliving arrangement if they cannot live at home because of abuse, \nneglect or other reasons.\n  Since 1996, these homes have produced notable and promising results: \nfewer second pregnancies, slightly higher adoption rates, less child \nabuse, better maternal and child health, dramatically increased school \ncompletion rates, higher employment rates, reduced welfare dependency. \nClearly these are successes we want to replicate.\n  Currently only six States have networks of Second Chance Homes. This \nbill will provide resources to expand the number of Second Chance Homes \nacross the country to continue these encouraging trends and assist \nthese young mothers to the brightest future they can have.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation \nwith Senators Lieberman and Conrad that will help to address a very \nserious problem facing our Nation. The rise of teenage pregnancy has \nmany implications for American society in terms of educational and \nemployment opportunities, economic self-sufficiency, children's health, \nand child abuse and crime prevention. For example, many teenage mothers \nfind that their educational and vocational opportunities are severely \nlimited. In fact, only one-third of teenage mothers complete high \nschool and receive their diploma. Furthermore, teenage pregnancy has \nbeen linked with increases in child abuse and criminal activity. But, \nperhaps most disturbing is the fact that daughters of teenage mothers \nare 22 percent more likely to become teenage mothers themselves, thus \ncreating a self-perpetuating cycle from generation to generation.\n  It is clear that these problems will only continue unless we address \nthe issue of teenage pregnancy. This is an especially critical issue, \nbecause the United States has the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in \nthe western industrialized world. I believe that this legislation will \nhelp to address these concerns. One of the ideas endorsed by Congress \nin the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act \nof 1996 was the concept of second chance homes. Second chance homes are \nan option for many teenage mothers who are required by the 1996 act to \nlive at home or under adult supervision. These homes provide both \nliving arrangements and educational opportunities for young mothers.\n  Second chance homes have been remarkably successful in decreasing \nboth second pregnancies and child abuse and in improving the \neducational and vocational opportunities of teenage mothers. For \nexample, New Mexico's second chances homes have produced many success \nstories with several residents earning a registered nurse degree. It is \ntruly inspiring to think that many\n\n[[Page S10459]]\n\nteenagers who had the odds stacked against them have been given a \nsecond chance and have become vital members of the health care \nprofession.\n  Despite the successes of second chance homes, many teenage mothers do \nnot have access to such a home. Although New Mexico has over a hundred \nsecond chance homes, many States are not so fortunate. Furthermore, \naccording to a 1999 study, eighteen States do not have a policy for \nhelping mothers find such a shelter. This is the genesis behind our \nlegislation. We hope to increase the availability of second chance \nhomes and allow a greater number of teenage mothers to take advantage \nof the many opportunities that they provide. This bill will create a \ncompetitive grant program within the Department of Health and Human \nServices that will award five-year grants to State, local, and tribal \ngovernments and to non-profit organizations to create or expand a \nsecond-chance home. I am hopeful that this significant federal \ninvestment will allow a greater number of teenage mothers to graduate \nfrom high school, and even college or vocational training, and will \nincrease the health and safety of their children.\n  Second chance homes have a remarkable record in alleviating many of \nthe problems associated with teenage pregnancy. From education to \nmaternal and infant health, they have played a crucial role in the \nsuccess of welfare reform. I thank Senators Lieberman and Conrad for \ntheir work on this important legislation, and I look forward to all \nteenage mothers having a true second chance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1523. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the Government pension offset and windfall elimination \nprovisions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto repeal the Government pension offset and windfall elimination \nprovisions of the Social Security Act, provisions of current law that \nreduce earned Social Security benefits for teachers and other \ngovernment pensioners.\n  Under current law, public employees, whose salaries are often lower \nthan those in the private sector to begin with, find that they are \npenalized and held to a different standard when it comes to retirement \nbenefits. The unfair reduction in their benefits makes it more \ndifficult to recruit teachers, police officers, and fire fighters.\n  The legislation that I introduce today addresses two provisions in \nthe current Social Security Act that create this problem: The Windfall \nElimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset provision.\n  The Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision reduces Social \nSecurity benefits for retirees who paid into Social Security and also \nreceive a government pension, such as from a teacher retirement fund. \nPrivate sector retirees receive monthly Social Security checks equal to \n90 percent of their first $561 in average monthly career earnings, plus \n32 percent of monthly earnings up to $3,381 and 15 percent of earnings \nabove $3,381. Government pensioners, however, are only allowed to \nreceive 40 percent of the first $561 in career monthly earnings, a \npenalty of $280.50 per month.\n  To my mind it is simply unfair, especially at a time when we need to \nbe doing all we can to attract qualified people government service, and \nthis bill will allow government pensioners the chance to earn the same \n90 percent to which non-government pension recipients are entitled.\n  The current Government Pension Offset provision reduces Social \nSecurity spousal benefits by an amount equal to two-thirds of the \nspouse's public employment civil service pension. This can have the \neffect of taking away, entirely, a spouse's benefits from Social \nSecurity.\n  It is beyond my understanding why we would want to discourage people \nfrom pursuing careers in public service, such as teaching, by \nessentially saying that if you do become a teacher your family will \nsuffer by not being able to receive the full retirement benefits they \nwould otherwise be entitled to.\n  There is a teaching crisis in California right now, as there is in \nmany States. Yet current Social Security benefit rules penalize private \nsector employees who leave their jobs to become public school teachers, \nor public school teachers who work second jobs during the summer months \nto help make ends meet. They lose legitimately earned Social Security \nbenefits. And in certain cases, their wives and husbands will lose \nspousal benefits, too.\n  That is simply not fair and not right. California faces a teaching \ncrisis, and we need to do everything we can to attract and keep good, \nqualified people as public school teachers, not make an already \ndifficult job more difficult.\n  The same can be said for other public employees, like police and fire \nfighters.\n  This legislation addresses this inequity in the Social Security Act, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Burns, Mr. Gregg, and \n        Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1525. A bill to extend the moratorium on the imposition of taxes \non the Internet for an additional 5 years; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Defense of \nInternet Tax Freedom Act, with my friends and colleagues from \nCalifornia, Montana, New Hampshire, and Virginia, to extend the \nmoratorium on Internet access taxes and multiple and discriminatory \ntaxes for five-years. As you know, the original provisions of the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act are set to expire this October 21, less than \ntwo weeks from now.\n  As many in this chamber know, I have made extending the moratorium on \ntaxes that discriminate against the Internet one of my top priorities \nsince coming to the Senate. I cannot ever envision a time when it will \nbe okay for any government to tax freedom on the Internet by taxing \naccess to the Internet. I cannot ever conceive of any instance or event \nthat will precipitate justification for multiple or discriminatory \ntaxes on the Internet by any government, large or small, national or \nlocal.\n  For this reason, I have maintained constant and steady support for \nthe permanent extension of the Internet moratorium on Internet access, \nmultiple and discriminatory taxes. I never thought I would be willing \nto vote for, much less sponsor, legislation that endorsed a limited \nextension, but the events of September 11, 2001 have forced all of us \nin this Congress, and indeed throughout the country, to think and act \naccording to the most immediate interests of our Nation.\n  Now, more than ever, the people of this country need security, not \nonly with regard to safety, but also with regard to their financial \nfuture. Any additional tax burdens on the Internet now, will mean \nadditional costs that many Americans cannot afford, forcing the poorest \nin our society to reduce or even forgo their use of the Internet as a \ntool for education and exploration.\n  Consider the fact that by taxing Internet access, States and \nlocalities are actually contributing to an already growing economic \n``digital divide.'' For every dollar added to the cost of Internet \naccess, we can expect to see lost utilization of the Internet by \nthousands of poor and impoverished families nationwide.\n  Furthermore, the more expensive you make Internet access, the less \nlikely people are to buy advanced services, including broadband \ndelivered high-speed Internet access, multimedia expansion cards, and \nInternet protocol enabling software. Given the current state of the \ntechnology market as a whole, a decrease in consumption resulting from \nInternet access taxes could destroy what glimmer of hope remains for \nmany telecommunications and technology manufacturers.\n  The effects of these closures have already been felt throughout our \ncountry. Congress should be working to keep businesses open and \nAmericans employed, and that is why we must pass a reasonable extension \nof the moratorium on Internet access, multiple, and discriminatory \ntaxes.\n  If you consider for a moment that the Internet has only been around \nin its contemporary form since 1995 or 1996, then you realize that this \ntechnology and the impact it has made and will continue to make on our \neconomy is both very promising and very unsure. To date we have very \nlittle reliable data as to the real impact the\n\n[[Page S10460]]\n\nInternet is making on the daily lives of Americans.\n  We have little to no information as to how and why consumers on the \nweb decide to spend their hard earned money. We have no real evidence \nthat consumers would decide to spend money or purchase products they \nbuy on the web today if these products were only available in \ntraditional brick-n-mortar settings.\n  The studies we have seen thus far all contradict one another. In one \nstudy dealing with the effects of Internet purchasing on State \nrevenues, I found a quote from the President of the National Conference \nof State Legislatures comparing State budgets in recent years to the \nengine of a luxury car. Yet, I have heard from this and other \norganizations that the Internet is destroying State tax revenue \nstreams.\n  I don't know who or what to believe. All I know is that many in this \nSenate need time to understand this issue. There are many members in \nthis body who do not fully recognize that the moratorium is completely \nunrelated to sales taxes or the collection thereof. Given that fact, I \ncannot see why extending the moratorium for a mere few months or years \nwould be beneficial in terms of educating the general public and the \nMembers of this body.\n  In a matter of months or a few years, the technology sector will only \njust be at the point of full recovery from the current downturn in our \neconomy. We will need several years beyond that point of full recovery \nto complete the comprehensive, neutral studies of the Internet and e-\ncommerce that Members of Congress will need in order to make these \nimportant decisions, decisions that may directly challenge the \nconventional wisdom of our Founding Fathers and our own historical \nexperience.\n  Given these requirements, five years seems to be the minimum amount \nof time Congress, the private sector, and other interested \norganizations will need in order to make well-informed, proactive \ndecisions regarding other issues not related to the Internet \nmoratorium.\n  In the meantime, we can guarantee a level of stability for the \nInternet over the next five years that will allow our Nation to \ncontinue to close the digital divide and encourage new and enhanced \nuses of the web for consumers.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me and my fellow cosponsors in \ncosponsoring the Defense of Internet Tax Freedom Act, in supporting a \nfive year extension of the Internet moratorium on access multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes.\n  Let's give the Internet the future it deserves and show America that \nthe answer is not more taxes but rather better, more efficient \ngovernment for the people and by the people.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Today, I am joining Senators Allen, Burns, and Gregg in \nsupporting an extension of the Internet tax moratorium for another 5 \nyears.\n  I supported the moratorium when it was initially instituted in order \nto encourage the growth of the then newly emerging Internet industry. \nIn the 1990s, the industry enjoyed a growth spurt that helped move the \nwhole economy forward. But recently, Internet companies have fallen on \nhard times.\n  Because Internet commerce and technology firms are not now fairing \nwell, I support a five year extension of the tax moratorium. I believe \nthat renewed investment in the Internet is crucial to the welfare of \nthe entire economy and we need to support its growth as much now as we \ndid in 1998. Through a clean extension of the tax moratorium, Congress \ncan promote an environment for Internet growth that avoids the \nuncertainty, inefficiencies, and barriers to entry that new taxes would \ncreate.\n  The technology sector was in a recession before the September 11, \n2001 attacks. In the first half of 2001, more than 300,000 technology \nsector jobs were eliminated and companies declared bankruptcy because \nof reduced consumer and business spending on technology products. One \nexample, Webvan, an Internet grocery delivery company, closed shop in \nJuly. In the process, 2,000 employees lost their jobs in the company's \nseven markets--San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, \nSeattle, Chicago, and Portland.\n  With the additional decline in consumer confidence resulting from the \nSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the industry has fallen even \ndeeper into recession. The results have been devastating for many \nfirms. For example, since the attacks, Cisco laid off 8,500 workers, \nExcite@home has laid off 500 workers, and MicroStrategy has laid off \n200 workers. By extending the Internet tax moratorium for five years, \nwe send the message to the industry and its workers that we will not \nturn a deaf ear to this crisis.\n  The economy rose during the last eight years on the new jobs, \nefficiencies, and demand for products that the Internet and Internet-\nrelated companies created. Restoring economic growth will depend \nlargely on our ability to spark renewed investment and growth in this \nvital industry. Firms that sell products over the Internet are key \nconsumers of computers, software, and hardware. Their growth would \nencourage additional interest in connecting to the Internet and help \nproduce new consumer demand for more technology products.\n  We should assist, not burden our technology firms at this time. \nAnother five years could give the Internet time to work out its current \ngrowing pains. As technology innovations encourage additional growth \nand renewed interest in the Internet, our economy as a whole will \nbenefit. A stronger Internet will mean more jobs, more companies, and a \nbroader tax base. That is a net gain for everyone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1527. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend and \nimprove the environmental quality incentive program; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to announce the introduction of a \nbill that would amend and extend the Environmental Quality Improvement \nProgram, EQIP, to make it more user friendly, and to make it more \neffective in it's on-the-ground implementation.\n  EQIP is a voluntary, Federal cost share program administered by the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture's, USDA, Natural Resources \nConservation Service, NRCS, and Farm Service Agency, FSA. The program \nwas created to assist farmers and ranchers in implementing conservation \nmanagement programs on private lands, lands that not only serve as the \nbackbone of our Nation's food supplies but which also provide important \nhabitat for America's wildlife, including many endangered species. It \ndoes this by providing technical, financial, and educational assistance \nto farmers and ranchers as they make capital improvements in irrigation \nand other water systems, address a wide variety of conservation \nproblems, provide flood plain protection, support grazing lands \nconservation, and facilitate wildlife habitat protection programs.\n  When everything works right, EQIP provides a tremendous benefit to \nproducers and the environment. One example of this can be found in an \nEQIP-funded project underway in central Wyoming. This project, known \nlocally as the Sand Mesa project, is allowing a group of Wyoming \nfarmers to increase irrigation efficiency while also reducing pumping \ncosts. They are doing this by replacing an aging canal system with a \ngravity-flow pipeline.\n  Under the old system, the open air canals lost a lot of water to \nseepage and evaporation. The water savings from the new pipeline has \nturned out to be critically important in years, like this one, where \ndrought is so prevalent in the West. The 14 miles of pipeline replaced \n11 miles of open canal and committed 5,000 acre feet of water for \nexisting wetlands. In the first year alone the new system saved at \nleast 22,000 acre feet of water. This translates into that much more \nwater being available in Bull Lake and Wind River for other uses. The \ngravity-flow pressure is also adequate to eventually run all 36 \nirrigation pivots on the new system, which will result in an even \ngreater water savings.\n  Why did this project work out so well? It wasn't because Washington, \nDC bureaucrats stepped in and told the community the best things to do \nwith their money.\n  Sand Mesa is a combined effort that unites the knowledge of local \nfarmers with local technical experts who together are able to turn \nWyoming's desert into fertile farmland. Together, the farmers and the \ntechnicians are designing a conservation and financial\n\n[[Page S10461]]\n\nplan that will allow them to make the most out of their limited \nenvironmental and financial resources.\n  The inclusion of local expertise in establishing program priorities \nis one of EQIP's strongest assets. Local working groups are made up of \nindividuals who represent a wide range of interests. The groups are \nmade up of farmers, ranchers, representatives from conservation \ndistricts, agricultural organizations, environmental groups, Native \nAmericans, and other local, state and federal agencies.\n  Along with the State Advisory Committees, local work groups have made \na conscientious effort to make sure limited EQIP dollars are put to \ntheir best use. They have not always been successful. The only existing \nauthority these groups have is in identifying priority areas that may, \nif Washington, DC bureaucrats decide, receive funding. The result of \nthis allocation structure is that funds are not always equitably \ndistributed.\n  In 1999 a group of my constituents in Powell, WY approached me with \nserious concerns about the way EQIP regulations took authority away \nfrom local experts. EQIP was created as a part of the 1996 Farm Bill. \nIn establishing EQIP, the Farm Bill terminated four previously existing \ncost share, conservation programs and replaced them with the new \nprogram. The terminated programs had relied heavily on local input to \nmanage all aspects of implementation. Because of this history producers \nhad come to expect local expertise to play a bigger role in the new \nprogram. EQIP regulations, however, consolidated the decision making \nprocess at the Federal level and left out local input.\n  My consitutents were concerned that an unusually large percentage of \nnew EQIP dollars were being directed to applicants who did not \nnecessarily require federal assistance to complete conservation \nimprovements, while smaller, family-owned producers, who could \nsincerely benefit from the program, were being overlooked. Their fears \nwere that funding decisions were determined more by politics and grant \nwriting ability than by the greatest need or ability to maximize \nenvironmental benefit per dollar expended.\n\n  In response to their concerns, I wrote a letter to former Secretary \nof Agriculture Dan Glickman and asked for his help in correcting these \ninequities. He forwarded my request to the Wyoming NRCS offices where \nNRCS Wyoming State Director Ed Burton organized a team that reviewed \nthe EQIP allocation process. This team identified a number of \nlegislative and administrative actions which, if they are followed, \nwould ensure the program's most effective implementation.\n  This bill is the result of their efforts. The bill addresses four \nareas that the Wyoming review team noted would require specific \nlegislative fixes. First, the bill increases allocation flexibility by \ndefining the phrase ``maximize environmental benefits per dollar \nexpended'' in a way that gives the Secretary of Agriculture the ability \nto consult with local working groups in deciding what are the best ways \nto guarantee that limited EQIP funds can be directed to those ranchers \nand farmers who can provide the most effective use of the program's \ncost share program. The bill would simplify and streamline the current \nprocess to make the program less time consuming to field office staff, \nand less frustrating to producers.\n  The bill also would allow farmers and ranchers the flexibility to use \nEQIP funds when they are needed most. Too often weather conditions or \nother unrelated reasons make it impossible for eligible applicants to \nconform to Federal fiscal calendars. By allowing funds to be available \nuntil expended, this bill would keep program dollars available on a \nreal-world schedule and would allow producers to receive cost share \ndollars at current costs and not at the rate in effect when the \ncontract was written.\n  The third change this bill would make is to adjust the program to \nallow contracts from three to ten years. Current EQIP requirements \nallow five to ten year contracts only. EQIP payments are limited \ngenerally to $10,000 per person annually, and $50,000 over the 5 to 10 \nyear life of the contract. This is often much more than is required by \nfarmers and could place an undue hardship on producers who do not have \nthe ability or the desire to enter into long-term contracts. Three to \nten year contracts, based on the producer's conservation plan, would \nallow greater flexibility to implement resource management systems.\n  Finally, the bill would allow producers who are ready to begin work \nin the first year of the contract to immediately receive contract \npayments. Many producers who apply for EQIP are ready to install \npractices as soon as the contract is approved. Under current law, if \npractices are installed in the same year the contract is written, the \nproducer must wait until the next fiscal year for their first payment. \nThis delay can cause undue financial hardship, especially in an \nindustry where cash flow is severely limited.\n  I am proud of the efforts of the people in my State to make this \nprogram better and more efficient. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis bill and to support our farmers in their work to feed the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 1528. a bill to improve the safety and security of rail \ntransportation; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rail Safety and \nSecurity Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator \nGordon Smith, the ranking Republican of the Commerce Committee's \nSurface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee.\n  This legislation would authorize funding to improve rail passenger \nsafety and security, while assuring accountability and oversight of all \nassociated expenditures. It would also amend current law and allow for \nrail police officers to enforce laws on the properties of other \nrailroads and would establish criminal sanctions for attacks against \nour Nation's rail system. And, it would also require a comprehensive \nassessment of the security risks surrounding rail transportation in \norder for the Congress to then take appropriate action based on the \nconclusions of the assessment. I believe this legislation is a much \nneeded step in protecting our rail transportation system against \nsecurity threats and vulnerabilities.\n  During the past four weeks, we have been working in a bipartisan \nmanner to address the nation's most pressing needs in the wake of the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. We have worked with the administration \nto provide necessary emergency funding to aid in the aftermath of the \nattacks in New York and at the Pentagon.\n  Part of that effort has focused on the survival of the aviation \nindustry, and rightly so. Our Nation, our citizens, and our economy \ncannot afford further deterioration of this critical segment of the \ntransportation industry. It is equally important that we approve \naviation security legislation and send it to the President.\n  Transportation systems are the target of 40 percent of terrorist \nattacks worldwide. That is why it is necessary for the government to \nplay a key role in assessing potential security threats in our Nation's \ntransportation system. We must ensure that we have taken every \nprecaution to safeguard critical infrastructure and that procedures are \nin place to protect people and property in the event of actual \nterrorist attacks. In that effort, the Senate Commerce Committee has \nbeen conducting a series of hearings to gain the information we need to \nhelp us evaluate potential security risks and determine how best to \nrespond to those potential risks.\n  In addition to aviation security legislation, the Commerce Committee \nhas approved legislation to address security at our Nation's ports. I \nam hopeful the full Senate will have the opportunity to consider that \nbill in the near future.\n  Given the hundreds of thousands of miles of rail track, highways, and \npipelines, hundreds of ports and terminals throughout the U.S., and the \nease of access to public transportation, it is impossible to fully \nsecure our transportation system against all deliberate acts of \ndestruction. Efforts to reduce vulnerability, however, are essential \nand each industry has a responsibility to assess and respond to \nidentified problems. Federal, State, and local governments also play an \nimportant role in this effort.\n\n[[Page S10462]]\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today is designed to address the \nsafety and security of our Nation's rail transportation network, both \npassenger and freight. Unlike other passenger rail funding proposals \nthat have been suggested, this legislation would only fund legitimate \nsafety and security initiatives. It would also assure the highest \ndegree of accountability of all expenditures. I note my proposal would \nnot provide a handout directly to Amtrak to fund long-planned capacity \nprojects that it has been unable to accomplish. Therefore, some will \nlikely object to my approach from the outset. But, I hope members \ninterested in addressing legitimate rail safety and security concerns \nwill join me in supporting this alternative approach.\n  Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on Rail and \nMaritime security. We learned from that hearing that certain actions \nthat can be taken immediately to address security vulnerabilities. \nTherefore, this legislation is designed to address the needs we \ncurrently know exist and, at the same time, provide for an assessment \nof rail security that would enable us to act on matters identified \nthrough a more comprehensive review than has yet occurred.\n  First, the bill would authorize funding for security upgrades for \nrail transportation provided by Amtrak. However, the funding would be \nmade available to Amtrak only after the Secretary establishes \nappropriate funding procedure safeguards and after approving a system \nwide security plan submitted by Amtrak.\n  Second, the bill would authorize funding for the Tunnel Life Safety \nprojects in New York, Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. The DOT \nInspector General has confirmed the need to bring existing systems up \nto par with modern safety standards, including the replacement of \nnarrow, winding spiral staircases, the installation of modern \nventilation fans, and the rehabilitation of benchwalls. The IG further \nhas expressed concerns that an extended schedule of repairs as would \noccur without federal assistance places the public at prolonged and \nunnecessary risk.\n  Based on the findings of the DOT-IG, this legislation includes \nprovisions to fully fund these projects in order to reduce the risk to \npublic safety. It would fund these projects, however, only after the \nSecretary approves engineering and financial plans submitted by Amtrak \nand conditions the release of funding by entering into proper funding \nprocedures. In other words, the funding will not just be handed to \nAmtrak with no questions asked. It ensures proper federal oversight of \nthe federal assistance.\n  Furthermore, the legislation would direct the DOT Inspector General \nto review the obligation and expenditure of funds provided under this \nlegislation to ensure that the funds are used solely for the purposes \nintended by Congress.\n  Third, the bill would permit rail police officers to enforce laws on \nthe properties of other railroads. Current law only permits officers to \nenforce laws on the properties of the rail carrier that employs the \npolice officer. This provision would allow for flexibility and the \nsharing of enforcement resources among all rail carriers as may be \nnecessary to address safety and security threats directed at a \nparticular carrier.\n  Fourth, this legislation includes provisions to address potential \nsecurity threats to our nation's rail transportation system. While the \nvulnerabilities of air travel may be most prevalent in our memory, our \nrail system has been and continues to be vulnerable to security \nthreats. Five years ago, Arizonans and citizens throughout the country \nwere saddened to learn of an Amtrak derailment near Hyder, AZ, which \nclaimed the life of one individual and injured seventy-eight others. \nShortly after the accident, the sadness turned to shock as we learned \nthat the derailment may have been caused by someone who intentionally \nsabotaged the track. The Arizona accident is not unique. There have \nbeen other examples of acts against railroads.\n  Following that occurrence, the Senate passed legislation requested by \nthe previous Administration addressing some of these vulnerabilities. \nUnfortunately, we failed to reach an agreement with the House during \nconference deliberations on the multi-year highway funding legislation. \nTherefore, I am including those provisions as part of this bill today. \nNow, more than ever, these provisions are essential.\n  The legislation would establish criminal sanctions for violent \nattacks against railroads, railroad employees and railroad passengers \nsimilar to sanctions currently afforded for attacks against airlines, \nvessels on the high seas, motor carriers, and pipelines. I strongly \nbelieve the rail industry and its employees and customers deserve the \nsame protections afforded the other methods.\n  Finally, the legislation would direct the Secretary to assess the \nsecurity risks associated with rail transportation and to develop \nrecommendations for target hardening those areas identified as posing \nsignificant risk to public safety. As I previously mentioned, there has \nnot yet been a comprehensive analysis of the security risks of the rail \nindustry. This provision would direct that such an assessment be \ncarried out and at the conclusion of the assessment, it would provide \nus with the information Congress needs in order to make future \ndecisions on how to further address rail security matters.\n  I believe this legislation is a credible proposal that could do a \ngreat deal to improve the safety and security of our rail network. I \nstand ready to work with my colleagues, the Administration, industry, \nand public safety advocates in an effort to address the safety and \nsecurity of our nation's rail system.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1529. A bill to direct the Assistant to the President for Homeland \nSecurity to establish the National Energy Infrastructure Security \nProgram; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we consider the issue of national \nsecurity in the weeks after the terrorist attacks of September 11, one \nsector in particular that deserves our undivided attention is the \nsecurity of our national energy infrastructure. The vulnerability of \nour country's energy infrastructure became more clear last week when an \nindividual was able to cause about 150,000 gallons of oil to spill from \nthe 800 mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline with a bullet from a high powered \nrifle.\n  I believe the events of September 11 have proven that Congress has a \nresponsibility to make sure our Nation's energy infrastructure is \nadequately protected from both hostile and natural attacks.\n  We are now engaged in an operation to combat terrorism which will \ntake considerable time and resources. Some of the emergency measures \nput in place at energy facilities throughout the country in response to \nthe September 11 attacks can only be maintained for so long. For \nexample, off the coast of my State of Louisiana the Nation's largest \nport for offloading crude oil was being patrolled by a military vessel. \nWhile a kind of safety zone around such areas makes sense, should we \nexpend our military's resources in order to do so? Merely using our \npresent available resources to operate at such high levels of alert for \nthe duration of what all indications are will be a long term effort \ndoes not seem realistic. There is a need for a substantial commitment \nto the protection of our country's energy infrastructure both in scope \nand duration.\n  Although 90 percent of the infrastructure in this country is \nprivately owned and operated and industry does have an obligation to \nprovide security, there is sufficient evidence to suggest the Federal \nGovernment should make a more significant contribution. First, our \ncountry is now experiencing an economic downturn. It is imperative for \nour government to continue to focus its attention on measures to \nincrease and shore up production while keeping our domestic supply of \nenergy steady.\n  Second, energy infrastructure is by nature not contained within the \nborders of one State or region. For example, three of the country's top \nten gasoline consuming States are in the Midwest. The Midwest imports \n25 percent of its total demand from the Gulf Coast. While the Gulf \nCoast refining centers handle half of the total barrels processed in \nthe U.S. today, there are only two pipeline systems in place to move \nthe product from the South to\n\n[[Page S10463]]\n\nthe Midwest. This is a tremendous amount of pressure on Gulf Coast \nrefineries to meet demand in the Midwest. What happens if one or both \nof these systems are disrupted? In addition, the only offshore oil \nterminal in the United States, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, LOOP, \nis estimated to take in 13 percent of the United States' imported oil \nand refining capacity and is connected by five pipelines to over 30 \npercent of the United States refining capacity. Imagine the impact its \ndisruption from natural or hostile threats would have on the Nation's \nrefining capacity.\n  So, whether we are talking about pipelines, transmission lines, \nelectric generators, refineries, nuclear power plants, ports, rigs or \nplatforms, the Federal Government has a clear and compelling interest \nin providing the necessary resources to ensure that our energy \ninfrastructure is sufficiently protected. Since the disruption of a \nparticular facility or transmission line has economic consequences and \ncould pose a significant threat to the safety of the surrounding \npopulation, as well as the effect on our economy, environment, state \nand local authorities must also play a role. This would require a \npartnership among the federal, state and local governments and \nindustry.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation, the National Energy \nInfrastructure Security Program Establishment Act, which would: \nEstablish a multi-year national energy infrastructure program overseen \nby the newly appointed Assistant to the President for Homeland \nSecurity, to provide funding annually to all 50 States in order to make \nsure that all appropriate measures from the monitoring and detection of \npotential threats to mitigation, response and recovery are in place \nagainst hostile and natural threats; create two funds, one for the \nprotection of energy infrastructure located in the coastal zones of oil \nand gas producing States, the other for the energy infrastructure of \nall fifty States excluding those areas in the oil and gas producing \nStates that would be provided for in the first fund; provide funding \nbased on a formula related to the amount of energy infrastructure a \nState has as well as to the contribution of the State's infrastructure \nto the rest of the country; the Governor of each State would consult \nwith Federal, State and local law enforcement, public safety, \nofficials, industry and other relevant persons or agencies to put \ntogether a security plan to submit to the Assistant to the President \nfor Homeland Security as well as the Secretaries of Commerce, Energy \nand Interior detailing what measures were necessary provide adequate \nprotection of that particular State's infrastructure; and in order to \npay for this program we would use a percentage of offshore revenues \nfrom oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  If we are truly serious about protecting our country's energy \ninfrastructure from present and future threats, it is necessary for us \nto provide a commitment of significant Federal resources as soon as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10463-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 78--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n     REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Bond, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nBunning, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Burns, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Kohl, \nMr. Cochran, Mr. Conrad, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. \nCarnahan, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Biden, Mr. Fitzgerald, \nMr. Edwards, Mr. Frist, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hagel, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Helms, \nMr. Rockefeller, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Johnson, \nMr. Shelby, Mr. Levin, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Voinovich) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the Nation requires that the \n     young people of the United States become an involved, caring \n     citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play their \n     role in determining the future of the Nation;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society; therefore, every adult has \n     the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities;\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations would focus on character education, would \n     be of great benefit to the Nation; and\n       Whereas the week beginning October 15, 2001, and the week \n     beginning October 14, 2002, are appropriate weeks to \n     establish as National Character Counts Week: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a National Character Counts Week should be established \n     to promote character education; and\n       (2) the President should issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to--\n       (A) embrace the elements of character identified by their \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and \n     honesty; and\n       (B) observe such a week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10463-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1854.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The safety and security of the civil air transportation \n     system is critical to the United States' security and its \n     national defense.\n       (2) A safe and secure United States civil air \n     transportation system is essential to the basic freedom of \n     Americans to move in instrastate, interstate, and \n     international transportation.\n       (3) The terrorist hijackings and crashes of passenger \n     aircraft into guided bombs for strikes against civilian and \n     military targets requires the United States to change \n     fundamentally the way it approaches the task of ensuring the \n     safety and security of the civil air transportation system.\n       (4) The existing fragmentation of responsibility for that \n     safety and security among government agencies and between \n     government and nongovernment entities is inefficient and \n     unacceptable in light of the hijackings and crashes on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (5) The General Accounting Office has recommended that \n     security functions and security personnel at United States \n     airports should become Federal government responsibility.\n       (6) Although the number of Federal air marshals is \n     classified, their presence on both international and domestic \n     flights would have a deterrent effect on hijacking and would \n     further bolster public confidence in the safety of air \n     travel.\n       (7) The effectiveness of existing security measures, \n     including employee background checks and passenger pre-\n     screening, is impaired because of the inaccessibility of, or \n     the failure to share information among, data bases maintained \n     by different Federal and international agencies for criminal \n     behavior or pertinent intelligence information.\n\n     SEC. 3. TRANSPORTATION SECURITY FUNCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 102 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (d), (e), and (f) as \n     subsections (e), (f), and (g); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:\n       ``(d) Deputy Secretary for Transportation Security.\n       ``(1) In general.--The Department has a Deputy Secretary \n     for Transportation Security, who shall be appointed by the \n     President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. \n     The Deputy Secretary for Transportation Security shall carry \n     out duties and powers prescribed by the Secretary relating to \n     security for all modes of transportation.\n       ``(2) Aviation-related duties.--The Deputy Secretary--\n       ``(A) is responsible for day-to-day Federal security \n     operations for the air transportation or intrastate air \n     transportation;\n       ``(B) shall coordinate and direct as appropriate functions \n     and responsibilities of the Secretary of Transportation and \n     the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration \n     under chapter 449;\n       ``(C) shall work in conjunction with the Administrator of \n     the Federal Aviation Administration with respect to any \n     actions or activities that may affect aviation safety or air \n     carrier operations.\n       ``(D) is responsible for hiring and training personnel to \n     provide security screening at all United States airports \n     involved in air transportation or intrastate air \n     transportation, in consultation with the Attorney General, \n     the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other appropriate \n     Federal agencies and departments; and\n       ``(E) shall actively cooperate and coordinate with the \n     Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of \n     other appropriate Federal agencies and departments with \n     responsibilities for national security and criminal justice \n     enforcement activities that are related to aviation security \n     through the Aviation Secretary Coordination Council.''.\n       (b) Review and Development of Ways To Strengthen \n     Security.--Section 44932(c) of title 49, United States Code, \n     is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``x-ray'' in paragraph (4);\n       (2) By striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (4);\n       (3) by striking ``passengers.'' in paragraph (5) and \n     inserting ``passengers;''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) to strengthen and enhance the ability to detect \n     nonexplosive weapons, such as biological, chemical, or \n     similar substances; and\n       ``(7) to evaluate such additional measures as may be \n     appropriate to enhance physical inspection of passengers, \n     luggage, and cargo.''.\n       (c) Transition.--Until the Deputy Secretary for \n     Transportation Security takes office, the functions of the \n     Deputy Secretary that relate to aviation security shall be \n     carried out by the Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation \n     Security of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to lend \nmy support to Senator Carnahan's measure, which would finally give some \nrelief to the many airline workers in this country who have lost their \njobs in recent weeks.\n  I voted against the prior package to bail out the airlines of this \ncountry. Many of the Members in the Congress were under the impression \nthat that $15 billion package was designed to compensate the airlines \nfor their losses during the 3- or 4-day Government shutdown. But most \nMembers don't recognize that during that 3- or even 4-day shutdown the \nairlines' lost revenues--not necessarily bottom line losses, but \nmissing revenues--were $340 million a day. If you multiply $340 million \na day by 4 days, as opposed to 3 days, being very generous to the \nairlines, you come up with losses of $1.36 billion. But Congress didn't \ngive the airlines $1.36 billion; we gave them $5 billion in immediate \nupfront cash, plus $10 billion worth of loan guarantees. So the \nNation's airlines got many times their losses from the 3-day shutdown \nfrom Congress.\n  I thought that bailout package was excessive. I also thought that \nCongress perpetrated an injustice in shoveling out such large amounts \nof taxpayer money toward the airlines. We completely ignored the over 1 \nmillion employees in the airline industry.\n  It is a misnomer to call the airline bailout package an industry \nbailout package. It wasn't an industry bailout package; it was a \nshareholder bailout package. There was no bailout for the skycaps, or \nfor the flight attendants, or the mechanics, or the baggage handlers, \nand the pilots didn't get bailed out. Instead, it was a bailout for the \nsophisticated investors who held airline stocks in their portfolios and \nthe many large institutions holding airline stocks in their portfolios.\n  I emphasize that it is a misnomer to call the airline bailout an \nindustry bailout. It was simply a bailout for shareholders or \ninvestors. There was no relief for the over 1 million employees of the \nairline industry. It is fitting and proper to now provide relief for \nthe airline industry employees.\n  We should have done this in the original airline industry bailout. \nOut of that $15 billion which we gave to the airlines, we could have \nhad some requirements that they give minimal severance or health care \nbenefits to their employees, at least some requirements, some strings \nattached to assure the laid-off flight attendants, baggage handlers, \npilots, and skycaps would be treated decently. But we did not do that \nin that bailout package.\n  We have to correct the injustice in that first bailout package, and \nwe have to help the industry's employees. The relief Senator Carnahan \nhas put together in her package--and I am happy to say I am a \ncosponsor--is appropriate. It should have been in the original bill.\n  As I said, we paid the airlines many times their losses for the \nperiod they were shut down. That created a terrible precedent, in my \njudgment, one that is haunting Congress every day this fall\n\n[[Page S10476]]\n\nbecause we now are beset with industries from all over the country \ncoming to Capitol Hill knocking on our door and saying: You gave all \nthat money to the airlines. You bailed them out. You covered all their \nlosses through December 31, 2001. You paid them not just for the days \nthe Government shut them down by Government edict; you covered all \ntheir losses through the end of the year.\n  Other industries are now saying to leaders in Washington: Why are we \ndifferent? Why shouldn't we get a bailout? We have hotels that are \nempty. We have car rental firms that are hovering near insolvency \nbecause they do not have any customers. We have many of the suppliers \nfor airlines--I was approached by a company in Illinois that supplies \nfood for the airlines, and they believed they were entitled to a \nbailout.\n  We have industries of all sorts that have come asking us for help, \nand because of the precedent we set in the airline industry bill, we do \nnot know how to tell these other industries that they are not entitled \nto help.\n  We should have carved aside a generous portion in that initial bill \nfor workers in the airline industry. Senator Carnahan's amendment will \nget this done. I support it, and I urge colleagues to vote in favor of \nit. It would be a miscarriage of justice; it would compound the \ninjustice we have already perpetrated if we were to let stand a bailout \nfor sophisticated investors while we left all the airline industry \nemployees twisting in the wind. We cannot allow that to stand. We have \nto correct that injustice.\n  Many of these employees who have been furloughed maybe never had a \nnickel to invest in the market in the first place. They are worried \nabout how they are going to pay their mortgage, or how they are going \nto pay their rent, or how they are going to feed their families while \nthey are laid off. Meanwhile, many investors who should have \nappreciated the risk of investing in the airline industry were bailed \nout, but the skycap got the boot. We have to correct that.\n  I am pleased to stand with the Senator from Missouri in support of \nthis legislation. I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of it.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence at this late hour and \nappreciate your attention. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/10/senate-section/article/S10476-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
