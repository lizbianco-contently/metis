In the Bible You tell us wisdom is more precious than rubies, \nmore important than riches and honors. Solomon called wisdom a tree of \nlife to those who lay hold of it. Your gift of wisdom enables true \nsuccess, righteousness, justice, and equity. The Talmud reminds us that \nwith wisdom, we can turn our lives back to You in authentic repentance \nand commit ourselves to do the good deeds that You guide.\n  James, the brother of Jesus, extends Your clear invitation to receive \nwisdom: ``If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to \nall liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.''--\nJames 1:5. Bless the women and men of this Senate with a special \nmeasure of wisdom today.\n  We are grateful for the immense contribution to the Senate of the \nleadership of Sergeant at Arms Jim Ziglar. Thank You for his \nfriendship, his outstanding executive skills, and his commitment to \nexcellence in all he does. Bless him as he moves on to new \nopportunities and challenges in his ongoing dedication to serve You in \ngovernment. You are our Lord and Saviour. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8403-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Debbie Stabenow led the Pledge of Allegiance, as \nfollows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8403-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the agreement arrived at by \nthe distinguished majority leader and the Republican leader for the \nbeginning of this debate on the supplemental farm emergency amendment.\n  I cannot emphasize, as the Chair knows as a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, the importance of this moment for agricultural \nAmerica, for those who have hopes that we will be successful in this \nendeavor. I simply pay tribute to our leadership on both sides of the \naisle for attempting to frame the debate in this way: by beginning with \ngiving me this opportunity to offer an amendment.\n  Let me be clear that the bill before the Senate now came by majority \nvote from the Senate Agriculture Committee. For Members who have \nfollowed the debate yesterday--and for those who have not--we had a \nfull debate in the committee during which I offered a substitute \namendment to that offered by our distinguished chairman, the Senator \nfrom Iowa. Essentially, my amendment called for the expenditure of $5.5 \nbillion. It was apportioned through a number of items, about $5 \nbillion-plus of that through the so-called AMTA payments, these \npayments that have been made to farmers who, as part of the farm \nprogram, have had program crops in the last several years.\n  It has been the responsibility of the Senate and the House--our \nGovernment--to make additional AMTA payments in recent years in \naddition to those provided by the farm bill in 1996. The reason we have \nchosen the AMTA framework is that the farmers to be paid are known, \ntheir names and the addresses of these farms. They have been a part of \nthe program. As a result, their crop histories are expeditious.\n  Members of the committee from time to time have raised questions as \nto: Why these farmers? Why should people who are in corn, wheat, \ncotton, and rice be the recipients? There is no equitable answer to \nthat. Most of these debates have occurred in an emergency context such \nas the one we now have.\n  This is July 31. By definition of the fiscal year, the payments have \nto be cut and received by September 30. So as a result, for programs \nthat do not have an AMTA history and which are not clear about the \ncriteria or the recipients, those checks cannot physically get there by \nthe 30th.\n  We found last year, in making a larger list of recipients, that a \nlarge list of new program procedures had to be formulated by the \nDepartment of Agriculture. That happened, and in due course the checks \nwere cut, but frequently it was a hiatus of 6, 7, 8, 9 months. That is \na part of the issue today. We are talking about the fiscal year we are \nin that ends September 30 and how money might be received by farmers.\n  Farmers listening to the debate are very interested in this. The \ntestimony we have heard is that they are counting in many cases upon \nthese payments. More to the point, many of our country bankers are \ncounting on these payments, counting on meeting with farmers to settle \nplanting loans from this season's planting and the hope; therefore, \nthat there might be loans for planting next year in the case of farms \nthat are in that situation, literally, needing loans from year to year \nto continue on in business. That is why there is an emergency aspect \ninvolved.\n  I have sought recognition this morning at the early part of the \ndebate because I sense that we may be successful, and I have some \npremonition of disaster if we are not, as I read in the press, in the \nnewsletters, in all of the communications that come to us about all the \nways in which this particular debate might go. I will not try to be a \nprophet. My own optimistic spirit is that the debate will go in a \nconstructive way, and that is the purpose of this amendment.\n  I will not offer the amendment this morning, though I offered it in \ncommittee. It did have a limit of $5.5 billion. I thought it was \nreasonably well constructed as a compromise of various interests within \nthe committee.\n  Instead, the amendment I have sent to the desk--and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration--is the identical language of legislation that \ncame from the House of Representatives. It is a bill already adopted by \nour friends in the House Agriculture Committee and the House of \nRepresentatives as a whole. It is passed. At some point, probably very \nquickly, we will have to come to grips--this week, for example--with \nwhat we will do if we pass legislation different from that which the \nHouse has passed.\n  The conventional wisdom is, of course, we would have a conference \nbetween Members of the House and Senate. We would try to reconcile our \ndifferences. We would report back to the two bodies at some time during \nthis week. Presumably because of the emergency, priority would be given \nto this conference report. Hopefully, both Houses would pass what we do \nand send it to the President.\n  The President has left no doubt what he will do if in fact this comes \nto him in some form with a pricetag higher than $5.5 billion, all to be \nspent in this fiscal year. We had, first of all, at the time of our \ncommittee debates, a letter from Mitch Daniels, Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget. Mr. Daniels said he would not recommend that \nthe President sign a bill of more than $5.5 billion in this fiscal \nyear.\n  That was fairly mild in comparison to the letter read on the floor by \nthe distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania yesterday, which was \nreceived by many Members and which, after a lot of conversation, \nincluding the President of the United States, rather vividly in much of \nit--the letter came to us and said the senior advisers of the President \nwould advise him to veto the bill if it has more than $5.5 billion and \nextends beyond this year. They gave reasons for that, and these are \ndebatable, and I am sure we will hear debate about them.\n  Madam President, there is no doubt in my mind, nor should there be in \nthe minds of other Senators or of the farmers in this country or of \nanybody listening to this debate, what is going to occur in the event \nwe finally come to a conference and we have a result other than \nsomething less or $5.5 billion.\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\n  That being the case, I have suggested to the Senate, and in fact \ntaken the action of offering it as an amendment, that if we are serious \nabout coming to a conclusion on this farm bill, we had best at this \npoint adopt the House language. This is not my language. It is not \npride of authorship. It is not my way or no way. I have already had a \ntry at it and lost 12-9 in the Ag Committee on what I thought was a \npretty good suggestion. That is another day.\n  We are now in Tuesday of presumably our final week. The distinguished \nmajority leader has said we are going to stay at this, not just this \nweek and this weekend but until we pass a bill. I have no doubt we will \npass a bill. The point I am making is, it had better be one the \nPresident will sign or at the end of the trail we will not have \nlegislation. We will have an issue. Members may say: The President was \nwrong; he should not have done that. The President and his supporters \nwill affirm that he was absolutely right.\n  The net effect, however, for farmers listening to all of that, as we \nsort out the relative praise and blame, will be that they have no \nmoney. That I start the debate with and will probably repeat several \ntimes because it is a very critical element.\n  If the House bill which I have offered today as an amendment did not \nhave a lot of merit, I would not have taken the step this morning to \nsuggest to my colleagues they adopt something that was without the \nmerit at least that I believe it has.\n  I want to offer, as introduction to the discussion of this House bill \nand my amendment, a letter that was received yesterday by Trent Lott, \nour Republican leader. It was written by three distinguished Members of \nthe House of Representatives; namely, Charlie Stenholm, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee from Texas; \nJohn Boehner from Ohio; and Cal Dooley from California. They \nessentially were authors and major advocates in the House of the \nlegislation that finally emerged. They say:\n\n       It is our understanding the Senate will begin floor \n     consideration this week on the Fiscal Year 2001 Agricultural \n     Supplemental Assistance bill. We are writing to urge the \n     Senate to stay within $5.5 billion provided for FY2001 in the \n     budget and to approve this measure immediately in order to \n     provide the assistance prior to September 30, 2001 as \n     required by the 2002 Budget Agreement.\n       As you know, the House reported a bill that will spend $5.5 \n     billion to assist our farmers and ranchers this fiscal year. \n     After much debate in the House Agriculture Committee, we \n     determined that spending more than $5.5 billion would limit \n     our flexibility as we write the 2002 Farm Bill. We believe \n     that if we spend more than the money allowed for fiscal year \n     2001, we will be borrowing against American agriculture's \n     best chance for a comprehensive safety net.\n       Last week the House Agriculture Committee approved a \n     landmark farm bill that will provide a safety net for our \n     farmers, fund conservation at an unprecedented levels and \n     renew our commitment to needy families. Passage of \n     agricultural assistance legislation beyond $5.5 billion will \n     imperil these critical needs.\n       We urge you to remain within the $5.5 billion so that we \n     can provide long-term solutions for America's farmers and \n     ranchers. Thank you in advance for your consideration of this \n     request.\n\n  It is signed by the three distinguished Members.\n  We likewise, Madam President, heard from a good number of our \ncolleagues on the floor yesterday that they appreciate the point of the \nHouse. They disagree with it--and Members will disagree with a number \nof our approaches--in part because all are compromises between \ninterests that have a lot of merit.\n  For example, in the amendment I offered in committee, the AMTA \npayment was somewhat over $5 billion. In the amendment we are looking \nat today, the House legislation, the AMTA payment is somewhat better \nthan $4.6 billion--about $400 million less. Legislation offered by the \ndistinguished chairman of our committee, Senator Harkin, offers about \n$400 million more in the end.\n  If we take an example, for the corn farmer--and I admitted yesterday \nI am one--this is bad news. Moving from, say, $5.4 billion, or some \nsuch figure in the AMTA payment, even to $5 billion is difficult, and \n$4.6 billion is very difficult; likewise, wheat farmers, cotton \nfarmers, rice farmers. What goes on here? In the old days, the only \ncrops we were talking about were the program crops as I outlined \nyesterday that started in the 1930s. That is the way it has been all \nthese years.\n  Now suddenly, in a $5.5 billion bill only $4.6-plus billion is \ndevoted to us. After all, we farm the majority of the acreage and, in \nterms of crops, the majority of the value.\n  Livestock producers would say: Welcome. We were never in on the deal \nto begin with. Program crops meant crops. They did not mean hogs and \ncattle and sheep. In fact, we will take a look at this situation. We \nare already in some anxiety as, say, cattlemen and people who produce \npork, as we heard in our committee last week.\n  What do these programs do to feed costs? Is there an input problem \nfor us already in what agriculture committees have been doing \ncumulatively? We thought there might be, and that would be bad news if \none were getting no AMTA payment or consideration. In fact, we are \nseeing potential costs increase in the programs to help various people.\n  My only point is within American agriculture there are many diverse, \neven competing, views among those who produce livestock, feed \nlivestock, and those who produce the feed. If there was one integrated \noperation, perhaps it all works out, but as we have heard, many farmers \nin America do one or another or various things. So they are all going \nto look at this bill and say: What is in this for us?\n  The amendment I have offered will be a disappointment in that respect \nbecause it is a compromise. It suggests that in order to accommodate a \nnumber of interests, and some say even in the House bill not nearly \nenough, there is some division of what might be coming in a more whole \nform in the AMTA payment.\n  I make that point explicitly because on our side of the aisle I have \nheard Senators say they want the bigger AMTA payment. I am not so \nworried about specialty crops or about poultry or livestock. As a \nmatter of fact, I am worried about cotton farmers, rice farmers, wheat \nfarmers, and corn farmers. I understand that. As a matter of fact, this \nis a part of the business of legislation, trying to find and meld these \ncompeting interests.\n  In any event, we have that predicament at the outset, which I admit. \nAs I said at the beginning, I offered the amendment because I see this \npotentially as a way in which we will have a bill. I fear if we do not \nhave a solution along those lines we will not have a bill.\n  Let me go explicitly into the amendment that has been offered this \nmorning. As was suggested by our distinguished Members of the House, \nwhose letter I read, led by Congressmen Stenholm, Boehner, and Dooley, \non June 26, the House passed H.R. 2213, which provided for $5.5 billion \nin broad-based market loss assistance to the Nation's farmers and \nranchers. The assistance must be provided to farmers by September 30 of \nthis year, the last day of fiscal year 2001.\n\n  This market loss assistance is above and beyond $21.7 billion in \npayments in fiscal year 2001 that the Congressional Budget Office now \nestimates is already being provided to farmers in this fiscal year \nunder current law commodities support and crop insurance programs. \nExcluding the new farm assistance we are now considering, the \nAgriculture Department projects United States net cash farm income for \n2001 at $52.3 billion, down $3 billion from last year's $55.3 billion.\n  As I mentioned in the debate yesterday, herein lies the reason at \nleast the Budget Committees of the Senate and the House allocated the \n$5.5 billion for this year. They saw a gap. As I recall, they estimated \nthe gap then, in January and February, at $3 billion or $4 billion. \nWith updated figures, we now see an estimate that there is about a $3 \nbillion gap between the $52.3 billion in net cash income last year and \nwhat was expected for this year.\n  Farm income last year was supported by nearly $23 billion in direct \npayments to farmers, which at that time was an all-time high. If we \nenact H.R. 2213, the amendment I have offered, in a timely fashion, net \ncash farm income for this year, based on the current USDA projection, \nwould rise to $57.8 billion, $2.5 billion above last year's level. We \nwill have made up the $3 billion gap and exceeded that by $2.5 billion \nwith a $5.5 billion expenditure.\n  H.R. 2213 provides for $4.622 billion in supplemental market loss \npayments.\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\n These are payments to producers enrolled in the 1996 farm bill's \nAgriculture Market Transition Act, the AMTA acronym. These farmers have \ncontracts, and the bill says the payments come to them throughout the \nentirety of the 7 years of the bill. That is the AMTA payment, $4.622 \nbillion.\n  The second provision is $424 million in market loss payments to \nproducers of soybeans and other oilseeds. My first question on this \nprovision was: How will the $424 million in these market loss payments \nto the soybean and oilseed producers get to them by September 30? The \nanswer to that question, and that will be roughly the same answer but I \nwill be explicit all the way through this list, is they are the same \nproducers who received the money last year.\n  It was not easy to make the payments last year, and this called for \nan enormous amount of research and guidance through the whole process, \nbut the results of all of that activity are that there is now a list. \nThe expedition of the payments will be the $424 million goes to those \nsame people and can be paid, if we make a decision to act this week, by \nSeptember 30.\n  Next comes $159 million in assistance to producers of specialty crops \nsuch as fruits and vegetables. Here we do not have lists of who \nreceived the money last year, and therefore the provision in the House \nbill is there would be grants to the States. Now, the States will have \nto work out who gets the money within their States, but for the \npurposes of this act the money is dispensed by the Federal Government \nto the States before September 30. Therefore, technically, it is out of \nthe Treasury before the fiscal year ends and fits within the $5.5 \nbillion in that way.\n  That implies a great deal more activity, understandably, for equity \nfor the specialty crops as it goes to the various States and farmers \nwork with their State governments.\n  Then we have $129 million in market loss assistance for tobacco. This \ngoes to quota holders, who are a well-known group, and payments have \nbeen made to these persons in the past.\n  The next provision is $54 million in market loss assistance for \npeanuts. Likewise, there are quota holders for peanuts, a well-known \nlist for these producers. The money can be paid to them by September \n30.\n\n  The same is true for the next provision, $85 million in market loss \nassistance for cotton seed; the same for $17 million in market loss \nassistance for wool and mohair producers; the final provision in the \nHouse bill is $10 million in emergency food assistance support. This \nemergency assistance support will go for commodities for the school \nlunch programs and other important and nutrition programs. Those moneys \nwill be spent before September 30. These are the provisions of the \nHouse legislation. That is the total list of provisions.\n  H.R. 2213 utilizes the full $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2001 provided \nin this year's budget resolution for farm market loss assistance. It \ndoes not touch the $7.35 billion in fiscal year 2002 funds that the \nbudget resolution also provides either for supplemental farm assistance \nfor the 2002 crops or to help the Agriculture Committee write a new \nmultiyear farm bill. That very statement is, of course, the source of \nsome debate. There are Members who say: Why not reach into the $7.35 \nbillion? After all, it is there. The Budget Committee certainly \nmentioned it. Perhaps the Budget Committee, in mentioning it, implied \nthat the agricultural crisis goes on next year. As a matter of fact, \none can suggest the Budget Committee, in talking about over $70 billion \npayments over 10 years, implies the crisis goes on forever, or at least \nfor 10 years almost at the same level of crisis, maybe with a a few ups \nand downs, $10 billion payment one year, $5 billion the next, and so \nforth.\n  If we adopt this thinking, it makes almost no difference when the \nmoney is spent because the crisis goes on and people think if you can't \npick it up in this bill, you might try the Agriculture appropriations \nbill and find an emergency there to provide additional funds.\n  Sponsored by Congressmen Stenholm and Boehner, whom I mentioned \nbefore, the House bill finally represents a bipartisan compromise. It \nwas not easy to come by. Stenholm-Boehner-Dooley, and others I have \ncited, had contending parties within the House Agriculture Committee. \nMany people, as I read the debate, asked, What about us? They mentioned \nvarious considerations: if we were sending money to farmers, they \nwanted their fair share, including the brokering of all of that, with \npayments that could be made physically by the end of this year.\n  It was not an easy task. Nevertheless, they mastered it in the House. \nIt came out of committee well over a month ago. Their bill passed the \nHouse of Representatives by voice vote. Perhaps the House Members, by \nthe time they listened to all of this debate, figured the Agriculture \nCommittee people suffered enough; that they had undergone the agonies \nand did not want a repetition.\n  It is remarkable that this body takes a very different view. It \nappears we are going to have an extensive debate that may go on for \ndays. The House people were able to do this by voice vote. One reason \nthey did so is that they heard from farmers, they heard from their \nconstituents, and the farmers said: Get on with it; we don't want an \nargument; we understand you are doing your very best. The House people \nunderstood most of the Members on the floor of the House were not \nfarmers; they were advocates for farmers. They were doing the best for \ntheir constituents who were farmers, but at some point the constituents \nwould say; don't overlawyer me; don't over advocate me; try to get on \nwith a result because September 30 is coming quickly. Now, granted, \nsuch voices will be heard coming from agricultural America to this \nbody.\n\n  As I indicated at the outset, and the reason I offer this amendment, \nthis amendment offers, I believe, the opportunity to get a result. The \nbill before the Senate today, which I have sought to amend, represents \na very different approach that came out of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. The approach is that $1.976 billion in fiscal year 2002 \nwould be spent in addition to the $5.5 billion in the current fiscal \nyear. A significant portion, therefore, of the fiscal year 2002 budget \nauthority is used to fund this farm bill provision as opposed to the \nemergency that may arise next year or the farm bill which presumably \nwill come out of our committee and set some charter philosophy for the \nfuture. The House already passed such a bill. We may or may not agree \nwith it. In any event, they have a pretty full picture now of their \nactivities.\n  The bill offered by the distinguished chairman of our committee, \nSenator Harkin, for example, provides $200 million for the wetlands \nreserve program, WRP; $250 million for the environmental quality \nincentive programs, EQIP; $40 million for the farmland protection \nprogram; $7 million for the wildlife habitat incentive program; $43 \nmillion for a variety of agricultural credit and rural development \nprograms; and $3 million for agricultural research. The outlays from \nsome of these programs would be spread over a number of years, well \nbeyond fiscal year 2002.\n  I mention these programs because I support these programs. I have \nbeen a major advocate for agricultural research, not only of the \nformula grants to our great universities but cutting-edge research \nwhere anyone can compete to try to go out after the most pervasive \nhunger problems on Earth, or go after production problems, genetic \nproblems, the whole raft of things that are very important for \nhumanity. I think we ought to be about this in a very serious way. The \nEQIP program that I cited is extraordinarily important. It is at least \na way in which our livestock producers can stay alive while meeting the \nrequirements of the EPA or other environmental considerations that \nimpinge very markedly on their operations. As we consider the farm bill \nin the Senate as a whole, I would be an advocate of doing a great deal \nmore. I have saluted our chairman, Senator Harkin, for his championship \nof conservation programs. Both the chairman and I, as we speak, are \nmissing a hearing on conservation programs and we regret that because \nthese are people who are in the field, championing things that we \nbelieve in very strongly.\n\n  There is an argument, which you will hear in due course as the farm \nbill is presented, between those who advocate a lot more for \nconservation and maybe less for crop payments and subsidies of that \nsort and much more for the EQIP\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\nprogram that helps livestock people and maybe less for support of \ncertain crops. Those are the tradeoffs, again, and the difficulties \nwithin the whole agricultural family that we finally have to face. But \nit would be very difficult to argue, in the sense that we are \nattempting to get emergency money to farmers to pay the county banker \nand get the money to them by September 30, that these broad-gauged, \nimportant programs of research and conservation for America belong in \nthis particular emergency supplemental bill.\n  Our distinguished Senators will offer: ``They certainly do. And why \nnot?'' And: ``If we believe in them, why not do more of them?'' And: \n``Why not now?''\n  Earlier in the debate I pointed out one reason, as a practical \nmatter, is that President Bush has said he will veto the bill if it is \nmore than $5.5 billion. One way, perhaps, for the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa to remedy that is to downsize everything in his package to \nabout five-sevenths of where he is, get it under $5.5 billion. But \nthat, of course, then gets into an argument between the people who want \nmore AMTA payments, crop payments, as well as those who want to take \ncare of conservation and various other aspects all in this same \nemergency bill which is not a full-scale farm bill by any means.\n  As a result, we have that dilemma, and I come down on the side of \nsaying we try to do the conservation, the research, the EQIP, and the \nfarm bill as opposed to the suggestion in this day's discussion.\n  Let me just comment further that, with the program improvements we \nmade in the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000--that was the very \nimportant debate on crop insurance--participation in crop insurance has \nrisen sharply, as we hoped it would. Without repeating even a portion \nof that important debate, the point of last year's discussion about \nthis time was that crop insurance can offer a comprehensive safety net.\n  For example, take once again a personal, anecdotal experience with my \ncorn and soybean crops. This year I have about 200 acres each on the \nLugar farm in Marion County in Indiana. We have taken advantage of the \nlegislation we talked about last year and we purchased the 85-percent \nrevenue protection. Very simply, this means that our agent takes a look \nat the last 5 years of records of production and that gives a pretty \ngood baseline of what could be anticipated from those fields and, \nsimply, we are guaranteed about 85 percent of revenue based upon the \naverage crop prices for those 5 years. At the present time, the average \nfor the last 5 years is higher than the current price. It may rise and \nmeet that average.\n  So, as a corn farmer, for example, I know I am going to get 85 \npercent of a higher price than in fact is the market now, at least on \nthe average production I have had. So I do not have the problems of the \nbad weather one year, or so forth, affecting that abnormally. The net \neffect of that is, as a corn farmer, before I even planted the crop \nthis year, I knew that x number of dollars were at the end of the \ntrail--as a matter of fact, a pretty good number of those dollars that \nI could expect in a reasonably good year. That is a safety net that is \nvery substantial any way you look at it.\n\n  Many farmers may say: I have never heard of such a program.\n  That is a part of our problem, the educational component, trying to \nunderstand what crop insurance and marketing strategies, and so forth, \nare all about. For instance, once guaranteed this income from that \ncornfield, I could be alert for spikes in the market that come along \nand make forward sales of corn when prices were up. I am not beholden \nto sit there and hope the Lord will provide at the time I ship it in, \nin the fall. So I can enhance that 85 percent a whole lot. So can any \ncorn farmer in America who hears these words this morning and adopts \nsuch a policy.\n  But we in the Senate and the House provided that. The President \nsigned it last year. One of the problems of it is that it costs \nprobably about $3 billion a year. I mention that because that--we are \nnot debating that this morning--flows right along. It is a part of the \nbase as well as these AMTA payments that are made, regardless of what \nwe do, or the loan deficiency payments made at the elevator even as we \nspeak.\n  So the safety net already is very heavy. But I mention with those \nimprovements--and I think they were constructive ones--a part of our \nproblem remains information dissemination, education on marketing \ninsurance strategies in the hope that farmers will take advantage of \nactions the Congress has already taken.\n  In addition, as to what we do today, we will be hearing soon from the \nAgriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. Typically, \nthat subcommittee takes a look at miscellaneous disasters of all sorts \nthroughout the United States. I cannot remember an Agriculture \nappropriations bill that did not take into consideration weather \ndisasters. But sometimes there are other disasters. In other words, it \nprovides still an additional safety net for events that seem \nextraordinary and beyond anything we have considered or that could have \nbeen helped with crop insurance or any of our AMTA payments that flow \nwhether or not you even have a crop.\n  Overall, the bill of the distinguished Senator from Iowa, the \nunderlying bill in this debate, provides $6.75 billion in supplemental \nfarm assistance for 2001 crops and $750 million in other spending over \n2 fiscal years. It leaves, now, $5.35 billion for the supplemental farm \nassistance of next year and very likely, in my judgment, will create a \nfunding shortfall for that farm assistance. Senators can argue maybe no \nassistance will be required so why not try it this year. But that is a \nvalue judgment.\n  The President, the White House, and others, have come to the \nconclusion that this year is this year and we ought to look at next \nyear on its merits because any way you look at it, $2 billion borrowed \nfrom next year theoretically could be spent for anything in America; \nthere is no obligation to spend that $2 billion on emergencies. For \nexample, without getting into a debate that is deeper than I want to \nget today, by next year people could say: In fact we take very \nseriously the problem of prescription drugs for the elderly under \nMedicare. We take very seriously Social Security reform. How are you \nfolks going to pay for that?\n  We might say: Well, the $2 billion will never be missed. It was \nsimply a part of a debate we had awhile back. But every $1 billion is \ngoing to be missed when we come to those fundamental issues.\n  Agriculture is a part of this general amount of $1 trillion that the \nPresident discussed in the State of the Union Address. As he outlined \nhis assurance to the American people that we have to be thoughtful \nabout Medicare, about Social Security, about education, and about \nhealth generally, he said there is still this contingency of about $1 \ntrillion from which we make the reforms in Medicare, from which the \nsupplementary legislation for prescription drugs for the elderly come, \nSocial Security reform, and agriculture.\n  There are a number of people in both the House and the Senate \ncommittees who say we had better get busy because when this general \ndebate gets going, if we have not pinned down the agriculture money on \nall four corners for the next 10 years, Katy bar the door. People are \nlikely to take a look at priorities.\n  I understand that. This $2 billion reaching across the line is not an \negregious misstep. And clearly one can argue the Budget Committee \nprovided this liberal interpretation. But $2 billion is $2 billion, and \nit is an expenditure. The Senate must determine priorities; the House \nhas. They have said $5.5 billion, and the President said that is the \nonly figure he is going to sign. We may, once again, get into that kind \nof argument in behalf of farmers. We are strong advocates for farmers.\n  But farmers, by and large, will say: Pass the bill and cut the checks \nbecause we have an appointment with the banker. You can have your \nargument when you come back.\n  It is a good argument for farmers as well as for other Americans.\n  The President's advisers in advising the President to veto this bill \nmade a number of statements with regard to the need for it at this \ntime. This is an important part of the debate. Members, in fact, \nyesterday got into this in a big way. The most common way of getting \ninto this is for a Senator to address the Chair and say, I have been to \nthis county seat or that county seat or on my friend's farm. Anybody \nwho does not\n\n[[Page S8409]]\n\nunderstand the profound suffering and difficulty has just not been \nthere and doesn't have eyes to see. All over America people are in \ngrave trouble. Each one of us from a farm State, as a matter of fact, \ncould cite hundreds of instances of farmers who are having severe \ndifficulty. There is no doubt about that. I simply state that as a \nbasic premise for the debate.\n  If there were any doubt about it, we would not be debating $5.5 \nbillion of emergency payments on top of over $20 billion of support \nthat Congress has already voted. That is a lot of money, but I \nunderstand that a vast majority of Senators are in favor of legislation \nthat would be helpful in this respect. We are not talking about a \nsituation in which the needs have not been perceived, but at the same \ntime in reality sometimes people can overstate this. That is always \ndangerous to do.\n  I have found in meetings with farmers around my State that, by and \nlarge, most people do not want to have a cheerful meeting. There are \nnot a lot of good-news apostles coming forward and pointing out how \nwell they are doing. In fact, that is totally out of the question.\n  I made a mistake at a meeting a while back in pointing out that on my \nfarm we had made money for the last 45 years without exception. You \ndon't do that, I found out. No one wants to hear that because, as a \nmatter of fact, it just isn't true for most people. And they would say \nthat for some it has never been true for the 45 years. They lost money \nfor all of the 45 years, or at least essentially that is the case. I \nhear that.\n  On the other hand, let me say that essentially there has been some \nmodest improvement in agricultural America. For example, world markets \nthat are extremely important to the growth of the U.S. sector show some \npromise of increase this year. That is amazing on the face of it. The \nreason why our export sales fell out of bed 4 years ago was not because \nwe were not competitive in this country. The price of rice and the \nquality were good, but anybody reading about the Asian economies \nunderstands that they had severe banking difficulties. The IMF even to \nthis day has not been able to cure it in some instances. As a result, \nwe lost about 40 percent of our exports to the Asian sector in 1 year's \ntime. That was a big hit. That really meant that 10 percent of our \nexports overall vanished overnight--not through any misdeed of American \nagriculture but because of the lack of demand and lack of effective \nmoney to buy it. Much of that has not yet been restored. There is \nalways the possibility. We wish that the Indonesian economy would get \nhealthier in a hurry. We are grateful for some good news from Thailand \nand South Korea. The Japanese are always big customers but not any \nbigger. This is not an economy that is growing. We all are working with \nour friends there to try to restore some activity.\n  In the European case, we have been hit--not on the questions of price \nor income but on biotechnology--with essentially all of our corn being \nexported and very few soybeans. That is a real problem.\n  Our export sales fell to $49 billion in 1999 but are forecast to \nincrease to $53.5 billion in 2001--an increase of $500 million, as a \nmatter of fact, over the forecast by USDA in February--with livestock \nproducts, cotton, and soybeans accounting for much of the gain over the \nprevious year. That is truly good news.\n  Export levels in 2001--the year we are in--are still well below the \nrecord highs of 1996. Primarily in response to these problems that I \nhave cited in Asia, and production increases by competing exporters \nthat sometimes are becoming much better at the task, nevertheless, \nsales appear to be increasing significantly.\n  During the first half of fiscal year 2001, the surplus in U.S. \nagricultural trade grew to $9.4 billion, almost $2 billion more than \nthe same period last year. Year-to-date exports are $32.4 billion, $1.8 \nbillion higher than they were during the same time period of last year, \nprimarily due to $1.5 billion in more shipments of high-value products. \nThat includes significant gains in livestock and feed, but bulk \ncommodities have also contributed modestly to that.\n  Although the intermediate term outlook for agriculture is clearly \nuncertain at this point, it is clear that many underlying farm economic \nconditions are stronger this year than last year. Farm cash receipts \ncould be a record high for 2001, driven primarily by a nearly 7-percent \nincrease in livestock sales while crop sales could increase by as much \nas 1 percent. That scenario depends on $15.7 billion in direct payments \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  Those taking a look at this situation could say that is still not the \nreal market. The sales are up because the Federal Government already \nhas put up $15.7 billion, and we are about to put up at least $5.5 \nbillion more. But, nevertheless, it is up rather than down.\n  As I pointed out earlier, if we had the $5.5 billion in my amendment, \nwe are clearly going to have a net cash income situation that is at \nleast $2.5 billion stronger than last year.\n  The projected increase in sales for 2001 is projected to more than \noffset the decline in Government payments and will boost gross cash \nincome to $234 billion, up slightly with the bulk of the increase from \nlivestock. Net cash income is forecast to decline $3 billion, as I \npointed out earlier. That is why the $5.5 billion in my amendment takes \ncare of that, plus $52.3 billion for the year, albeit through the \nhealth of the American taxpayers generally.\n  Therefore, the outlook for 2001 farm income performance includes:\n  Livestock sales, up 6.7 percent; Crop sales up 1 percent; gross cash \nincome up .1 percent; and net cash income down--before we act--5.4 \npercent. And we remedy that with the $5.5 billion we are about to \nadopt, I hope. If you take a look at the balance sheet for agriculture, \nthat is somewhat more promising.\n\n  Overall, the agricultural sector was strong throughout the year 2000, \nwith part of that strength coming from strong balance sheets. Assets in \n2000--the year previous--increased 3.6 percent and reached $1.12 \ntrillion. Farm debt increased 4.1 percent to $183.6 billion. But \nfarmers' equity increased 1.4 percent to $941.2 billion. For many \nobservers that is astonishing. This being a year or 2 or 3 or 4, \nhowever you count it, of an agricultural crisis, the net worth of \nfarmers as a whole has increased every year. It increases this year as \ncompared to last year. Total farm debt has still stayed well under \nconstraints at a very modest percentage of that overall equity.\n  During the mid-1990s, farm debt rose steadily at $5 to $6 billion \nannually. That clearly is not the case as farmers were much more \nprudent during this particular period.\n  The value of livestock and poultry, machinery, purchased inputs, and \nfinancial assets are all expected to increase this year, but the value \nof stored crops could decline modestly as a part of that asset \nsituation.\n  Farm operators and lenders learned during the crisis of the 1980s \nthat ill-advised borrowing cannot substitute for adequate cash flow and \nprofits. In addition to gains in farmland values, cautious borrowing \nhas kept the sector sound.\n  The farm sector equity growth continues. During the 2001 forecast, we \nsee a moderate increase in debt, suggesting modest levels of new \ncapital investments financed by debt, and a very low incidence of farms \nborrowing their way out of cash flow problems.\n  I mention that because of testimony we heard from farmers who need \nthe $5.5 billion in our amendment. But at the same time, they are \npaying back their loans. They are not in a crisis situation with the \ncountry banker. And the country bankers need to make the loans because \nthey do have a relatively sound market situation.\n  Land prices: Cash rents reinforce economic strength and suggest \ninvestment is profitable for many farmers. That raises another issue \nbecause, in fact, with land prices rising each year--and I cited \nyesterday sector by sector all over the country land prices have been \nrising throughout this decade. The young farmer coming into this \npicture, trying to buy land or to rent land, with rents going up every \nyear, has raised some questions about our farm policies.\n  They have said: You folks in the Senate and the House are busy \nsending payments to farmers. They are capitalizing that in the value of \nthe land. They are charging more rent. How are young farmers such as \nourselves ever going to get in the game?\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\n  We say: We will try to give you some low-cost loans. And the \nPresiding Officer, from his background in finance, will immediately \nrecognize that these policies have some contradictions. On the one \nhand, we are doing our very best to boost income and the net worth, the \nbalance sheets. I pointed, with pride, to the fact that we have some \nstrength here. But it is not strength to everybody. The competing \nsectors, once again, are fairly obvious once you get to the fissures in \nour farm policy.\n  Nothing we do today will remedy that problem specifically. We are \ntalking about an emergency. We are plugging in the net income, but it \nis all a part of this picture of well over $20 billion of Federal \npayments and who gets them, how are they capitalized, how does that \nwork out in balance sheets, and for which farmers.\n  These are important issues. The chairman of our committee has had to \ntry to resolve that within the committee. I salute him. As chairman for \nthe 6 previous years, I had that responsibility. It is not easy, as you \ntake a look around the table just in the Ag Committee, quite apart from \nthe Senate as a whole. Therefore, I have had modest arguments in favor \nof the amendment I offer today. It is clearly not meant with the wisdom \nof Solomon. It is a pragmatic approach to how we might get action on \nthe Agriculture bill as opposed to having a monumental argument for \nmany hours and perhaps a veto at the end of the trail.\n  Let me just simply say that clearly the bill the Senator from Iowa \nhas offered is different from the House bill--significantly different--\nand no less a group than the White House people have pointed out the \ndifference and indicated the action they would take if that difference \nwas not resolved.\n  So my hope is that essentially Members will gather as much of this \ntogether as they wish and try to distill at least the picture of \nagriculture in America that I have suggested and come to a conclusion \nthat the amendment I have offered in a way--hopefully, with as much \nequity as possible on both sides of the aisle, and for farmers all over \nAmerica--resolves our problem.\n  It would be unseemly to try to point out all the other scenarios that \ncould happen if my amendment is not adopted. But let me just describe \nvery clearly a part of the task ahead of us if we do not adopt the \nHouse language.\n  Whatever we adopt has to have a conference. I have cited that the \nbill the Senate Agriculture Committee passed the other day, maybe \ninadvertently, appears to touch at least three different House \ncommittees that have jurisdiction over some of this material. Maybe all \nof them will be happily cooperative in these final days, but I am not \ncertain that is the case.\n  As I take a look at the chairmanships, the ranking members, and the \ngeneral views of some of these committees--and they are not all Ag \nCommittee people--they have other views. Maybe the distinguished \nSenator will excise various items and try to get these folks out of the \npicture. That would be helpful.\n  I have suggested he might downsize all of his items by five-sevenths \nand get it under $5.5 billion. Maybe that is a pragmatic solution to \nthat. As he does so, of course, he will run into the same problem I \nhave. He will run into people who want a bigger AMTA payment, and say: \nBy golly, I am not going to vote for that bill unless the AMTA payment \nis at least as it was last year and the year before. I can't go home \nand see my cotton farmers and my corn farmers with anything less. \nWhether we have any money or not, I am going to fight to the very last \nhour to get that dollar, if I can.\n  Or you run into the so-called specialty crops people. Strawberry \nfarmers have said: We have not been in on this business before. Why \nnot?\n  Apple growers will say: We have a special problem this year. Without \nsome payments, it is curtains for us.\n  It goes down through the line. So the chairman has to face all these \npeople. He has already promised the AMTA people that they get the same \nas last year. That takes almost all the $5.5 billion. It is no wonder \nthat the bill spills beyond $5.5 billion. It is--without any \ndisrespect--a collection of the wish lists of members of the Ag \nCommittee thrown together, listed ad seriatim. When you add up the \ntotal, it happens to come to $7.4 billion-plus.\n  You can say: Why not? But I am suggesting the ``why not.'' I think it \nis fairly clear it does not come close to our friends in the House. It \ndoes not come close to the requirements of the President to sign the \nbill. Although it may satisfy Members who say we have to go home and \nsay we did the very best we could, that will not satisfy American \nfarmers who, in the end result, do not get the money.\n\n  Let me just add, if there is anybody in this body with a perverse \nbelief that we should be doing nothing here--in other words, in his or \nher heart of hearts who says, why are we having another farm debate; Is \nthere no end of expenditure that is required?--if such a Member exists \nwho perversely says, these folks, out of their own overlawyering and \noveradvocacy, will kill each other off, the net result at the end of \nthe day will be zero expenditure, and that is a good result because \nthat leaves $5.5 billion for something else in life that is more \nimportant--there could be a problem.\n  I suppose my suggestion would be, if there is not a constructive \nmajority on my amendment, those folks will be interspersed with those \npurporting to be friends of farmers and suggesting more and more. The \ntwo extremes will finally get their wish, which is no bill.\n  I am not one of them. In a straightforward way, we have offered a \npragmatic solution--not my own bill, not one that I find has \nextraordinary merit, but one that I believe has enough merit to be the \nbasis for a good conclusion of a lot of difficulty in farmland and a \nlot of difficulty we have as legislators. It is something to broker all \nthe interests of America into this particular situation.\n  At the appropriate time, I am hopeful Members will vote in favor of \nthe amendment. I have been advised that there may in due course be a \nmotion to table my amendment. Some have suggested that would offer at \nleast a clue of the strength of how we are doing. I hope that will not \ncome too soon, before Members really have considered what our options \nare, because I predict, in the event my amendment is tabled and no \nlonger really is a viable possibility, almost all of the possibilities \nthat follow are fairly grim.\n  If, for example, other amendments should be adopted that are more \nthan $5.5 billion or the basic underlying bill, which is about 7.4, the \nodds of that becoming legislation are zero. Members need to know that \nat the outset. There has never been a more explicit set of messages \nfrom the White House before we even start. One could say, well, let's \ntaunt the President; let's sort of see really what he wants to do. That \nis not a very good exercise, given 3 days of recess and the need for \nthese checks by September 30.\n  In addition, if my amendment fails, this I suppose offers open season \nfor anybody who has an agricultural problem in America. If this is \ngoing to be a failing exercise, why not bring up a whole raft of \ndisputes, try them on for size, sort of test the body, and see what \nsort of support there is out there as a preliminary for the farm bill. \nThis really offers spring training for arguments that might be out \nthere in due course. We might try out a whole raft of dairy amendments, \nfor example, try to resolve that extraordinary problem, all on this \nbill with both sides predicting filibusters that curl your hair \nthroughout the whole of August, not just the whole of this week, or we \ncould try out other experiments that have been suggested as Members \ntruly believe we ought to discuss the trade problems and work out \npriorities with Social Security or Medicare and how we do those things.\n  Given the rules of the Senate, you could say, why not? Is anybody \ngoing to say it is nongermane? Does anybody really want to bring the \nthing to a conclusion?\n  I simply do want to bring it to a conclusion. I am hopeful that after \nboth parties, both sides of the aisle, have considered the options, \nthey will adopt my amendment, and we will swiftly join hands with the \nHouse and the President and give assurance to American farmers, which, \nas I understand, was the beginning of our enterprise.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senate for allowing me to make this \nextensive presentation.\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to address the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Indiana, the distinguished ranking member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, someone for whom I have enormous respect \nand listen carefully when the Senator from Indiana speaks on a subject. \nHe has always done his homework, and he has a clear view. In this \ncircumstance, I regret to say I have a different view.\n  As I look at the history over the last 3 years of the assistance \nbills we have passed in the Senate for agriculture in these situations, \nthis is a very modest bill. In fact, it is significantly less than we \nhave passed in each of the last 3 years.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana is precisely what \npassed in the House. It is exactly the legislation that comes to us \nfrom that body. The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, the \nRepublican chairman, has, in his written views on this bill, said it is \ninadequate, has pointed out that this bill would provide $1 billion \nless than what we have passed in the last 3 years--$1 billion less than \nwhat has been passed each of the last 3 years to assist farmers at a \ntime of real economic hardship. And as the Republican chairman of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee pointed out, this is at a time when farmers \nface the lowest real prices since the Great Depression.\n  The hard reality here is that prices for everything farmers buy have \ngone up, up, and away, especially energy prices, and yet the prices \nthey receive are at a 70-year low in real terms. That is the situation \nwe confront today. That is the hard reality of what we face today. The \ndecision we have to make is, are we going to respond in a serious way, \nor are we going to fail to respond?\n  I hope very much that we will just look at the record. This chart \ndepicts it very well. The green line is the prices farmers paid for \ninputs. The red is the prices farmers have received from 1991 through \n2000. Look at the circumstance we have faced. The prices farmers have \npaid for inputs have gone up, up, and up. The prices farmers have \nreceived have declined precipitously.\n  That is the situation our farmers are facing. We can either choose to \nrespond to that or we can fail. I hope we respond. I hope we respond \nquickly because the Congressional Budget Office has told us very \nclearly: If we fail to respond this week, the money in this bill will \nbe scored as having been passed and effective in the year 2002. In \neffect, we would lose $5.5 billion available to help farmers.\n  There has been a lot of suggestion that things have been improving \nlately. I don't know exactly what they are talking about in terms of \nimprovement. We have searched the markets to try to find where these \nimprovements are occurring.\n  There has been modest improvement in lifestock. We do not see \nimprovement in the program crops or the nonprogram crops, the things \nthat are really covered by this bill.\n  Let me go back to what the chairman of the Agriculture Committee in \nthe House of Representatives said about this very amendment, this \nprecise legislation, that is before us now. This is the Republican \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee. He said: H.R. 2213 as \nreported by the Agriculture Committee is inadequate in at least two \nrespects:\n  First, the assistance level is not sufficient to address the needs of \nfarmers and ranchers in the 2001 crop-year.\n  Second, the bill's scope is too narrow, leaving many needs completely \nunaddressed.\n  This is the Republican chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the \nHouse of Representatives talking about the very legislation being \noffered by the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee in the \nSenate today.\n  This is, again from the House Agriculture chairman, at a time when \nreal net cash income on the farm is at its lowest level since the Great \nDepression, and the cost of production is expected to set a record \nhigh. H.R. 2213, that has precisely the same provisions as are being \noffered by the Senator from Indiana, cuts supplemental help to farmers \nby $1 billion from last year to this year. Hardest hit will be wheat, \ncorn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, rice, soybean, and \nother oilseed farmers since the cuts will come at their expense.\n  I say to my colleagues, if they are representing wheat farmers, if \nthey are representing corn farmers, grain sorghum, barley, oats, rice, \nsoybean, and other oilseed farmers, to vote for the amendment of the \nSenator from Indiana is to cut assistance to their producers at the \nvery time they are suffering from this circumstance.\n  The prices they pay are increasing each and every year. The prices \nthey receive are plunging.\n  The House Agriculture Committee chairman went on to say, H.R. 2213, \nthe bill that was reported by the House committee, the identical \nlanguage which has been offered here, also fails to address the needs \nof dairy farmers, sugar beet and sugar cane farmers, farmers who graze \ntheir wheat, barley and oats, as well as farmers who are denied \nmarketing loan assistance either because they do not have an AMTA \ncontract or because they lost beneficial interest in their crops.\n  The House Agriculture chairman went on to say, earlier this year, 20 \nfarm groups pegged the need in farm country for the 2001 crop-year at \n$9 billion. We do not have $9 billion available to us. We have, under \nthe budget resolution, $5.5 billion available to us, and that is what \nthe bill from the Agriculture Committee provides, $5.5 billion this \nyear, $1.9 billion out of what is available to us next year in 2002.\n  What the amendment from the Senator from Indiana would provide is \n$5.5 billion this year, period. It is not enough. It represents, \naccording to the Republican chairman of the Agriculture Committee in \nthe House, a billion dollar cut from what we did last year. That is not \nwhat we should do.\n  The House Agriculture Committee chairman went on in his report to \nsay, those who championed this legislation, as reported in the \ncommittee, argued in part a cut in help to farmers this year is \nnecessary to save money for a rewrite of the farm bill, but the fly in \nthe ointment is many farmers are deeply worried about whether they can \nmake it through this year, let alone next year.\n  That is what we are down to in farm country across America. We are \ndown to a question of survival. In my State, I have never seen such a \nloss of hope as has occurred in the agricultural sector, and it is the \nbiggest industry in my State. If one were out there and they were \npaying for everything they buy, all of the inputs they use, every input \ngoing up, up, and up --if this chart extended to 2001, it would be more \ndramatic--we would see the prices going up even further.\n\n  On the other hand, if we looked at the prices for everything one sold \ngoing almost straight down, they would be hopeless, too.\n  This chart does not show just the last 6 months. This pattern of \nprices is since 1996. These are not Kent Conrad's numbers. These are \nthe numbers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  The pattern of the prices which farmers receive is virtually straight \ndown, and the prices they pay have been going up, up, up.\n  I do not know what could be more clear. We have an obligation to \nhelp. We have an obligation to move this legislation. We have a \nrequirement to move this legislation this week, not just through this \nChamber but through the whole process. It has to be conferenced with \nthe House, and the conference report has to be voted on before we go on \nbreak or we are going to lose $5.5 billion. The money will be gone \nbecause the Congressional Budget Office has told us very clearly if \nthis bill is not passed before we leave on break, they will score this \nlegislation, even though it is being passed in fiscal year 2001, as \naffecting 2002 because they say the money cannot get out to farmers \nbefore the end of the fiscal year.\n  It is all at stake in this debate we are having, and I urge my \ncolleagues to think very carefully about what they do in these coming \nvotes.\n  I will close the way I started, by referring to the report of the \nchairman from the House Agriculture Committee, who said very clearly \nthe identical legislation, which is contained in the amendment from the \nSenator from Indiana, is inadequate. This is the Republican chairman of \nthe House Agriculture Committee, and he calls the\n\n[[Page S8412]]\n\namendment being offered inadequate in at least two respects: First, the \nassistance level is not sufficient to address the needs of farmers and \nranchers in the 2001 crop-year.\n  Second, the bill's scope is too narrow, leaving many needs completely \nunaddressed.\n  Finally, he said, clearly this legislation, precisely what we are \ngoing to be voting on in the Senate, cuts supplemental help to farmers \nby $1 billion from last year to this year. We are cutting at the time \nwe see a desperate situation in farm country all across America. It \ndoes not make sense. It is not what we should do. We ought to reject \nthe amendment by the Senator from Indiana.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest we move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee for pointing out the letter we received from the \nOffice of Management and Budget, which is not signed, but it is from \nthe Office of Management and Budget and says: ``The President's senior \nadvisers would recommend he veto the Senate bill we have before us \nbased upon improvements in agricultural markets. Stronger livestock and \ncrop prices means that the need for additional Federal assistance \ncontinues to diminish.''\n  I grant that livestock prices are a little bit higher. Are crop \nprices better than last year? Yes, but last year was a 15-year low. So \nit has come up a little bit. We are still at a 10- or 12-year low in \ncrop prices. Simply because they were a little bit better than last \nyear's disastrously low prices does not mean we don't have a need for \nadditional farmer assistance. We do need it desperately.\n  It seems to me if that is the advice the President is getting, he is \ngetting bad advice. I hope the President--he is the President; he does \nmake the final decision--will look at the low crop prices we have all \nover America, and not only low crop prices, that is just looking at one \nthing. Crop prices may be marginally better than last year, but the \ninput costs have skyrocketed.\n  We all know what has happened to fuel prices and fertilizer prices. \nThey have skyrocketed. So the gap between what the farmer is receiving \nand what he is paying out continues to widen, as indicated in the chart \nof the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The President's advisers do not really know what is happening in farm \ncountry.\n  The Senator from North Dakota read from the report of the Agriculture \nCommittee. I reemphasize that the chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, a Republican, Larry Combest from Texas, along with 17 \nmembers of the House Agriculture Committee, said their bill was \ninadequate for two reasons: One, it is not sufficient to address the \nneeds of farmers and ranchers; second, the scope is too narrow, leaving \nmany needs completely unaddressed.\n  He points out that earlier this year 20 farm groups pegged the need \nfor the 2001 crop-year at $9 billion. The farmers represent, according \nto Larry Combest's letter, the views of 17 members of the Agriculture \nCommittee. The farmers they represent had every reason to believe the \nhelp this year would be at least comparable to the help Congress \nprovided last year. Producers who graze their wheat, barley, and oats, \nas well as producers who are denied marketing loan assistance--either \nbecause they do not have an AMTA crop or they lost beneficial interest \nin their crops--need help, too.\n  As this process moves forward, the letter continues, we will work to \nbuild a more sturdy bridge over this year's financial straits, straits \nthat may otherwise threaten to separate many farmers from the promise \nof the next farm bill.\n  If all we are going to do is adopt the farm bill the House passed, \nthere is no bridge. They are saying they hope the Senate might do \nsomething else so we can work on building that bridge.\n  A letter dated March 13, 2001, to the Honorable Pete Domenici, \nchairman of the Committee on the Budget, is signed by 21 Members of the \nSenate on both sides of the aisle: Senators Cochran, Hutchison, Breaux, \nLandrieu, Bond, Sessions, Lincoln, Shelby, Bunning, Helms, McConnell, \nCraig, Cleland, Inhofe, Thurmond, Fitzgerald, Miller, Frist, Thomas, \nHutchinson, and Hagel.\n  It says:\n\n       Specifically, since conditions are not appreciably improved \n     for 2001, we support making market loss assistance available \n     so that the total amount of assistance available through the \n     2001 Agricultural Market Transition Act payment and the \n     Market Loss Assistance payments will be the same as was \n     available for the 2000 crop.\n\n  Further, the letter says:\n\n       In addition to sluggish demand and chronically low prices, \n     U.S. farmers and ranchers are experiencing rapidly increasing \n     input costs including fuel, fertilizer and interest rates.\n\n  Further reading from the letter:\n\n       With projections that farm income will not improve in the \n     near future, we believe it is vitally important to provide at \n     least as much total economic assistance for 2001 and 2002 as \n     provided for the 2000 crop.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Pete: We are writing to request your assistance in \n     including appropriate language in the FY02 budget resolution \n     so that emergency economic loss assistance can be made \n     available for 2001 and 2002 or until a replacement for the \n     1996 Farm Bill can be enacted. Specifically, since conditions \n     are not appreciably improved for 2001, we support making \n     market loss assistance available so that the total amount of \n     assistance available through the 2001 Agricultural Market \n     Transition Act payment and the Market Loss Assistance \n     payments will be the same as was available for the 2000 crop. \n     We understand it is unusual to ask that funds to be made \n     available in the current fiscal year be provided in a budget \n     resolution covering the next fiscal year, but the financial \n     stress in U.S. agriculture is extraordinary.\n       According the USDA and other prominent agriculture \n     economists, the U.S. agricultural economy continues to face \n     persistent low prices and depressed farm income. According to \n     testimony presented by USDA on February 14, 2001, ``a strong \n     rebound in farm prices and income from the market place for \n     major crops appears unlikely . . . assuming no supplemental \n     assistance, net cash farm income in 2001 is projected to be \n     the lowest level since 1994 and about $4 billion below the \n     average of the 1990's.'' The USDA statement also said . . .'' \n     (a) national farm financial crisis has not occurred in large \n     part due to record government payments and greater off-farm \n     income.''\n       In addition to sluggish demand and chronically low prices, \n     U.S. farmers and ranchers are experiencing rapidly increasing \n     input costs including fuel, fertilizer and interest rates. \n     According to USDA, ``increases in petroleum prices and \n     interest rates along with higher prices for other inputs, \n     including hired labor increased farmers' production expenses \n     by 4 percent or $7.6 billion in 2000, and for 2001 cash \n     production expenses are forecast to increase further. At the \n     same time, major crop prices for the 2000-01 season are \n     expected to register only modest improvement from last year's \n     15-25 year lows, reflecting another year of large global \n     production of major crops and ample stocks.''\n       During the last 3 years, Congress has provided significant \n     levels of emergency economic assistance through so-called \n     Market Loss Assistance payments and disaster assistance for \n     weather related losses. During the last three years, the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation has provided about $72 billion \n     in economic and weather related loss assistance and \n     conservation payments. The Congressional Budget Office and \n     USDA project that expenditures for 2001 will be $14-17 \n     billion without additional market or weather loss assistance. \n     With projections that farm income will not improve in the \n     near future, we believe it is vitally important to provide at \n     least as much total economic assistance for 2001 and 2002 as \n     was provided for the 2000 crop.\n       Congress has begun to evaluate replacement farm policy. In \n     order to provide effective, predictable financial support \n     which also allows farmers and ranchers to be competitive, \n     sufficient funding will be needed to allow the Agriculture \n     Committee to ultimately develop a comprehensive package \n     covering major commodities in addition to livestock and \n     specialty crops, rural development, trade and conservation \n     initiatives. Until new legislation can be enacted, it is \n     essential that Congress provide emergency economic assistance \n     necessary to alleviate the current financial crisis.\n       We realize these recommendations add significantly to \n     projected outlays for farm programs. Our farmers and ranchers \n     clearly prefer receiving their income from the market. \n     However, while they strive to further reduce costs and expand \n     markets, federal assistance will be necessary until \n     conditions improve.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Thad Cochran, John Breaux, Kit Bond, Blanche Lincoln, Jim \n           Bunning, Mitch\n\n[[Page S8413]]\n\n           McConnell, Max Cleland, Strom Thurmond, Zell Miller, \n           Craig Thomas, Chuck Hagel, Tim Hutchinson, Mary \n           Landrieu, Jeff Sessions, Richard Shelby, Jesse Helms, \n           Larry Craig, James Inhofe, Peter Fitzgerald, Bill \n           Frist, Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The bill reported from the Agriculture Committee meets \neverything in this letter, signed by all these Senators, sent to \nSenator Domenici. We have met the need. We have provided for the same \nmarket loss assistance payment this year as provided last year.\n  The House bill that Senator Lugar has introduced as an amendment \nprovides 85 percent of what was provided last year; the Agriculture \nCommittee bill provides 100 percent. I hope Senators who sent this \nletter earlier to Senator Domenici recognize we met these needs; we \nprovided 100 percent, exactly what they asked for, the same as \navailable for the 2000 crop.\n  As Senator Conrad pointed out, the gap, as pointed out in the letter, \nin rapidly increasing input costs, fuel, fertilizer, and high interest \nrates, still means farmers have a big gap out there between prices they \nare receiving and what they are paying out.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my colleague from Michigan, a \nvaluable member of the Agriculture Committee.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I take a moment to thank the chairman for his \nleadership in putting forward a bill that is balanced and that meets \nthe criteria laid out, the needs expressed by Members on both sides of \nthe aisle. I thank the Senator for putting together a package \naddressing those crops that are not considered program crops but are in \nsevere financial situations.\n  One example in the great State of Michigan, among many, are our apple \ngrowers who have needed assistance and received assistance--late but \ndid receive assistance--last year. I am deeply concerned when we hear \nas much as 30 percent of the apple growers in this country will not \nmake it past this season. If we are to look at their needs for, not the \nfiscal year, but as the Senator eloquently stated in the past, the crop \nyear, and the needs of the farmers, it means the version that came from \nthe Senate committee needs to be the version adopted.\n  I ask my esteemed chairman, it is my understanding in the amendment \nbefore the Senate, there is not a specific loss payment for apple \ngrowers; is that correct? I could address other specialty needs in \ndairy, sugar, and a whole range of needs in the great State of \nMichigan, but is it true that this does not, as the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee bill does, put forward dollars specifically for our apple \ngrowers? It is my understanding this amendment adopted by the House of \nRepresentatives would not address the serious needs of America's apple \ngrowers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond to my colleague from Michigan, she is \nabsolutely right, there is nothing in the House bill providing any help \nfor the tremendous loss, 30-some percent loss, that apple producers \nhave experienced in this country. We are talking about apple producers \nfrom Oregon, from Washington, Michigan, to Maine, Massachusetts, New \nYork, Pennsylvania, all who experienced tremendous losses.\n  Under the AMTA payment system, they don't get money, but they are \nfarmers. They are farmers.\n  Many are family farmers and they need help, too. So I think, I say to \nmy friend from Michigan, what Larry Combest and the 17 others who \nsigned the ``additional views'' on the House bill said was that the \nbill was too narrow in scope. There are a lot of other farmers in this \ncountry who are hurting, who need some help.\n  So, yes, I say to my friend from Michigan, we provided $150 million \nin there to help our apple farmers. That is a small amount compared to \nthe $7.5 billion in the total package. But it is very meaningful. It \nwill go to those apple producers, and it will save them and keep a lot \nof them in business for next year, I say to my friend from Michigan.\n  I especially want to thank the Senator from Michigan for bringing \nthis to our attention. To be frank, I don't have a lot of apple growers \nin Iowa. We have a few, but not to the extent of many other States. It \nwas through the intercession and the great work done by the Senator \nfrom Michigan that this was brought to our attention, the terrible \nplight of our apple farmers all over America. I thank her for sticking \nup for our family farmers.\n  I just have a couple of other things. The Lugar amendment, the House \nbill, strikes out all the money we have for conservation. It strikes \nall the conservation money out. Earlier this year--June 14 of this \nyear--130 Members of the House of Representatives, including many \nmembers of the House Agriculture Committee, wrote a letter to Chairman \nCombest and Ranking Member Stenholm. They said:\n\n       We believe conservation must be the centerpiece of the next \n     farm bill.\n\n  They talk about the farm bill, but, they said:\n\n       We should not leave farmers waiting while a new farm bill \n     is debated. We urge you to work with the House Appropriations \n     Committee to increase FY 2002 annual and supplemental funding \n     for voluntary incentive-based programs. In particular, we \n     urge you to use 30 percent of emergency funds to help farmers \n     impacted by drought, flooding and rising energy costs, \n     through conservation programs. Currently, demand for the \n     Environmental Quality Incentives Program exceeds $150 \n     million. Demand for the Farmland Protection Program exceeds \n     $200 million, demand for the Wetlands Reserve Program exceeds \n     $350 million, and demand for the Wildlife Habitat Incentives \n     Program exceeds $150 million.\n\n  That is signed by 130 Members of the House.\n  I have to be honest; we didn't meet 30 percent of the emergency funds \nbut we did put in about 7 percent, if I am not mistaken--a little over \n7 percent. The Lugar amendment gives zero for conservation--zero.\n  Again, these are family farmers. Many of these farmers do not get the \nAMTA payments that go out, but they are farmers nonetheless and they \nneed help. Certainly we need to promote conservation because a lot of \nthese farms simply will lie dormant if we do not provide this \nassistance in this bill.\n  There are two other things I want to point out. I have a letter I \nreceived today from some Members of the House--two Members. The House \nbill passed by 1 vote. The House Agricultural Committee passed out the \nLugar amendment. What Senator Lugar is putting out there is the House \nAgriculture Committee bill. It passed by 1 vote. I have a letter from \ntwo members of that committee who voted on the prevailing side. Listen \nto what they said:\n\n       Dear Chairman Harkin: Although we supported H.R. 2213--The \n     Crop-Year 2001 Agricultural Economic Assistance Act--as it \n     passed the House of Representatives, we applaud the \n     comprehensive approach you have taken in the aid package \n     passed by the Senate Agriculture Committee to address the \n     many diverse needs of agricultural and rural communities.\n       By including additional funding for conservation programs, \n     nutrition, rural development and research, many farmers in \n     rural communities who do not benefit from the traditional \n     commodity programs will receive assistance this year. In \n     particular, the $542 million you included for conservation \n     programs will help reduce the $2 billion backlog of \n     applications from farmers and ranchers who are waiting for \n     USDA assistance to protect farm and ranchland threatened by \n     sprawling development and critical wetlands and riparian \n     areas for wildlife habitat, water quality, and floodplains.\n\n  Signed by Representative Ron Kind and Representative Wayne Gilchrest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    July 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin: Although we supported H.R. 2213--The \n     Crop Year 2001 Agriculture Economic Assistance Act--as it \n     passed the House of Representatives, we applaud the \n     comprehensive approach you have taken in the aid package \n     passed by the Senate Agriculture Committee to address the \n     many diverse needs of agriculture and rural communities. We \n     look forward to working with you to reconcile the competing \n     measures in order to ensure that we meet the diverse needs of \n     both our family farmers and the overall environment.\n       By including additional funding for conservation programs, \n     nutrition, rural development and research, many farmers and \n     rural communities who do not benefit from the traditional \n     commodity programs will receive assistance this year. In \n     particular, the $542 million you included for conservation \n     programs will help reduce the $2 billion backlog of \n     applications from farmers and ranchers who are waiting for \n     USDA assistance to protect farm and ranchland threatened by\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\n     sprawling development and critical wetlands and riparian \n     areas for wildlife habitat, water quality, and floodplains.\n       Earlier this year, 140 House members called on the House \n     Agriculture Committee to ``not leave farmers waiting while a \n     new farm bill is debated'' and instead allocate 30 percent of \n     emergency funding to conservation programs this year. Your \n     conservation package will maintain critical conservation \n     programs before the farm bill is reauthorized. Without this \n     additional funding, the Wetlands Reserve Program, Farmland \n     Protection Program, and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program \n     would cease to operate. It is our hope that the conferees \n     will view conservation programs favorably during conference \n     proceedings.\n       We believe this short-term aid package should reflect the \n     needs of all farmers in this country and set the tone for the \n     next farm bill by taking a balanced approach to allocating \n     farm spending among many disparate needs.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ron Kind,\n     Wayne Gilchrest,\n                                              Members of Congress.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then I have a letter also today saying:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am writing to you today to express \n     my support for the comprehensive approach you have taken in \n     drafting the Senate agricultural economic assistance bill. In \n     providing important funds for nutrition and conservation, the \n     agriculture economic assistance package recognizes that the \n     jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee goes beyond the \n     critically important task of providing economic support for \n     producers of commodities.\n       I urge you to ensure that the bill reported out of the \n     Senate retain these vitally important resources and look \n     forward to working with you to ensure that any bill sent to \n     the President is similarly cognizant of the broad array of \n     issues before the Agriculture Committees of the House and \n     Senate.\n       Eva M. Clayton, Member of Congress.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    July 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am writing to you today to express \n     my support for the comprehensive approach that you have taken \n     in drafting the Senate agriculture economic assistance bill. \n     In providing important funds for nutrition and conservation, \n     the agriculture economic assistance package recognizes that \n     the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee goes beyond the \n     critically important task of providing economic support for \n     producers of commodities.\n       In providing funds for important nutrition programs such as \n     the Senior Farmers Market and the Emergency Food Assistance \n     Program, the Committee acknowledges its responsibility to \n     ensure that American children live free from the specter of \n     hunger. Additionally, by providing important resources for \n     farmland conservation and environmental incentive payments, \n     the Committee recognizes the important fact that the \n     degradation of our natural resoruces and the decay of vitally \n     important water quality and farmland are emergencies that \n     affect our rural communities and thus are deserving of our \n     immedate attention.\n       I urge you to ensure that the bill reported out of the \n     Senate retain these vitally important resources and look \n     forward to working with you to ensure that any bill sent to \n     the President is similarly cognizant of the broad array of \n     issues before the Agricultue Committees of the House and the \n     Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Eva M.

These are two people who voted for the House-passed bill, \nwhich only passed by 1 vote, I might add.\n  So I would say there is a lot of support in the House of \nRepresentatives for what we have done in the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. I believe what we have done truly does provide that bridge.\n  I will close this part of my remarks by just saying we have a limited \namount of time. We need to get this bill out. We need to go to \nconference, which we could do tomorrow. If we can get this bill done \ntoday, we can go to conference tomorrow. I believe the conference would \nnot last more than a couple of hours, and we could have this bill back \nhere, I would say no later than late Wednesday, maybe Thursday, for \nfinal passage, and we could send it to the President.\n  I believe his senior advisers notwithstanding, the President would \nlisten to the voices here in the House and the Senate as to what is \nreally needed.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to print a news release in the Record \nthat was put out by the American Farm Bureau Federation dated June 21. \nIt says:\n\n       The House Agriculture Committee's decision to provide only \n     $5.5 billion in a farm relief package ``is disheartening and \n     will not provide sufficient assistance needed by many farm \n     and ranch families,'' said American Farm Bureau Federation \n     President Bob Stallman.\n       We believe the needs exceed $7 billion.\n\n  This is according to Mr. Stallman, president of the American Farm \nBureau Federation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Farm Bureau Disappointed in House Funding for Farmers\n\n       Washington, DC, June 21, 2001.--The House Agriculture \n     Committee's decision to provide only $5.5 billion in a farm \n     relief package ``is disheartening and will not provide \n     sufficient assistance needed by many farm and ranch \n     families,'' said American Farm Bureau Federation President \n     Bob Stallman.\n       ``We believe needs exceed $7 billion,'' Stallman said. \n     ``The fact is agricultural commodity prices have not \n     strengthened since last year when Congress saw fit to provide \n     significantly more aid.''\n       Stallman said securing additional funding will be a high \n     priority for Farm Bureau. He said the organization will now \n     turn its attention to the Senate and then the House-Senate \n     conference committee that will decide the fate of much-needed \n     farm relief.\n       ``Four years of low prices has put a lot of pressure on \n     farmers. We need assistance to keep this sector viable,'' the \n     farm leader said.\n       ``We've been told net farm income is rising but a closer \n     examination shows that is largely due to higher livestock \n     prices, not most of American agriculture,'' Stallman said.\n       ``And, costs are rising for all farmers and ranchers due to \n     problems in the energy industry that are reflected in \n     increased costs for fuel and fertilizer. Farmers and ranchers \n     who produce grain, oilseeds, cotton, fruits and vegetables \n     need help and that assistance is needed soon.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a letter dated July 11 from the National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers that said:\n\n       However, given current financial conditions, growers cannot \n     afford the reduced level of support provided by the House in \n     H.R. 2213. Wheat farmers across the nation are counting on a \n     market loss payment at the 1999 PFC rate. Thank you for your \n     leadership and support.\n       Dusty Tallman, President of the National Association of \n     Wheat Growers.\n\n  What is in our bill provides to wheat farmers across the country a \nmarket loss payment at the same rate they got in 1999.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Wheat Growers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Agriculture Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin: As President of the National \n     Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG), and on behalf of wheat \n     producers across the nation, I urge the Committee to draft a \n     2001 agriculture economic assistance package that provides \n     wheat producers with a market loss payment equal to the 1999 \n     Production Flexibility Contract (AMTA) payment rate.\n       NAWG understands Congress is facing difficult budget \n     decisions. We too are experiencing tight budgets in wheat \n     country. While wheat prices hover around the loan rate, PFC \n     payments this year have declined from $0.59 to $0.47. At the \n     same time, input costs have escalated. Fuel and oil expenses \n     are up 53 percent from 1999, and fertilizer costs have risen \n     33 percent this year alone.\n       Given these circumstances, NAWG's first priority for the \n     2001 crop year is securing a market loss payment at the 1999 \n     PFC rate. We believe a supplemental payment at $0.64 for \n     wheat--the same level provided in both 1999 and 2000--is \n     warranted and necessary to provide sufficient income support \n     to the wheat industry.\n       NAWG has a history of supporting fiscal discipline and \n     respects efforts to preserve the integrity of the $73.5 \n     billion in FY02-FY11 farm program dollars. However, given \n     current financial conditions, growers cannot afford the \n     reduced level of support provided by the House in H.R. 2213. \n     Wheat farmers across the nation are counting on a market loss \n     payment at the 1999 PFC rate.\n       Thank you for your leadership and support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Dusty Tallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a letter from the National Corn Growers \nAssociation:\n\n       Dear Chairman Harkin: We feel strongly that the Committee \n     should disburse these limited funds in a similar manner to \n     the FY00 economic assistance package--addressing the needs of \n     the 8 major crops--corn, wheat, barley, oats, oilseed, \n     sorghum, rice and cotton. . . .\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\n       Again, we urge the Committee to allocate the market loss \n     assistance payments at the FY99 production flexibility \n     contract payment level for program crops.\n\n  Our bill does exactly that. The House bill only puts in 85 percent.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter from the National Corn Growers \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter ws ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            National Corn Growers Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin: We write to urge you to take \n     immediate action on the $5.5 billion in funding for \n     agricultural economic assistance authorized in the FY01 \n     budget resolution.\n       The fiscal year 2001 budget resolution authorized $5.5 \n     billion in economic assistance for those suffering through \n     low commodity prices in agriculture. However, these funds \n     must be dispersed by the US Department of Agriculture by \n     September 30, 2001. We are very concerned that any further \n     delay by Congress concerning these funds will severely hamper \n     USDA's efforts to release funds and will, in turn, be \n     detrimental to producers anxiously awaiting this relief.\n       We feel strongly that the Committee should disperse these \n     limited funds in a similar manner to the FY00 economic \n     assistance package--addressing the needs of the eight major \n     crops--corn, wheat, barley, oats, oilseeds, sorghum, rice and \n     cotton. It is these growers who have suffered greatly from \n     the last two years of escalating fuel and other input costs. \n     The expectation of these program crop farmers is certainly \n     for a continuation of the supplemental AMTA at the 1999 \n     level.\n       Again, we urge the Committee to allocate the market loss \n     assistance payments at the FY99 production flexibility \n     contract payment for program crops. We feel strongly that \n     Congress should support the growers getting hit hardest by \n     increasing input costs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Lee Klein,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have another piece from the National \nCorn Growers Association in which they say the National Corn Growers \nAssociation is optimistic about the Senate Agriculture Committee's $7.5 \nbillion emergency aid package.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From NCGA News, July 26, 2001]\n\n    NCGA Optimistic About Senate Agriculture Committee $7.5 Billion \n                         Emergency Aid Package\n\n       The Senate Agriculture Committee yesterday approved a $7.5 \n     billion emergency aid package for farmers in the current \n     fiscal year, championed by Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA).\n       A substitute amendment offered by Richard Lugar (R-IN), \n     ranking member, failed by a vote of 12-9. Lugar sought an aid \n     package totaling $5.5 billion, similar to what the House \n     Agriculture Committee passed in late June.\n       The package approved yesterday will provide help to program \n     crops such as corn, as well as to oilseeds, peanuts, sugar, \n     honey, cottonseed, tobacco, specialty crops, pulse crops, \n     wool and mohair, dairy and apples. The Senate package is \n     expected to move to floor consideration at anytime, where \n     Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) may offer an amendment to curb the \n     overall spending while maintaining emergency spending for the \n     major commodities.\n       Because the aid packages passed by the Senate and House are \n     markedly different, a conference committee will be scheduled \n     to craft a compromise.\n       ``This development places even more pressure on Congress to \n     act expeditiously, because any aid package approved by \n     Congress must be done soon so that the USDA can cut checks \n     and mail them to farmers before fiscal year ends on September \n     30, 2001,'' said National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) \n     Vice President of Public Policy Bruce Knight.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have a release from the National \nFarmers Union, in which they say:\n\n       The National Farmers Union today applauded the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee on its approval of $7.4 billion in \n     emergency assistance for U.S. agriculture producers.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Farmers Union Commends Senate on Emergency Assistance Package\n\n       Washington, DC, July 25, 2001.--The National Farmers Union \n     (NFU) today applauded the Senate Agriculture Committee on its \n     approval of $7.4 billion in emergency assistance for U.S. \n     agriculture producers. The bill provides supplemental income \n     assistance to feed grains, wheat, rice and cotton producers \n     as well as specialty crop producers. The Senate measure \n     provides the needed assistance at the same levels as last \n     year and is $2 billion more than what is provided in a House \n     version of the measure. NFU urges expeditious passage by the \n     full Senate and resolution in the House/Senate conference \n     committee that adopts the much needed funding at the Senate \n     level.\n       ``We commend Chairman Tom Harkin for his leadership in \n     crafting this assistance package,'' said Leland Swenson, \n     president of NFU. ``We are pleased that members of the \n     committee have chosen to provide funding that is comparable \n     to what many farmers requested at the start of this process. \n     This level of funding recognizes the needs that exist in \n     rural America at a time when farmers face continued low \n     commodity prices for row and specialty crops while input \n     costs for fuel, fertilizer and energy have risen rapidly over \n     the past year.''\n       The Senate Agriculture Committee approved the Emergency \n     Agriculture Assistance Act of 2001 that provides $7.4 billion \n     in emergency assistance to a broad range of agriculture \n     producers and funds conservation programs. It also provides \n     loans and grants to encourage value-added products, \n     compensation for damage to flooded lands and support for bio-\n     energy-based initiatives. The funding level is the same as \n     what was provided last year and is comparable to what NFU had \n     requested in order to meet today's needs for farmers and \n     ranchers. The House proposal provides $5.5 billion.\n       ``We now urge the full Senate to quickly pass this much-\n     needed assistance package,'' Swenson added. ``It is vital \n     that the House/Senate conference committee fund this measure \n     at the Senate level. As we meet the challenge of crafting a \n     new agriculture policy for the future, today's needs for \n     assistance are still great. We hope for swift action to help \n     America's farmers and ranchers.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have another letter, dated today, from \nthe American Farm Bureau Federation:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The American Farm Bureau Federation \n     supports at least $5.5 billion in supplemental Agricultural \n     Market Transition Act payments and $500 million in market \n     loss assistance payments for oilseeds as part of the \n     emergency spending package for crop year 2001.\n\n  Our bill does that. Senator Lugar's amendment does not.\n  They state further:\n\n       We also believe it is imperative to offer assistance to \n     peanut, fruit and vegetable producers. In addition, it is \n     crucial to extend the dairy price support in this bill since \n     the current program will expire in less than two months.\n       All over this country agriculture has been facing historic \n     low prices and increasing production costs.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, dated today, from Mr. Bob \nStallman, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, be printed \nin the Record.\n  Again, I point out that our bill meets these needs. The House bill \ndoes not. Our bill provides the assistance to peanut, fruit, and \nvegetable producers, and we do, indeed, extend the dairy price support \nprogram beyond its expiration date in 2 months.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     American Farm\n\n\n                                            Bureau Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2001.\n     Hon.

Without this provision, any participating school \n     that received bonus commodities from the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture would have its entitlement commodities under the \n     NSLP reduced. As you know, this would result in a de facto \n     funding cut of between $50 million and $60 million for the \n     NSLP during school year 2001-02. Further, with an eye to \n     Conference, ASFSA does not support a block grant approach to \n     the distribution of commodities.\n       On behalf of ASFSA's members and the children we serve, \n     thank you again for your leadership on this important issue. \n     Please let me know if there is anything else we can do to \n     further S. 1246.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Marcia L. Smith,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, to sum up--and I will come back to this \nlater on--we looked at the Nation as a whole. We looked at all farmers \nin this country. All farmers need help, plus there are others in rural \ncommunities who need help. There are conservation programs, as was \npointed out by a letter I read from the 130 Members of the House, that \nneed to be continued beyond the end of this fiscal year. We addressed \nall of these needs, and we did it within the confines of the budget \nresolution.\n  Each Senator on that side of the aisle or on this side of the aisle \nwho is opposed to our bill could raise a point of order. But no point \nof order lies against this bill because it is within the budget \nresolution. Therefore, there is no reason for the President to veto it, \nunless he simply does not want our apple farmers to receive help, or to \nextend the dairy price support program, or to help some of our peanut \nand cottonseed farmers, and others who need this assistance, or perhaps \nhe doesn't think we should have a nutrition program.\n  Quite frankly, we have met our obligations to provide for the full \nAMTA payment for fiscal year 2001--the full AMTA payment. The House \nbill only provides 85 percent.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, if you want to provide the same level of \nassistance to farmers this year under AMTA as we did last year, you \ncannot support Senator Lugar's amendment. That will wipe it out and \nmake it only 85 percent, which is what the House bill does.\n  I hope after some more debate we can recognize that we have met our \nobligations in the Senate Agriculture Committee. This is the right \ncourse of action to take for this body and for the President to sign.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I want to yield to my friend, the \nSenator from Idaho, but first I wish to make a couple of remarks. One \nis that if you came in here and you were listening to the difficulty \nthat some talk about in getting this job done prior to the time the \n$5.5 billion disappears, then you would imagine the thing to do is to \ngo ahead and have a bill similar to the House. Then it would be there, \nand we would come back with the other $2 billion, which is in the \nbudget for next year. It isn't as if this is a long time off. It is \nright there, and it can be done. It isn't as if it isn't going to \nhappen. It will happen. We are taking out next year's and putting it in \nthis year. You can bet that there will be a request to replace that \nwith new money next year.\n  It is sort of an interesting debate. It is also interesting that the \nHouse version includes $4.6 billion in AMTA payments.\n  There was mention by the Senator from Michigan that it didn't go \nbeyond that. Actually, there is $424 million in economic assistance for \noilseeds; $54 million in economic assistance for peanut producers; $129 \nmillion for tobacco; $17 million for wool and mohair; $85 million for \ncottonseeds; and $26 million for specialty crops, which is for the \nStates to disperse. Over $3.5 million goes to Michigan which could go \nto apple growers. This idea that somehow the people have been left out \nis simply not the case.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this has been cleared with Senator Lugar, \nSenator Harkin, and both leaders.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 p.m. today I be \nrecognized to move to table Senator Lugar's amendment, and that the 15 \nminutes prior to that vote be equally divided between Senators Harkin \nand Lugar.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I think I will object simply to talk \nwith the others to see if they need more time. I hope they do not. But \nat this moment, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nyielding. I will be brief, for I have sat here most of the morning \nlistening to both the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Iowa \ndiscuss what is now pending.\n  There is no question in my mind--and any Senator from an agricultural \nState--that we are in a state of emergency with production agriculture \nin this country. I certainly respect all of the work that the chairman \nof the Senate Ag Committee has done, the authorizing committee. I no \nlonger serve on that committee, but my former chairman and ranking \nmember of the Ag Appropriations Committee is in this Chamber, and I \nserve on that committee. So I have the opportunity to look at both the \nauthorizing side and the appropriating side of this issue.\n  Clearly, I would like to hold us at or near where we were a year ago. \nAt the same time, I do not believe, as we struggle to write a new farm \nbill, that we should write massive or substantially new farm policy \ninto an appropriations bill that is known as an Emergency Agricultural \nAssistance Act. There is adequate time to debate critical issues as to \nhow we adjust and change agricultural policy in our country to fit new \nor changing needs within production agriculture.\n  I have been listening to, and I have read in detail, what the \nSenator, the chairman of the Ag Committee, has brought. You have heard \nthe ranking member, the Senator from Indiana, say he is not pleased \nwith what he is doing today. In fact, the amendment that he offered in \nthe committee--one that I could support probably more easily than I \ncould support the amendment he has offered in this Chamber today--is \nnot being offered for a very simple reason; it is a question of timing.\n  The chairman of the authorizing committee but a few moments ago said: \nIf we pass this bill today, we can conference tomorrow. We can go out \nand have it back to the floor by Thursday or Friday of this week.\n  I would think you could make a statement like that if the House and \nthe Senate were but a mile apart. We are not. We are 2,500 to 3,000 \nmiles apart at this moment. We are $2 billion apart on money. The \nchairman of the authorizing committee has just, in a few moments, \ndiscussed the substantial policy differences on which we are apart. And \nI am quite confident--I know this chairman; I have served on \nconferences with him; he is a tough negotiator; he is not going to give \nup easily, as will the House not give up easily on their positions, \nlargely because we are writing a farm bill separate from \nappropriations, as we should.\n  But both sides have spilled into the question of policy as it relates \nto these vehicles. What we are really talking about now, and what we \nshould be talking about now, are the dollars and cents that we can get \nto production agriculture before September 30 of this fiscal year.\n  I happen to be privileged to serve on leadership, and we are \nscratching our heads at this moment trying to figure out how we get \nthis done. How do we get the House and the Senate to conference, and \nthe conference report back to the House and the Senate to be voted on \nbefore we go into adjournment, and to the President's desk in a form \nthat he will sign?\n  I do not think the President is threatening at all. I think he is \nmaking a very matter-of-fact statement about keeping the Congress \ninside their budget so that we do not spill off on to Medicare money. \nWe have heard a great deal from the other side about the fact that we \nare spending the Medicare trust fund. But this morning we have not \nheard a peep about that as we spend about $2 billion more than the \nbudget allocates in the area of agriculture.\n  So for anyone to assume that getting these two vehicles--the House \nand the Senate bills--to conference, and creating a dynamic situation \nin which we can conference overnight and have this back before we \nadjourn on Friday or Saturday, to be passed by us and signed by the \nPresident, is, at best, wishful thinking.\n\n  We are going to have a letter from OMB in a few moments that very \nclearly states that this has to get done and has to get scored before \nthe end of the fiscal year or we lose the money.\n  The ranking member of the Ag Appropriations Committee, who is in this \nChamber, and certainly the chairman of the authorizing committee, do \nnot want that to happen, and neither does this Senator. In fact, I will \nmake extraordinary efforts not to have it happen because that truly \ncomplicates our budget situation well beyond what we would want it to \nbe, and it would restrict dramatically our ability to meet the needs of \nproduction agriculture across this country as we speak.\n  I am amazed that we are this far apart. The House acted a month ago. \nWe have been slow to act in the Senate. And now it is hurry up and \ncatch up at the very last minute prior to an adjournment for what has \nalways been a very important recess for the Congress.\n  I will come back to this Chamber this afternoon to talk about the \npolicy differences, but I think it is very important this morning to \nspell out the dynamics of just getting us where we need to get before \nwe adjourn, I hope, Friday evening late. And I am not sure we get there \nbecause we are so far apart.\n  The chairman talks about passing the bill this afternoon, assuming \nthat we would table the amendment of the Senator from Indiana; then \nthis would pass, forgetting there are other Senators in the Cloakrooms \nwaiting to come out and talk about an issue called dairy compacts, and \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact legislation or policy authority ending at \nthe end of September, with no train leaving town between now and then \nthat gets that out. And to assume that is going to be a simple debate \nthat will take but a few hours, I would suggest: How about a day or 2 \nto resolve what is a very contentious issue? I know I want to speak on \nit. I know a good many other Senators do. We do not want to see our \nNation divided up into marketing territories that you cannot enter and \nleave easily, as our commerce clause in the Constitution would suggest.\n  So those are some of the issues that are before us today and tomorrow \nand the next day. That means as long as we are in this Chamber debating \nthis bill on these very critical issues, it will not be in conference. \nAnd those very difficult policy issues and that $2 billion worth of \nspending authority will not get resolved where the differences lie.\n  So let us think reasonably and practically about our situation. The \nclock is ticking very loudly as it relates to our plan for adjournment \nand our need to get our work done, and done so in a timely fashion.\n  I do not criticize; I only observe because much of what the Senator \nfrom Iowa has talked about I would support. But I would support it in a \nnew farm bill properly worked out with the dynamics between the House \nand the Senate, not in appropriating legislation done in the last \nminute, to be conferenced in an all-night session, or two or three, to \nfind our differences, and to work them out. I am not sure we can get \nthere. If we can't, we lose $5.5 billion to production agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this morning I was very impressed by \nthe comments made by the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar.\n  At the markup session of our Committee on Agriculture, I had come to \nthat session with a compromise that I was prepared to offer because I \nthought it would more nearly reflect the programs Congress provided for \nemergency\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\nor economic assistance to farmers in the last two crop-years.\n  We had testimony in our Appropriations Committee from the chief \neconomist and other high-ranking officials at the Department of \nAgriculture that the situation facing farmers this year is very \nsimilar--just as bad--as it was last year and the year before. So the \nrecord supports the action being taken by the Congress to respond to \nthis serious economic problem facing agricultural producers around the \ncountry.\n  It was the Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee during the last 2 \nyears that had been given the responsibility, under the budget \nresolution, for writing this disaster or economic assistance program. \nAnd we did that. The Congress approved it. It was signed and enacted \ninto law. And the disbursements have been made.\n  This year the budget resolution gave the authority for implementing \nthe program for economic assistance to the legislative committee in the \nSenate, the Agriculture Committee. I also serve on that committee. The \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa chairs that committee, and Senator \nLugar is the ranking member and former chairman of that committee. I \nhave great respect for all of my fellow members on the committee, but I \nhave to say that arguments made this morning, and the proposal made \nthis morning at the beginning of the debate by Senator Lugar, to me, \nare right on target in terms of what our best opportunity is at this \ntime for providing needed assistance to agricultural producers.\n  The facts are that the House has acted and the administration has \nalso reviewed the situation and expressed its view. We have the letter \nsigned by Mitch Daniels, the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, setting forth the administration's view and intentions with \nrespect to legislation they will sign or recommend to be vetoed. If we \nare interested in helping farmers now, in providing funding for \ndistressed farmers to help pay loans from lenders, to get additional \nfinancing as may be needed, if that is our goal, then the best and \nclearest opportunity for providing that assistance is to take the \nadvice and suggestion of Senator Lugar and vote for the alternative he \nhas provided, which is the House-passed bill.\n  It obviates the need to conference with the House, to work out \ndifferences between the two approaches, which is necessarily going to \ndelay the process. To assume that that conference can be completed in 2 \nor 3 days and funds be disbursed in an appropriate and efficient way is \nwishful thinking. It is no better than wishful thinking. I do not think \nproducers would like to take that chance under the conditions of \ndistress that exist in agricultural communities all over this country \ntoday.\n  If we could take a poll now among those who would be the \nbeneficiaries of this legislation, I am convinced most would say: Let's \ntake the House bill now, use the budget authority for new farm bill \nprovisions that will strengthen our agricultural programs for the \nfuture, into the next crop year and beyond, so that we can guard \nagainst, in a more effective way, the distresses that confront farmers \ntoday. But for now, to deal with the emergency and the problems of \ntoday, let's pass a bill that will put money in the pockets of farmers.\n  That is the object, not to improve conservation programs which can be \ndone in the next farm bill. Of course, we are going to reauthorize \nthese conservation programs. But doing it with $1 billion gratuitously \nfrom the budget resolution that provides for economic assistance to \nfarmers, that is not direct economic assistance to farmers. That is an \nindirect benefit, of course, to agricultural producers and to society \nin general, but it is not money in the pockets of farmers, as the \nHouse-passed bill provides and as the Lugar alternative before the \nSenate today provides.\n  I had hoped there could be a way to provide exactly the same \nassistance we provided last year and the year before. I crafted an \namendment I was prepared to offer in the Senate Agriculture Committee \nthat would do just that.\n  My amendment would provide for $5.46 billion for market loss \nassistance to farmers. This is the same level of support farmers have \nreceived for the past 2 years. My amendment provides an additional $500 \nmillion for oilseed assistance, which is the same as last year, and $1 \nbillion for aquaculture and other specialty crops. This is a total \namount of $6.475 billion, and it represents approximately half of the \nAgriculture budget for both fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002 \ncombined.\n  The $7.5 billion reported in the bill by the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee contains nearly $1 billion for programs that do not provide \ndirect economic assistance to farmers. Why argue about that? Why argue \nabout that in conference and spend some amount of time delaying the \nbenefits that farmers need now?\n  My suggestion is, the best way to help farmers today is to pass the \nLugar substitute. It goes to the President, and he signs it. We can't \nwrite the President out of this process. He is involved in it. He has \ncommitted to veto the bill as reported by the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. Nine of us voted against it; 12 voted for it. But we are \nasking the Senate today to take another look realistically at the \noptions we have.\n  Let's not embrace what we would hope we could do. Let's embrace what \nwe know we can do. I don't care how many charts you put up here to show \nhow bad the situation is in agriculture, you are not going to change \nthe reality of the House action and the President's promised action.\n  We are part of the process and we have a role to play--right enough--\nand we can exercise our responsibilities when we rewrite the farm bill. \nIf there is an indication that additional assistance is needed later \non, we can take that from the budget resolution which provides for \neconomic assistance for farmers in the 2002 crop year. We can do that. \nWe don't have to solve every problem facing agriculture or conservation \non this bill today. We can do what we can do today, and farmers \nunderstand that. They don't fall for a lot of political grandstanding. \nThey don't spin all the charts that you can put up on the floor. That \ndoesn't help them a bit. They know how bad it is. What they want is \nhelp now. To get help now, let's vote for the Lugar substitute.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a section-by-section \nanalysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAmendment to the Emergency Agriculture Assistance Act of 2001--Section-\n                               by-Section\n\n\n                                Title I\n\n     Section 101--Market Loss Assistance\n       Supplemental income assistance to producers of cotton, \n     rice, wheat, and feedgrain producers eligible for a \n     Production Flexibility Contract payment at the 1999 AMTA \n     payment levels, totaling $5.466.\n     Section 102--Oilseeds\n       Provides $500 million for a supplemental market loss \n     assistance payment to oilseed producers totaling $500 \n     million.\n     Section 103--Peanuts\n       Provides peanut producers of quota and additional peanuts \n     with supplemental assistance of $56 million.\n     Section 104--Sugar\n       Suspends the marketing assessment from the 1996 Farm Bill \n     for the 2001 crop of sugar beets and sugar cane at a cost of \n     $44 million.\n     Section 105--Honey\n       Makes non-recourse loans available to producers of honey \n     for the 2001 crop year at a cost of $27 million.\n     Section 106--Wool and Mohair\n       Provides supplemental payments to wool and mohair producers \n     totaling $17 million.\n     Section 107--Cottonseed Assistance\n       Provides assistance to producers and first handlers of \n     cottonseed totaling $100 million.\n     Section 108--Specialty Crop Commodity Purchases\n       Provides $80 million to purchase specialty crops that \n     experienced low prices in the 2000 and 2001 crop years. $8 \n     million of the amount maybe used to cover transportation and \n     distribution costs.\n     Section 109--Loan Deficiency Payments\n       Allows producers who are not AMTA contract holders to \n     participate in the marketing assistance loan program for the \n     2001 crop year.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank Senator Cochran for his great \nstatement.\n  The question before the Senate is: do we want a reasonable package \nthat will help farmers now that is within our budget, that we set out \nfunds for, that can be delivered next week, or do we want a political \nissue that comes from a proposal which is full of provisions that have \nnothing to do with direct aid to farmers, that dramatically expands \nspending on programs that have nothing to do with an agriculture \nemergency, and a program that will almost--well, it will certainly be, \nsince the President has now issued the veto message--be vetoed?\n  Ultimately, people have to come down to reaching a conclusion in \nanswering that question.\n  What I would like to do today is make a few points. First, Senator \nCochran is right. If we want to get aid to Texas and Mississippi and \nIowa farmers next week, we need to pass the bill that passed the House \nor something very close to it. And passing the bill that passed the \nHouse, which can go directly to the President, which can be signed this \nweek, is the right thing to do.\n  The second issue has to do with non-emergency matters in an emergency \nappropriations bill. I could go down a long list, but let me mention a \nfew.\n  Changing the conservation reserve program: Maybe it needs to be \nchanged, but do we have to do it in an emergency bill where we are \ntrying to get assistance out the door by October 1? I think, clearly, \nwe do not.\n  Expanding a yet-to-be-implemented program about farmable wetlands: I \ndon't understand, in an emergency bill, expanding a program that has \nnever gone into effect. Maybe we will want to expand it after it goes \ninto effect, and we know what it is. But, A, I can't imagine we would \nwant to do it now, and, B, why would we want to clutter up an emergency \nfarm bill that desperately needs to become law this week or next by \ngetting in that debate here?\n  Expanding subsidies for paper reduction in lunch programs: Maybe we \nneed to increase subsidies for reducing the amount of paper that is \nexpended in serving school lunch programs. Maybe that is a worthy \nobjective. But why are we doing it on an emergency farm bill? I know of \nno critical shortage of paper in making plates and cups. So far as I am \naware, we are capable of producing virtually an infinite quantity, not \nthat that would be desirable public policy, but the point is, what does \nthis have to do with the emergency that exists on many farms and \nranches throughout America? The answer is nothing.\n\n  Additional funding for the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Pilot \nProgram: That may be a meritorious program. If I knew more about it, I \nmight think it was one of the most important nutrition programs in \nAmerica. On the other hand, maybe I would not think it is even \nmeritorious if I knew more about it. The point is not whether it is \nmeritorious or whether it is not; the point is, it has absolutely \nnothing to do with an emergency on farms and ranches all over America, \nand it has no place in an emergency farm bill.\n  Making cities eligible for rural loan programs and credits: I guess \nother things being the same, I do not think cities of 50,000 ought to \nqualify for programs that are aimed at helping rural America. I have a \nlot of cities of 50,000. Just looking at it, it does not strike me that \nthis is a great idea, but it may be a great idea. Maybe I just do not \nunderstand.\n  The point is, what does this have to do with the emergency that is \noccurring in bank loans that our farmers and ranchers all over America \nare having trouble paying? It has absolutely nothing to do with it, and \nit should not be in this bill.\n  There is an increase in funding bioenergy loan subsidy programs in \nthis bill. Maybe bioenergy should receive additional funding. Maybe it \nreceives too much funding. The point is, what does that have to do with \nan emergency in rural America? What does it have to do with farmers and \nranchers trying to make that payment on that loan at the local bank? It \nhas nothing to do with it, and it should not be in this bill.\n  Paying researchers at USDA beyond the civil service scale: I think \nhighly of researchers. Some of my best friends are researchers. I used \nto be a researcher. Maybe this is God's work, changing the Civil \nService Act to let researchers at the Department of Agriculture make \nmore money. The point is, should we not look at that in the context of \ncivil service? Shouldn't this be looked at by the committee that has \njurisdiction, the Governmental Affairs Committee? Isn't this something \non which we ought to have a fairly substantial debate? Are we going to \ndo this at all the labs in America? Are we going to do it at the \nDepartment of Energy? Are we going to do it in oceanography? Is this \nthe beginning of a major program?\n  No one knows the answer to this. I do not even know if a hearing ever \noccurred on this subject.\n  The point is, whether it is meritorious or not, what does it have to \ndo with this farmer in plain view making that payment at the bank? It \nbasically has to do with the pay of people who are fairly well paid. \nMaybe they are not paid enough.\n  This has absolutely nothing to do with the crisis in rural America. \nThis is something that ought to be dealt with next year.\n  This brings me to the second point I want to talk about, and that is \nthe $2 billion we are spending in this bill above the amount we said we \nwere going to spend in the budget.\n  I have sat in the Budget Committee and I have sat in this Chamber and \nhave heard endless harangues about how we are about to spend the \nMedicare trust fund--how dare we spend the Medicare trust fund.\n  My response has been, there is not a Medicare trust fund. We are \nrunning a surplus in Part A, we are running a deficit in Part B, and so \nthere is no surplus, but that is not the point. The chairman of the \nBudget Committee has given us endless orations pleading that we not \nspend the Medicare trust fund, much less the Social Security trust \nfund. In fact, in committee and in the Senate Chamber, he and others \nhave endlessly harangued about not spending these trust funds. Yet I \nhear no harangue today.\n\n  We are in the process today of considering a bill that is $2 billion \nabove the amount we included in the budget to spend in fiscal year 2001 \nfor the agriculture emergency--$2 billion above the amount we have in \nthe budget.\n  Having harangued endlessly about every penny we spend, every penny we \ngive back to the taxpayer in tax cuts is imperiling the Medicare trust \nfund, where is Senator Conrad today? When we are in the process of \nadding $2 billion of spending above the budget, does anybody doubt that \nwhen the re-estimate comes back in August, when the new projections of \nthe surplus come forward, given the economy has slowed down, does \nanybody doubt this $2 billion will come out of exactly the same\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\nMedicare trust fund about which we have heard endless harangues? Does \nanybody doubt that?\n  No, they do not doubt it, but where are the harangues today? Those \nharangues were on another day focused on another subject. The harangues \nwere against tax cuts, but when it is spending, there are no harangues.\n  Lest anybody be confused, I do know something about the Budget \nCommittee, having been privileged to serve on that committee in the \nHouse and the Senate. I understand the rules. Basically, the budget is \nwhatever the chairman of the Budget Committee says the budget is.\n  We have before us a bill that is $2 billion above the amount we wrote \nin the budget for fiscal year 2001, but the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee says it is okay to take $2 billion from 2002 and spend it in \n2001 because in 2003, we can take the same $2 billion and spend it in \n2002. Actually, we cannot. If he reads his own budget, he will see that \nin 2003, unless we have a sufficient surplus so that all funds are \ngoing into the Medicare trust fund and the Social Security trust fund \nand reducing debt or being invested, we will not be able to make the \nshift from 2003 to 2002.\n  One can say, as Senator Conrad did yesterday, that he makes the \ndetermination in advising the Parliamentarian that this does not have a \nbudget point of order. So by definition, if he says it does not have a \nbudget point of order, it does not have a budget point of order, but \ndoes anybody doubt it violates the budget?\n  We wrote in the budget $5.5 billion, black and white, clear as it can \nbe clear, that is how much we were going to spend. Now we are spending \n$7.5 billion, but it does not bust the budget? Why doesn't it bust the \nbudget? Because the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, \nadvises the Parliamentarian that it does not bust the budget. He is the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, so how can it bust the budget when he \nsays it does not bust the budget?\n  The pattern is pretty clear. Senator Conrad is deeply concerned--\ndeeply concerned--about spending these trust funds as long as the money \nis going for tax cuts, but the first time we bring to the Chamber an \nappropriation that clearly busts our budget, that spends $2 billion \nmore than we wrote in the budget, that is all right because Senator \nConrad said it is all right. He said it does not bust the budget \nbecause we are going to take the $2 billion from next year.\n  If that creates a problem in writing the farm bill, I say to three \nMembers who will be very much involved in writing the farm bill, \nSenator Conrad has the solution: It is no problem, just take the $2 \nbillion from 2003. There will be a problem, as I pointed out.\n  Basically what we have before us is an effort to take $2 billion and \nto spend most of it on non-emergency programs that do not affect \ndirectly the well-being of farmers who are in crisis today in a clear \naction that busts the budget.\n  I want to say this, not to go on so long as to be mean or hateful \nabout it. I do not mind being lectured. I get lectured all the time. I \nguess I am about as guilty as any Member of the Senate in lecturing my \ncolleagues. It comes from my background where I used to lecture 50 \nminutes Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and an hour and 15 minutes on \nTuesday and Thursday. My students paid attention because they wanted to \npass.\n\n  Here is the point: I don't see how any Member of the Senate who \nstands idly by and watches us spend $2 billion more than we pledged in \nthe 2001 budget that we were going to spend on this bill, how that \nMember can remain silent or support that effort and have any \ncredibility ever again when they talk about concern over deficits or \nspending trust funds.\n  Ultimately, the debate is: Is it words or is it deeds? Are you really \nprotecting the budget when we are on the floor spending $2 billion more \nthan we said we were going to spend in the budget?\n  It seems to me if you vote for this $7.5 billion appropriation--it is \nan entitlement program and an authorization, in addition to the $7.5 \nbillion--if Members vote for this $7.5 billion spending bill, which \nviolates that budget by spending $2 billion more than we committed to, \nyou cannot ever, it seems to me, have any credibility again in arguing \nyou are concerned about the deficit or that you are concerned about \nspending the Medicare or Social Security trust fund.\n  There is no question when the August re-estimates come in, this $2 \nbillion is going to come right out of the Medicare trust fund. We will \nhave a vote. If Members want to live up to the rhetoric in saying we \ndon't want to spend that trust fund, and we don't want to bust the \nbudget, Members can vote for the Lugar amendment because it has three \nbig advantages: First, it will become law this week, the President will \nsign it; and, second, it doesn't bust the budget. Third, it doesn't \ntake money out of the Medicare trust fund.\n  I think every argument that can be made that should carry any weight \nin this debate is an argument for the Lugar amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues not to get into an argument that will delay the assistance \nto our farmers and ranchers. We are going to debate a farm bill in the \nnext fiscal year. I don't know whether we will pass one or not. We are \ngoing to debate one. Why start the debate by taking $2 billion we have \nto finance a new farm bill and spend it now on non-emergency items, by \nand large? Why not live within the budget today, get a bill to the \nPresident that he can sign, let him sign it this week, and let the \nmoney next week go out to help farmers and ranchers.\n  In the next fiscal year, after October 1, we can debate a new farm \nbill. It is at that point that many of these issues need to be decided.\n  If Members do not want to bust the budget and Members want this bill \nto become law, and become law soon, vote for the Lugar amendment. I \nintend to vote for the Lugar amendment. I intend to oppose the \nunderlying bill. It violates the budget. It spends $2 billion more than \nwe pledged to limit spending in the budget. I intend to resist it as \nhard as I can. I think it sends a terrible signal that here we are, \ndespite all our high-handed speech about spending trust funds and \nliving within the budget, and we come to the first popular program that \nwe voted on and now we are busting the budget by 40 percent. Forty \npercent of the funds in the bill before the Senate represents an \nincrease in spending over the budget that we adopted. That is a \nmistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Lugar substitute. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am surprised to hear the Senator from \nTexas talk about how this does not comport with the budget resolution. \nThe Senator from Texas is a member of the Budget Committee. The Senator \nfrom Texas must know full well the budget allows $5.5 billion for the \nAgriculture Committee to expend in fiscal year 2001. The Budget \nCommittee also gave instructions to the Agriculture Committee that the \nAgriculture Committee could expend up to $7.35 billion in fiscal year \n2002.\n  The reason that a point of order does not lie against this bill is \nnot because of what the Budget Committee chairman said but because of \nthe way the budget was written and adopted by the Senate when under the \ncontrol, I might add, of my friends on the Republican side. I didn't \nhear the Senator from Texas say at that time when the budget was \nadopted we shouldn't be doing this--that we should only adopt $5.5 \nbillion for 2001 and nothing for 2002. I didn't hear the Senator from \nTexas at the time the budget was adopted get up and rail against that.\n  So there it is. We have it in the budget that this committee is \nauthorized to expend up to $7.35 billion in fiscal year 2002.\n  I say to my friend from Texas, we didn't do that. We didn't expend \n$7.35 billion; we expended about $2 billion of that $7.35 billion that \nwill be spent in fiscal year 2002.\n  The Senator from Texas surely knows we are not spending any 2002 \nmoney in 2001. We are spending 2001 money prior to September 30, but \nthe other $2 billion, about, is spent after October 1, which is in \nfiscal year 2002 and is allowed under the budget agreement adopted by \nthe House and the Senate.\n  I didn't hear the Senator taking issue at that when the budget was \nadopted. We are only doing what is within our authority to do.\n  Again, the Senator from Texas also went on at some length to read \nabout\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\nsome of the programs in the bill. I refer to last year's bill when we \npassed emergency assistance. There was a lot of extraneous stuff put in \nthere because it was felt it was needed.\n  Carbon cycle research was in last year's bill; tobacco research for \nmedicinal purposes; emergency loans for seed producers; water systems \nfor rural and native villages in Alaska; there is the Bioinformatics \nInstitute for Model Plant Species in last year's ``emergency'' bill, \nalong with crop insurance and everything else.\n  I point out to my friend from Texas, there are no new programs in \nthis bill, not one. In last year's bill there was a new program put in \nthat probably, I suppose, we could have said should not have gone in \nthe farm bill, but I thought it was reasonable and it was put in at \nthat time on a soil and water conservation assistance program which was \na brand-new program included in the emergency bill last year. I did not \nhear last year the Senator from Texas getting up and saying that the \nemergency bill should not include those. He is saying that this year.\n  Again, we made no changes, and we made no policy changes. There is \none technical correction included, and I had to smile when I heard the \nSenator talk about the paperwork reduction in the school nutrition \nprogram. Actually, that was requested by the House Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce. They actually requested we do that to take \ncare of a problem in paperwork. We said it sounds reasonable. We might \nas well do it. Why not take care of it?\n\n  Again, there are no new programs, no new changes. All there is is one \ntechnical change in the CRP program, but in last year's emergency \npackage there were a number of technical fixes and changes. There were \nnew programs, as I pointed out. There were changes in eligibility. All \nthat was done. We do not do that, basically, in this bill. There are no \nnew conservation programs. All we are doing is funding the ones that \nare out of money.\n  I do want to at least address myself very briefly to another issue. I \nheard some of my friends on the other side say: Yes, we do have a dire \nsituation in agriculture; yes, farmers are hurting; yes, it has not \ngotten any better since last year. But because Mr. Daniels, the head of \nOMB, has said he would recommend a veto, we can't meet the needs of \nfarmers out there.\n  I ask my colleagues, who knows agriculture better, Mr. Daniels or the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation? Who knows agriculture better, the \nNational Corn Growers Association or Mr. Daniels? Who knows agriculture \nbetter, the National Farmers Union or Mr. Daniels? Who knows \nagriculture and their needs better, the National Wheat Growers \nAssociation or Mr. Daniels at OMB?\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle who understand \nthat we have some real unmet needs out there, we really have some \nfarmers all across America who are hurting, as we have heard from all \nof their representatives. I say to them: Call on the President. Don't \nlet Mr. Daniels speak for you. I say to my friends who understand \nagriculture, who understand the needs out there: Call up President Bush \nand say we need this package.\n  I have heard Senators on the other side--not all of them, but I have \nheard some of them say we need this assistance; we need the kind of \nmoney we are talking about; but because there has been a threat of a \nveto, we cannot do it.\n  I daresay that if Senators who hold that view were to call up the \nPresident and say: Mr. Daniels is wrong on this; we need this money; \nfarmers desperately need it, I, quite frankly, believe the President \nwould listen to the Senators here who represent agricultural States \nrather than Mr. Daniels.\n  I don't know what Mr. Daniels' background is. I don't know if he is a \nfarmer, if he comes from a farm or not. I don't know, but I don't think \nhe understands what is happening there in agriculture.\n  Last, there was a statement\nmade--I wrote it down--``political grandstanding.'' I resent the \nimplication that what we are doing is political grandstanding. We took \na lot of care and time to talk with Senators on both sides of the \naisle. I talked with Representatives in the House of Representatives. \nWe met with farm groups to try to fashion a bill that did two things: \nIt met the requirements of the Budget Act and, second, met the needs \nfarmers have out there.\n  I really resent any implication that there is political \ngrandstanding. We may have a difference of opinion on what is needed \nout there. I can grant there may be some differences of opinion on \nthat. But that is why we have debates. That is why we have votes. But \nin no way is this political grandstanding. This is what many of us, I \nthink on both sides of the aisle, believe is desperately needed in \nrural America.\n  Since it is desperately needed, I hope my friends on the other side \nof the aisle will contact the President and tell him this is one time \nhe needs to not listen to the advice of Mr. Daniels but to listen to \nthe advice of our American farmers, their Representatives here in \nWashington, and the Senators who represent those farm States.\n  I yield the floor. I see my friend from Nebraska is waiting to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before you recognize the Senator from \nNebraska, I have a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be recognized to move to table Senator Lugar's amendment at 3 \no'clock this afternoon and the 45 minutes prior to that vote, after our \nconferences, be equally divided between Senators Harkin and Lugar, and \nthat no other amendments be in order prior to that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise in support of this \nlegislation, S. 1246, and in opposition to the amendment offered by my \ngood friend, Senator Lugar. I know he is attempting to do what he \nthinks is best. That is what this honest debate should be about--what \nis best for American agriculture and how we can best meet those needs.\n  I notice my good friend, Senator Cochran from Mississippi, has a view \nthat is a little different from that of Senator Lugar in that he had \nprepared an amendment of about $6.5 billion but is supporting Senator \nLugar in his effort at $5.5 billion. But it points out that there are \nhonest differences of opinion, even on the other side.\n  The reason I support S. 1246 is that it is a balanced bill and one \nthat takes into account the diversity of agricultural interests all \nover this country. It recognizes that the major commodities are in \ntheir fourth year of collapsed prices, yet at the same time recognizes \nthat economic assistance cannot and should not go just to program \ncrops, it must reach further, to add additional farmers who are \nsuffering and who do not happen to grow wheat, corn, or rice.\n  On a parochial level, the bill before us holds several provisions \nthat are important to Nebraskans. It is no exaggeration to say that \nagriculture is the backbone of Nebraska's economy, for one of every \nfour Nebraskans depends on agriculture for employment. It has been an \nongoing source of concern for me that when the rest of our economy was \nbooming, production agriculture was on the decline.\n  As do other Senators, I regret having to supplement our farm policy \nwith billions of dollars of additional emergency assistance every year. \nSo it is, in fact, high time to move on with the writing of a new farm \nbill for just that reason.\n\n  But until then, we have to be here to help those who produce food, \nwho feed our Nation. This bill does that. This bill provides for an \nadditional AMTA, or Freedom to Farm payment, at the full $5.5 billion \nlevel, which is what producers in Nebraska want. It is what producers \nall across our country want and what they expect us to provide. The \nbill passed by the House does not do so, and any package that spends \njust $5.5 billion cannot do so. I believe that is unacceptable.\n  This bill provides for assistance for oilseeds, which are not a \nprogram crop. It suspends the assessment on sugar, which is critical to \nthe beleaguered sugar beet growers of western Nebraska and other parts \nof our country. And it beefs up and in some cases reinstates spending \nfor vital conservation programs, all of which face long-term\n\n[[Page S8422]]\n\nand growing backlogs and many of which would expire if not extended by \nthis bill and were left for a farm bill later this year or next year.\n  In some cases my good friend from Texas points out some programs that \ndo not, I suspect, seem to be quite as much of an emergency. But I \nthink the good Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, answered that and said \nthat in every emergency bill you might question the urgency or \nemergency of certain aspects of it but we ought not to let that get in \nthe way of passing a bill that deals with emergency needs.\n  This bill also offers eligibility for LDP payments to producers who \nare not enrolled in the current farm program, a provision which I \nstrongly support and which makes an enormous difference for the small \nnumber of producers who need this provision. In fact, Senator Grassley \nand I introduced legislation to this effect earlier this year and I am \ngrateful to Chairman Harkin for including this provision. This morning \nI received a call from a constituent about this issue. So, for those \nwho are eligible, there is no more important provision in this bill.\n  Finally, I commend the chairman for including funding for value-added \ndevelopment grants. This program was first funded last year, and it has \nbeen very popular in Nebraska. In fact, I know we have several grant \nrequests under preparation for this funding, including one for a \nproducer-owned pork processing and marketing facility. This is exactly \nthe kind of program that we all talk about and want to encourage.\n\n  I am happy to support this package and know it will find wide support \nin Nebraska from farm groups and from farmers all over our State and \nour country.\n  It is beyond me why some Senators and the administration are so \nstaunchly opposed to this bill. In fact, it provides a payment for a \nsingle crop year but stretching over two fiscal years, and it is within \nthe budget constraints.\n  I can't find a way to explain to Nebraskans when prices are no better \nthan last year's why the assistance provided by Congress should be cut. \nI can't find a way, and I don't intend to try to find a way to explain \nthat. It just simply won't sell.\n  The Director of OMB suggested in his letter that the spending should \ndecrease because farm income is up. That certainly may be true for our \ncattle producers. But this assistance flows primarily to row crop \nproducers and others who are not enjoying such good fortune. How can I \nexplain to my constituent who called this morning saying that he \nqualified for LDPs on his farm last year but he doesn't merit any \nassistance this year?\n  My point is that the tunnel vision approach that we must spend \nexactly and only $5.5 billion ignores an awful lot of needs in each and \nevery one of our States.\n  I am not willing to say that the needs of producers who grow corn in \nNebraska are more important than those who grow chickpeas or to the \ndedicated hog producers who are working diligently to process and \nmarket their own pork that we can't find a way to afford the value-\nadded loan program that offers them their best chance to get off the \nground. How can I say to them that they will have to wait for the farm \nbill and maybe there will be funding available after that?\n  This bill before us attempts to balance the needs across commodities \nand across the country. I think it is a great effort. I hope we can \nconvince the House of its merits.\n  There was a statement that some of the payments will be direct but \nsome will be indirect, as though there is some distinction there of any \nimportance. The fact that we are able to get direct and indirect money \ninto the pockets of farmers today is what this is about. That is what \nthe emergency requires, and that is what this bill does.\n  As a fiscal conservative, I want to economize but not at the expense \nof America's farmers. I support this bill because I think it, in fact, \nwill do what we need to do for agriculture on an emergency basis and \ngive us the opportunity in a more lengthy period of time to come to the \nconclusion about what the ongoing farm bill should be and do that not \non an emergency basis but on a long-term basis and a multiyear basis.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska. I \nassociate myself with all of Senator Nelson's remarks.\n  I can't wait to write a new farm bill. I jumped on this Agriculture \nCommittee when there was an opening because I have hated this ``freedom \nto fail'' bill. We have had a dramatic decline in farm prices and farm \nincome.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for this emergency package. I rise to \nspeak on the floor to strongly support what our committee has reported \nout to the Senate.\n  Let me say at the very beginning that I don't like the AMTA payment \nmechanism. I am disappointed that we have to continue to do it this \nway.\n  From the GAO to what farmers know in Minnesota and around the \ncountry, a lot of these AMTA payments have amounted to a subsidy and \ninverse relationship to need. The vast amount of the actual payments to \nfarmers to keep them going goes to the really large operations and the \nmid-sized and smaller farmers do not get their fair share.\n  I also believe that a lot of younger farmers who were hurt by the low \nproportion of payments that go to them are also hurt as younger \nfarmers. We need more younger farmers.\n  I believe all of this should be changed. The Senator from Iowa knows \nthat. But I also think we have to get the payments out to people.\n  Let me say to colleagues that I am not prepared to go back to \nMinnesota and say to people in farm country that we didn't have the \nmoney to provide the assistance to you.\n  I think it is a shame that people are so dependent on the Government. \nPeople hate it. What they want is some power or some leverage to get a \ndecent price in the marketplace. I believe in this farm bill that we \nare writing in the Senate Agriculture Committee. We should do so. I \nalso believe that there should be a strong effort in the conservation \npart of this legislation.\n  I think there ought to be a section that deals with energy, and there \nought to be a section dealing with competition. We ought to be talking \nabout put putting more competition into the food industry.\n  I am becoming conservative these days in the Senate because I want to \nput more free enterprise into the free enterprise system. I want to see \nus take antitrust seriously. I want to see us go after some of these \nconglomerates that are muscling their way to the dinner tables and \nforcing family farmers out--and, by the way, very much to the detriment \nof consumers.\n  This emergency package has some very strong features. First of all, \nthank goodness, this is an emphasis on conservation and conserving our \nnatural resources. From the CRP Program, to the Wetland Reserve \nProgram, to Environmental Quality Incentive Programs, we are talking \nabout programs that need the additional funding. We are talking about \nprograms that are win-win-win: win for the farmers, win for Pheasants \nForever, win for Ducks Unlimited, some of the best environmental \norganizations you could ever run across; a win for consumers; and a win \nfor the environment.\n  Our Catholic bishop wrote a statement about 15 years ago entitled \n``Strangers and Guests.'' He said we are all but strangers and guests \nin this land. They were looking at soil erosion and chemical runoff \ninto the water.\n  The focus on conservation in this emergency package is just a \nharbinger of the direction we are going to go because this next farm \nbill is going to focus on land stewardship, on preserving our natural \nresources, on conservation, and on a decent price for family farmers as \nopposed to these conglomerates.\n\n  I believe what we have in this emergency package is extremely \nimportant. I thank my colleague from Iowa for an extension of the Dairy \nPrice Support Program. It is important to dairy farmers in Minnesota \nand throughout the country. The program was due to expire this year. At \nleast it is an effort to stabilize these mad fluctuations in price.\n  If you have a lot of capital, it is fine if you go from $13.20 per \nhundredweight to $9 per hundredweight. But if you do not have the \ncapital and the big bucks, you are going to go under.\n  I think it is important to have that.\n  I thank my colleagues. The growers in the Southern Minnesota Sugar \nBeet\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\nCooperative are going to receive benefits under the 2000 crop \nassistance program through this legislation. These are sugar beet \ngrowers of southern Minnesota who suffered because of a freeze in the \nfields last fall. They tried to process the beets. They tried to do \ntheir best. They couldn't make the money off of it. Frankly, without \nthe assistance in this package, they wouldn't have any future at all.\n  Again, what is an emergency? From my point of view, if you can get \nsome benefits to people who find themselves in dire economic \ncircumstances through no fault of their own, and you can make sure that \nthey can continue to survive today so that they can farm tomorrow, then \nyou are doing what you should do.\n  That is what this package is all about. I fully support it.\n  As much as I like my colleague from Indiana and as much as I think he \nis one of the best Senators in the Senate, I cannot support his \nsubstitute amendment.\n  I hope we will have strong support on the floor of the Senate for \nthis package of emergency assistance that comes to the Senate from the \nSenate Agriculture Committee.\n  By the way, we need to move on this matter. We need to get this \nassistance out to farmers. We don't need to delay and delay because \nthen we are playing with people's lives in a very unfortunate way. We \nreally are. This is the time for Senators to have amendments, as \nSenator Lugar has. This is a time for Senators to disagree. That is \ntheir honest viewpoint. But it is not a time to drag this on and on so \nthat we can't get benefits out to people who without these benefits are \nnot going to have any future at all. We cannot let that happen. We \ncannot do that to farmers in this country.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8423-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous agreement, the time until 3 \no'clock is evenly divided between Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin, I yield 4 \nminutes to the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Presiding Officer and my colleague, and I \nthank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee for this time as well.\n  Mr. President, I want to address, just briefly, the statements that \nwere made by the Senator from Texas about whether or not this bill--the \nunderlying bill; not the amendment by the Senator from Indiana but the \nunderlying bill--violates the budget, whether it busts the budget.\n  I think it is very clear that the bill brought out of the Agriculture \nCommittee by the chairman, Senator Harkin, does not violate the budget \nin any way. The budget provided $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2001 to the \nAgriculture Committee for this legislation and provided an additional \n$7.35 billion in fiscal year 2002 for additional legislation to assist \nfarmers at this time of need.\n  The bill that is in the assistance package provides $5.5 billion in \n2001 and provides $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2002. It clearly does not \nviolate the budget in any way. It does not bust the budget. It is \nentirely in keeping with the budget.\n  I just challenge the Senator from Texas, if he really believes this \nviolates the budget, to come out here and bring a budget point of \norder. That is what you do if you believe that a bill violates the \nbudget, that it busts the budget. Let's see what the Parliamentarian \nhas to say. We know full well what the Parliamentarian would say. They \nwould rule that there is no budget point of order against this bill \nbecause it is entirely within the budget allocations that have been \nmade to the Agriculture Committee.\n  This notion of whether or not you can use years of funding in 1 year \nand in the second year is addressed very clearly in the language of the \nbudget resolution itself. It says:\n\n       It is assumed that the additional funds for 2001 and 2002 \n     will address low income concerns in the agriculture sector \n     today.\n\n  These funds were available to be used in 2001, in 2002, in \nlegislation today. It goes on to say:\n\n       Fiscal year 2003 monies may be made available for 2002 crop \n     year support . . .\n\n  Understanding the difference between a fiscal year and a crop-year.\n  The fact is, every disaster bill we have passed in the last 3 years \nhas used money in two fiscal years because the Federal fiscal year ends \nat the end of September and yet we know that a disaster that affects a \ncrop affects not only the time up until the end of September but also \naffects the harvest in October and the marketing of a crop that occurs \nat that time. So always two fiscal years are affected.\n  Finally, the Senator from Texas said that this will raid the Medicare \ntrust fund.\n  No, it will not. We are not at a point that we are using Medicare \ntrust fund money. We are not even close to it at this point. I believe \nby the end of this year we will be using Medicare trust fund money to \nfund other Government programs. I have said that. I warned about it at \nthe time the budget was considered. I warned about it during the tax \nbill debate. It is very clear that is going to happen, not just this \nyear; it is going to happen in 2002, 2003, and 2004. And in fact we are \neven going to be close to using Social Security trust fund money in \n2003.\n  This is not about that. This is about 2001. This is about 2002. In \nthis cycle, this part of the cycle, we are nowhere close to using \nMedicare trust fund money. I would like the record to be clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas. How much time does the Senator require?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished ranking member, and former \nchairman, for yielding me the time. I ask for 15 minutes if I might. If \nI get into a problem, maybe a minute or two.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby the distinguished former chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Lugar. I know agriculture program policy is somewhat of a high-\nglaze topic to many of my colleagues. I know many ask questions as to \nthe details and the vagaries of farm programs, why we seemingly always \nconsider for days on end every year emergency farm legislation and \nAgriculture appropriations, what we now call supplemental Agriculture \nbills.\n  In the ``why and hows come'' department, let me recommend to my \ncolleagues yesterday's and today's proceedings and in particular \nSenator Lugar's remarks with regard to this bill and, more importantly, \nthe overall situation that now faces American agriculture and farm \nprogram policy. It is a fair and accurate summary that the ranking \nmember has presented. In typical Dick Lugar fashion, the Senator from \nIndiana has summed up the situation very well. If you want a 15-minute \nprimer in regards to agriculture program policy, simply read the \nSenator's remarks.\n  Why are we here? Why are we considering this legislation? The title \nof this legislation is the Emergency Agriculture Assistance Act of \n2001. The name implies to me that the bill is to fund pressing economic \nneeds in farm country. We have them. That is what\n\n[[Page S8424]]\n\nthe committee actually set out to do. In the debate, we have heard a \ngreat deal about how much is enough to address the problems in farm \ncountry. And certainly with the committee's mark, some $2 billion over \nwhat was agreed to in the budget and with the possibility of a \nPresidential veto, that debate is absolutely crucial.\n  I don't believe any agriculture Senator is looking forward to a \npossible Presidential veto--I hope not--or agriculture becoming a \nposter child in regards to out-of-control spending, porkbarrel add-ons, \nor eating into the Medicare trust fund or, for that matter, Social \nSecurity.\n  It seems to me we ought to stop for a minute and ask: Why are we \nhaving these problems to begin with? For the third year in a row \nfarmers, ranchers, and everybody else dependent on agriculture have \nbeen trying to make ends meet in the midst of a world commodity price \ndepression, not just in the United States but the entire world.\n  There are many reasons for this: unprecedented record worldwide \ncrops; the Asian and South American economic flu crippling our exports; \nthe value of the American dollar, again crippling our exports; and my \npersonal view, the lack of an aggressive and consistent export policy, \nhighlighted, quite frankly, by the inaction in this Congress with \nregard to sanctions reform and Presidential Trade Authority (PTA).\n  If you have in the past exported one-third to one-half of the crops \nyou produce and you experience 3 straight years of declining exports \nand increased world production, not to mention what many of us consider \nunfair trading practices by our competitors, you begin to understand \nwhy the market prices are where they are. Add in very little progress \never since the Seattle round in regards to the World Trade \nOrganization, and you can understand why we have a problem.\n  Now what are we going to do about this? To address this problem, when \nthis year's budget resolution was passed, it included $5.5 billion for \nspending in 2001 and $7.35 billion in 2002, with total funding of $73.5 \nbillion for 2002 through 2011. I might add, if you add in the baseline \nfor agriculture, you are talking about another $90 billion. That is a \ntremendous investment, to say the least.\n  When we passed the budget, the assumption among virtually all of us, \nand all of our farm groups and all of our commodity organizations, was \nthat the funding for 2002--not 2001, the funding for 2002 would be used \nfor one of two things: An agricultural assistance package in 2002, if \nneeded, or funding for the first year of the next farm bill.\n  We should make it very clear to our colleagues, our farmers and \nranchers, our conservation and wildlife organizations, our small towns \nand cities--we are borrowing from the future when we have $7.5 billion \nin this package. I don't know if it violates the budget agreement or \nnot. I don't know what the Parliamentarian would say. Regardless, the \npool of money available for writing the next farm bill has just shrunk \nby $2 billion. We are robbing next year's funds for this year's \nemergency bill.\n  We are going to be left with less than $5.5 billion in 2002 funding. \nAre we prepared to take that step? Apparently some are.\n  There are always disagreements on the Agriculture Committee. But I \nthink the Agriculture Committee is probably the least partisan \ncommittee, or one of the least, in the Congress. Certainly in the \nSenate, we have always tried to work in a bipartisan manner. In fact, \nthat is how former Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and I operated when \nwe wrote and passed crop insurance reform in the last Congress with the \nleadership and the able assistance of the chairman and the ranking \nmember. With all due respect, that has not happened on this \nlegislation.\n  We were given very short notice on the components of the package, the \nmarkup itself. When we actually arrived at markup, the legislation was \nnot the same language our staff was provided the night before. I will \nnot dwell on that, but it is most unfortunate. It is a harbinger of \nwhat I hope will not happen in regards to the farm bill debate.\n  Furthermore, I am deeply troubled that the title of this legislation \nis the Emergency Agricultural Assistance Act of 2001. The name implies \nthat the bill is to fund pressing economic and income needs in farm \ncountry. That is not what we have before us with this proposal.\n  In fact, I am deeply concerned that we are providing funding here for \nseveral commodities that are actually at or above their long-term \naverage prices and returns, while also making many programmatic \nchanges. We are doing a mini farm bill.\n  I want to serve warning. I do not argue that commodities, other than \nthe program crops, have not faced difficult times. Indeed, many have \nbeen in rough times. But let's make it very clear that the program \ncommodities, those that are usually receiving the AMTA payments, the \nmarket loss payments, have stringent requirements that many, if not \nall, specialty crops do not have to meet in order to be eligible for \npayments.\n  Chief among these is conservation compliance. To receive assistance, \na program crop producer has to meet very stringent requirements on \nconservation compliance. In many instances they have spent thousands of \ndollars to meet and maintain these requirements--good for them, good \nfor their farming, and good for the environment.\n  Today I put colleagues on notice that if we intend to continue making \npayments to commodities that do not meet these requirements, I will \npropose they have to meet the same guidelines as producers of wheat, \ncorn, cotton, rice, and soybeans to receive their payments. I thought \nabout introducing an amendment on this legislation. That would just \ndelay it further and get us into more debate, and I consider it an item \nfor the Farm Bill debate. Time is of the essence, so I will not do \nthat. I do mean to offer or at least consider it when we debate the \nfarm bill. It isn't so much a warning. It is just a suggestion that \nfair is fair. All commodities should be treated equally in their \nrequirements to receive payments through the Department of Agriculture.\n  Let us also remember exactly why we set aside the $5.5 billion for \nthe purpose in the budget. The $5.5 billion is equal to the market loss \nassistance payment we provided last year, and it was to address \ncontinued income and price problems with these crops.\n  What am I talking about? Wheat, 57 cents to 67 cents below the 12-\nyear average. That is about a 20-percent drop below the 12-year \naverage. That is the plight of the wheat producer. Cotton, 7.65 cents \nbelow the 12-year average, about 12.5 percent below the 12-year \naverage. Rice, same situation, even worse--about 27 percent below the \n12-year average, $2.02 per hundredweight below the 12-year average of \n$7.52 per hundred weight. Corn, 47 cents below the 12-year average; 21 \npercent below the average price. It is the same thing for soybeans, 26 \npercent below the average price.\n  In regard to these problems in farm country, I believe we will \ncontinue to stand and face the same problems, regardless of what farm \nbill we put in place, if we do not get cracking on selling our product \nand having a consistent, regular, predictable, and aggressive export \nprogram.\n  The real emergency bill, as far as I am concerned, other than this \none, is passing a clean bill to grant the President trade promotion \nauthority--the acronym for that is the TPA--and obtaining real \nsanctions reform.\n  The distinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator Lugar, has \nhad a comprehensive sanctions reform bill proposed for as long as I \nhave had the privilege of being in the Senate. I do not argue that \ntrade will solve all of our problems. It will certainly help.\n  In 1996--this is one of the reasons we are here--ag exports were over \n$60 billion, almost hit $61 billion. Last year, ag exports were only \n$51 billion. Just subtract the difference. It is not a one-for-one \ncost, but one can see $50 billion and $61 billion, not selling the \nproduct. That is roughly about the same amount we are sending out in \nsubsidies the past two or three years. That seems to indicate we should \npress ahead in an emergency fashion in regards to our trade policies as \nwell.\n  Since 1994, when the trade authority expired, there have been \napproximately 130 bilateral agreements negotiated around the world. We \nhave been involved in two of them. We cannot sell\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\nthe product in regards to that. It is very difficult to compete in the \nworld market when our negotiators cannot get other countries to sit \ndown at the table.\n  I am a little disturbed and very concerned in regards to the lack of \nreal blood pressure to move ahead on this legislation from the other \nside of the aisle. I am getting the word that trade authority for the \nPresident might not even be passed this session. It might put it off on \nthe back burner. How on Earth can we be passing emergency farm \nlegislation to provide assistance to hard-pressed farmers and ranchers \nwhen we have lost our exports and we cannot sell the product? We have \nto move here, it seems to me, on TPA.\n  As we have begun hearings on the next farm bill, I have also \nindicated my support for expanding conservation and rural development \nprograms. This farm bill is going to have conservation and rural \ndevelopment in the center ring with the commodity title. I stand by \nthat support.\n  I want to credit the chairman of the committee, the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, who has shown great leadership in focusing on \nconservation. The increases in funding and the program changes should \nbe done in the context of the farm bill where we can a have full and \nopen debate. Senator Crapo has a bill that I have cosponsored and \nothers have bills. In this bill we have not had a full and open debate \non the conservation programs in this bill. There are numerous \nprovisions in this legislation that either create or extend or modify \nUSDA programs, many of which have nothing to do with the financial \ndifficulties in rural America.\n\n  This is going to create a problem, not only in the Senate but also in \nregards to the House-Senate conference. The best I can tell, the way \nthis legislation is drafted, it is going to require a conference with \nat least three separate House committees, the chairmen of which are not \nexactly conducive to emergency farm legislation. That is not the way to \ncreate swift and easy passage of what many consider must-pass \nlegislation.\n  We are going beyond the scope of this legislation by including \nprovisions that should be debated and considered openly in the farm \nbill debate. I think we are making decisions that are taking away from \nthe 2002 budget for 2001 and reducing either a 2002 emergency package \nor the next farm bill money by $2 billion.\n  My last point is this: I am concerned about the tone of some of my \ncolleagues in terms of their debate, especially on the other side of \nthe aisle, who argue that we on this side of the aisle were responsible \nfor holding up this bill and putting agricultural assistance for our \nfarmers and ranchers in jeopardy.\n  We have already told every farm lender, every farmer and rancher in \nAmerica, that a double AMTA payment was coming. Why? Because of the \nloss in price and income I have just gone over with all of the program \ncrops and other crops as well. Every banker knows that. Every producer \nknows that. We have to do it now because the Congressional Budget \nOffice, in a letter today, tells us we will lose the money if we do \nnot.\n  In May, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, in his position as \nthe then-ranking member of the Budget committee, wrote to then-chairman \nLugar of the committee, asking that the committee move on an \nagricultural assistance package or risk losing the funds.\n  Soon after that letter was received, we had a little fault line shift \nof power in this body. The fault began to take place in late May. It \nwas completed on June 5, when the distinguished Senator from Iowa took \nover as chairman of the Agriculture Committee.\n  Let me repeat that. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle took \nover June 5. The legislation was not brought before the Agriculture \nCommittee until last week, July 25, 7 weeks after taking over the reins \nof control, 9 calendar days from our scheduled August adjournment. This \ndelay occurred when everybody knew full well we were going to have \ncontentious issues, the Dairy Compact, everything, and it could lead to \na prolonged and substantial debate.\n  I see my time has expired. I ask for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  We know anytime an ag bill is brought to this distinguished body, we \nare getting into all sorts of controversies and so consequently, \nknowing this, they went ahead and presented a bill $2 billion higher \nthan the House version.\n  It is $2 billion higher. We have all these other programs we should \nconsider in a farm bill. They are good programs. I support the \nprograms. It is substantially different in substance from the House \nbill that is going to require a conference with up to three House \ncommittees.\n\n  Speaking of the House, I want to point out the House Agriculture \nCommittee passed its version of this assistance package June 20. It \npassed on a voice vote in the House--get it out, get the assistance out \nto farmers. It did not even have a vote. They passed it by a voice \nvote, June 26, a full month before we even held committee markup in the \nSenate.\n  I might also point out it was the ranking member of the House, the \ndistinguished Congressman from Texas, Charlie Stenholm, who led the \ncharge to keep the package at $5.5 billion.\n  Let me go through that time line again: The Senator from Iowa took \nthe reins of the Committee on June 5, the House Agriculture Committee \npassed the bill on June 20, and the full House passed the bill by voice \nvote on June 26. Yet, we did not even act in the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee until July 25. I must ask why we waited, when we knew it was \nmust pass legislation?\n  We can pass a $7.5 billion. We can go ahead and do that. It will be \n$2 million over what we allowed in the budget. We are robbing Peter to \npay Paul. Again, we could come up with different names. We can take a \nlook at the possibility of a Presidential veto. That is a dangerous \ntrail to be on. I do not want to go down that trail. We have an \nopportunity now to vote for Senator Lugar's amendment and keep this \nwithin budget, keep this within guidelines, and get the assistance to \nfarmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not spend much time now, but I find \nit incongruous that my colleague from Kansas talks about delay. When we \ntried to bring this bill to the Senate, we had to file a cloture motion \nto proceed to debate the bill. I repeat, we could not even proceed \nwithout filing a cloture motion--so much for delay. That really is \npretty irrelevant to farmers out there who are today doing chores, \nhauling bales and plowing ground while worrying whether they will be \nable to continue to operate their family farm.\n  The question is: Is somebody going to step in and give them the right \nhelp and say they matter, and that we want them as part of our future? \nThat is the question.\n  The phrase was used, if we pass this legislation and deny the \namendment by Senator Lugar, we will be borrowing from the future. I \ntell my colleagues how to quickly borrow from the future for this \ncountry, and that is to sit by and watch farm bankruptcies and farm \nforeclosures. Family farms being lost is borrowing from America's \nfuture as well.\n  We stand in suits and ties--we dress pretty well here--talking about \nthe agricultural economy in some antiseptic way. None of us has had a \ndrop in our income to 1930s levels in real dollars--none of us. Has \nanybody here had a huge drop in income back to 1930 levels in real \ndollars? I do not think so. But, family farmers have suffered a \ncollapse of this magnitude to their income.\n  We have had people say things are better today on the family farm; \nprices are up; Gee, things are really going along pretty well and \nlooking up. If you take 15- or 25-year lows and say prices have \nimproved slightly, you could make the case they have improved slightly, \nbut you still have dramatically lower income than you have had for many \nyears. Another thing that must also be considered is this year's \ndramatically higher input costs, such as fertilizer and fuel prices.\n  The only people who, in my judgment, can say things are much better\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\nare the people who are not getting up in the morning to do chores or \ntrying to figure out how to make a tractor work to make a family farm \noperate on a daily basis.\n  The question is not so much what does Washington think; the question \nis what do family farmers know. I will tell you what they know. They \nknow they are hanging on by their financial fingertips struggling to \nsee if their family can stay on the farm when they are receiving 1930s \nprices and paying inflated prices for every one of their inputs when \nputting in a crop.\n  The amendment before us is to cut this funding for family farmers by \n$1.9 billion. It is an honest amendment. You have a right to propose a \ncut, and you have a right to say farmers do not deserve this much help. \nIt is not accurate to say if this amendment is adopted that farmers \nwill receive a double AMTA payment. The fact is, they will not. This \namendment will reduce the amount of help available to family farmers.\n  It is interesting to me that we have had four successive years of \nemergency legislation to respond to the deficiencies of the current \nfarm program. I can remember the debate on the farm program--a program \nI voted against. This was nirvana. Boy, was this going to solve all our \nproblems. We now know it solved none of our problems.\n  Year after year we have had to pass an emergency bill. Why? To fill \nin the hole of that farm program that did not work. We need to get a \nbetter farm program. We are about the business of doing that. In the \nmeantime, we need to save family farmers and help them get across those \nprice valleys. Everything in this country is changing. Go to a bank and \nin most places that bank is owned nationally with little branches \naround the country.\n  Do you want to get something to eat? In most cases, you are going to \nget something to eat at a food joint that has ``mom and pop'' taken \ndown and it has a food chain logo on top.\n  Do you want to go to a hardware store? Local hardware stores are not \naround much anymore. Now it is a big chain.\n  The last American heroes, in my judgment, are the folks on the farm \nstill trying to make a living against all the odds. Sometimes they are \nmilking cows, sometimes hauling bales, always doing chores. They also \nput in a crop while praying it does not hail, that they do not get \ninsects, that it does not rain too much, that it rains enough. And if \nthese family farmers are lucky enough to get a crop, they put it in a \ntruck and drive it to an elevator, they find out that the price it is \nworth is really only in 1930 dollars. They find out the food they \nproduce has no value. The farmer who risks everything for himself and \nhis family is told: Your food has no value. In a world where people go \nto bed with an ache in their belly because it hurts to be hungry, our \nfarmers are told their food has no value.\n  There is something disconnected in public policy. The question is, \nare family farmers like the little old diner that is left behind when \nthe interstate comes through? It is a romantic notion to talk about \nthem, but that is yesterday's dream. Is that what family farms are? \nSome think that. Some think our future is mechanized corporate \nagriculture from California to Maine.\n  I think the family unit and family agriculture which plants the seeds \nfor family values that nourish and refresh our small town and big \ncities--the rolling of those valleys from small towns to big cities--\nhas always represented the refreshment of character and value in this \ncountry. Family farms are important to our future.\n  This amendment is asking that we cut back by $1.9 billion the amount \nof emergency help that family farmers need just to keep their heads \nabove water until we can get them across this price valley. We need a \nbridge across these valleys for family farmers. We need a better farm \nprogram to provide that bridge. In the meantime, we need this \nlegislation and we need to defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask that I be yielded 6 minutes from \nthe ranking member's time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Will the Senator accept 5 minutes? We are almost at our \nlimit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will even accept 4 minutes 45 seconds at this point.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Very well. I yield that time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to respond to some of the \ncomments made today and strongly urge my colleagues to support the \neffort put forth by Senator Lugar to get this assistance now to the \nfamily farmers in my State and across this country.\n  The Senator from North Dakota just spoke about the need to get this \nhelp to the family farmers and the people who start the tractors and \nmove the bales. That is my family. That is what they do. That is what \nmy dad and brother do. My other brother is a veterinarian. We are \nintricately involved in agriculture and have been for generations.\n  This help is needed, but I can tell you one thing as well: a rain \ntoday is much more useful than a rain in November. We need it during \nthe growing season. We can use the money today and not in the next \nfiscal year.\n  What we are really flirting with is the very real possibility that \nthe Senate could say: OK, $5.5 billion is not sufficient. We want more. \nI would like to have more for my farmers, but at the end of the day, we \nput in a higher number than the House and we cannot get to conference \nin time and the President, on top of that, has said he will veto the \nbill if it is over $5.5 billion.\n  At the end of the day, instead of getting $5.5 billion or $7.4 \nbillion, we get zero out of it, and that would be very harmful to the \nfarmers across this country--the wheat farmers and the grain crop \nfarmers across Kansas. It would be very harmful to my family who is \nlooking at a situation where prices have been low and production high \nand where we have not opened up foreign markets.\n  I was in Wilson, KS, at the Czech festival talking with farmers \nthere. Overall, they appreciate the freedom and flexibility in this \nfarm program but would like us to open up some of these markets. They \nsay we have not done that in sufficient quantity yet.\n\n  They say as well they need support from the farm program and they \nneed it now. They do not need it taking place 6 months from now. If you \nare looking at saying we have $5.5 billion or zero, they will say the \n$5.5 billion, that is what we need to do.\n  It looks to me as if we are staring at a very dangerous gamble \nsaying: OK, we think we can bounce this number up another nearly $2 \nbillion, and we are looking at less than a week to do this. In that \nperiod of time, it has to clear the Senate, get to the House, and the \nPresident has to say: Yes, you are right, I have changed my mind; it is \nnot $5.5 billion; I will jump that number up some.\n  I do not think that is a safe gamble at all, and it is not a gamble \nwe should make the farmers of the United States and the farmers across \nKansas take when we are looking at this particular type of difficult \nfinancial situation in which the farmers find themselves.\n  It is responsible for us to support Senator Lugar and what he is \nputting forward to get the $5.5 billion that has been promised. It is a \nresponsible thing for us to do, even though we would like to put more \ninto the farm program. This we can do; this we should do. I believe \nthis is something we must do, and we must do it now.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Lugar amendment. This is the \ntype of assistance we can and should get out the door. Let's do this \nnow and not gamble on something that might be higher in the future.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 1 minute 10 \nseconds, and the Senator from Iowa has 10 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes off my time to the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nthoughtfulness.\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\n  I hope Senators will support my amendment and vote no against the \ntabling motion. I ask them to do this because I believe it is the only \nway in which farmers are going to receive any money.\n  I will go over the situation again. If we adopt the House language, \nwe do not have a conference, and that is very important, because in a \nconference with the House, other items could arise that are of concern \nto Senators. As it is, we know the parameters of the bill as we see \nthem. Adoption by the Senate of the House language means we have no \nconference, the President signs the bill, and the money goes to the \nfarmers.\n\n  We have received from the CBO assurance that this bill must be \nsuccessfully conferenced and passed by the Senate and the House before \nwe recess, and the President must sign it in the month of August or \nthere will be no checks. None. Senators need to know that.\n  The fact is, we have a difference of opinion. But the specialty crops \nare cared for by the House bill. The AMTA payments are cared for--not \nin the quantity that persons in either of these categories wish to \nachieve but this is emergency spending. It is our one opportunity to do \nit.\n  I am hopeful, in a bipartisan way, we will reject tabling; we will \npass the amendment; we will go to the President, united with the House; \nand we will get the money to the farmers. This is very important, as \nopposed to having a partisan issue, as opposed to discussing how sad it \nwas that somehow we miscalculated, how sad it was, indeed, for the \nfarmers that we were attempting to help.\n  Finally, I believe we are doing something responsible. I believe we \nare filling in the gap for income, and our estimates are that farmers \nwill have less this year, and we are going to make certain they have \nmore; that country bankers are paid and they can count on it; and that \nfarmers will plant again and they can count upon it. Any farmer \nlistening to this debate wants us to pass the bill today and to move on \nwith the House and the President. They do not want haggling over who is \nresponsible, which party really cares more, which crop should have had \nsomething more, or an opportunity for mischief to occur in the \nconference, in which finally the whole issue revolves on something \nother than what we have been talking about today.\n  I plead with my colleagues, in a bipartisan way, to reject tabling \nand to support the Lugar amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is not easy to say the amendment \noffered by my good friend from Indiana should be defeated because he is \nmy good friend and I know he is doing this in good faith. We have \ntalked about this and I know he feels deeply this is the way we should \ngo. Quite frankly, as we all are friends on the Senate floor, we differ \nsometimes on how we ought to proceed and what is needed to meet the \nneeds of our constituents. I respectfully dissent from that position \nthat my friend from Indiana has taken.\n  I believe the $5.5 billion passed by the House is inadequate. I am \nnot just saying that. Read the letters I have had printed today from \nthe American Farm Bureau, the National Wheat Growers, the National Corn \nGrowers, the National Soybean Association, and on and on and on. Every \none of them is saying it is inadequate; that we have to provide the \nsame payments to our farmers this year as we did last year.\n  I have heard talk that the markets have improved. That is not true. \nThe livestock sector has gone up a little bit; that is, the livestock \nsector but not the crop sector. We hear the aggregate income has gone \nup.\n  Mr. President, say we are in a room of 10 people and we are talking \nabout prescription drug benefits for the elderly. We have 10 people in \nthe room and you put Bill Gates in the room. All of a sudden you say \nthe aggregate income in the room is $1 billion per person so why do you \nneed benefits under Social Security? That is what they are saying.\n  Yes, aggregate income has gone up because of the livestock sector, \nbut that has not happened with the crop sector. Because of the increase \nin the price of fuel and fertilizers, farmers today are in worse shape \nthan they were last year.\n  The House bill provides 85 percent of the support level we provided \nlast year and the year before. The bill the committee reported out--and \nit was not a straight party line vote either --the bill we reported out \nprovides for 100 percent of what they got last year and the year \nbefore. As I said, all of the groups we have received letters from \nsupport this position.\n  I ask that by unanimous consent a letter from the National Cotton \nCouncil of America be printed in the Record, along with a position \npaper from the National Barley Growers Association, and a letter dated \ntoday from the Oil Seed Federation, the American Soybean Association, \nthe National Sunflower Association, and the U.S. Canola Association.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The undersigned oilseed producer \n     organizations strongly support the Committee's efforts to \n     complete consideration of legislation to provide Economic \n     Loss Assistance to producers of 2001 crops prior to the \n     August Congressional work period. As you know, funds \n     available for this purpose in FY-2001 must be expended before \n     the end of the Fiscal Year on September 30, 2001. This \n     deadline requires that Congress complete action this week, so \n     that the Farm Service Agency can process payments after \n     enactment.\n       As part of the Economic Loss Assistance package, we support \n     continuing the level of support for oilseeds provided in last \n     year's plan of $500 million. Prices for oilseeds are at or \n     below levels experienced for the 2000 crop. Farmers and their \n     lenders expect Congress to maintain oilseed payments at last \n     year's levels.\n       For this reason, we support making funds available for \n     oilseed payments from the $7.35 billion provided in the \n     Budget Resolution for FY-2002. This is the same approach used \n     for 2000 crop oilseeds, when $500 million in FY-2001 funds \n     were made available. We only ask that oilseed producers \n     receive the same support, and in the same manner, provided \n     last year.\n       Thank you very much for your efforts to provide fair and \n     equitable treatment for oilseed producers in this time of \n     severe economic hardship.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Bart Ruth,\n                                 President, American Soybean Assn.\n     Lloyd Klein,\n                               President, National Sunflower Assn.\n     Steve Dahl,\n     President, U.S. Canola Assn.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     National Barley Growers Association (NBGA)--Position Statement\n\n\n          Income and Market Loss Assistance for the 2001 Crop\n\n       The Fiscal Year (FY) 2002 budget resolution provides $5.5 \n     billion in additional agricultural assistance for crop year \n     2001 and an increase of $73.5 billion in the agriculture \n     budget baseline through 2011. The budget resolution also \n     provided flexibility in the use of a total of $79 billion. \n     Because agricultural prices are not improving and production \n     costs continue to escalate, NBGA believes it will be \n     difficult to fully address the chronically ailing agriculture \n     economy if Congress provides no more than $5.5 billion in \n     assistance.\n       Although projections show a rise in farm income, this is \n     largely due to the fact that analysis project livestock cash \n     receipts to rise from $98.8 billion in 2000 to $106.6 billion \n     in 2001. At the same time, cash receipts from crop sales are \n     up less than $1 billion.\n       Further, producers continue to face historic low prices and \n     income as well as increased input costs. In 2000, farm \n     expenditures for fuel and oil, electricity, fertilizer and \n     crop protection chemicals are estimated to increase farmers' \n     cost $2.9 billion. This year, USDA estimates those expenses \n     will rise an additional $2 billion to $3 billion while farm \n     income continues to decrease. These issues affect every \n     sector of agriculture.\n       We urge Congress to mandate that the Secretary of \n     Agriculture make emergency economic assistance for the 2001 \n     crops in the form of a market loss assistance payment at the \n     1999 Production Flexibility Contract (PFC, or AMTA) payment \n     rate as soon as practicable prior to the end of FY01.\n       We believe this additional assistance will help addresses \n     the serious economic conditions in the farm sector and does \n     not jeopardize the House and Senate Agriculture Committees' \n     ability to develop effective new long-term farm policy in the \n     near future.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Natiional Cotton Council\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 2001.\n     Hon. Larry Combest,\n     Chairman, House Agriculture Committee, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your efforts on the behalf \n     of US agriculture. It is\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\n     clear your leadership has raised the level of awareness of \n     the stark economic reality facing US agricultural producers \n     both in the US Congress and the Administration. As the House \n     Agriculture Committee addresses the various needs of the US \n     agricultural sector in its markup for emergency assistance, \n     the National Cotton Council supports the allocation of at \n     least $5.5 billion for market loss assistance payments. This \n     amount is sufficient to provide economic assistance in the \n     form of a market loss assistance payment at the 1999 AMTA \n     payment rate and is the minimum necessary for an effective \n     response to the continued economic crisis that pervades the \n     entire cotton industry. Even this amount will result in less \n     total assistance than was provided to producers in 2000.\n       U.S. cotton producers have seen prices paid for all inputs \n     rise by 10% since 1999, as measured by USDA. Prices in U.S. \n     agricultural commodity futures markets are trading 55% to 65% \n     of the values present in 1995. For cotton, the December \n     contract on the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) averaged 63 \n     cents per pound from mid May to mid June in 2000. For the \n     last 30 days the December 2001 contract on NYBOT has averaged \n     just 47 cents. The squeeze on cotton producers is incredibly \n     intense.\n       The National Cotton Council testified in February seeking \n     total support for producers in 2001 to be no less than that \n     provided in crop year 2000. In the specific case of cotton, \n     the combined 2000 crop year AMTA and market loss assistance \n     was 15.21 cents. A market loss assistance payment of 7.88 \n     cents in 2001 is a solid move to toward last year's level of \n     combined support. This assumes the entire $5.5 billion \n     allocated for 2001 in this year's budget resolution is \n     dedicated to market loss assistance. Any reduction below $5.5 \n     billion for market loss assistance further harms the US \n     agriculture production sector.\n       The National Cotton Council seeks additional funding for \n     other critical issues facing our industry, including (1) \n     cottonseed assistance; (2) elimination of the 1.25 cent Step \n     2 threshold; and (3) use of a modified base for the \n     calculation of market loss assistance payments. Low \n     cottonseed prices plague the industry for the third year in a \n     row and cut substantially into producer income. For the past \n     2 crop years Congress has recognized the impact of low \n     cottonseed prices on producers and ginners and provided \n     cottonseed assistance payments. Offers for 2001 new crop \n     cottonseed are as low as those faced in the most recent 2 \n     years.\n       The National Cotton Council seeks elimination of the 1.25 \n     cent threshold in the Step 2 competitiveness provision. The \n     U.S. textile industry is reeling from the impact of textile \n     and apparel imports associated with a strong dollar. U.S. \n     mills used 11.4 million 480-lb. bales of US in cotton in \n     1997, but current use rates are under 8.5 million. U.S. \n     exports of raw cotton are also hampered by the strength of \n     the dollar. Improved competitiveness in the face of external \n     forces is critical to the economic health of the U.S. cotton \n     industry.\n       The National Cotton Council also seeks relief for producers \n     whose recent planting history differs substantially from the \n     acres enrolled in the production flexibility contracts (PFC). \n     The use of the PFC base for delivery of supplemental market \n     loss assistance speeds payments to producers, but may not \n     adequately address losses associated with actual production. \n     The NCC proposal will not slow delivery of market loss \n     assistance payments, but provides producers with an option to \n     apply for additional assistance based on a modified base \n     calculation. This enables the committee to more closely align \n     production with supplemental assistance without slowing the \n     delivery of this critical aid.\n       We understand there are many legitimate requests for \n     assistance given the continued economic stress throughout \n     agriculture. We urge you to develop a balanced package and to \n     include these initiatives if sufficient funds become \n     available now or at a future date and the ability of the \n     Committee to write effective long term farm policy, \n     consistent with the Council's and other groups' testimony, is \n     not jeopardized.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James E. Echols,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. All we are saying is that we have a tough situation in \nagriculture. There is no reason why we shouldn't provide 100 percent of \npayments. That is what we did in our bill.\n  I point out the House bill initially started out at $6.5 billion. An \namendment was offered to put it at $5.5 billion, and it passed by one \nvote. Two of those who voted sent me letters, which I have included in \nthe Record, saying they want a more comprehensive bill, one that \nincludes the Senate's provisions.\n  I say the responsible thing to do is to meet the needs of our \nconstituents, our farmers, and our farm families around the country.\n  We also made the bill broader. In other words, we didn't just look at \nthe program crops. We looked at a lot of other crops: the crops in the \nNorthwest, the peas and lentils and chick peas, we looked at apples and \nwhat is happening to our specialty crops there. There are a lot of \nother farmers in the country who are hurting and who need assistance. \nWe included them, also. I don't see why we should leave them out.\n  We made 100 percent of payments but we reached out. We also put in \nsome strong conservation measures. The Lugar amendment leaves out all \nof the conservation provisions we put in the bill. The people that need \nthat conservation are all over this country, anywhere from Georgia, to \nWashington State and California, to New York and Maine.\n  These conservation moneys do two things: They help our farm income, \nand they help our farmers. But they also help all in society by \ncleaning up our water and cleaning up our air and soil runoff. The \nconservation funding would lie dormant for the Wetland Reserve Program, \nthe Farmland Protection Program and the Wildlife Habitat Improvement \nProgram.\n  I think we are doing the responsible thing. I believe if we were to \npass the committee-passed bill--and I believe the votes are here--and \ngo to conference with the House, we can be back from conference with \nthe House, I would hope, no later than tomorrow night, perhaps by \nThursday. We would have a good conference report, one that could be \nbroadly supported. I believe the President would do well to sign that \nbill.\n  Again, we will probably have to make compromises in conference. I \nunderstand that. I point out to all who will be voting, there is three \ntimes the amount of help to specialty crop producers in our underlying \nbill as in the Lugar amendment. To my friends on both sides of the \naisle, I say we included moneys for crops all over this country. We \ndidn't just single out one or two.\n  I am hopeful we can table the amendment offered, I know in good \nfaith, by my friend from Indiana. But we have to meet our needs. We \nhave to meet the needs of our constituents.\n  I make one final point: The committee bill is in full compliance with \nthe budget resolution. We did exactly what the Budget Committee allowed \nus to do: $5.5 billion is spent before September 30; the other moneys \nin the next fiscal year. That is exactly what the budget resolution \nallows.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). It is now 3 o'clock. Under the \nprevious order, the Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table the Lugar amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, could I have the attention of our \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8429-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8429-S8431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JAMES W. ZIGLAR, OF MISSISSIPPI, TO BE COMMISSIONER OF \n                     IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 286, the \nnomination of James Ziglar to be Commissioner of Immigration and \nNaturalization; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, any statements thereon be printed in \nthe Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, may I be \nrecognized for 2 minutes as soon as the Senate has completed this \naction?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the foregoing request is agreed to.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of James W. Ziglar, of \nMississippi, to be Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization.\n  The nomination was considered and confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  We have all come to know and, I would say, have a great deal of \naffection for Jim Ziglar. He has been an extraordinary Sergeant at \nArms. This afternoon there is a reception. I hope our colleagues will \nwish Mr. Ziglar well.\n  I have come to admire his work and have said already on the floor how \nmuch I appreciate his commitment to the Senate, to this institution, to \npublic service.\n  In an effort to accelerate his nomination and confirmation, we wanted \nto have the opportunity to take this matter up prior to the time his \nreception is held this afternoon.\n  I think on behalf of the entire Senate, we wish Jim Ziglar well in \nhis new role and new responsibilities. I can think of no one who could \nserve more ably. I am grateful to my colleagues for the consideration \nand ultimately for the adoption of this confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle for moving this \nnomination. I have been very proud of the job that Jim Ziglar from \nPascagoula, MS, has done as the Senate Sergeant at Arms.\n  When he came, I asked him to make sure the office was run efficiently \nand fairly, certainly in a bipartisan way, a nonpartisan way. He \ncertainly did that. Sometimes I think maybe he got a little carried \naway doing that. But he did a great job. I know he has friends on both \nsides of the aisle. When he came to me to talk about the possibility of \nbecoming Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, I \nquestioned him about his desire to do that, but he assured me he was \nprepared for that challenge and that he wished to do so.\n  I am glad he has been confirmed. I hope my colleagues will join him \nat the reception this afternoon. Certainly we all wish him well in this \nvery important job that is going to take a lot of administrative \nability and a lot of willingness to make changes to make sure that \nagency is run more efficiently.\n  I also hope this is a sign that this is the first of many nominations \nthat will follow very shortly that will move as quickly and easily as \nthis one, that this is the opening in the floodgates.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for bringing up the nomination.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I'm pleased the Senate has confirmed the \nnomination of Jim Zigler to the Commissioner of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. He is well suited for this job, and I am sure \nhe will discharge the responsibilities he is undertaking with a high \nlevel of competence and dedication.\n  Jim once served on the staff of Senator James O. Eastland of \nMississippi whom I succeeded when he retired from the Senate in 1978. \nOne of Senator Eastland's interests and responsibilities when he was \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee was the work of INS. I can recall \nhis very close supervision of the work of his agency when I was a \nMember of the House.\n  I know Jim Eastland would be very proud indeed that his former \nprotege, Jim Zigler, has been confirmed today as Commissioner. I'm \nproud of Jim, too, and wish for him much success and satisfaction in \nthis important new job.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that we have the opportunity \nto consider today the confirmation of the Honorable James Ziglar for \nCommissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. While there \nis little doubt that Mr. Ziglar faces tremendous challenges as \ncommissioner of the INS, I also believe that there is little doubt that \nMr. Ziglar has the ability to take on those challenges. I therefore \njoin my colleagues in support of his confirmation and look forward to \ngreat things from Mr. Ziglar and the Immigration and Naturalization \nService in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad this has gone through as quickly \nas it has. After hearing the minority leader's comments, he is \nobviously not aware of how fast the Judiciary Committee is moving.\n  By the end of this week I hope that a few more nominations will reach \nthe Senate floor from the Judiciary Committee. If they do, I will \nrequest a roll call vote on them in order to demonstrate to all the \nMembers how quickly we are moving nominations. The Ziglar nomination \nreceived a hearing before the Judiciary Committee within two weeks of \nthe time that the other side of the aisle allowed the Senate to \nreorganize. We also held hearings for Asa Hutchinson, the President's \nchoice to head the Drug Enforcement Administration, along with four \njudicial nominees and two additional Justice Department nominees. This \npace was probably the fastest the Judiciary Committee has moved on \nnominations in the last six years.\n  In addition, we completed confirmation hearings on Robert Mueller's \nnomination for FBI director this morning. I am pleased that we were \nable to begin his hearing within days of receiving the papers from the \nWhite House. If he is not blocked by the other side, we will bring him \nup Thursday before the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am particularly pleased that we were able to move quickly to \nconsider James Ziglar's nomination. I think he is extraordinarily \nqualified to head the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and I \napplaud President Bush for choosing him. Mr. Ziglar will work with both \nRepublicans and Democrats. He will not seek partisan advantage but will \nrather act in the Nation's best interest, just as he has as Sergeant at \nArms here.\n  It was a very good move when Senator Lott first appointed him to this \nposition. I am very impressed with him. I am pleased to be his friend, \nand I am happy to vote for his nomination.\n  He has a distinguished background as a lawyer, investment banker, and \ngovernment official. As Sergeant at Arms, he worked behind the scenes \nto ensure that the business of the Senate went smoothly even in \nstressful times such as the impeachment trial of President Clinton. We \nhere all owe him a debt of gratitude for his hard and effective work.\n  These next few years will be a pivotal time for the INS and for \nimmigration policy in the United States. The Administration has \nexpressed interest in reorganizing the INS and having the new \nCommissioner implement the reorganization plan. The Administration is \nalso apparently considering proposing numerous changes in immigration \nlaw as part of bilateral discussions with Mexico. I trust that Mr. \nZiglar will play a role in the Administration's consideration of these \nmatters, and will encourage a fair approach to the problems faced by \nundocumented workers from both Mexico and the rest of the world.\n  In addition to the new proposals the Administration is considering, \nthere is significant unfinished business in the immigration area. The \nnew Commissioner will inherit a number of questionable immigration \npolicies that Congress enacted five years ago in the\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. There are \nalso a number of unresolved issues from the last Congress that we must \naddress in this one.\n  Mr. Ziglar promised at his confirmation hearing to be an advocate for \nthe many fine men and women who work for the INS, and I was glad to \nhear him say that. I know that in my State there are many hardworking \nmen and women who work for the Law Enforcement Support Center, the \nVermont Service Center and Sub-Office, the Debt Management Center, the \nEastern Regional Office, and the Swanton Border Patrol Sector. These \nare employees Mr. Ziglar can rely on in his attempt to improve the \nagency.\n\n  One of the bigger issues facing the next Commissioner will be \nrestructuring the INS. I strongly support improving the agency and \ngiving it the resources it needs. The tasks we ask the INS to do range \nfrom processing citizenship applications to protecting our borders, and \nI agree that there are some internal tensions in the INS' mission that \nmight be resolved. I also believe, however, that we must ensure that \nthe INS does not lose its strengths, which I think are well represented \nby the great efficiency of the INS offices in Vermont. I intend to play \nan active role in the development and consideration of any INS \nreorganization plan.\n  I am also heartened that Mr. Ziglar questioned our nation's use of \nexpedited removal and detention at his confirmation hearing. Later this \nweek I will join with Senator Brownback and others to introduce the \nRefugee Protection Act, which would sharply limit the use of expedited \nremoval and reduce the use of detention against asylum seekers. I think \nI can speak for Senator Brownback in saying we look forward to working \nwith Mr. Ziglar to move this legislation.\n  The use of expedited removal, the process under which aliens arriving \nin the United States can be returned immediately to their native lands \nat the say-so of a low-level INS officer, calls the United States' \ncommitment to refugees into serious question. Since Congress adopted \nexpedited removal in 1996, we have had a system where we are removing \npeople who arrive here either without proper documentation or with \nfacially valid documentation that an INS officer simply suspects is \ninvalid. This policy ignores the fact that people fleeing despotic \nregimes are quite often unable to obtain travel documents before \nleaving--they must move quickly and cannot depend upon the government \nthat is persecuting them to provide them with the proper paperwork for \ndeparture. In the limited time that expedited removal has been in \noperation, we already have received reliable reports that valid asylum \nseekers have been denied admission to our country without the \nopportunity to convince an immigration judge that they faced \npersecution in their native lands. To provide just one example, as \nArchbishop Theodore McCarrick described in an op-ed in the July 22 \nWashington Post, a Kosovar Albanian was summarily removed from the U.S. \nafter the civil war in Kosovo had already made the front pages of \nAmerica's newspapers. I believe we must address this issue in this \nCongress.\n  In addition to questioning expedited removal and detention, I hope \nthat Mr. Ziglar will work with us to address some of the other serious \ndue process concerns created by passage of the Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act in 1996. Through those laws, Congress \nexpanded the pool of people who could be deported, denied those people \nthe chance for due process before deportation, and made these changes \nretroactive, so that legal permanent residents who had committed \noffenses so minor that they did not even serve jail time suddenly faced \nremoval from the United States. The Supreme Court has recently limited \nsome of the retroactive effects of those laws, in INS v. St. Cyr, but \nwe must do more to bring these laws into line with our historic \ncommitment to immigration. Many of us have attempted throughout the \nlast five years to undo the legislation we passed in 1996--it remains a \nhigh priority and I hope we can find areas of agreement with Mr. Ziglar \nand the Administration.\n  Mr. Ziglar did not present himself at his confirmation hearing as an \nexpert on immigration and immigration law--he said frankly that he has \nmuch to learn. He did offer his expertise in management and promised to \nwork hard to solve some of the problems the INS has faced over recent \nyears. We in Congress want to be partners in this effort, and I hope \nthat the excellent working relationship we have had with Mr. Ziglar \nover the years will continue in his new capacity.\n  James Ziglar is the President's choice to be the Commissioner of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, and I am happy to vote for his \nnomination. He has a distinguished background as a lawyer, investment \nbanker, and government official. Furthermore, he was a distinguished \nSergeant at Arms of the Senate, serving the needs of every Senator in a \ntime of great partisanship. He worked behind the scenes to ensure that \nthe business of the Senate went smoothly even in stressful times such \nas the impeachment trial of President Clinton. We here all owe him a \ndebt of gratitude for his hard and effective work.\n  These next few years will be a pivotal time for the INS and for \nimmigration policy in the United States.

He did offer his expertise in management and promised to \nwork hard to solve some of the problems the INS has faced over recent \nyears. We in Congress want to be partners in this effort, and I hope \nthat the excellent working relationship we have had with Mr. Ziglar \nover the years will continue in his new capacity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I note that Jim Ziglar is on the floor. I \nwant to be the first among all of our colleagues to congratulate him \npublicly.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8431-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are still on the agriculture package. \nAfter having had this last vote, I think it is the wish of the Senate \nthat we move ahead on this bill so we can go to conference.\n  Again, I remind Senators, as others have reminded them today, time is \nrunning short. We would like to finish this bill if at all possible \ntoday so that we can go to conference tomorrow, hopefully finish the \nconference tomorrow at some reasonable time, and come back with the \nconference report either late tomorrow or early on Thursday so we can \nfinish the conference report and get it to the President before we \nleave at the end of the week.\n  It is going to be touch and go because the checks have to get out in \nSeptember. We will not be here in August. We will be on recess in \nAugust.\n  We do have to complete our work on the bill and get it to the \nPresident. This Senator is convinced that if we get this bill done \ntoday, we could probably finish conference tomorrow. I don't anticipate \na long conference with the House. We would have to work out some \ndisagreements on spending levels. I believe that could be done fairly \nexpeditiously.\n  If any Senators have further amendments they would like to add, I \nhope we can reach some agreement on time limits. I hope there is not \ngoing to be any effort to string out the bill or to delay it. We just \ncan't afford to delay this bill. We have to get it done, and we have to \nget to conference. We have to get the conference report back and get it \nto the President.\n  I am not saying Senators should not offer amendments. I am just \nsaying if they offer amendments, let's do so right now. Let's have some \nreasonable time agreements, and then let's finish the bill so we can \nget to conference tomorrow.\n\n  I hope we can move ahead expeditiously and finish this bill yet \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1191\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1191.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 1191.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am proposing this amendment on behalf \nof Senators Landrieu, Collins, Schumer, Snowe, Leahy, Allen, Biden, \nBond, Breaux, Carnahan, Carper, Chafee, Cleland, Clinton, Cochran, \nDodd, Edwards, Frist, Gregg, Helms, Hollings, Jeffords, Kennedy, Kerry, \nLieberman, Lincoln, Mikulski, Miller, Reed, Rockefeller, Sarbanes, \nSessions, Shelby, Smith of New Hampshire, Thompson, Thurmond, \nTorricelli, and Warner. \n  As the distinguished manager, the Senator from Iowa asked for a time \nagreement--if I might have the attention of the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am surprised that the Senator from Iowa was not \nlistening. We have a close partnership on the Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am always delighted to respond to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I was saying I would be glad to agree to a time limit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would, too. I hope we can enter into a reasonable time \nlimit. I have to consult with my ranking member, Senator Lugar, to see \nwhat might be a good time agreement. Does the Senator have anything in \nmind he wants to propose?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be agreeable to 4 hours equally divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am hopeful we do not have to go that long, I say to my \nfriend. I am hopeful we could have a shorter debate than that. That is \na pretty long period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have a couple of observations. Before we lock in any time \nagreement, we want to make sure we check with the leadership on both \nsides for when the next vote will occur. If we agreed to 4 hours, we \nare talking about a vote occurring at 20 minutes to 8 tonight, and I am \nnot sure Senator Daschle or I want to do that. We need to do some \nchecking.\n  In terms of the time, I do not know what the advocates or the \nopponents of this amendment want. I do think this is a very important \nissue. We need to make sure everybody has been contacted and sufficient \ntime is available to the proponents and opponents because this could \nbe--well, this is one of the two issues that will determine\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\nwhether or not this legislation goes forward. The other one is the \ndollar amount.\n  We already have a problem with the fact that the Lugar amendment was \nnot adopted, and that causes me a great deal of concern because I am \nworried now that this could lead to the necessity of having a \nconference and concern about when we get to conference and worried \nabout the funds being available for the needs of agriculture in this \ncountry in August or in September.\n  We have a major problem on our hands, and now this dairy compact \nbeing offered on this bill significantly complicates it further. All I \nsay to the Senator from Pennsylvania is that before he locks in the \ntime we have a chance to check on both sides of the aisle with \nopponents and proponents--and they are on both sides of the aisle--for \na reasonable amount of time and a time for a vote will be necessary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator, the \nSenator from New Mexico objects to a time limit. I will be in the \nChamber to object to a time limit an hour from now, 2 hours from now. I \nwant the ag bill to pass, but I am not at all sure it is the right \nthing to put a dairy compact on at this late hour. This Senator needs \nto know a lot more about it. So my colleagues know, I do not agree with \nthe one being discussed, and I will not agree to one when it is \nproposed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered in a very \ntimely way. This is the first time on this bill that the amendment \ncould be offered, so I do not think it is accurate to say it is being \noffered at a late hour. The issues involved with the dairy compact are \nwell known. The matter has been debated extensively recently in the \nSenate Chamber. The Northeast Dairy Compact is due to expire on \nSeptember 30. The pending legislation dealing with the farm issue makes \nit preeminently appropriate to offer this amendment.\n  The dairy compact, as envisioned in this bill, would reauthorize and \nextend the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact which consists of Maine, \nNew Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts to \ninclude Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Delaware, New Jersey, and \nMaryland. It would authorize the Southern Dairy Compact for Alabama, \nArkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North \nCarolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and \nWest Virginia.\n  It would authorize a specific Northwest Dairy Compact within 3 years \nfor the States of California, Oregon, and Washington, and would \nauthorize an Intermountain Dairy Compact within 3 years for the States \nof Colorado, Nevada, and Utah.\n  A dairy compact creates a regional commission of delegates from each \nof the participating States. Each State delegation would have three to \nfive members, including at least one dairy producer and one consumer \nrepresentative, all of whom would be appointed by the Governor of the \nState.\n  The commissioner would have the authority to regulate farm prices of \nclass I fluid milk. It may establish price regulation by way of a \nformal rulemaking process. The commission would take formal testimony \nto assess the price necessary to yield a reasonable return to the dairy \nproducer.\n\n  One of the principal concerns this Senator has is the wide \nfluctuation there has been in dairy pricing. The price has fluctuated \nfrom less than $10 a hundredweight to $17 a hundredweight. In my State \nof Pennsylvania, it is a constant source of concern really putting many \nsmall dairy farmers out of business.\n  The compact does not cost any money. There is no drain on the \nTreasury. It is friendly to the consumer and I think has a great deal \nto recommend it.\n  The commission takes into account the purchasing power of the public, \nand any fluid milk price change proposed by the commission is subject \nto a two-thirds approval vote by the participating State delegations. \nThe compacts receive payments from processors purchasing class I milk \nand returns these funds to farmers based on their milk production.\n  It is very important to note that the compacts are self-financed and \nrequire no appropriation of tax revenues--State, local or Federal. \nLegal challenges to the current dairy compact have been decided in its \nfavor. It is constitutional. The underpinning is article I, section 10. \nTwenty-five States, all of which are included in this legislation, have \nrequested dairy compact authority from Congress, and there have been \npre-compact activities in as many as 10 of the other States.\n  Compacts are needed because the current Federal milk marketing order \npricing system does not fully account for regional differences in the \ncost of producing milk. The Federal order program relies on State \nregulation for an adjustment in fluid milk prices to account for \nregional differences. However, since milk now almost always crosses \nState lines to get to the markets, the courts have ruled that \nindividual States do not have the authority to regulate milk prices \nunder the interstate commerce clause.\n  Dairy compacts recognize the economic benefits that a viable dairy \nindustry brings to a region, and dairy farms are an integral component \nto the region's economy. Dairy compacts ensure customers have a \ncontinuous adequate supply of quality milk at a stable price. This \nstability gives consumers money in the long run by protecting them from \nretailers that profit from volatile milk prices by fattening their \nprofit margins when the price of milk rises and then keep their prices \ninflated long after wholesale prices have already fallen.\n  Dairy compacts' main benefit to consumers is ensuring a local supply \nof fresh milk and a stable price. Dairy compacts help maintain dairy \nfarms which in turn preserve the environment and open space.\n  I realize there are substantial regional differences and there are \npeople who have deep-seated opposition. I recently conducted a hearing \nfor the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. I \nhave served on that subcommittee during my 20-year-plus tenure in the \nSenate. I convened that hearing in Pennsylvania and conducted it \nbecause of the concerns I had heard from so many dairy farmers in \nPennsylvania and, for that matter, in other States whereas, I say, the \nprices fluctuated from less than $10 per hundredweight to more than $17 \nper hundredweight, which hardly gives a dairy farmer any stability as \nto what is happening.\n  At the same time the milk prices are falling precipitously, I know as \na consumer that I am paying more for a half gallon of milk at the \nconvenience store.\n  The issue of milk pricing is a very complex issue which goes all the \nway back to New Deal legislation in the 1930s. When I was admitted to \nthe bar, one of my first jobs as a beginning lawyer with Barnes, \nDechert, Price, Myers and Rhoads was to help represent national dairy \nproducts, such as Sealtest, before the milk control commission of \nPennsylvania. The issue was having a minimum price, an adequate price, \nto assure the farmer that the price would be adequate to have a \nsufficient supply of wholesome, clean, safe milk. Milk is one of the \nmost basic commodities in our society. We have seen Agricorps \nproliferate in America so that the local family farmer is in real \njeopardy.\n  One of the cases I recall studying in law school was a case of Nebbia \nv. New York which established the authority to establish minimum \nprices. The constitutional scholar from my law school, Walton Hale \nHamilton, made it a practice just for a brief moment of levity by going \nback to the sites where major constitutional cases had arisen. The case \nof Nebbia v. New York arose because Leo Nebbia, who ran a store, had \nsold a quart of milk and a loaf of bread for the price of a quart of \nmilk. Walton Hale Hamilton went to Leo Nebbia's store and walked to the \ndairy case and picked out a quart of milk. As he was about to pay for \nit, he then asked Mr. Nebbia if he would throw in a loaf of bread. \nProfessor Hamilton was promptly thrown out of the store, as the story \ngoes.\n  But this compact, I believe, is very important. It was a very \ncontentious issue when it was authorized for the Northeast region. I \nwas disappointed\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\npersonally that my State and other States were not included at that \ntime, and the day of the dairy compact is going to come. I think today \nis a good day.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the two managers of the \nbill. There is an amendment that is of interest to Senator Allard that \nhe wants to offer. Senator Miller wants to be here to vote against the \namendment. It is my understanding we will do this with a voice vote. I \nask unanimous consent the Specter amendment be set aside, Senator \nAllard be recognized for up to 10 minutes following his offering of the \namendment, followed by a voice vote on the matter.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I don't want to take \nmuch time, but I wanted to have about 5 minutes in response to Senator \nSpecter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is not on the Senator Specter.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to Senator Allard and then back to Senator \nSpecter.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask, after the Allard amendment is disposed of, we \ncome back to the Specter amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding \nwe will move off of this amendment----\n  Mr. REID. For 10 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That Senator Specter and I offered, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak after Senator Wellstone when we get back on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Specter has 5 minutes. How long do you wish to \nspeak?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Twenty minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1188\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 1188.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1188.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 7__. INTERSTATE MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS FOR ANIMAL FIGHTING.\n\n       (a) Removal of Limitation.--Section 26 of the Animal \n     Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2156) is amended by striking subsection \n     (d) and inserting the following:\n       ``(d) Activities Not Subject to Prohibition.--This section \n     does not apply to the selling, buying, transporting, or \n     delivery of animals in interstate or foreign commerce for any \n     purpose or purposes, so long as those purposes do not include \n     that of an animal fighting venture.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     takes effect on the date that is 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. The amendment I am offering is a bill I have been working \non for over 3 years in the Senate. It is commonly known as the \ncockfighting bill.\n  The bill amends the Animal Welfare Act to remove a loophole that \npermits interstate movement of live birds for the purpose of fighting \nto States in which animal fighting is lawful.\n  Currently, the Animal Welfare Act makes it unlawful for any person to \nknowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal in any animal fighting venture \nto which the animal was moved in interstate or foreign commerce.\n  Therefore, if an animal crosses State lines and then fights in a \nState where cockfighting is illegal, that is a crime.\n  The law further states,\n\n     the activities prohibited by such subsections shall be \n     unlawful with respect to fighting ventures involving live \n     birds only if the fight is to take place in a State where it \n     would be in violation of the laws thereof.\n\n  This means that the law applies to all animals involved in all types \nof fighting--except for birds being transported for cockfighting \npurposes to a State where cockfighting is still legal. Because of this \ncrafty loophole, law enforcement officers have a more difficult time \nprosecuting under their State cockfighting bans.\n  As introduced, this legislation will close the loophole on \ncockfighting, and prohibit interstate movement of birds for the purpose \nof fighting from States where cockfighting is illegal to States where \ncockfighting is legal.\n  Illegal cockfighting is rampant in this Nation. All over the country, \nbirds are affixed with razors and knives, pumped full of steroids, \nstimulants, and blood clotting agents, and made to fight to the death--\nall for sport and money.\n  Not only are most of the fights themselves illegal--gambling, money \nlaundering, assaults, and even murders are not uncommon activities that \naccompany cockfights.\n  I simply do not see any place for any of this in American society.\n  Having said that, I want to make it clear I am a strong proponent of \nsmaller government and of States rights. I do not believe you will find \na stronger supporter of States rights in the Senate today than myself. \nWhile I do not personally approve of cock fighting, my bill clearly \nprotects the rights of States to make or keep cockfighting legal if \nthey so choose. I would not have introduced this bill if it did not. \nThree States currently allow cockfighting, and under my bill these \nthree States would still be allowed to have cockfighting.\n  This bill is much more than a humane issue. It is a serious law \nenforcement issue. I know so because my bill has received the \nendorsement of 70 law enforcement agencies from all over the Nation. In \nStates such as Texas, Arkansas, California, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Ohio, \nIowa, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, and many others, they \nrecognize that this Federal loophole is undermining their ability to \nenforce their own State and county laws. Federal law is being thrown in \nthe faces of citizens in 47 States and used as a shield for criminals \nto hide behind.\n  As a veterinarian and supporter of States rights, I believe it is \ntime to bring parity to the laws governing animal fighting and give law \nenforcement greater leverage to enforce State laws. I appreciate \nChairman Harkin and Ranking Member Lugar's assistance to my efforts.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, I thank the Senator from Colorado for \nproposing his amendment on the issue of cockfighting. He is a \nveterinarian and speaks with special credibility on the topic of the \nhumane treatment of animals, given his academic training and \nprofessional experience in service to animals and their well-being. I \nunderstand that the distinguished Senator from Colorado has retained \nhis veterinary credentials and license in Colorado, continuing to \npractice on occasion and giving periodic check-ups to some of the dogs \nwho are the companions of U.S. Senators. I am also so pleased to note \nthat one of our newest Senators, the distinguished junior Senator from \nNevada, is a veterinarian. This may be the first time that two \nveterinarians have served in the Senate.\n  About 2 weeks ago, I took to the floor of the Senate and spoke about \ndisturbing trends in our culture with respect to the inhumane treatment \nof animals. I decried wanton, barbaric acts of animal cruelty, spending \nsome time recounting the awful circumstances of the small dog, a Bichon \nfrise named Leo, who was yanked from a car after a minor traffic \naccident and thrown into oncoming highway traffic, in an act of terror \ndirected at both the dog and his horrified and traumatized owner. The \ninnocent creature met a brutal and painful death as a consequence of \nthis hate-filled act. In this case, I am happy to report that some \nmeasure of justice prevailed in the end. The man who perpetrated this \nappalling and indefensible act of animal cruelty was apprehended, tried \nbefore a California court, convicted of animal cruelty, and sentenced \nto the maximum penalty allowed under California's anti-cruelty code--3 \nyears in prison. It is interesting to note that this same man was \nconvicted earlier this week of stealing a vehicle--indicating once \nagain to me that there is a link between acts of animal cruelty and \nother types of criminal conduct.\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\n  Two weeks ago, I also spoke about the transformation in American \nagriculture. In all too many cases, we have moved away from small \nfarms, where animals are treated with dignity and respect, to large \ncorporate farms where animals are treated as nothing more than \nunfeeling commodities. Pregnant pigs confined in two-foot-wide \ngestation crates for years at a time; egg-laying hens crammed into \nbattery cages and also deliberately starved in order to induce a molt \nso that they will produce bigger eggs; young male calves jammed into \ntwo-foot-wide crates to produce veal, which is tender because the \nanimals are so completely immobilized in the crate that they cannot \nmove and, as a consequence, their muscles don't develop. I also spoke \nof the abuse of cattle and pigs in slaughter lines, in which animals \nare disassembled before they are killed.\n  I don't think that there is a person among us who can countenance \nthese acts of cruelty--whether they are random acts of violence against \nanimals or institutionalized agriculture practices.\n\n  It is one thing to determine as a culture that it is acceptable to \nraise and rear and then eat animals. It is another thing to cause them \nto lead a miserable life of torment, and then to slaughter them in a \ncrude and callous manner. As a civilized society, we owe it to animals \nto treat them with compassion and humaneness. Animals suffer and they \nfeel. Because we are moral agents, and compassionate people, we must do \nbetter.\n  In our society, there are surely some activities or circumstances \nwhich cause us to weigh or balance human and animal interests. In terms \nof food production, most people choose to eat meat but insist that the \nanimals are humanely treated. That is a choice we make in our culture, \nand it is grounded on the notion that we must eat in order to survive.\n  Breeding animals just for the pleasure of watching them kill one \nanother cannot be justified in a society that accepts the principle \nthat animal cruelty is wrong. It brings to mind the days of the \nColosseum, where the Romans fought people against animals or animal \nagainst animal in gladiatorial spectacles, and the people in attendance \nreveled in the orgy of bloodletting. Yet, even then, in an age known \nfor its callous disregard for animals, there were pangs of remorse and \neven revulsion. The great orator Cicero, after a day at the Colosseum \nduring which gladiators spilled the blood and eventually killed more \nthan a dozen elephants, recalled that the crowd was moved to tears by \nthe sheer cruelty exhibited.\n  In the same way, our country is turning against spectacles involving \nthe injuring and killing of animals for the amusement of spectators. \nPlacing dogs in a pit, instigating them, and watching them fight to \ninjury or death for our amusement is wrong. If dogfighting is wrong, \nthen surely cockfighting is wrong, too.\n  These hapless birds are bred to be aggressive, pumped full of \nstimulants, equipped with razor-sharp knives or ice-pick-like spurs on \ntheir legs, and placed in an enclosed pit, which bars their retreat or \nescape. They fight to the death, hacking one another to death--with \npunctured lungs, gouged eyes, and pierced eyes the inevitable \nconsequence of the combat.\n  Mr. President, today, I speak in support of the amendment from the \nSenator from Colorado, a veterinarian and a humane-minded person.\n  Pitting animals against one another and causing them to fight just so \nthat we can witness the bloodletting presents a clear moral choice for \nus. There can be no confusion on this issue. As decent people, we must \nact to stop it.\n  The law must bar this activity, and impose penalties upon those who \nwould flout this humane standard. I thank the Senator from Colorado and \noffer my support of his amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 1188.\n  The amendment (No. 1188) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Record reflect in that voice vote the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Miller, voted no?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is duly noted.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, with the passage of this amendment I thank \nthe Members of the Senate. We have strong sponsorship on the bill as it \ngoes to conference committee. I hope the conferees, when they \ndeliberate this bill in conference committee, will keep in mind the \nstrong support we have had in the Senate.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1191\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask the Chair whether there are any \ntime constraints at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair that the \nSenator would be allocated 5 minutes at this time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not remember asking for only 5 \nminutes. I do not intend to speak for very long but if that is the \nagreement at the moment--5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Before I proceed further, I ask whether or not each \nSenator who is speaking this afternoon is limited to 5 minutes. Is that \nit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The only sequence at this point was the \nSenator from Minnesota had 5 minutes and the Senator from Louisiana \nasked for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not remember asking for only 5 \nminutes. Could somebody check on exactly where this came from?\n  Let me ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reserving the right to object, could I add, when the \nSenator from Minnesota has finished, following the remarks of the \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, I be recognized to speak for 5 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not know if I will need to take 15 \nminutes. There will be plenty of time for debate. I may be back to the \nfloor again.\n  Let me, first of all, put my comments in some kind of context. These \nare hard times for a lot of dairy farmers, and I understand that full \nwell. I am not terribly sure the idea of a compact or the idea of \nbalkanizing dairy farmers around the country with different compacts is \nthe answer. In fact, I do not think it is the answer at all. As we \nwrite a new farm bill, I wish the focus would be for our farmers, corn \ngrowers and wheat growers and other crop farmers and livestock \nproducers and dairy farmers. I think the focus should be on a way for \nour independent producers to be able to get a decent price in the \nmarketplace. That is what I think this should be about.\n  In Minnesota, just to give Senators some reason as to why I come to \nthe floor with a lot of determination and oppose the Specter \namendment--I do not mean that in a disrespectful way. I mean the \namendment proposed by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter--\nthe dairy industry is a big part of our State's economy. We have 8,000 \ndairy farmers in Minnesota. We rank fifth in the Nation's milk \nproduction. The milk production from Minnesota farms generates more \nthan $1.2 billion for our State's farmers each year. Frankly, it adds \nan additional $1.2 billion by way of a multiplier effect to Minnesota's \noverall economy.\n  I am not talking about big giants. The average herd size in Minnesota \nis 60 cows per farm. We are talking about family operations. We are \ntalking about family businesses with total sales of $1.2 billion. But \nbetween 1993 and the year 2000, we lost about 5,000 dairy farms. That \nrepresents a loss of over one-third of our total dairy farms. That is \nsecond only to the State of Wisconsin, among the 50 States in our \ncountry.\n  If you look at the upper Midwest States, including Minnesota and \nWisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, \nour region lost 49 percent of all the dairy farmers between 1992 and \n1998. These are not just statistics; these are people's lives.\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\n  I hope, as I said earlier, we will actually write a new farm bill \nwhich will give dairy farmers in all regions of the country, especially \nthe family operations, a decent price. I am not talking about these big \nconglomerates. I am talking about farms where the people who work the \nland are the people who make the decisions, and they live there. There \nis no reason in the world why we cannot have a family-farm-based dairy \nsystem, a dairy system which promotes economic vitality in our rural \nareas.\n  I have said it many times. The health and vitality of rural America, \nwhich is a part of America and a part of Minnesota that I love, is not \ngoing to be based on the amount of land owned. Somebody is always going \nto own the land. Someone will own the animals. But the health and \nvitality of the communities is not based upon the amount of land that \nis owned by someone or the number of animals. It is the number of \nfamily farmers who live there, dairy farmers included, who live in the \ncommunity, who buy in the community, who support schools in the \ncommunity; that is what is of key importance.\n  As if dairy farmers were not struggling with enough already in the \nMidwest, in 1996 Congress assisted and in some ways has made the price \nfor many dairy farmers much worse. That is what has happened in the \nMidwest.\n  Again, I did not support the Freedom to Farm bill. I have always \ncalled it the ``freedom to fail'' bill. But the whole idea was you were \ngoing to decouple farmers--you were going to decouple the payments to \nfamily farmers from the Government. Of course, that is not what has \nhappened. But this compact fixes fluid milk prices at artificially high \nlevels for the benefit of dairy producers in one region. Now, there may \nbe other regions, according to this amendment. This is a different set \nof rules.\n  There was a study at the University of Missouri. A dairy economist, \nKen Bailey, found that Minnesota's farm level milk price would drop at \nleast 21 cents per hundredweight if the Southeast Dairy Compact were \nallowed to be expanded, to attach to an expanded Northeast Dairy \nCompact.\n  That is a $27.2 million annual reduction of Minnesota farm milk \nsales.\n  Some of my colleagues say: Why doesn't the upper Midwest form its own \ncompact? Minnesota and Wisconsin farmers would benefit from organizing \ntheir own compact. A compact price boosts supplies only to fluid milk. \nThe percentage of upper Midwest milk sales going to fluid products is \nso low that any compact would do little for Minnesota's farm income.\n  What happens is a negative--the surplus of that milk gets dumped in \nour State and competes with our cheese and butter market.\n  We are talking about trade barriers in our country. We are talking \nabout a compact that is not good for consumers. Quite frankly, I don't \nknow whether or not there is a way to keep dairy farmers in business in \nany part of the country. We transferred millions of dollars from \nmillions of consumers to New England dairy farmers, but the dairy \nfarmers continue to go out of business at an equal or even faster rate \nthan prior to the compact. The Northeast Dairy Compact has not slowed \nthe loss of dairy farmers. There are less New England dairy farmers. \nFour-hundred and sixty-five have left business in the 3 years since the \ncompact than before the compact. It was 444 before.\n  I could go on and on, but I think expanding the dairy compact sets a \nterrible precedent. We can start doing this for other American \nagricultural products as well.\n  The question is, Where do we go with all of this? The current dairy \npolicy in this country is putting dairy farmers in Minnesota at great \nrisk--not just in Minnesota but across the country.\n  I think what we should do is establish a national equitable dairy \nsystem for all. I don't know why in the world Senators from different \nStates with dairy farmers and with family-run operations cannot work \ntogether to make sure we have a safety net and a decent price and some \nkind of income for dairy farmers that would help people especially \nduring the time of low prices. Also, I think we could end a half \ncentury of discrimination against the Midwest as well.\n  We will have the vote on this. I assume Senator Kohl will move to \ntable this amendment. I know we will be joined by Senator Feingold, \nSenator Dayton, and myself. This is what is so unfortunate about where \nwe are right now.\n  First of all, the compact is quite inconsistent with what many \nSenators believe in terms of what we should be doing. I heard my \ncolleague from Wisconsin refer to it as a ``cartel.'' That is strong \nlanguage. But there are an awful lot of Senators in the Senate who do \nnot believe in fixing prices this way. That is point one.\n  The second point is a different point. There are a lot of Senators \nwho support this whom I like as friends; good people. But why in the \nworld are we now basically balkanizing all of the dairy farmers and \nSenators who are supposed to be supporting dairy farmers, cutting \ndeals, and basically saying, OK, Northeast, now we will add the \nSoutheast? Now we will go to the Northwest--keep cutting deals trying \nto bring people in, further balkanizing and forgetting that we are \nreally in the same boat together.\n  Yes, I come to the floor to fight for the upper Midwest. I come to \nthe floor to fight for dairy farmers in Minnesota. But, for God's sake, \nI don't understand why some Senators want to go in the direction of \nadministering prices, cutting deals, balkanizing dairy farmers, \nbalkanizing agriculture, balkanizing Senators, and balkanizing the \ncountry.\n  This isn't a step in the right direction. It is a great leap \nbackwards.\n  I am speaking as a Senator from Minnesota. Yes, I am speaking for \ndairy farmers in Minnesota. Yes, I am doing everything I can to fight \nfor dairy farmers in Minnesota just as other Senators would do when it \ncomes to representing people you love.\n  I don't even think what is being proposed is good for the country at \nall. This makes no sense. I hope Senators--consistent with what they \nhave always said they believe in, consistent with promises that have \nbeen made to Senator Kohl and others, consistent with the idea of how \nwe can work together rather than basically being pitted against one \nanother--will vote to table this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nLouisiana has 20 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise to support the amendment offered by Senator Specter from \nPennsylvania and myself along with 39 cosponsors--actually Democrats \nand Republicans from many different parts of the States--who see this \nas an excellent way to help dairy farmers, to help consumers, to be \nfair to retailers, and to make sure children and families and people in \nevery region of the United States have access to fresh milk at a \nreasonable price.\n  In addition--as the Senator from New Jersey will speak after me--\nthere are compelling environmental reasons in terms of preservation of \nland and green space and open space that are at issue as well.\n  Let me address some of the concerns that the Senator from Minnesota \nraised. Let me begin by saying that if, in fact--I am certain it is \ntrue because he brings a lot of wisdom and experience to many of these \ndebates--it is true that many of the dairy farmers in Minnesota have \ngone out of business, or in his area, he may well want to look into the \nbenefits of this compact. If this compact doesn't work because of the \ndifference in the grades of milk, perhaps a similar kind of compact for \nhis dairy farmers might be helpful. In the area of the Northeast where \nthis compact has now been in existence for several years, benefits are \nobvious. They are clear. They have worked to preserve farmers in \nbusiness to hold down prices to a fair level but providing profit \nmargins for the farmers.\n  There has been some real success. As many times as we deal with many \nissues on a variety of subjects, sometimes we don't create a national \nprogram all at one time. I am fairly familiar with the details of how \nthis started. But it is often that we will start a pilot program, if \nyou will, in one part of the Nation to test and see if it works. I know \nthat was not exactly the way this started, but the end result is that \nwe have compacts in the Northeast which have worked very well. This is \nan effort to expand it to the southern region, to the Pacific region, \nto the Midwest region--all voluntary. It is totally up to\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\nthe States if they, in fact, want to join. No one is forced to join \nthis compact. It is the States themselves.\n  In the last year, I have been made aware--not 2, not 10, not just a \nfew in one region but 25 States in the Nation--that State legislators \nand their Governors have petitioned for Congress to allow them to \nbasically use this self-help mechanism.\n  The second point I will make before I get into my prepared remarks \nis, it is a wonder we have not adopted it sooner. The Senators from \nVermont--Senator Jeffords and Senator Leahy--are effective \nspokespersons. The fact is the dairy compact doesn't cost the taxpayers \nany direct subsidy. We spend hours on this floor passing many farm \nbills, which I have supported because agriculture is important in \nLouisiana. It costs billions of dollars. We ask taxpayers every year to \nput up money out of their hard-earned tax dollars to support a very \ncomplex system of subsidies for farmers. Louisiana farmers benefit in \nmany ways. But this doesn't cost the taxpayers a penny.\n  So you would think there would be 100 Senators rushing to this \nChamber to vote for something that is really all American. It is about \nself-help. It is about risk management. It is about people coming \ntogether in voluntary compacts with all of the parties equally \nrepresented--no one is shut out--in public meetings to set a price that \nworks for everyone. I think it has a lot of merit.\n  State officials and dairy producers across the country are concerned \nthat the current Federal milk marketing order pricing system does not \nfully account for regional differences in the cost of producing milk. \nThe U.S. dairy industry is transporting ever-increasing amounts of milk \nover increasing numbers of miles to supply the fluid market. This is \nespecially true in the South. That is why I am so interested in this \nissue, as is the senior Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, who joins \nme in this effort.\n  In the South, all the dairy-producing States are milk deficient. We \nare milk deficient. We need to be able to produce more milk to supply \nour own customers in the South. We can only do that if our dairy \nfarmers stay in business. If not, we will be importing milk from \noutside of our region.\n  It is the sense of this Congress that milk be produced in the region \nso it can be fresh because it is quite perishable. It can be produced \nand transported easily in the region. It is perishable, so it is \nexpensive to ship and refrigerate.\n  In the past 10 years, nearly a quarter of the dairy farmers in my \nState have gone out of business. Many more are in danger of shutting \ndown. This compact is their way to come to us to say: We found a way \nout. We don't need a direct subsidy. Just allow us this compact, and we \ncan do it.\n  So compacts are a solution. As a result, as I mentioned earlier, 25 \nStates have now passed legislation--almost a majority in the country--\nfor this particular approach.\n  Let me take a moment to explain how the compact works. Compacts are \nformal agreements between three or more contiguous States to determine \na price for fluid milk sold in that region. This price is determined by \na regional commission of delegates from each of the States appointed by \nthe Governor. It has to include at least one dairy producer and one \nconsumer representative.\n  So let me just make one point. Critics have said: This is a cartel \nand we do not want cartels.\n  A cartel is dangerous because usually people who get into a cartel \nare people of all one perspective, people producing an item, and they \nwant to run up the price. But on these commissions--which are not \ncartels because they are not created the same way as you would think of \na regular cartel--the people who drink the milk, the people who sell \nthe milk, and the people who produce the milk are all in a room \ntogether, not in a back room smoking a cigar but out in a public \nmeeting, with a public record, discussing a price that works for them \nall. That is not a cartel. That is the opposite of a cartel. That is \nkind of a committee--an arrangements committee; the American way, a \nDemocratic process--to come to a win-win solution. So I reject the idea \nthat this is a back room cartel. It is exactly the opposite.\n  The commission holds public hearings to assess the price necessary to \nyield a reasonable return to the farmer. Any proposed price change is \nsubject to approval by two-thirds of the State delegations. Any State \nmay leave the compact without penalty. So this is quite a voluntary \nmeasure, not a mandatory measure.\n  Payments are made by the commission and are countercyclical, meaning \nwhen the Federal milk marketing order prices are above the compact \ncommission order price, farmers don't receive compact payments; when \nthe Federal milk marketing order price falls below that of the compact \ncommission, farmers receive compact payments.\n  I show my colleagues a chart. It is the best chart I have seen to \nexplain this situation. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for helping \nme display this chart. I appreciate his help.\n  As you can see from the chart, the compact helps to try to stabilize \nprices. Shown on this chart is the price of milk as it moves up and \ndown. Shown is the set price. The compact operates so that when the \nFederal milk marketing order price falls below that of the compact \ncommission, the compact actually pays the difference to the farmers. \nWhen it goes above, the farmer pays into the compact.\n  Again, it is no cost to the taxpayer. It is a way to stabilize the \nprice. Farmers need certainty, just as any businessperson. Sometimes \npeople can live with low prices. Sometimes they can live with low \nprices if they are certain of the price. It is the uncertainty in any \nbusiness market--whether you are talking about farming or health care \nor transportation or high-tech businesses--that causes people to have \ngreat difficulty.\n  So the compact is a real answer to that. Again, it is sort of a novel \napproach, and one that has been tried. It is not any longer \nexperimental. We can actually see that it is working.\n  I also want to just run through a few of the facts and the fictions \nabout dairy compacts.\n  I mentioned this, but it is worth repeating: The critics say dairy \ncompacts cost taxpayers money.\n  Dairy compacts are self-financing. There is no impact on State or \nFederal treasuries. Let me repeat: No impact on State and Federal \ntreasuries.\n  Critics say the dairy compacts are not constitutional.\n  I do not have my copy of the Constitution with me, as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia usually carries with him, but I can tell you, if you \nflip to article I, section 10, clause 3, of the Constitution, it \nclearly allows for interstate compacts, provided they are approved by \nState legislatures and ratified by Congress.\n  So our action by law, ratifying a compact, and then having States \nvoluntarily entering into it, is absolutely within the framework of the \nConstitution.\n  Third, our critics will say that dairy compacts create \noverproduction.\n  Let me show you the next chart. The Northeast Compact has a very \neffective supply management measure which would be included for all of \nthe regions. It provides an incentive for farmers to limit production. \nIt works like this: It takes 7.5 cents for every 100 pounds of milk \nproduced and places it in a reserve, which is distributed to the \nproducers who did not increase production by more than 1 percent from \nthe previous year.\n  Louisiana, and all other potential Southern dairy compact States, are \nnet importers of fluid milk, so overproduction is not in the \nforeseeable future. So overproduction is just not foreseeable.\n  However, in the 4 years since the compact was created, milk \nproduction in New England has increased by only 2.2 percent, while the \nincrease in the rest of the country was 7.4 percent. So based on that \ninformation alone, you can argue that the efficiency mechanism to hold \ndown production is actually working. Why? Not because the Senator from \nLouisiana says it is working or the Senator from Vermont, but because \nthe statistics show that it is working because the production has been \nheld to a reasonable level.\n\n  While the U.S. average is 7.4 percent, the production in New England \nhas been held to a low, you could say, of 2.2 percent--but also meeting \nthe other laudable goals. So this is a very important fact to note.\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\n  No. 4, the critics will say that a dairy compact is a trade barrier \n``balkanizing'' the dairy market. Let me please reiterate that dairy \ncompacts regulate all fluid milk sales in the compact region, \nregardless of where the milk is produced.\n  So if a farmer in another region had a relatively low price, and \nthought the compact price was higher, that farmer is not at all \nprohibited, in our legislation, from selling their milk into this \nmarket. So it is not a barrier. It encourages free trade, fair trade, \namong the regions.\n  Fifth, our critics say dairy compacts will raise retail milk prices. \nLet me concede this point. It does raise milk prices slightly. The \nAgriculture Department's Economic Research Service has done a study on \nthis, and the facts are in. It does raise prices to consumers slightly. \nThat price is $1.06 per person--$5 a year for a family of four.\n  I can honestly say I do not know of a family in America that would \nnot be willing to pay $5 a year so they can have available to them a \nsupply of regionally produced milk that is fresh and healthy, and \nknowing that they are doing something to help their farmers that is \nfair to their retailers and does not in any way hurt low-income \nconsumers. Let me repeat, there is not a family in America, I don't \nbelieve, who would not be willing to pay $5 a year for the benefits \nthis compact provides.\n\n  Six, the fiction that the dairy compact will hurt low-income \nconsumers. One of the programs I have supported, as have many of the \nSenators, is WIC, the Women, Infants and Children's program, a Federal \nprogram that is very successful and that supplies milk to low-income \nmoms and their infants in the School Lunch Program. People representing \nWIC and consumers representing the school lunch program are on these \ncompacts within the region. Their voices are heard and well \nrepresented.\n  Finally, as I conclude--the Senator from New Jersey will speak more \neloquently and in greater length and detail about this particular \nissue--this is also an environmental issue. As our dairy farmers \nbasically serve now as rings of green around many of our urban areas, \nthis is true in Louisiana, but it is particularly true in States such \nas New Jersey or New York, and what farms are left in places such as \nFlorida and in California. If we can do something to help the dairy \nfarmers stay in business, we keep this land green; we keep it open; we \nkeep the possibility for the proper kind of development in the future. \nIf we don't step in and help our dairy farmers, we will not only lose \ndairy farmers potentially over the long run, driving up the price of \nmilk, being unfair when there is a fairness to be reached here, but we \nwill see some of these farms plowed under in additional development.\n  Let's do the right thing by instituting voluntary compacts that will \nhelp not only the States in the South but also in places around the \ncountry. There is a tremendous amount of support.\n  I believe I have exhausted the time I have. There are many more \nSenators who want to speak. I yield for a question to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield without losing the right to the \nfloor, I ask first, how much time does the Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am happy to yield without losing the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think the Senator from Louisiana would agree with me \nthat one of the problems we have is the huge growth of one major \nprocessor. We are talking about a situation where we have a program \nthat should be embraced by everybody. The cost to the taxpayers is \nabsolutely nothing, I believe the Senator from Louisiana will agree. \nThe cost to the taxpayers is absolutely nothing.\n  We are being asked to take huge amounts of tax dollars from various \nparts of the country, a lot of it from the eastern seaboard, to pay for \nprograms in the Midwest. This is a program that costs taxpayers \nabsolutely nothing. You might wonder why the big processors have spent \nmillions of dollars to try to beat it through lobbying and every other \npossible effort. One of the reasons is, we see in our part of the world \nin New England, Suiza Foods is trying to get a stranglehold on prices.\n  When Suiza started in Puerto Rico, it was down here with three \nplants. That is the way it started. But then Suiza started moving, and \nin the year 2000, look at the area they cover with their plants. Now \nthey want to combine with Dean Foods. Here is a company that, if they \ncould get rid of all competition, if they could control the price the \ndairy farmers get, if they could tell the consumers, you are going to \npay this much and, by the way, dairy farmers, because we are the only \ngame in town, we are only going to give you this much, that is \ncompetition? They call us a cartel.\n  What we are saying is, let the consumers and the producers within the \nregion decide what they are willing to pay. It has worked out well for \nus. We pay less, for example, in New England, where we have the \ncompact. We pay less than they do in Minnesota and Wisconsin, if you go \nto the grocery store for the milk.\n  Where is the pressure coming from and why do they want to get rid of \nthis compact? Why do they want to get rid of the dairy farmers having \nany say over it? So that Suiza and Dean Foods, which are becoming a \nmonopoly and want to control all of it--it is actually a ``Suizopoly,'' \nI would call it, at this point--can say just how much can be spent, \nwhere it can go. In fact, when we checked into this, we found that 90 \npercent of the cost increase goes to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Louisiana has \nexpired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute so I may finish. Senator Leahy was asking me a question. Could I \nhave 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from New Jersey is now \nrecognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, for purposes of a unanimous consent \nrequest only, I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1191, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just by brief explanation, there is not \ngoing to be time to debate this amendment adequately this evening. We \nare calculating a vote count, and I want to give my colleagues notice \nthat this amendment may well be introduced tomorrow. I do have the \nabsolute right to withdraw it, as the Chair has recognized, and \ntherefore the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized \nunder the previous order.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, for purposes of a unanimous consent \nrequest only, I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be given 5 minutes after \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nLouisiana so she may conclude her remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey. I \nso appreciate the comments of Senator Leahy from Vermont, who has been \none of the great leaders and spokespersons on this issue. I wanted 30 \nseconds to wrap up to say how important this issue is for farmers not \nonly in the southern part of the Nation. Of course, Louisiana is the \nState I represent. I have heard loudly and clearly from our farmers \nabout how important this is.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, this is an issue of fairness for the whole \nNation. We are not attempting to be unfair to any particular area. This \nis about competition. It is about free and fair trade.\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\nIt is about self-help, managing risk, and about an idea that a compact \ncan be beneficial to all parties involved.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact, enacted in 1996, and due to expire this \nyear, has proven extremely successful in balancing the interests of \nconsumers, dairy farmers, processors, and retailers, by maintaining \nmilk price stability, and doing so at no cost to taxpayers.\n  We have an opportunity to assure consumers in other states an \nadequate, affordable milk supply while maintaining positive balance \nsheets for our farms, whose social and economic contributions remain so \ncritical to the vitality of our country's rural communities. It is long \npast the time for us to permit states the opportunity to provide their \nfarmers the stability they so desperately need.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for allowing me to finish my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nwithdrawn his amendment for the moment. But the Senate should be under \nno illusions. The amendment will return, and this fight will go on. It \nwill go on tonight. It will go on tomorrow. It will go on next week. It \nwill go on.\n  There are States in this Union that have asked, to protect their own \ninterests, to be able to be in dairy compacts--States in the South, \nStates in New England, and States in the Northeast.\n  As sovereign members of the United States of America, the \nlegislatures in our States have voted to join these compacts. It is a \nright that no one should deny us. We have a right to it; we have a need \nfor it; and we are going to insist on it.\n  This can be an important day in agricultural policy in the history of \nthis country. For a long time, States such as my own, because we care \nabout the Union and we care about farmers across America, have remained \nsilent. I have voted for wheat programs and corn programs and peanut \nprograms and cotton programs. I have voted for crops I have never heard \nof.\n  I do it because it is in the national interest. It is usually not in \nthe interest of the State of New Jersey. This is in our interest, a $17 \nbillion agricultural appropriations bill. If one takes the entire \nNortheastern part of the United States, the most densely populated part \nof the country which pays the highest taxes in America, we have $200 \nmillion worth of appropriations of $17 billion. Enough. Enough.\n  Every time there is an emergency, every time there is an agricultural \ndisaster, every time some farmer has a problem, the Senators from \nMaryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, and Maine come \nto this floor to do our duty because we want to support the country.\n  Now we want support. Our dairy farmers are not in trouble. They are \nout of business. We ask for no money. We want a compact.\n  This compact will not cost the American taxpayers a dollar, not a \ndime. It supports prices, because without those price supports we \ncannot remain in the dairy business. The price of land in New Jersey \nwhere dairy farmers operate is $10,000 an acre, $25,000 an acre. The \ntaxes dairy farmers pay could be $100,000. Their labor costs are high. \nTheir energy costs are high.\n  What is it we are to do, have no farmers left in New England, none in \nthe mid-Atlantic, close down agriculture in the South? That is what \nthis is about. What is it we ask that is so unreasonable? We are not \nasking for any money. We take nothing away from any other State. We \nonly ask the actions of our own legislature be recognized.\n  America is changing. From Washington, D.C., to Boston, MA, the Nation \nis becoming one massive suburb. Shopping centers follow shopping \ncenters, malls follow malls, highways upon highways. We do not fight \nfor agricultural prices. This amendment is not just about how much a \ndairy farmer earns; it is about not losing the last of our agricultural \nland. It is about the great environmental issue of this decade, \nstopping the destruction of open space.\n  Since 1961, New Jersey, which had 128,000 dairy cows, is down to \n20,000 cows, a loss of 108,000 producing dairy cows. Since 1950, when \nthe State of New Jersey had 26,900 farms with 1,200,000 acres, we have \nlost a quarter of the acreage and have but a little more than 9,000 \nfarms left from 26,900.\n  It is about saving land. It is about a way of life. It is about a \nlocal culture. A quality of life depends upon more than suburban row \nhouse upon suburban row house. It is a chance to drive with one's child \nthrough some open space. A healthy life and a good community is about \nnot having to buy milk that comes in on a railroad car from halfway \nacross the country but a local farm, with a fresh product, whether it \nis tomatoes or corn or fresh milk.\n  For 200 years, from Maryland to Maine, people who have lived in the \nNortheast and New England have enjoyed that quality of life. It is \nbeing lost, and that is what this is about.\n  Two years ago, I came to the Chamber to wage the same fight. Since I \nspoke 24 months ago for this same amendment, when we lost, the number \nof dairy farms in New Jersey has declined from 168 to 138, another 17 \npercent loss.\n  In the last decade, we have lost 42 percent of our remaining dairy \nfarms. I was here 2 years ago. I am speaking about it again tonight. If \nnecessary, I will speak about it 2 years from now. It is clear to me, \nif we fail tonight, there will be no one left to defend. This is our \nlast stand.\n  I hand it to my colleagues in the Midwest. Win this fight one more \ntime and we may never have to raise it again. There will be no dairy \nfarmers left in my State. Give it another 10 years, there will be none \nleft in New York. Give it 20 years, there will be none left in Vermont.\n\n  It will be a success. Congratulations; some working class people, who \nhave lived on the land for 200, 300 years, produced fresh produce for \ntheir neighbors, were put out of business. They were not put out of \nbusiness to save the Federal Government money, because the amendment \ncosts no money, but just to deny our own State the right to set a price \nso a farmer can get a decent return on his money.\n  What is the real price? It is the 138 dairy farmers who remain. It is \nthe loss of a quality of life from the fresh produce for local people \nand fresh milk. It also means this: Next year, like this year, another \n10,000 acres of New Jersey will be plowed under to suburban \ndevelopment. We have lost 600,000 such acres in recent decades.\n  For almost 2 years, this has accelerated because the USDA has \nrepeatedly announced plummeting milk prices that have directly lowered \nthe ability of dairy farmers to earn a living. Prices have dropped as \nmuch as 40 percent in a month, and middle class farmers with high costs \nhave had to absorb this cost.\n  The result is known. I have already told it. They go out of business. \nThere is no other answer but to allow this compact to go ahead.\n  I cannot say it might not cost consumers some money. One estimate is \nit could cost 4 cents, though, indeed, in New England, after they \njoined, their prices actually declined. It may be 4 cents more; it may \nbe 4 cents less if the State is in the compact, but it does provide \nprice stability.\n  I do not know a person in New Jersey, if it did cost 4 cents, who \nwould not pay it to know that the last of our agricultural land is not \ngoing to be lost. It would be a fair bargain for consumers and for our \nquality of life.\n  There are those who will argue maybe it does not cost consumers more \nmoney, maybe it saves the land, but it does cost Federal benefit \nprograms money, programs such as WIC for children, for families, or \nschool milk programs. The compact, by law, is required to reimburse \nFederal nutrition programs such as WIC and school lunch programs that \nuse 68 million pounds of milk per year, many in my State, to ensure \nthey do not have higher costs. They are protected under these \nprovisions.\n  Nothing I am suggesting to the Senate is theoretical in its benefit. \nThe compact is not new. New England has had a compact. It worked. It \nstabilized retail milk prices and provided a safety net for producers. \nIndeed, New England retail milk prices were 5 cents per gallon lower on \naverage than retail milk prices nationally following the Northeast \nDairy Compact initiation. It did not cost consumers money. It saved \nconsumers money, while costing the Federal Government nothing.\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\n  On September 30, the compact for New England expires. The \nconsequences are enormous, and it will help my colleagues to understand \nwhy we come to the Senate across the South, across the mid-Atlantic, \nacross New England, to insist on its reauthorization, because the price \nis so high and the consequences so devastating that no matter what it \ntakes, we cannot allow this legislation to go forward without Senator \nSpecter's amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his excellent remarks. I wish to \nsay, before I ask him a question, I join with him. This is of vital \nimportance to the close to 8,000 dairy farmers in New York in countless \ncommunities.\n  I say to the good Senator from Indiana--and I respect his view--his \ncorn farmers and his soybean farmers get plenty of subsidy. We are \nnever going to get a dairy subsidy to that extent. So if we do not get \nthis compact, I ask my colleague from New Jersey, is it his opinion \nthat the dairy farms in the Northeast will eventually just die and we \nwill have no dairy industry whatsoever?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I respond to the Senator from New York, as I \nindicated perhaps before he entered the Chamber, 40 percent of the \ndairy farms in New Jersey in the last 10 years have been lost. I am not \ncertain any will survive the next 10 years if there is not a dairy \ncompact.\n  The situation in my State is somewhat more acute than New York, but \ncertainly the pattern of the rate of decline is the same.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, we have lost half of our \ndairy farms in the last 10 to 15 years, and if one talks to dairy \nfarmers, one will find they are all in such desperate shape that they \nwill go under as well.\n  I say to my friend, the Senator from New Jersey, it is an anomaly: We \nhave all sorts of price supports, taxpayers' money for so many of the \nrow crops that dominate the Middle West, that are prevalent in the \nSouth and other parts of the country. I do not know why dairy was left \nout of that, but it was.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Jersey has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent he be given 2 additional minutes \nso he can answer my question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I object. I will agree if I and Senator \nKohl can have 5 minutes by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I modify my request that the Senator from New Jersey be \ngiven 2 minutes, and I believe Senator Kohl is to be given an \nadditional 5 minutes, because I think he has 5 right now.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I so ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleagues from Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n  The bottom line is very simple, and that is that we will never get \nunder this situation, or any other, the dollars we need, and so the \nchoice is the dairy compact or the death of dairy farms in the \nNortheast. Does the Senator disagree with that analysis?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. It is the loss of dairy farms, and we are not doing \nin our region what other States did and by right we are entitled to do. \nWhen their farms and products were in trouble, they asked for Federal \nappropriations. We asked for no appropriation. We asked for the right \nfor a fair price for our dairy farmers.\n  When I began my remarks, I quoted the remarks of the Senator from New \nYork in the caucus that there is a $17 billion appropriations bill and \nour entire region of the country is getting $200 million in \nappropriations. In the next couple days, when we object to the bill and \nSenators ask how can you jeopardize this entire legislation for the \nwhole country, recognize this is what matters for us, and it may be all \nthat is in the bill that matters, and that is why we are going to take \na stand here and do what is required across the region, across the \nSouth to ensure these few remaining farms can survive.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for his support and leadership, and \nI thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for offering the amendment. We \nwill be back to fight another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the dairy compacts \nthat exist and are being proposed, and it is for very good reason. We \nhave never had price-fixing arrangements in the history of our national \neconomy.\n  When the Articles of Confederation were proposed, they understood we \nneeded a national unified economy, and the beauty of our economy today, \nwhich makes it the envy of every country in the world, is that in the \nUnited States of America, since we started, every product and every \nservice has unimpeded access in all 50 States. That promotes \ncompetition, that promotes excellence in quality, and that promotes the \nbest prices for our consumers.\n  What they are proposing right now is that we invalidate that concept \nand we start going down the road of price-fixing cartels, arrangements \nthat will allow for no competition pricewise and, as a result, for \naccess basically from one market to another in the case of milk.\n  Once we start doing that, then we have to recognize that other \ncommodities and other products will come to the Senate asking for the \nsame consideration. If we allow that for milk, then we certainly have \nto recognize that other commodities and other products have the right \nto make the same arguments.\n  What will happen 10 years from now or 20 years from now when we \nbalkanize the American economy by virtue of price arrangements between \nStates based on commodities that they share? We will have an economy in \nwhich the consumer will pay. When we have price-fixing arrangements and \nallow producers to get more than what the market would normally allow \nthem to get, inevitably, always the consumer pays and inevitably, we \nwill begin to destroy this great national economy we have built up over \nthe past 200-plus years.\n  With respect to the loss of dairy farms, I come from the Middle West, \nand statistically we have lost as large a percentage of our dairy farms \nas they have in the Northeast. We have lost between 30 and 40 percent \nof our dairy farms over the past 20 years. That is statistically \nexactly what has happened in the Northeast. Their situation is not \nunique.\n  The answer is not to balkanize that industry or any other industry \nand pit one region against another. The answer is to have a national \npolicy that covers the existence and the proposed prosperity of all \ndairy farmers everywhere, not just in the Northeast. The answer will \nnever be, in my judgment, price-fixing arrangements because, as I said, \nunder those conditions, inevitably the consumer pays, and that is not \nwhat we do in this country. That is not how our economy operates.\n  I am suggesting the reason this amendment has been pulled, basically \nbecause it does not have the votes, is because a majority of the \nSenators--and this is bipartisan--a majority of the Senators recognize \nthat price-fixing arrangements between States on commodities is not the \nway in which we want this economy to begin to progress into the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider in the days ahead what may or may \nnot occur by way of trying to balkanize the dairy industry from one \nState to another. I do not think it has ended yet. I think it is going \nto be discussed again. But if there is an honest and fair vote in the \nSenate, which is the only way to determine policy on any issue but \ncertainly on an issue as important as this one, we will not support \ndairy compacts. They do not make any sense. There are other ways to \ndeal with the problem, not just in the dairy industry but in the \nagricultural industry because we have to recognize that it is not just \nthe dairy industry which is in trouble in America; it is the entire \nagricultural sector, one product after another, one commodity after \nanother. It is not just in the Northeast; it is in the\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\nMiddle West, it is in the Plains States, it is in the North and in the \nSouth.\n\n  The agricultural industry has not found a way to provide prosperity \nfor all of our farmers. We have been struggling with it. We all know \nthat as Senators. But now the dairy industry comes along and says: Let \nus balkanize our industry and let us be allowed to set prices for which \nthe consumer will pay more.\n  That is a huge step, and before we take it, we need to have much more \nextensive debate on the agricultural industry in this country and how \nwe are going to deal with that, including the dairy industry.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota. I ask unanimous consent that if there is no objection, the \nSenator from Wisconsin be allowed to speak after the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, how much time do I have allotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin for his leadership on behalf of the dairy producers of his \nState and my own State on this matter. I thank also the chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, and the ranking member, \nSenator Lugar, who have collaborated on this legislation with some \ndisagreements.\n  What has been important in this undertaking is a recognition that \ntimeliness of this legislation to benefit all the farmers of America in \nsome form or another is very critical. It is unfortunate, in my view, \nthat this matter has been offered at this time.\n  I say that with all due respect to my distinguished colleagues who \nhave sponsored and who have cosponsored this amendment. It is terrible \neconomic policy; it is terrible agricultural policy; and it is terrible \nnational policy.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact as it exists today confers a substantial \nstatus on six States. It is a cartel. It is legalized price fixing, and \nit is economic discrimination against States such as Minnesota and our \ndairy producers.\n  Now, according to this amendment which has been withdrawn but which \nmay be brought forward again or inserted into the conference committee \ndeliberations, in order to protect their own special deal, they propose \nto make a series of Faustian pacts with other States. We learn today \nthat under this proposed legislation, the Southeastern States of our \ncountry would get their special deal; the Pacific Northwest States \nwould get their special deal; and other States in the country would get \ntheir special deal. I guess the theory is if you make enough deals, \nmaybe it will add up to 51 votes on the Senate floor.\n  It is a siren song, the false awareness of brief economic advantage \nat other people's expense. It is a beggar-thy-neighbor approach to \neconomic and farm policy, and it will be the death knell, if \nsuccessful, of a national farm policy. It will be the death knell to a \nnational unified dairy program, which is what should be the focus of \nthe new farm bill.\n  Instead, it will result, as my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin \nand my distinguished friend from Minnesota have said already, in the \nbalkanization of the United States dairy industry, pitting one region \nof the country against another, with everybody conniving and conspiring \nto undercut everyone else, the direct opposite of what we need in order \nto have a sensible national agricultural policy, which is what the \nchairman and the members of the Agriculture Committee are trying to put \ninto place.\n  We have had hearings for the last several weeks on the supplemental \nAgriculture bill, and this subject has never been brought forward. We \nhave had hearings even on the new farm bill, which we will be taking up \nin the fall. There are differences of opinion from one group to \nanother. There are different economic interests at stake. But not a \nsingle other commodity group has proposed a program which benefits the \nproducers of one region of the country at the expense of others.\n  Now there is one exception where the dairy producers of one region \nare trying to bring in others on their side who see a market in balance \nbetween supply and demand that is temporarily to their benefit, saying \nwe want our own cartel. Our producers are included; their producers are \nexcluded.\n  The proponents say--I have heard it on the Senate floor--we have a \nright to this. We are not asking for anything. We have a right to this \nkind of economic policy. I could not disagree more. The proponents are \nasking for the right to violate the U.S. Constitution. They are asking \nfor the right to violate the basic principles, both economic and \nsocial, of one nation comprised of 50 States, not one State comprised \nof 50 countries, not one State balkanized into eight separate economic \nregions, each one looking out only for itself.\n  The economic problems afflicting American dairy producers are very \nreal. The problems afflicting Vermont dairy producers, New Jersey, and \nPennsylvania farmers are very real. The economic problems afflicting \nMinnesota dairy producers are very real, as they are in our neighboring \nState of Wisconsin. To the States which have supported this amendment, \nand others who think they might benefit temporarily from these \narrangements, let's work together on behalf of all of our dairy \nproducers over the next few months. Let's work together on behalf of \nthe entire U.S. dairy industry over the next few months and incorporate \nthis national interest, a common national interest into the new farm \nbill. That is the direction I believe we should take with this \nproposal.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. It is wonderful to \nhave a new and strong ally on this issue from Minnesota. I thank my \nsenior colleague, Senator Kohl, for his tremendous leadership on this \nissue. It is a great concern to everyone in our State of Wisconsin.\n  I rise today in opposition to this effort to expand and extend the \nNortheast Dairy Compact. As the senior Senator from Wisconsin has said \nmany times, it is a price-fixing dairy cartel that hurts dairy farmers \noutside the compact region.\n  In fact, a few days ago, the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, \nheld a hearing on the record of the dairy compact. I do commend the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for allowing both those for and \nagainst the compact to have a chance to testify. I was there for the \nwhole hearing. Sometimes we have hearings around here that maybe we can \ndo without, but this was very useful.\n  It clearly showed Congress should not renew or expand the compact.\n  I thought that the most compelling testimony came from two people: \nRichard Gorder, a Wisconsin dairy farmer, who spoke about the compact's \nimpact on dairy farmers outside the compact region, and Lois Pines, a \nformer Massachusetts State Senator and former compact supporter, who \ndetailed her opposition to the compact.\n  Mr. Gorder outlined better than any other witness the true impact of \nthe dairy compact on dairy farmers outside that region. Given that Mr. \nGorder was the only dairy farmer to testify at the hearing, I think it \nwould benefit my colleagues to hear how he described how the compact \noperates.\n  According to Mr. Gorder:\n\n       Regional dairy compacts place a floor under the price of \n     milk used for fluid purposes in the compact region. This \n     artificial price increase creates an incentive for more milk \n     production in the region, yet represses the consumption of \n     fluid milk in that area. The surplus that results finds its \n     way into manufactured milk products such as cheese, butter, \n     and milk powder.\n       While dairy compacts insulate that market from competition \n     by placing restrictions on milk entering the compact region, \n     they impose no restrictions on the surplus milk and milk \n     products that must leave the region in search of a market. As \n     a result, the market distortions of dairy compacts have a \n     negative effect on prices of producers in non-compact states.\n\n  Mr. President, an expanded compact will cause Wisconsin dairy farms \nto lose between $64 million and $326 million per year. Whichever number \nis used, the long range consequence would be even greater if you were \nto calculate the economic impact to our rural communities.\n  I thought that former Senator Pines' testimony was also incredibly \ncompelling. Here is a former state senator--the chairman of the \ncommittee that\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\nhelped push through the compact--who is now calling the dairy compact a \nfailure.\n  She detailed how the Northeast Dairy Compact hasn't even stopped the \nloss of small farmers in the Northeast. According to the American Farm \nBureau Federation's data, New England has lost more dairy farms in 3 \nyears under the compact--465--than in the 3 years prior to the compact.\n  Let me read from former Senator Pines' statement:\n\n       The evidence clearly shows that Compact supporters were \n     wrong about how the Compact would save small family farms and \n     protect the region's consumers . . . the claims made by \n     compact supporters have had two debilitating impacts on state \n     and federal policy process:\n       (1) they have grossly misled hundreds of lawmakers in \n     Congress and state legislatures, including myself, and \n     persuaded them to mistakenly give their support to compacts: \n     and\n       (2) they have diverted lawmakers' attention from developing \n     and implementing policies that could rally help to keep small \n     dairy farmers on the land, genuinely protect consumers, and \n     effectively preserve open space in rural New England.\n\n  Not only does the Northeast Dairy Compact not help save New England \nfarmers because it gives the vast majority of its subsidies to large \ndairy farms, it also aggravates the inequities of the Federal milk \nmarketing order system by allowing the Compact Commission to act as a \nprice fixing entity that walls off the market in a specific region and \nhurts producers outside the region.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission is empowered to set \nminimum prices for fluid milk higher than those established under \nFederal milk marketing orders. Never mind that farmers in the Northeast \nalready receive higher minimum prices for their milk under the \nantiquated milk pricing system.\n  The compact not only allows these six States to set artificially high \nprices for specific regions, it permits them to block entry of lower \npriced milk from producers in competing States.\n  This price fixing mechanism arbitrarily provides preferential price \ntreatment for farmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers in \nother regions who work just as hard, who love their homes just as much, \nand whose products are just as good or better.\n  It also irresponsibly encourages excess milk production in one region \nwithout establishing effective supply control. This practice flaunts \nbasic economic principles and ignores the obvious risk that it will \ndrive down milk prices for producers outside the compact region.\n  The dairy compact is unconstitutional. Compacts also are at odds with \nthe will of the Framers of our Constitution. In Federalist No. 42, \nMadison warned that if authorities were allowed to regulate trade \nbetween States, some sort of import levy ``would be introduced by \nfuture contrivances.''\n  I would argue that the dairy compacts are exactly the sort of \ncontrivance feared by Madison. Dairy compacts are clearly a restriction \nof commerce, and, in effect, they impose what amounts to a tariff \nbetween States. The Founding Fathers never intended the States to \nimpose levies on imports such as those imposed by one nation on \nanother's goods.\n  At the recent judiciary hearing, we heard this same argument from \nProfessor Burt Neuborne, who has taught constitutional law for 25 \nyears. Professor Neuborne said:\n\n       [the compact] violates the commerce clause, as well as the \n     Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, section 2, as \n     well as the 14th Amendment . . . and is an inappropriate and \n     possibly unconstitutional exercise of Congress' power.\n\n  Mr. Neuborne continued to say that:\n\n       The Founders abandoned the Articles of Confederation in \n     favor of the Constitution in order to eliminate the rampant \n     protectionism that threatened to destroy the United \n     States.\n\n  The compact is exactly the type of protectionist barrier the Founders \nworried about.\n  More than anything, the compact debate is about fairness to all dairy \nfarmers. Over the past 50 years, America's dairy policy has put \nWisconsin dairy farmers out of business by paying Wisconsin dairy \nfarmers less for their milk. In 1950 Wisconsin had approximately \n150,000 dairy farms and we are now down to about 18,000.\n  Do we pay sugar growers more in Alaska? No. Do we pay orange growers \nmore in New York? No. Do we pay avocado farmers more in Indiana? No, \nand we shouldn't. We have one nation, one dairy market, and we should \npay all dairy farmers--regardless of where they live--the same price \nfor their milk.\n  As I said earlier, dairy farmers in the northeast and southeast \nalready receive more for their milk. The compact makes the situation \nworse by walling off the majority of the country from receiving milk \nfrom outside the compact.\n  I urge my colleagues who support compacts to go to a farm in Marathon \nCounty, WI, and explain to the family who have owned their farm for \nthree generations that they have to sell their farm simply because they \nwill be paid less for their milk because of some political game.\n  Instead of focusing on regional dairy policies Congress must turn its \nattention to enacting a national dairy policy that helps all farmers \nget a fair price for their milk. Congress needs to follow the lead of \npeople like my senior Senator, Mr. Kohl, who has demonstrated that if \nwe work together, we can provide meaningful assistance to America's \ndairy farmers.\n  I believe Congress must enact a national dairy policy such as the one \nenvisioned by Senators Kohl and Santorum. This legislation brings a \nnational, unified approach to a national problem.\n  Who can defend the dairy compact with a straight face? This compact \namounts to nothing short of Government-sponsored price fixing that \nhurts producers outside the compact region. It is outrageously unfair, \nand also bad policy.\n  I hope that Congress will turn its attention away from dairy compacts \nwhich ultimately hurt both consumers and farmers. Its high time to \nbegin to focus on enacting legislation that helps all dairy farmers. \nAmerica's dairy farmers deserve a fair and truly national dairy policy, \none that puts them all on a level playing field, from coast to coast.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, the Southern Dairy Compact is an issue \nof tremendous importance to many Missouri farmers. Missouri has been \nlosing its dairy industry. Last year, we lost 171 herds and 5,000 cows. \nSome estimate this economic loss at up to $40 million.\n  Just over 2,000 class A dairy farms remain in Missouri. To survive, \nthey need milk prices to remain stable. Without assistance from a dairy \ncompact, farms in Missouri are likely to disappear at an even faster \nrate. Last year, the Missouri General Assembly passed legislation \nallowing the State to join the Southern Dairy Compact. My late husband, \nMel Carnahan, signed the legislation into law. Missouri dairy producers \nand the Missouri Farm Bureau support this measure as well.\n  I do not agree with critics of dairy compacts, who contend that \ncompacts encourage farmers to overproduce milk. Look at the track \nrecord of the Northeast Compact. Last year, only one State in the \nNortheast Compact, Vermont, saw its production increase. The increase \nwas by 2.8 percent, which is below the national average increase of 3 \npercent over the same period. Milk production in the other States in \nthe compact actually decreased.\n  Further, there have been practically no surplus dairy products \npurchased from the Northeast Compact region since the Compact was \nestablished. In spite of this, the Northeast Compact has taken \naggressive steps to discourage overproduction by providing incentives \nfor farmers not to overproduce.\n  We will do the same in the Southern Dairy Compact, even though \noverproduction is improbable in the Southern Compact States. Most of \nthe southern States, like Missouri, are net importers of milk.\n  Saving our small and mid-size family farms is an important issue for \nus in Missouri. Allowing Missouri to join the Southern Dairy Compact \ncould help many of these farmers. I hope that the Senate will be able \nto vote on this important issue in the near future.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Ohio wishes to offer \nan amendment this evening. We have talked to him, and he indicated he \nwants to do that tonight. That is fine.\n  What I wanted to talk about a little bit, as someone who is not \nheavily involved in farm policy but heavily involved in the \nlegislation, is I understand how the Senate works. I have no doubt in \nmy mind that this legislation is being given the perennial slow dance. \nWe are waltzing into nowhere. We tried to move this legislation last \nweek, Friday. We were on it on Monday. We were forced to file a cloture \nmotion just to be able to move on the bill, the motion to proceed.\n  This bill is very important to the breadbasket of America. The people \nwho raise and produce our food and fiber all over America need this \nvery badly. This is an emergency appropriation, an emergency \nAgriculture bill. Why? Because there are emergencies out in the farm \ncountry that we have heard talked about here in the last 2 days. The \nlegislation is going nowhere. I am very concerned about that.\n  We have an August recess coming up. We are told by the powers that be \ndowntown that this legislation has to pass or the farmers will lose the \nmoney that is set forth in this bill, billions of dollars around \nAmerica that will make the difference between farms staying in \nbusiness, farmers being able to stay on their farms, or, as one Senator \ntalked about today, whether another farm, another farm, another farm \nwill be leveled off and a shopping center will be built, or homes.\n  Family farms in America are threatened. They will become an even more \nthreatened species if we don't do something about this legislation.\n  It was interesting to me to hear the wide support for \nthis legislation. New Jersey is a heavily populated State. The Senators \nfrom New Jersey are concerned about this legislation. All over America \npeople are saying: We have to do something to help the farmers.\n\n  Yet the Senate is, as my friend from North Dakota has said, walking \nas if we are in wet cement. It is really hard to pull one foot out and \nget the other one in. We are going nowhere with this legislation.\n  The American public should understand that we understand that this \nlegislation is being stalled for reasons I do not fully understand. It \nis being stalled. I hope everyone understands we have waited around \nhere. An amendment was offered. We in good faith offered a motion to \ntable that amendment. It was tabled. What do we know, that amendment is \ngoing to be offered again. We can have another long debate and another \ntabling motion and proceed. I guess they could do it again and again.\n  It appears to me that the majority leader is going to have to arrive \nat a point where he is going to have to file cloture.\n  Everyone knows--I shouldn't say everyone knows, but I hope that this \ndiscussion tonight will help a lot of people understand, especially \nthose people in farm country, the States that are so dependent on these \nfarm programs, this is being held up by the other side, by the \nminority.\n  We are going to come to a time where we are going to have to wrap \nthings up for the August recess and, in effect, the farmers will end up \ngetting nothing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend, without losing my right, \nfor a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This has been a very frustrating time for a number of \nreasons. The Senate seems to have begun moving in slow motion, if that, \nin recent days and weeks. Last week I recall we had the Department of \nTransportation bill on the floor. We had very few workdays remaining \nbefore the August break and very important legislation to get finished \nor completed by then. Despite this, during proceedings on the \nDepartment of Transportation bill, the Senate was in quorum call after \nquorum call. No one would bring amendments to the floor. What we had, \nit appeared to me, was kind of a deliberate slowdown.\n  Now, we have brought an emergency Agriculture bill to the floor of \nthe Senate--an emergency supplemental. I understand some people would \nprefer to provide less money to family farmers who are in some trouble, \nsome real trouble because of collapsed grain prices. They would like to \nprovide less money. I understand that. They have a right to offer \namendments to reduce the amount of help for family farmers. We had one \nsuch amendment today, and the amendment lost.\n  It is a rather frustrating time because even to get to the emergency \nbill to help family farmers, we had to file a cloture motion to \nproceed, for gosh sakes, not even on the bill. It was a debate on \nwhether or not we should debate the bill. This is an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. That was on Friday. Then on Monday, \nwe had to vote on the cloture motion. Now we are at the end of the day \non Tuesday.\n  I ask the Senator a question, perhaps more appropriately answered by \nthe manager of the bill, the Senator from Iowa: Are we facing a \nprospect of seeing an end to this so we might be able to get this \npassed, have a conference, and get it completed by the end of the week? \nAre there amendments still pending? Are there amendments on our side?\n  I am told we are done with the amendments, we are ready to go to \nthird reading, and yet we were in a quorum call before we took the \nfloor. I understand the next amendment has nothing to do with this \nbill. Apparently there is one more amendment ready that is totally \nextraneous to an issue dealing with family farmers.\n  It is also the case, I understand, that there are other amendments \nbut no one knows what amendments or how many amendments or when we \nmight finish.\n  Are we in a circumstance where there is kind of a slow-motion march \ngoing on, not necessarily in the right direction? I might ask the \nSenator, if he knows, is there an end date we might expect the minority \nto be helpful to us in passing this legislation?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, the reason I am a little personally troubled about this, the \nSenator will recall last year, before the August recess, we passed \neight appropriations bills. How were they passed? Because we, as a \nminority, helped the majority pass those bills. My friend will remember \nthe many times the majority leader assigned the Senator from North \nDakota and this Senator to work through amendments, and we did that. We \nworked through hundreds of amendments in an effort to pass an \nappropriations bill.\n  The reason I feel personally concerned--I will not say my feelings \nare hurt because I am an adult and I understand how things work, but we \nare not being treated the same way we treated the majority, when we \nwere in the minority, in passing these appropriations bills. We thought \nit was important to get them passed, get them to the President. It \nseems to me that same philosophy is not here.\n  We have appropriations bills. For example, the Senator mentioned the \nTransportation appropriations bill. The House passed a bill, and the \nSenator from North Dakota wanted to offer an amendment. In effect, it \noutlawed Mexican trucks. I am being a little more direct, but basically \nthat is what it did. The two managers of the bill, Senators Shelby and \nMurray, offered a compromise, a midpoint. We could not even get that \nup. There was a filibuster on that, recognizing that if the President \nwas concerned about it, the time to take care of it was in conference.\n  In the Transportation appropriations bill, it appears they did not \nwant it passed. It did not matter how reasonable or unreasonable \nsomething was; they simply did not want it passed. We now have a \nsituation, I say to my friend, where we are not allowed, on the energy \nand water appropriations bill that I worked very hard on with Senator \nDomenici, to even get a conference on that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further for a \nquestion, I know my colleague from Iowa perhaps wishes to inquire as \nwell. I understand--and I think the Senator from Nevada understands--we \ncannot get anything done in this Chamber without cooperation. There is \nno question about that. Unless we all cooperate and find a way to \ncompromise, with some goodwill, the Senate will not get its work done. \nWe must get through certain legislation by a certain time. Unless we \nfind a way to cooperate, it does\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\nnot happen. That is because the levers in the Senate are substantial \nand can slow things down.\n\n  As I said yesterday, no one has ever accused the Senate of speeding \non a good day, but the ability to slow the Senate down or stop it is an \nability that almost any Senator has.\n  I also understand this is a difficult time in a lot of ways, and I \nunderstand there are some who are pretty negative about some of the \nthings we propose to do; for example, the transportation and the \ntrucking issue. On the legislation dealing with emergency help to \nfamily farmers, the Senator from Iowa has put together a bill that I \nthink is terrific legislation, and I am proud to support it. It is very \nhelpful and very important to family farmers. I know there are some who \ntake a negative view of it and I respect that.\n  I must say, when I think of that, I think of Mark Twain who was asked \nonce to engage in a debate. He said: Of course, as long as I can have \nthe negative side.\n  They said: We have not yet told you what the subject is.\n  He said: It does not matter. The negative side requires no \npreparation.\n  It is very easy to oppose almost anything. What we need to do is to \nask for some cooperation.\n  We are going to have to pass an emergency supplemental bill to help \nfamily farmers. We know that. We have provided for it in the budget. We \nknow we need to get this done, and everyone in this Chamber knows it \nhas to be done this week. We ask for some cooperation. We have so much \nmore to do than just this bill.\n  Is it not the case that we also have to do the VA-HUD appropriations \nbill; we need to finish the Department of Transportation appropriations \nbill; we have to get this emergency supplemental appropriations bill \ndone; we have the export bill we have to get done--all of this between \nnow and the end of this week?\n  My great concern is there seems to be no activity in the Chamber, and \nit is not because we do not want to get to a final conclusion on this \nlegislation. It is because those who want to thwart us from making \nprogress can easily do so, and at least have been doing so now for some \nnumber of days, beginning at least at the start of last week and \nperhaps partly the week before.\n  I ask the Senator: Is there a prospect of being able to make some \nprogress with this emergency legislation? If so, how can we do that and \nhow can we enlist the cooperation of the other side and say we need to \nhave our amendments and have our shot at these amendments and have a \nvote? if we lose we lose, but we at least move the bill and go to \nconference. I ask my colleague from Nevada, how can we accomplish that?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, who is a veteran legislator, we can \nonly get legislation passed when one is willing to compromise. \nLegislation is the art of compromise, the art of consensus building. We \ndo not have anyone willing to compromise at all. It is all or nothing, \ntheir way or no way.\n  It is too bad because the Senator is absolutely right. We have four \nthings the majority leader has said he needs to do before we leave. It \nis not that he is being arbitrary. First of all, the Export \nAdministration Act expires the middle of August, and the high-tech \nindustry of America needs that legislation very badly.\n  He did not drum this farm bill out of nowhere. It is something that \nhas to pass the experts downtown. The Office of Management and Budget \nhas said the money is lost if we do not pass this bill so it can go to \nfamily farmers. We have to do it, they say, by the August recess. The \nTransportation appropriations bill, we need to get that done. It is \nalmost all done anyway. Then, of course, there is VA-HUD. I was here \ntoday when the House sent this over. It is done in the House. We could \ndo that. Senators Mikulski and Bond have both come to me, they have \ncome to the minority leader and the majority leader, saying: When can \nwe do this? It will not take very long. But we are being prevented from \nmoving forward on legislation. I think it is too bad.\n\n  I see my friend from Oklahoma, my counterpart. I can reflect back \nthis past year, when we were in the minority, and Senator Lott said on \na number of occasions he appreciated our help in getting these things \npassed. We worked very hard to get bills passed. It does not seem there \nis reciprocation.\n  If it is payback time, we are not being paid back the way we paid \nout, and I hope there can be something done. For example, the Senator \nfrom Ohio believes very strongly about this issue. I have great \nadmiration for the Senator from Ohio. He was a great Governor. He is an \noutstanding Senator, and this is an issue in which he believes very \nstrongly. We have to get our financial house in order. I do not know \nhow many times we have debated this issue. When he and Senator Conrad \ncame the last time, they each received 42 votes. His amendment received \n42 votes; Senator Conrad's received 42 votes.\n  We can go through that same process again, and I am willing to do it. \nIt is an important issue, but it is not moving the legislation forward \nat all that is before this body.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Iowa had a question first, and then I will \nyield. I did not respond to the Senator from Iowa, who has a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I do have a question, \nand I want to proceed by saying we do not have any amendments on this \nside to the agricultural emergency bill. We are ready to go to third \nreading. We are ready to pass the bill right now.\n  We had a debate today on whether or not we wanted one level or \nanother level. It was a good, honest debate. We had the vote. One side \nlost and one side won. It would seem to me then we should move ahead.\n  I was dismayed this afternoon when the Senator from Pennsylvania \noffered the dairy compact amendment, which by the way is not even \ngermane to this bill. The dairy compact belongs in the Judiciary \nCommittee, not the Agriculture Committee. The Senator has a right to \noffer an amendment.\n  They yanked the amendment, but they are going to come back tomorrow. \nI am beginning to sniff something here. What I am smelling does not \nsmell very good. It smells like a deliberate attempt to slow down, if \nnot stop, this emergency Agriculture bill. I did not think that until \njust a little while ago. I hope I am wrong. I hope we can come in \ntomorrow and wrap this up in a short time, have a final vote and see \nwhich way the votes go, and then move on.\n\n  My question to the Senator from Nevada, our distinguished assistant \nmajority leader, is simply this: Is it not true that we in the Senate \nshould do what we think is in the best interest of the country to have \nthe votes and let the President decide what he wants to do at that \npoint in time?\n  The Senator spoke about this idea of working together. President Bush \ncame into office saying he wanted to work in a spirit of compromise. \nThat is what we have to do around here. We do have to compromise. We \nhave to work things out. But now there is some talk that the President \nhas said--I have not heard him say it, and we do not have a letter from \nthe President, but we have something from OMB saying his advisers will \nrecommend he veto the committee-passed bill which is before the Senate.\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada, is that what we are reduced to, we \ncannot do anything here unless the President puts his stamp of approval \non it?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, I mentioned briefly the \nTransportation appropriations bill. The President said he did not like \nit. If he did not like what was in the Senate bill, he must have hated \nthe bill which was passed by a Republican House.\n  In the Senate, we have a compromise worked out by Senators Murray and \nShelby, and we are told they are not going to let us do that; the \nPresident will veto it.\n  The Senator from Iowa has been a Member of Congress longer than I \nhave, and the Senator from Iowa knows the way the President weighs in \nis during the conference stage of legislation. That is why I have \ntalked off the Senate floor to my friend from Iowa indicating: Tom, I \nthink they are trying to stall this bill. The Transportation bill, \nobviously, they are doing that, and here we have the same thing.\n  If the President does not like this legislation, that is fine; he has \nveto power, and it is obvious his veto will be sustained. So why \ndoesn't he let us go\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\nto conference and the Senator from Iowa and his counterparts in the \nHouse, with Senator Lugar, can work this out and bring it back? That is \nthe way things are done.\n  If the President is going to say, unless the Senate does what I want, \nthe bill is going nowhere, and he instructs his people in the Senate \nthe bill is going nowhere, if that is the case, then we might as well \nbe taken out of it and have him declared the King.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We might as well have a dictatorship if we cannot do \nanything unless the President first says we are allowed to do it. I \nhope I am wrong. I refrained from saying anything about it since this \nafternoon, but it appears to me there may be a deliberate slowdown \nhere.\n  Again, I say to my friend from Nevada, I hope I am wrong. I hope we \ncome in tomorrow morning and dispose of amendments. I hope we can \npropose a time agreement tomorrow so we can vote on final passage of \nthis Agriculture emergency bill. Doesn't that seem like a logical way \nto proceed, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. REID. I have heard from the Senator from Iowa and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota that their States are so dependent on agriculture. It \nis difficult for me to comprehend. In Nevada, we grow garlic, a few \npotatoes, and lots of alfalfa. The States of Iowa and North Dakota are \ntwo examples. I heard the Senator from North Dakota say over 40 percent \nof the economy of the State of North Dakota is agriculture related. \nIowa is a huge part of that economy.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is our biggest industry.\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, both Senators have said, if this \nlegislation does not pass, what it will do to their States and what it \nwill do to their farmers. That, to me, indicates the President should \nallow us to move this bill along.\n  It appears to me this is all coming from the White House. The Senator \ndoes not have to agree. I understand. But it appears to me this is all \ncoming from the White House. We are being allowed to move nothing. \nNothing. We have had no conferences. The few bills we were fortunate \nenough to pass, we have had no conferences.\n  The President wants us to write the legislation he thinks is \nappropriate. The last measure we worked on, the Transportation \nappropriations bill, is a perfect example. It appears he wants it his \nway or no way.\n  I say to my friend from Iowa, I hope I am wrong. I told you earlier \ntoday I thought it was being slowed down, that it was going nowhere. I \nhope I am wrong.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hope so, too.\n  Mr. REID. I hope people say: Let's agree to go to final passage at 5 \no'clock and go to conference. The House is trying to adjourn Thursday. \nWe can have the conference Thursday. We will spend all night doing it. \nWe can do it. That is the way we used to legislate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am informed on this go-round I will be chairing the \nconference. I spoke with both the chairman and ranking member of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee today. They said we can go to conference \nand wrap it up in short order. I think that is true. Given a good \nmorning or afternoon, I believe we can work this out and come back with \na package that will be widely supported, but we cannot get there if we \ncannot get to a final vote on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, I saw the chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee in the Senate Chamber today.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And the ranking member.\n  Mr. REID. I did not recognize him.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, there is a pretty wide gap between what \nWashington thinks and what farmers know. This, after all, is about \nfamily farmers. That is what the issue is: emergency help for family \nfarmers. There are a whole lot of folks in the country struggling to \nmake a living. Prices family farmers receive--the price for \ncommodities--have collapsed to 1930 levels in real dollars.\n  I heard some people say: Things are improving. Yes, the price of \ncattle has improved, there is no question about that, but I guarantee, \nthere is no one who serves in the Senate who has seen their income \ndiminished in any way that resembles what has happened to family \nfarmers. Grain prices are still at a very significant low.\n  When one takes particular grains and say they are at a 17-year low or \n25-year low and then say they have improved slightly from that, the \nimprovement ``slightly'' does not mean very much. It doesn't mean much \nto family farmers if slight improvements in the prices they receive \nmeans they are going to go broke probably a few weeks later.\n  The fact is, our family farmers are in desperate trouble.\n  The point I make is this is an emergency supplemental bill dealing \nwith agriculture. It is in the budget, it is provided for, and we are \ntrying to get some help out as soon as we can to family farmers.\n  Last Friday, inexplicably we were confronted with the question of \nhaving to file a cloture motion on the motion to proceed. In plain \nEnglish, that means the other side said we had to have a debate about \nwhether or not we were going to have a debate on this issue. We said: \nThis is an emergency issue to help family farmers. These are, pardon me \nto others, America's last heroes, in my judgment. These are families \nout there struggling, working under a yard-light trying to keep it \ntogether. They are harvesting a crop--if they are lucky enough to get a \ngood crop--and trucking it to the elevator only to find they are \ngetting pennies on the dollar, 1930s prices in real value.\n  The fact is, they are hanging on by their financial fingertips trying \nto stay alive. And then when we came to this issue, we were told we \nhave to debate whether we are going to be able to debate.\n  I am sorry, there is something wrong with that. There is something \nthat misses the urgency of what ought to be done by the Senate to help \nfamilies who are in trouble.\n  I help a lot of people. I am someone who believes I have a \nresponsibility to invest in other States, in other regions. I support \nmass transit. We do not have a subway system in Bismarck, ND, but count \nme as a supporter because I believe it is important for our country to \ndo that for other areas. I support programs in virtually every other \narea in this country because I think it strengthens this country. \nInvestment in family farmers strengthens our country as well. This is \njust a small bridge. We have to build a bigger bridge for them in the \nnew farm program which comes next.\n  To get from here to there, we are trying to do this emergency \nsupplemental for Agriculture. It is just inexplicable to me that we \neven had to debate whether we would be allowed to debate. Once we got \ncloture, which says, ``It is OK, you won the debate; we can now \ndebate,'' we find ourselves at a parade rest. It is like watching paint \ndry, except paint seems to dry more quickly than good debate on this \nbill.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa--if the Senator from Nevada will yield to \nhim--on other appropriations bills we have traditionally worked with \neach other, have we not? Both sides say all right, how many amendments \ndo you have; this is how many we have; can we get time agreements; can \nwe work them out; can we find an end date so we can get these done?\n  We have always done that. I hope we can do that on this piece of \nlegislation because it is so important.\n  The only way we are going to accomplish anything, I fully understand, \nis to be able to elicit cooperation from both sides. We have to \ncooperate. I understand that. Anybody can stop this place. Throw a \nwrench in the crank case and it comes to a stop quickly. That is easy \nto do in the Senate.\n  Are we in a position, I ask the majority whip, where we are able to \nget perhaps the other side to say to us, and our side to say to them: \nHere are the total amendments we have. Let's work through them and find \nways to reach an understanding of how we will get this bill passed.\n  Are we able to do that? If not, why not?\n  Mr. REID. I proposed earlier today that we have a time for filing \namendments. No need to write it up. It will not happen. For those \nwatching, that means if we have an agreement, usually we have very \ncompetent staff write up a unanimous consent agreement so we can \npropound it. There was\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\nno need to write this up because there was no chance the other side \nwould agree in any way to limit amendments. We have no amendments on \nthis side.\n  We are not a bunch of farmers over here. I say that in a positive \nfashion. We are not a bunch of Senators representing only farm States. \nWe have a wide range of interests. We have been convinced the family \nfarmers are so important, agricultural interests are so important to \nthis country, we all support an emergency Agriculture bill. That is why \nall 51 on this side of the aisle support this bill. We want to move it \nquickly. If there is something wrong with it, I have enough confidence \nin the legislative process, and I recognize the President will be \ninvolved in it, that a different product will come back than what we \npass. We are not being allowed to pass anything out of here. That is a \nshame. It hurts the institution. It hurts the legislative process. Most \nof all, I am convinced after 3 days of debate, the family farms, the \nagricultural interests in the country are being hurt, and hurt badly, \nand some irreparably damaged if we do not pass this legislation by this \ncoming Friday or Saturday.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is important to keep in mind what we are trying to do, \nand I will preface that with a statement. We are trying to provide the \npayments to our farmers all over America the same basic rate of payment \nthey got last year. It is not more, just the same basic rate. We know \ninput costs have gone up; fuel is higher.\n  Mr. REID. ``Input'' means production costs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Production costs are higher. We want to get them the same \namount as last year. This is so important to my State. The difference \nbetween what the committee bill has and the amendment offered today by \nSenator Lugar is about $100 million. That is how much we are hurting in \nmy State.\n  If that amount of money is taken away, if we don't get that payment \nout, think of all the small town banks that have loans to farmers. \nThese are not Bank of America and Wells Fargo. These are small, country \nbanks. They have extended credit to these farmers. They have to pay \nback their depositors, too, just like any bank. Yet $100 million they \nwould not get; that would be less than what they got last year.\n  Think of the damage that would do to our economy in the State of \nIowa. In North Dakota, it is roughly half of that, $51 or $50 million \nin North Dakota. That is a big hit in a State such as North Dakota. \nThink of all the independent people, small town banks, implement \ndealers, feed stores, the seed companies, all the people up and down \nthe Main Streets who, in many cases, have extended credit to family \nfarmers, believing we are going to come in and do what the budget \nallows to be done. We are not asking for any more than what we got last \nyear.\n\n  If I understand correctly, the President says we have to take less. \nSomehow we can afford to get hit harder in rural America. We cannot \nafford to get hit harder. We have been hit hard in the last few years, \npretty darned hard. All we are asking is to make the same payments we \ndid last year. The budget allows for that--the budget passed by the \nRepublican Congress, I point out. The Republicans passed that budget. \nIn that budget, there is money to allow farmers to get 100 percent of \nthe market loss and oilseeds payments that were made last year.\n  If the budget allows it and the money is there, why should we not at \nleast get the payments out for our family farmers on the same basis we \ndid last year?\n  Mr. REID. The chairman of the Budget Committee has been on the floor \nfor the last 2 days we have been on this bill. Each day he has said, \nciting line and verse of the Budget Act, that the budget resolution \nthat was passed and the activity that has been generated by this bill \ndo not in any way violate the Budget Act. He talked again this morning \nabout this.\n  People are saying it is $2 billion over what it should be. I say to \nmy friend from Iowa and anyone within the sound of my voice, we had a \nvote on that today, in effect. The vote was, no; it is fine. The vote \nwas 52-48, as I recall. A close vote, but we have a lot of close votes, \njust like the Supreme Court makes a lot of close decisions. Even though \nthey are close, that is the law. A vote that is 52-48 carries the same \nweight as a vote 99-1.\n  For anyone who says this bill is a budget buster, I offered a motion \nto table the amendment of my friend from Indiana. I moved to table that \namendment because I felt the Senate should be able to speak as to \nwhether or not they felt it was too much money. Clearly, the Senate \nsaid it was not too much money.\n  I repeat, this matter should be passed out of the Senate so we do \nhave the opportunity, for the good of the farming community, \nagriculture all over America, for their benefit we should be able to go \nto conference with the House immediately. It should be in conference in \nthe morning.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We could be. We could be in conference tomorrow.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask a question?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my friend from New Mexico without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have been waiting to be heard for 6 or 7 minutes. How \nmuch longer before the Senator might be able to speak? The Senator has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that. I am about wound down. I think the \nSenator from Iowa is just about finished. Does the Senator from Wyoming \nhave anything to say?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I was going to say if you wanted to hear from the other \nside, a Senator is standing here. I wondered if you would give the \nSenator a chance to speak.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield the floor in a minute. Having served with my \nfriend from New Mexico for the years I have, no one ever has to worry \nabout his having the ability to speak. He always figures out a way to \ndo it. I have no problem yielding the floor in just a minute.\n  For the information of Senators, it appears clear there will be no \nmore votes tonight. I also say the Senator from Ohio wishes to offer an \namendment, and we will talk to the staff and perhaps we can work \nsomething out so when he finishes we can adjourn for the evening.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend, the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished majority whip for yielding, \nand Senator Harkin. I will take only a few minutes. My friend from Ohio \nhas been waiting for a long time.\n  I am listening tonight about how urgent matters are and how urgent it \nis we pass this measure tonight. I just want to make sure everybody \nunderstands that our farmers are in need of emergency relief provided \nin this bill. I hope my friend from Iowa is listening.\n  This Harkin measure was voted out of committee on July 25. The House \nbill came to the Senate on June 26--1 month before it was voted out by \nthe Ag Committee, which you chair, I say to my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa. So if there is 1 day's delay on the \nfloor because somebody really thinks that dairy compacts are important \nto their State, should it actually, in reality, even be insinuated they \nare the cause for delay when, as a matter of fact, the House bill has \nbeen here for 1 month?\n  The House bill is still something that is possible. If we pass the \nHouse bill, everything our farmers need is completed. This bill that is \nbefore us in the Senate, has the House relief and then it adds \nadditional spending into the next year--I am not arguing that the next \nyear is against the budget resolution, but why do we have to, in an \nemergency, do next year's spending when the emergency we are worried \nabout is this year?\n  I do not intend to stay here very long and debate the issue. I just \nthought it might be of interest to some, what the real facts are with \nreference to delay.\n  Having said that, I understand the great concern of the Senator from \nIowa about agriculture. I understand the Senators on the other side who \nhave gotten up and spoken today about agriculture. I do not want anyone \nto think that in the past 6 years while we were in control of the \nSenate we did not put very many billions--billions of dollars into \nemergency relief for the farmers. We did.\n  When I was chairman of the Budget Committee, on which I am now \nranking member--obviously, you can just go\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\nback and add it up--some years it was $8 billion in emergency money, \nother years we voted for $6 billion and $8 billion and $12 billion. So \nit is not anything new to have to vote or to be in favor of emergency \nrelief for our farmers. One of these days we need a better system, but \nfor now the world economy and a lot of other things are imposing on our \nfarmers in such a way that they do need help.\n  I am sure if the House bill were before us, with all of the emergency \nrelief that is needed for this year, without which many farmers will \nnot get what they are entitled to--if that were before us, it would \nprobably get no negative votes. We could pass it and be done with it.\n  Having said that, why did the Senator from New Mexico today object to \nproceeding with the amendment, with reference to dairies?\n  I am pleased to note that even though I objected to a time limit, it \nwas not the Senator from New Mexico who caused the delay. For some \nreason, the other side decided to pull the amendment. That is their own \nstrategy. I didn't have anything to do with that. I compliment them for \ntheir arguments in favor of the compact that was before the Senate as \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I would just like to say, all of us come here because from time to \ntime we are worried about legislation and its impact on our States. I \ncame to the floor earlier because I have been very busy and I was not \ntotally familiar with the compact amendments that were on the floor. I \ndid know, when I came to the floor, that they might impact my State. I \nhave now found they would impact my State in a dramatic way. All I want \nto do is tell the Senate what is happening to dairy in the United \nStates.\n\n  We are here talking about compacts protecting States as if that is \nthe only way to get milk products for American consumers. The truth of \nthe matter is, New Mexico and one other State are shining examples of a \ntotal departure from the idea of compacts, and a departure that says: \nInnovation. Let's do new things. Let's save real dollars for those who \nare consuming. We want to save on transportation, and under the compact \napproach you do not save on transportation.\n  New Mexico's dairymen are competing in their part of the country with \nnew technologies. They have new ways of treating milk before it is \ntransported. They make it lighter. When it gets to where it has to go, \nit is returned to its original form, and who benefits? There is no \nchange in the milk, and the beneficiaries are those who buy cheaper \nmilk and those who producer more and more milk in the herds that are \nnow grazing the landscapes of New Mexico and Idaho.\n  I want to say how important it is we let that happen, that we let \nthis innovation and competition happen. I am quite sure those who have \ncompacts feel just as strongly about their States and about what they \nare doing with small herds and the like, as I do about what is \nhappening in my State. I believe what is happening in my State and a \nfew others like it is the wave of the future. Innovation and \ncompetition are changing the face of business in all our States and it \nis going to change the production of milk and milk-related products, \njust as sure as we are standing here tonight.\n  In the year 2000, the dairy industry contributed over $1.8 billion to \nNew Mexico's economy. The producers had about 150 individual dairy \nfarmers, over 250,000 cows. That has grown since the early 80's and \n90's. These are just the numbers we have are for the year 2000. New \nMexico ranked 9th, believe it or not, in the total number of dairy \ncows; 10th in the total production of milk--5.23 billion pounds; 5th in \nthe production per cow, 20,944 pounds.\n  Some listening from other States probably cannot believe that is \nreally happening, but it is. Yes, it is. We continue to be the first in \nthe United States in the number of cows per herd, with New Mexico \ndairies averaging 1,582 cows per operation.\n  I am very sorry if in some States they have small operations. But I \nthink in the custom and tradition of the Senate that a Senator from New \nMexico who has this happening in his State, which is otherwise a rather \npoor State, should have enough time to come to the floor and discuss \nsomething as complicated and detrimental to our State--probably as \ndetrimental as any other legislation directly affecting New Mexico this \nwhole year.\n  New Mexico dairymen have a dramatic impact on local and regional \neconomies, from the hiring of labor to feed purchases. According to the \nNew Mexico Department of Labor, New Mexico dairies currently employ up \nto 3,183 people with an estimated payroll of $64.8 million. \nAdditionally, NM processors currently employ up to 750 people with an \nestimated payroll of $25.5 million. This is an industry that I am \ncommitted to fighting for.\n  Regional compacts could threaten this vital New Mexico industry. New \nMexico has a small population and with the numbers I just mentioned, it \nproduces a vast amount of milk. The future of the New Mexico dairy \nindustry depends on mechanisms that are conducive to allowing NM milk \nto be transported to other areas. Compacts prohibit this type of \nactivity.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact was established in mid-1997 as a short \nterm measure to help New England dairy farmers adjust to a reformed \nFederal milk marketing order system. Even though market order reform \nwas completed in late 1999, the Northeast compact was extended 2 \nadditional years. It does not need to continue.\n  The ``experiment'' with a Northeast Dairy Compact in the New England \nstates has provided evidence against existing dairy compacts and \npotential expansion of compacts into other regions. I would like to \ntake a moment and discuss why the Northeast dairy compact has been a \nfailure.\n  The stated goal of the Northeast compact was to reverse the steady \ndecline in the number of dairy farms in this country. The numbers \nsimply state the opposite has proved true. American Farm Bureau data \nindicates that New England lost more farms in the three years under the \ncompact 465 than in the 3 years just prior to the compact 444.\n  Most importantly, compacts are unconstitutional. Compacts blatantly \nundermine the commerce clause. One of the central tenets of the U.S. \nConstitution and a basic foundation of our nation is a unified economic \nmarket. We have never advocated for the right of States to unravel this \ncentral tenet of the U.S. Constitution, by allowing States to erect \neconomic walls against one another.\n  The higher prices paid by processors are passed on to consumers at \nthe retail level. Economic studies, including one ordered by the \nNortheast Compact Commission itself, have confirmed the pass-through \ncosts to consumers. These studies put the retail impact of the \nNortheast compact anywhere from 4\\1/2\\ to 14 cents per gallon of milk.\n  Additionally, compacts discourage farmers and cooperatives from \nfinding efficiencies in marketing, transportation and processing such \nas ultra-filtration and reverse osmosis technologies currently being \nused and improved upon by New Mexico dairymen.\n  This is definitely a commodity and an industry worth protecting. If \ncompacts are designed to protect dairy farmers and dairy farmers need \nprotection, then do it with a national, not a regional program. If \nthere are problems with the program, lets consider a national solution \nrather than expanding and extending divisive regional policies. A \nnational alternative will address the concerns of all dairy farmers, \nnot just those in compact States.\n  Compacts establish restrictions and economic barriers against the \nsale of milk from other regions, increase milk prices to consumers in \nthe compact region, and lead to a reduction in the price of milk paid \nto farmers outside the compact area. This is a quick fix not a national \nsolution. We need a policy that addresses the concerns of producers in \nall regions, without pitting farmers in one region against those in \nother regions, or interfering in the marketplace through artificial \nprice fixing mechanisms.\n  I fear the Northeast dairy compact has set some kind of precedent for \nregional price fixing for an agricultural commodity. This cannot \ncontinue. If we do not stop this right now, where will it stop? Will we \nsoon see a regionally fixed price for wheat to make bread? Or how about \nfruits and vegetables? Or will we soon see unelected regional \ncommissions fix prices for gasoline? Or coal? Or even lumber? These\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\nare all commodities that have a regional imbalance of production and \nconsumption, somewhat similar to milk, and the producers of these \ncommodities have seen hard times in recent history. I suggest regional \nprice fixing should end immediately.\n  To reiterate, I challenge the constitutionality of the compacts. I \nbelieve they will be challenged sooner or later. I believe the U.S. \nSupreme Court is moving in a direction where they will be declared to \nbe monopolistic. I think that is what is going to happen. But I do not \nwant to debate that as a lawyer or constitutional expert here on the \nfloor. I just want to say clearly I must, in all good conscience, \ndefend my State against what is going to happen if we proceed too \nquickly and we do not have a chance to thoroughly understand this \nmatter.\n  As I said, I have even studied the history of how we first got \ninvolved in these compacts. Actually, it was accidental. It was an \nemergency situation, and it was supposed to last for only 2 years. Two \nyears has led into many years beyond, and instead of just the \nNortheast, it is spreading throughout. So what we have are these kinds \nof compacts among States all over America except for States such as New \nMexico and perhaps Idaho.\n  We want to be competitive. We want to provide the very best products \nto as many American people as we can.\n  It is very important that we had this discussion today. I do not \nbelieve it is fair to characterize what has gone on here on this bill \nas any kind of excessive delay. You have a bill that exceeds what the \nPresident asked for and what the House passed by almost $2 billion. Use \nof that $2 billion will not occur until a year from now. It is not an \nemergency. Yet we have those saying if you do not let it pass, and let \nit pass quickly, you are unduly delaying what our farmers need.\n  It is very easy to decide how to fix this. Just take the 2002 money \nout of this bill and have it address a real emergency and let's vote up \nor down on it. That means we would not even have to go to conference. \nAll the farmers in our country who need their checks this year will get \nthem, and they will get them on time. Otherwise, it is very doubtful \nwhether they will.\n\n  Pass this bill with the 2002 money. That is not an emergency. Try to \npass it with anything like the compact and who knows where it will end \nup. The President isn't telling this Senator what to do. But I \nunderstand he will veto the bill. I understood where I was before I \nknew where he was, if anybody is interested on that side. Clearly, it \ndid not come from the President. My concern is as it affects New \nMexico.\n  I close by discussing what has happened in the last 10 years in the \nUnited States of America. It is a new economy. The United States has \nbasically changed the underpinnings of its economy. President Clinton \nsaid it. Our new President says it. Alan Greenspan says it. It is a new \neconomy in capital letters. It means we are changing. We are being \ninnovative. We are becoming more competitive. We are inventing and \nputting more things on the market. What does that increase? It \nincreases our productivity. Productivity is the key to the Social \nSecurity trust fund and to paying our seniors in the future. It is the \nkey to having surpluses in the future. Productivity can apply to every \nindustry, including dairy cows and milk production.\n  That is what we think ought to happen in America. We would like to \ncontinue to do it in our States. We would like for the Senate not to \nimpose upon them a cartel. States can in a sense in their own \ncircuitous way fix the product. Maybe you should strike ``fix the \nprice'' and make arrangements for what it will cost so we will not be \nlosing any pejorative words.\n  I am ready to discuss this tomorrow. I have been thoroughly apprised \nof the compact issue. I understand it, and I am willing to use a \nreasonable amount of time to discuss this tomorrow, and then proceed. \nBut what we think on this is not going to get this bill cleared and say \nit will pass and it will go to the President. It has a lot of hurdles. \nThe farmers need their money very quickly. We have already had a month \nwhen we could have produced a bill--at least 3\\1/2\\ weeks--for reasons \nwhich might be good. We didn't do that. But to complain right now that \nthis 1 day on the Senate floor is what is hurting our farmers is just \nnot true.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have heard it said on the floor a couple \nof times today that the Agriculture Committee is not moving this bill \nquickly enough. The fact is, the Agriculture Committee did not have a \nreconstituted committee until June 29. Following that, it did not have \nits full membership until July 1. Following that, the committee worked \n8 days. In 8 days, the bill came out of committee. It sounds like \npretty good work to me. Within 8 days we had a major piece of \nlegislation such as this coming out of the committee. Senator Harkin \nand Senator Lugar did a pretty good job.\n  I repeat: It could not move forward until the committee was \nreconstituted.\n  Last year we passed a bill similar to this. The agricultural \ncommunity has problems in different places every year. But they always \nhave problems. Last year we passed a bill with $7.1 billion. It was \nvery close to what we are trying to pass this year.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1212, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1212.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a substitute amendment)\n\n       Strike everything after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I have had an opportunity to listen \nto my colleagues talk about what is happening in the Senate in terms of \nprocedure. I had an opportunity to sit in the Presiding Officer's chair \nfor a lot of time during my first 2 years in the Senate. In fact, I was \nthe first member of the Republican Party as a freshman to get the \nGolden Gavel Award for 100 hours in the Chair.\n  I have to comment on what I am hearing on the other side of the aisle \nthat this side of the aisle is delaying the passage of bills. The same \ncomplaints being lodged against the Republican side of the aisle are \nthe same complaints the Republicans lodged\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nagainst the Democratic side of the aisle during my first 2 years in the \nSenate. It is deja vu all over again.\n  The fact is, some of us have some major concerns that we would like \nto have discussed in the Senate. We would like to have our point of \nview listened to and taken into consideration. For example, the dairy \ncompact was brought up and then withdrawn. I was very upset when this \nwas brought up last time. My State was opposed to the dairy compact \nbecause we thought extending it was not in the best interest of our \nState, but I never had a chance to vote on it because it came up in \nconference. It was done in that way.\n  I think some of us who are concerned about the dairy compact think it \nis unfair to the farmers in our respective States. For example, my \nState legislature would never have granted permission for Ohio to be \ninvolved in the dairy compact. We ought to have an opportunity to talk \nabout that in the Senate if we think it is something that is very \nrelevant, and we should at least have a chance to vote on it on the \nfloor, if that is the consensus of the Members of the Senate.\n  In addition, I have heard that this amendment I am bringing up this \nevening is not relevant to this farm bill. I happen to believe it is \nvery relevant to this farm bill. The farmers in my State are not only \ninterested in money for farmers and for agribusiness, but they are also \nvery interested in fiscal responsibility.\n  For example, I was at a meeting of farmers in Ohio a couple of weeks \nago. One of them asked me: Senator, why did you vote against the \neducation bill? My response was that the education bill increased \nspending by 64 percent. There was not another question about it in the \nroom. Someone said: Well, if you are going to increase education 64 \npercent over what you spent last year, that means there is not going to \nbe money for other priorities facing the Federal Government.\n  The Agriculture Supplemental for FY 2001, in my opinion, could be \npassed immediately tomorrow if my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would agree to the $5.5 billion that the House passed and to \nwhich the President agreed to sign. One of my great concerns is that \nbecause of the disagreement over the amount of money this might be \ndelayed. If it is not done before we go home, there is a good \npossibility that our farmers won't get the $5.5 billion that we want to \nprovide for them.\n  I suggest to my friends on the other side of the aisle that they \nagree to the $5.5 billion. Let's get it done, and let's get the money \nout so we can help our farmers.\n  In my opinion, to add another $2 billion that is going to come out of \nthe FY 2002 budget when we have a very tight budget situation already \nis fiscally irresponsible.\n  We know that the House provided $5.5 billion. If we put in another $2 \nbillion for next year, that means that in order to revise the farm \nbill, we are going to have to put even more money in there. And I would \nargue that we are very close right now to spending the Social Security \nsurplus in the 2002 budget.\n  So I believe this amendment that I am bringing to this Senate is \nrelevant. It is an amendment that I brought up a couple of weeks ago, \nand it is an amendment I am going to continue to bring up. I am going \nto repeat the same words I heard from some of the Members on the other \nside of the aisle, where the Republicans, they felt, did not give them \na chance for an up-or-down vote, whether it was on minimum wage or \nwhatever else it was. I want an up-or-down vote on a pure Social \nSecurity lockbox. I do not want to see it tabled. I do not want to see \nit objected to on some procedural matter. I want an up-or-down vote on \nthis. I think it is extremely important to fiscal responsibility for \nthis country.\n  I think if we do not pass this lockbox legislation, that indeed we \nwill spend the 2002 Social Security surplus of $172 billion.\n  So I am here to offer an amendment that will lockbox that Social \nSecurity surplus and force the Senate and the House to make the \nnecessary hard choices that will bring fiscal discipline to the \nGovernment and keep the Social Security surplus from being used.\n  I am also offering this amendment because it is part of the covenant \nthat we made to the American people when we passed the budget \nresolution and reduced taxes.\n  I refer to that covenant as the ``three-legged stool.'' One leg \nallows for meaningful tax reductions. One other leg reduces debt. The \nthird leg restrains spending. The Presiding Officer may not know this, \nbut in the last budget that we passed in the Senate, we increased \nbudget authority for nondefense discretionary spending by 14.5 percent, \nwith an overall increase in the budget of about 9 percent over what we \nspent in the year 2000.\n  I believe this amendment I am offering guarantees that the tax \nreduction will continue, that we will continue to pay down the debt, \nand that we will control spending. As I mentioned, if we do not get an \nup-or-down vote on this, I am going to continue, every opportunity I \nhave, to bring this amendment to this Senate Chamber.\n  I think my colleagues should know that the softening economy and the \ninexorable growth of Federal spending are putting us perilously close \nto spending the Social Security surplus. I think that has been \nenunciated by Senator Conrad on several occasions, that we are close to \nspending the Social Security surplus.\n  Until CBO and OMB issue their budget reports in August, we will not \nknow for sure, but the early economic barometers are worrisome, and the \nprimary barometer--tax receipts--is down.\n\n  In addition, I am concerned that the money in the fiscal year 2001 \nAgriculture supplemental bill--the bill we are talking about, including \nthe more than $2 billion that the Senator from Iowa is looking to spend \nin 2002 funds--will, I fear, push us over the top towards spending the \nSocial Security surplus.\n  So that my colleagues understand what is going on with spending in \nthe Senate, let's just look at this chart. I call it the ``here we go \nagain'' chart. The President came in with a budget recommendation of a \n4-percent increase over last year. Our budget resolution came back with \nan increase of about 5 percent. But after the Senate has passed three \nappropriations bills, and if you take into consideration if we kept the \nother 10 appropriations bills at their 302(b) allocations, and you add \nin the $18.4 billion that the President proposes for defense spending, \nwe are now at an increase in spending of 7.1 percent. And who knows \nwhere we are going to be going in the future.\n  So here we are in the middle of the appropriations season, and we are \non track to increase discretionary spending in fiscal year 2002 by more \nthan 7 percent.\n  But we are not done yet. We have 10 appropriations bills to go, and \nthat does not include conference reports. By the time we are all done, \nwho knows what the final fiscal year 2002 budget will be increased by?\n  Just look at how much we are increasing some of the specific \nappropriations bills already. I call this chart: ``old spending habits \ndie hard.''\n  Here are the three appropriations that we have passed already: \nLegislative branch, 5.6 percent over last year; Energy and Water, 6.4 \npercent over last year; Interior, 7.9 percent over last year.\n  Now let's look at the other bills that have been reported out: \nForeign Operations looks like it is OK, 2 percent; Transportation, 3.6 \npercent--but I am sure it is going to be more than that before the \nTransportation bill gets out of the Senate--Commerce-Justice-State, 4.4 \npercent; VA-HUD, 6.8 percent; Treasury-Postal, 6.8 percent; \nAgriculture, 7.1 percent. So when you add all of this together, there \nis a very good chance that our spending could be 8, 9, 10 percent \nhigher than last year.\n  So I think we have a problem. As I mentioned, if you take into \nconsideration that we increase education--that is, if we appropriate a \n64-percent increase--we are really in trouble. I think a 64-percent \nincrease for education, is $14 billion more than we would be spending \nordinarily.\n  So I am trying my best, I am trying my very best, to avoid the \nspending ``train wreck.'' The amendment that I am offering will keep \nthat train on track.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, I was faced with a $1.5 billion budget \ndeficit. When I came into office, my colleagues in the House and \nSenate, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, said \nto me: George, don't worry\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\nabout it. Everything is going to work out fine.\n  I did not think it would work out fine, and I began almost \nimmediately to start cutting spending. Over a 2-year period, we \ndecreased spending by almost $1 billion. If I had not gotten started \nearly with that process, we would have had a catastrophe.\n  My feeling is, the sooner the Senate understands we have a real \nproblem that needs to be dealt with, the better off we all are going to \nbe.\n  So the amendment I offer will guarantee we stay the course toward \nfiscal discipline. It contains two enforcement mechanisms: A \nsupermajority point of order written in statute, and an automatic \nacross-the-board spending cut to enforce the lockbox.\n  The amendment creates a statutory point of order against any bill, \namendment, or resolution that would spend the Social Security surplus \nin any of the next 10 years. And waiving the point of order would \nrequire the votes of 60 Senators.\n  In addition, if the Social Security surplus was spent, OMB would \nimpose automatic across-the-board cuts in discretionary and mandatory \nspending to restore the amount of the surplus that was spent.\n  I want everyone to understand that this amendment specifically \nprotects the Medicare Program from any cuts.\n  The only exceptions to the lockbox would be a state of war or if we \nhave a recession.\n  Some of my colleagues are probably thinking that we don't need this \namendment; that the spending excesses I have outlined earlier just will \nnot happen; that we won't spend so much, that we won't dip into Social \nSecurity. I disagree. We only need to look at our recent history to see \nhow addicted to spending Congress really is.\n\n  If my colleagues will look at this chart, they will see how much \nCongress has spent on some of the appropriations bills for fiscal year \n2001 according to the Senate Budget Committee. We can see Agriculture, \na 26.2 percent increase over FY 2000; energy and water, 10.1 percent; \nInterior, 24.7 percent, Labor-HHS, 25 percent; Transportation, we spent \n26.6 percent over fiscal year 2000; Treasury-Postal, 13.4 percent; and \nVA-HUD, a 13.5 percent increase over FY 2000. You can see, when you \nlook at the numbers, that we have increased budget authority for \nnondefense discretionary spending by 14.5 percent in fiscal year 2001.\n  It is amazing to me. I will talk to colleagues who were here during \nthe last 2 years and say to them: Do you realize how much we increased \nspending? Some of them seem to be shocked that we increased spending \n14.5 percent. When I go home and tell people in Ohio that this is what \nCongress did, they think it is incredible. They just cannot believe it.\n  I have said to them on many occasions, if I had spent money as mayor, \nas commissioner, as Governor of Ohio the way we have here in the \nSenate, they would have run me out of office. They would have literally \nsent me home.\n  What are we going to do? What we need to do is wall in Congress. And \nby ``wall in,'' I mean we are not going to spend Social Security and we \nare not going to increase taxes, we are going to live within our means.\n  It is very important that we face up to this reality. My \nrecommendation to my colleagues is that we ought to get out the Defense \nand the Labor-HHS bills and bring them to the floor now and not wait \nuntil the very end as we did last year for the pork-athon.\n  We have to live within the budget we have. I know that if we keep \ngoing one appropriation after another, say we do 11 of them and wait \nuntil the very end of the fiscal year for the last 2, we are going to \nhave the same situation we had last year. It is time we got those 13 \nappropriations bills on the table simultaneously and looked at them \nwith the administration and indicate how much we intend to spend \noverall--5 percent, or maybe at 6 percent, whatever it is, but work it \nout so that we don't end up with this great train wreck at the end of \nthis year as we did last year.\n  I implore my colleagues, the best way we can help our budgetary \nsituation is to formally lockbox the Social Security surplus, simply \ntake it out of the spending equation. It is the best thing we can do \nrelative to our economy.\n  I realize we have a number of pressing needs facing our Nation. \nAgriculture is one of them. One of the things about which I have always \nfelt good was even though I am from Cuyahoga County, a big urban \ncounty, I was referred to as ``the agri-Governor.'' I am interested in \nagribusiness. I care about my farmers and I have spent a great deal of \ntime with them. I want them to have that $5.5 billion. I want them to \nhave it now and they can have it now if we can get an agreement with \nour colleagues from the other side of the aisle.\n  Let's get it done. Let's not go home and not have it done and have it \ndisappear when the OMB or CBO comes out with their numbers.\n  I support a strong defense. I support education. However, the money \nto pay for whatever increases Congress makes to these and other \nprograms has to come from somewhere. We either prioritize our spending \nor we take the easy way out and reduce the Social Security surplus.\n  That had happened for 30 years before I came to the Senate. It was \nnot until 1999 that we stopped using the Social Security surplus to \nsubsidize the spending by Congress and by the administration.\n\n  I am asking this body to put their money where their mouth is. If my \ncolleagues do not want to spend the Social Security surplus, then I \nurge them to join me in support of this lockbox amendment.\n  Before I ask for the amendment to be read, I would like to make one \nother point in regard to the discussion prior to my speaking that I \nheard relating to the Transportation bill.\n  I was one of the Senators who stuck around here last Friday until the \nvery end to find out what would happen. I had an event in Cleveland to \nwhich I had to go, but I did not go because I really thought it was \nimportant that we get some dialog between Members of the Senate in \nregard to that Transportation bill and the provision of it that deals \nwith truck traffic coming out of Mexico.\n  I sincerely believed that that legislation interfered with NAFTA and \nthat we ought not to be doing that in the Transportation appropriations \nbill. I believed it was wrong. I believed my colleagues from the other \nside of the aisle should have sat down with Senator McCain and Senator \nGramm of Texas and worked out some language that was satisfactory to \nthe Senate and to the President of the United States and which did not \nviolate the NAFTA agreement.\n  I would like to read an editorial from the Cleveland Plain Dealer, \nthe largest newspaper in Ohio, which I think really captures what \nhappened here last Friday. The title of the editorial is: \n``Protectionism in High Gear.''\n\n       The Democrat-controlled Senate, with the help of enough \n     Republicans to block a filibuster, decided last week that \n     equal protection under the law doesn't apply to Mexico under \n     NAFTA.\n       Beneath a veneer of safety concerns, the Senate refused to \n     eliminate the trade barriers that keep Mexican trucking \n     companies from carrying freight beyond a 20-mile border zone, \n     no matter that among their fleets are some of the most \n     modern, best-equipped trucks on any nation's roads.\n       It's a witches' brew of protectionist politics disguised as \n     precaution, fueled by the demands of organized labor, that \n     gives off a stench of old-fashioned ethnic prejudice. What's \n     more, it invites a trade war of retaliation, should Mexico \n     decide to close its borders to U.S.-driven imports. Combined \n     with an even harsher House-passed version incorporated in the \n     Department of Transportation appropriations bill, it invites \n     a veto by President George W. Bush.\n       No one supporting Mexico's rights under the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement ever has argued that American roads \n     should be opened to unsafe vehicles. But in the years since \n     NAFTA was passed, Mexico has made giant strides to improve \n     its fleets. Some of its largest trucking companies now have \n     rigs whose quality surpasses those of American companies.\n       But safety is little more than a stray dog in this fight. \n     What this is about is the $140 billion in goods shipped to \n     the United States from Mexico each year, and the Teamsters \n     Union's desire that its members keep control of that \n     lucrative trade.\n       Labor--which documents gathered in a four-year Federal \n     Elections Commission probe show has had veto power over \n     Democratic Party positions for years--has never accepted the \n     benefits of expanded hemispheric trade. It has been adamant \n     in its opposition to allowing Mexican trucks, no matter how \n     modern the equipment or well-trained the drivers, access to \n     U.S. highways. It was this opposition that kept President\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\n     Bill Clinton from implementing the agreement, and it is this \n     opposition that yet drives labor's handservants, who now \n     control the Senate.\n       This position should be an embarrassment to a party that \n     makes a show of its concerns for the poor and downtrodden. It \n     is a setback to U.S.-Mexican relations, and an insult to \n     Mexico's good and earnest efforts to improve relations with \n     its northern neighbor. It is an abrogation of our treaty \n     responsibilities, and it must not be allowed to stand.\n\n  At least from the perspective of Ohio's largest newspaper, looking in \non what happened last Friday is a pretty good indication how many \nAmericans feel about what happened last week. It wasn't some effort to \ndelay the Transportation bill but a legitimate concern on the part of \nmany people in the Senate that we sit down and try to work out language \nthat would guarantee safe trucks in the United States, the safety of \nthe people in the United States of America, and at the same time \nguarantee that we not violate the NAFTA agreement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1209\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious concerns \nabout the President's nominee to Chair the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, Mary Sheila Gall.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission was created nearly 30 years \nago with the mission of protecting our families from consumer products \nthat pose serious health or safety risks. The Commission serves as the \nconsumer advocate for our Nation's children, protecting them from \npotentially dangerous, and in some cases deadly, products. In short, \nthe Commission is charged with saving lives, and it has done so with \ngreat success over the past several years. This success is based \nprimarily on the advocacy role that the Commission has assumed in \nfulfilling its duties for America's families and children. And it is \nMs. Gall's apparent opposition to this advocacy role that has given me \nserious concerns about her nomination.\n  As a Commissioner for the past ten years, Ms. Gall has opposed \nreasonable attempts to review questionable products and implement \ncommon sense protections for consumers. Perhaps the most troubling \nexample of this trend has been Ms. Gall's record on fire safety issues. \nMs. Gall opposed a review of upholstered furniture flammability and \nsmall open flame ignition sources, such as matches, lighters, and \ncandles. In opposing the review, she stated that ``. . . the benefits \nfrom imposing a small open flame ignition standard on upholstered \nfurniture are overestimated.''\n  With all sincerity, I doubt that the brave men and women who risk \ntheir lives every day fighting house fires in Delaware and throughout \nthe Nation would agree with that assessment. Nor would they agree with \nMs. Gall's decision to walk away from fire safety standards for \nchildren's sleepwear. In 1996, Ms. Gall voted to weaken fire safety \nstandards that required children's sleepwear to be made from flame-\nresistant fabrics. Ms. Gall joined another commissioner in exempting \nfrom this standard any sleepwear for children less than nine months \nold, and any sleepwear that is tight-fitting for children sizes 7-14. I \nsupport the original standard, which worked for more than two decades \nbefore it was weakened by the Commission. And I have cosponsored \nlegislation with my former colleague from Delaware, Senator Bill Roth, \nthat called on the Commission to restore the original standard that all \nchildren's sleepwear be flame-resistant.\n  But it's not just her record on children's sleepwear and fire safety \nissues that concerns me about Ms. Gall. She has turned her back on \nchildren and families on a number of occasions, rejecting moderate, \ncommon-sense warnings and improvements dealing with choking hazards, \nbunk bed slats, and crib slats. In some of these cases, Ms. Gall has \neven opposed efforts to merely review questionable products, to mention \nnothing about imposing regulatory standards to correct any potentially \ndangerous problems. For instance, Ms. Gall opposed a safety review of \nbaby walkers that, according to the Commission, were associated with 11 \nchild deaths between 1989 and 1994, and as many as 28,000 child \ninjuries in 1994, alone.\n  This safety review brought to light ways to produce walkers that were \nsafer for children, which were then used by manufacturers to develop a \nvoluntary standard for producing a safer product. This voluntary \nstandard was applied within the industry, and a media campaign followed \nto educate parents about the new, safer walkers that were entering the \nmarketplace. The Commission has estimated that since the review process \ntook place in 1995, injuries related to baby walkers dropped nearly 60 \npercent for children under 15 months of age, from an estimated 20,100 \ninjuries in 1995 to 8,800 in 1999.\n  These statistics are proof that the Commission's role as child \nadvocate produces results. But if Ms. Gall had her way, we would not \nhave had a review of baby walkers at all. And without this review, it \nis unlikely we would have had the important voluntary standards that \nhave protected thousands of children. If Ms. Gall is unwilling to even \ntake the first step in reviewing potentially dangerous products, I \nquestion whether we can expect her to fulfill the Commission's \nresponsibility as the Nation's child advocate.\n  I do not make this decision to oppose Mary Sheila Gall's nomination \nlightly. I have long recognized that the President should generally be \nentitled to have an administration comprised of people of his choosing. \nWhile his selections should be given considerable deference, that power \nis nonetheless limited by the duty of the United States Senate to \nprovide ``advice and consent'' to such appointments.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have supported countless \nnominees for Cabinet and other high-level positions, including many \nwith whom I have disagreed on certain policies. But I have also cast my \nvote against confirmation when I have become convinced that the nominee \nis not suitable to fill the role to which the person was nominated. I \nhave reluctantly reached the conclusion that this is one such case. It \nis one thing to serve as a commissioner, as Ms. Gall has done these \npast ten years. But serving as chair of this important Commission is a \nvery different role. As such, I strongly urge my colleagues on the \nSenate Commerce Committee to oppose Ms. Gall's nomination as Chairwoman \nof the Consumer Product Safety Commission. To put it simply, there is \nnothing less than children's lives at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8452-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 8, 1994 \nin Reno, NV.

I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8452-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8452-S8456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES IN TURKEY\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as my colleagues are well aware, the \npeople of Turkey, a NATO ally, are experiencing extremely serious \neconomic and political difficulties.\n  On April 10, 2001, at the Bosphorous University in Istanbul, Turkey, \nour distinguished former colleague in the House of Representatives, the \nHonorable John Brademas, delivered a most thoughtful address, on this \nsubject, ``Democracy: Challenge to the New Turkey in the New Europe.'' \nDr. Brademas' speech was sponsored by TESEV, the Turkish Economic and \nSocial Studies Foundation. Its contents some four months later still \nresonate with timely wisdom and creative analysis.\n  A long-time and effective advocate of democracy and transparency, \nJohn Brademas served for 22 years, 1959-1981, in the House of \nRepresentatives from Indiana's Third District, the last four as House \nMajority Whip. He then became President of New York University, the \nNation's largest private university, in which he served for 11 years, \n1981-1992. He is now president emeritus.\n  Among Dr. Brademas' involvements include Chairman of the Board of the \nNational Endowment for Democracy, NED, from 1993-2001, and founding \ndirector of the Center for Democracy and Reconciliation in Southeast \nEurope. Located in Thessalonike, Greece, the Center seeks to encourage \npeaceful and democratic development of the countries in that troubled \nregion of Europe.\n  I believe that Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives \nand other interested citizens will read with interest Dr. Brademas' \nsignificant discussion of the challenge of creating a truly more open \nand democratic Turkey. I ask unanimous consent to print Dr. Brademas' \naddress in the Record.\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Democracy: Challenge for the New Turkey in the New Europe\n\n       I count it an honor to have been asked to Istanbul to \n     address a forum sponsored by the Turkish Economic and Social \n     Studies Foundation, and I thank my distinguished host, \n     Ambassador Ozdem Sanberk, Director of TESEV, for his gracious \n     invitation even as I salute the invaluable work performed by \n     TESEV in promoting the institutions of civil society and \n     democracy in Turkey.\n       So that you will understand the perspective from which I \n     speak, I hope you will permit me a few words of background.\n       In 1958, I was first elected to the Congress of the United \n     States--the House of Representatives--where I served for 22 \n     years.\n       During that time I was particularly active in writing \n     legislation to assist schools, colleges and universities; \n     libraries and museums; the arts and the humanities; and \n     services for children, the elderly, the handicapped.\n       A Democrat, I was in 1980 defeated for re-election to \n     Congress in Ronald Reagan's landslide victory over President \n     Jimmy Carter and was shortly thereafter invited to become \n     President of New York University, the largest private, or \n     independent, university in our country, a position I held for \n     eleven years.\n       If I were to sum up in one sentence what I sought to do at \n     NYU during my service as President, it was to lead the \n     transformation of what had been a regional-New York, New \n     Jersey, Connecticut-commuter institution into a national and \n     international residential research university.\n       And I think it's fair to say that that transformation took \n     place, thanks in large part to philanthropic contributions \n     from private individuals, corporations and foundations.\n       Although no longer a Member of Congress or university \n     president, I continue to be active in a range of areas, only \n     a few of which I shall mention.\n       By appointment of President Clinton in 1994, I am Chairman \n     of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, \n     a group of 40 persons, 27 from the private sector and 13 \n     heads of government departments with some cultural program. \n     Our purpose is to make recommendations to the President--and \n     the country--for strengthening support for these two fields \n     in the United States--and we have done so. Four years ago, \n     then First Lady of the United States, and Honorary Chair of \n     the Committee, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and I released \n     Creative America, a report to the President with such \n     recommendations.\n       Among them was that the United States give much more \n     attention to the study of countries and cultures other than \n     our own, including strengthening international cultural and \n     scholarly exchanges. Only last Fall, I took part, at the \n     invitation of the then President, Bill Clinton, in the White \n     House Conference on Culture and Diplomacy, at which these \n     ideas, and others, were discussed, and I have urged the new \n     Secretary of State, Colin Powell, to consider ways of \n     implementing them.\n       Several days ago, in Washington, I attended a meeting of \n     the Advisory Board of Transparency International, the \n     organization that combats corruption in international \n     business transactions, to talk about how to expand the OECD \n     Convention outlawing bribery of foreign public officials to \n     include outlawing bribery of officials of political parties.\n\n\n                    national endowment for democracy\n\n       And last January I stepped down after eight years as \n     Chairman of what is known in the United States as the \n     National Endowment for Democracy.\n       Since its founding in 1983, the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, or NED, as we call it, has played a significant \n     role in championing democracy throughout the world.\n       The purpose of NED is to promote democracy through grants \n     to private organizations that work for free and fair \n     elections, independent media, independent judiciary and the \n     other components of a genuine democracy in countries that \n     either do not enjoy it or where it is struggling to survive.\n       Two years ago, in New Delhi, India, I joined some 400 \n     democratic activists, scholars of democracy and political \n     leaders from over 85 countries brought together by NED for \n     the inaugural Assembly of the World Movement for Democracy.\n       The establishment of this World Movement is inspired by the \n     conviction that interaction among like-minded practitioners \n     and academics on an international scale is crucial in the new \n     era of global economics and instant communications. The \n     Movement, we hope, can help democrats the world over respond \n     to the challenges of globalization.\n       Indeed, last November, Ambassador Sanberk and I were \n     together in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for the Second Assembly of the \n     World Movement for Democracy.\n\n\n      center for democracy and reconciliation in southeast europe\n\n       And I have been involved in yet another initiative related \n     to strengthening free and democratic political institutions. \n     Four years ago, a small group of persons, chiefly from the \n     Balkans, decided to create what we call the Center for \n     Democracy and Reconciliation in Southeast Europe. The \n     Center officially opened its offices one year ago in the \n     city of Thessaloniki, birthplace, as you all know, of the \n     great founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal \n     Ataturk. I was pleased that my friend, the distinguished \n     Turkish business leader, Mr. Sarik Tara, was with us on \n     that occasion.\n       The Center is dedicated to building networks among \n     individuals and groups working for the democratic and \n     peaceful development of Southeast Europe.\n       Chairman of the Board is a respected American diplomat, \n     Matthew Nimetz, who was Under Secretary of State with Cyrus \n     Vance and is Special Envoy for United Nations Secretary-\n     General Kofi Annan to mediate between Athens and Skopje. The \n     Center's Board is composed overwhelmingly of leaders from \n     throughout Southeast Europe, including Mr. Osman Kavala and \n     Dr. Seljuk Erez of Turkey. Ambassador Nimetz and I are the \n     only two Americans on the Board.\n       Although the Center is administratively headquartered in \n     Salonika, which, with excellent transportation and \n     communications facilities, is easily accessible from \n     throughout the region, the activities of the Center are \n     carried out in the several countries of Southeast Europe.\n       Last September, the Board of the Center met here in \n     Istanbul where Mr. Tara and other Turkish leaders graciously \n     received us.\n       Indeed, I arrived in Istanbul only last Sunday after a \n     meeting of the Center's Board this past weekend in \n     Thessaloniki. We had originally planned to gather in Skopje \n     but you will understand why we changed the venue!\n       What are we doing at the Center? Here are some of our \n     current projects:\n\n\n                         JOINT HISTORY PROJECT\n\n       The Center's inaugural program is a ``Joint History \n     Project,'' which brings together professors of Balkan history \n     from throughout the region to discuss ways in which history \n     is used to influence political and social relations in \n     Southeast Europe. The scholars seek to produce more \n     constructive, less nationalistic, history textbooks and \n     thereby ultimately enhance the understanding of, and respect \n     for, the peoples of the region for each other--a daunting \n     challenge, we realize!\n       For it is evident in the Balkans that how history is taught \n     can powerfully shape the attitudes of people toward those \n     different from themselves. Even as the violence plaguing this \n     region has roots in nationalist, religious and ethnic \n     prejudices, cultivated, in many cases, by and based on \n     distortions of histories, the accurate teaching of history \n     can be crucial in promoting tolerance and peace.\n       An Academic Committee, established by the Joint History \n     Project, encourages exchange among scholars in participating \n     educational institutions. We on the Center Board hope the \n     Committee will establish a network among academics in \n     Southeast Europe as counterweight to existing nationalistic \n     groups within each country. So far we have organized two \n     seminars for young scholars and another two are being \n     arranged.\n       The Center's History Project has also begun to work with \n     the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe, initiated by the \n     European Union and supported by the United States and other \n     non-EU countries in Europe. The mission of the Pact is to \n     extend democracy and prosperity to all the peoples of \n     Southeast Europe. So far, the participating governments have \n     pledged $2.4 billion for the initiative.\n       I must also cite the Center's Young Parliamentarians \n     Project which, through a series of seminars, enables young \n     MPs from Southeast Europe to join parliamentarians from \n     Western Europe and the European Parliament as well as \n     professionals, economists and journalists to discuss issues \n     of urgent and continuing concern in the region.\n       The Center last year conducted four seminars on such \n     subjects as the workings of parliamentary democracy, the \n     relationship between politics and the media, the operation of \n     a free market economy, and the organization of political \n     parties.\n       This year, in another project, the Center is sponsoring \n     seminars on reconciliation in the former Yugoslavia. Serbs \n     and Croats have already met in Belgrade and will meet again \n     next month in Zagreb. And representatives of the other \n     peoples of the former Yugoslavia will soon meet.\n       All the projects I have cited promote, by creating cross-\n     border contacts and stimulating dialogue, the economic, \n     social and political development of the Balkans. Our goal, to \n     reiterate, is to encourage vibrant networks of individuals \n     and groups with common interests and experiences.\n       I hope I have made clear, from what I have told you, that \n     in my own career, as a Member of Congress, university \n     president and participant in a range of pro bono \n     organizations, I have been deeply devoted to the causes of \n     democracy, free and open political institutions and \n     encouraging knowledge of and respect for peoples of different \n     cultures and traditions.\n       Against this background, I want now to talk with you about \n     the great challenge, as I see it, facing what I call ``the \n     new Turkey in the new Europe''--and that challenge is \n     democracy.\n       So that you can better understand my viewpoint, I must tell \n     you one other factor in my own experience that I believe \n     relevant to my comments.\n\n\n                       greece, cyprus, and turkey\n\n       As some of you know, my late father was born in Greece, in \n     Kalamata, in the Peloponnesus. My late mother was of Anglo-\n     Saxon ancestry.\n       I was the first native-born American of Greek origin \n     elected to the Congress of the\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\n     United States, and I am proud of my Hellenic heritage.\n       In 1967, however, when a group of colonels carried out a \n     coup in Greece, established a military dictatorship, later \n     throwing out the young King, I voiced strong opposition to \n     their action.\n       I refused to visit Greece during the seven years the \n     colonels ruled, refused invitations to the Greek Embassy in \n     Washington and testified in Congress against sending U.S. \n     military aid to Greece.\n       My view was that as Greece was a member of NATO, \n     established to defend democracy, freedom and the rule of law, \n     of all of which goals the colonels were enemies, I had as a \n     matter of principle to oppose sending arms from my own \n     country to the country of my father's birth.\n       In like fashion, when in 1974, the colonels attempted to \n     overthrow Archbishop Makarios, the President of Cyprus, \n     triggering their own downfall and sparking two invasions by \n     Turkish armed forces, equipped with weapons supplied by the \n     United States, I protested the Turkish action, again on \n     grounds of principle.\n       For the Turkish invasion violated U.S. legal restrictions \n     on the use of American arms, namely, that they could be \n     utilized solely for defensive purposes.\n       Because American law mandated that violation of such \n     restrictions would bring an immediate termination of any \n     further arms to the violating country and because Secretary \n     of State Kissinger willfully refused to enforce the law, we \n     in Congress did so by legislating an arms embargo on Turkey.\n       I can also tell you that when my colleagues in Congress and \n     I who called on Kissinger in the summer of 1974 to press him \n     to take the action required by law, we reminded him that the \n     reason President Nixon, who had just resigned, was \n     constrained to do so was that he had failed to respect the \n     laws of the land and the Constitution of the United States.\n       So even as I opposed U.S. military aid to Greece in 1967 on \n     grounds of principle, I opposed U.S. arms to Turkey in 1974 \n     on grounds of principle. You may not agree with my viewpoint \n     on either matter but I want you to understand it!\n\n\n                        a new democratic turkey?\n\n       Yet I would not be here today if I did not believe in the \n     prospect of a new, democratic Turkey, belonging to the new \n     Europe, a member of the European Union and a continuing ally \n     of the United States.\n       I am well aware that Turkey is now confronted with a \n     profound financial and economic crisis, ``the most severe \n     economic crisis of its history,'' the Chairman of TUSIAD, Mr. \n     Tuncay Ozihlan, told a group of us in New York City last \n     month at a meeting with members of the Turkish \n     Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association. It is a crisis \n     that reaches all parts of the nation.\n       If I have one thesis to advance tonight, it is this: That \n     the combination of three factors make this moment one of \n     great opportunity for fundamental reform of the Turkish \n     political system and significant advance in the quality of \n     life of the Turkish people.\n       The first factor is the economic crisis. The distinguished \n     Turkish economist, Mr. Kemal Dervis, has, as you know, been \n     charged with recommending structural reforms essential if \n     Turkey is to win assistance from the International Monetary \n     Fund, the United States and other actors in the international \n     financial community.\n       Most obvious in this respect is the situation of Turkish \n     banks, widely understood to be afflicted by corrupt links \n     with the nation's political parties.\n       The second factor that can drive fundamental reform in \n     Turkey and bring the country into the modern world is \n     Turkey's candidacy for accession to the European Union.\n       Beyond the economic crisis and Turkish candidacy for entry \n     into Europe, there is a third factor that can make this the \n     time to start building a new Turkey in the new Europe.\n       I speak of the rising engagement in pressing for democracy \n     of the leaders of Turkish business and industry, of your \n     universities, of the media, and leaders of the other \n     institutions of what we call civil society.\n       So where are we now?\n\n\n                     turkey and the european union\n\n       First, we can be encouraged by the approval last month by \n     the Turkish cabinet of the National Program for Adoption to \n     the Acquis of the European Union, or NPPA.\n       In my view, Turkish leaders of all parties should agree to \n     confront the problems resolution of which is necessary to \n     Turkish entry into Europe.\n       And if Turkish responses are only cosmetic, as Gunter \n     Verheugen, the European Commissioner in charge of \n     enlargement, has made clear, the candidacy will fail. \n     Verheugen has reminded Turkish leaders that the European \n     Council in December 1999 in Helsinki stated, ``Turkey is a \n     candidate state destined to join the Union on the basis of \n     the same criteria as applied to the other candidate states.''\n       I add that Turkey should deal with these obstacles not \n     solely to meet the so-called Copenhagen requirements for EU \n     membership but also because such action will be in the \n     interest of the people of Turkey.\n       What has impressed me greatly as I prepared for this visit \n     to Istanbul is the deep commitment of so many Turkish \n     leaders, especially in business and industry and in the \n     universities, to the economic and political reform of this \n     great country.\n       What are the requirements Turkey must meet to enter Europe?\n       Let me here remind you of the eloquent words of TESEV's \n     respected Director, Ozdem Sanberk, only a few weeks ago \n     (``It's Not the Economy, Stupid!'' Turkish Daily News, \n     February 28, 2001).\n       Commenting on the clash last February between Prime \n     Minister Bulent Ecevit and President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, \n     Ambassador Sanberk said: ``. . . You cannot reform the \n     economy root and branch without an equally radical reform of \n     the political system. . . .\n       ``. . . [O]nly comprehensive political reform can create \n     the stability . . . required for long-term economic \n     success.''\n       The Ambassador then criticized the Government's failure to \n     undertake radical structural reform, to ``plug the leaks in \n     the state-owned banks, through which billions of dollars of \n     public money have poured. . . . No crackdown on curruption in \n     the highest places. No lifting of cultural restrictions on \n     freedom of expression. No reform of the Political Parties \n     Law, which might transform our parties into something more \n     useful than closed clubs dominated by their leaders. No \n     serious effort to change a constitution which does not meet \n     the needs of the age. . . .\n       ``. . . The problems that lie at the root of Turkey's \n     current difficulties are political, not economic and \n     political reform can solve them. . . .''\n\n\n                          LEADERSHIP OF TUSIAD\n\n       I find encouragement, too, at the positions taken by the \n     leadership of TUSIAD, Turkey's major business and industrial \n     organization.\n       Indeed, only a few days ago, in New York City, I had the \n     privilege of meeting several members of TUSIAD, including its \n     distinguished chairman, Mr. Ozihlan.\n       I said then, and repeat here, that I have been deeply \n     impressed by the high quality of the reports published by \n     TUSIAD and by the obvious commitment of so many leaders of \n     Turkish business and industry to the principles of democracy \n     and human rights, freedom of enterprise, freedom of belief \n     and opinion.\n       As Muharrem Kayhan, President of TUSIAD's High Advisory \n     Council, who was also in New York last month, has said, ``The \n     requisites of EU membership are exactly what Turkey needs. . \n     . .\n       ``. . . TUSIAD believes that fully adopting the Copenhagen \n     Criteria will benefit our country. We think that the fears \n     expressed about the possible damages Turkey might suffer if \n     its special conditions are not taken into account are \n     exaggerated.\n       TUSIAD . . . consistently calls for a thoroughgoing \n     political reform for quite a long time. We firmly believe \n     that unless we change Turkey's political system, efforts to \n     modernize our economy will be in vain. To that end we join \n     the President of the Republic Ahmet Necdet Sezer, in calling \n     for a reform of the constitution and the rewriting of the \n     Political Parties Law and the Electoral Law.'' (TUSIAD)\n       This commitment to democracy, freedom of opinion, free \n     market economy, a pluralistic society, clean politics, social \n     development and the rule of law is, I have observed, one that \n     runs through TUSIAD's several studies and reports directed to \n     the problems that face Turkey.\n       Not only does TUSIAD call for action to meet the Copenhagen \n     criteria but do does a wide range of scholars, analysts and \n     officials from Turkey itself as well as from other countries.\n       Deputy Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz last month, in speaking \n     of the cabinet approval of the NPPA, said that Turkey must \n     give top priority to ensuring freedom of speech, cracking \n     down on torture, reviewing the death penalty and offering \n     more freedom of organization for trade unions.\n       So what else must be done for Turkish entry into Europe?\n       The European Union has also called on Turkey to grant full \n     cultural rights to all minorities, including allowing Turkish \n     citizens to speak whatever language they like. After all, \n     millions of the over 65 million people of this country speak \n     Kurdish. Why is it not possible to respond to their desire \n     for a degree of cultural freedom?\n       I was present in New York City when your Foreign Minister, \n     Ismail Cem, and the Greek Foreign Minister, George \n     Papandreou, were both honored at a dinner, a symbol of a \n     reapprochement between Turkey and Greece in recent months \n     triggered by the response in each country to earthquakes in \n     the other.\n\n\n                            the cyprus issue\n\n       Here again, I have been impressed by how both Turkish and \n     Greek business leaders seem to be able to communicate \n     effectively with each other, yet another example of the \n     significant contribution that institutions of civil society \n     can make to encouraging peaceful resolution of conflict in \n     this troubled part of the world.\n       And, of course, Europe wants to see progress in resolving \n     the thorny issue of Cyprus. With respect to Cyprus, I could \n     make an entire speech tonight but I won't!\n       Let me say that it must be obvious that both Greek and \n     Turkish Cypriots perceive a problem of security, both are \n     unhappy with the present situation and both would like to \n     improve their political and economic conditions by entering \n     the European Union. Turkish Cypriots, moreover, have an acute \n     economic problem, with less than a fifth of the $17,000 per \n     capita GDP annually of the Greek Cypriots.\n       Clearly Turkish Cypriots would be the net beneficiaries of \n     entry into Europe but this\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\n     gain will come only if Cyprus is admitted as a single federal \n     state, bi-zonal and bi-communal.\n       Accordingly, if Turkish Cypriots are not to continue to be \n     left behind, economically and politically, the only sound \n     answer is for Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots to accept the \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for such \n     a settlement.\n       For as The Economist has written, Cyprus represents ``the \n     main block of Turkey's hope of joining the European Union in \n     the near future.''\n       I turn to another matter that is clearly of concern to the \n     European Union, the role of the armed forces in the political \n     system of Turkey.\n       Now, of course, for decades, the principal link between the \n     United States and Turkey has been strategic, specifically, \n     military. In light of the geographical location of Turkey, \n     the size of its armed forces and its population, such a \n     relationship should not be surprising. Turkey is a major \n     actor on nearly every issue of importance to the United \n     States in this part of the world, including NATO, the \n     Balkans, the Aegean, Iraqi, sanctions, relations with the \n     states of the former Soviet Union, turmoil in the Middle East \n     and transit routes for Central Asian oil and gas.\n\n\n              the role of the military in turkish politics\n\n       Yet it must be obvious to any thoughtful observer that of \n     particular importance in opening the doors to Europe for \n     Turkey is that steps be taken to curb the influence of the \n     military in politics.\n       I am certainly aware of the respect and admiration the \n     Turkish people have always had for their armed forces. \n     Nonetheless, any serious student of the place of the military \n     in Turkish life learns very quickly that its role extends far \n     beyond defense of the security of the Republic.\n       Here, rather than using my own words, let me cite those of \n     a distinguished Turkish journalist, Cengiz Candar:\n       ``Unlike Western armies, the Turkish military is \n     politically autonomous and can operate outside the \n     constitutional authority of democratically elected \n     governments. It can influence the government both directly \n     and indirectly, controlling politicians according to its own \n     ideas and maxims. . . .\n       ``The National Security Council is the institution that \n     really runs the country. . . . ''\n       ``. . . [T]he military has become the power behind the \n     scenes that runs Turkish politics. . . .\n       ``. . . The military is able to intervene at will in \n     politics, not only determining who can form governments, but \n     actually exercising a veto over who can contest elections. . \n     . .'' (``Redefining Turkey's Political Center,'' Journal of \n     Democracy, October 1999, Vol. 10, No. 4)\n       A powerful analysis of the role of the military in Turkish \n     politics is to be found in an essay published last December \n     in the influential journal Foreign Affairs by Eric Rouleau, \n     French Ambassador to Turkey from 1988 to 1992. (``Turkey's \n     Dream of Democracy,'' Foreign Affairs, Vol 79, No. 6, \n     November/December 2000)\n       Said Rouleau, commenting on Turkey's candidacy for the EU, \n     ``Turkey today stands at a crossroads,'' and explains that \n     ``The [1999] Helsinki decision [of the EU] called on Turkey, \n     like all other EU membership candidates, to comply with the . \n     . . Copenhagen rules [requiring] EU hopefuls to build \n     Western-style democratic institutions guaranteeing the rule \n     of law, individual rights, and the protection of minorities. \n     Indeed, the EU's eastern and central European candidates \n     adopted most of the Copenhagen norms on their own, before \n     even knocking at the doors of the union.''\n       Rouleau then asserts that the Copenhagen criteria \n     ``represent more than simple reforms; they mean the virtual \n     dismantling of Turkey's entire state system . . . which \n     places the armed forces at the very heart of political life. \n     Whether Turkey will choose to change . . . a centuries-old \n     culture and . . . practices ingrained for decades--and \n     whether the army will let it--remains uncertain. Even EU \n     membership, the ultimate incentive, may not be enough to \n     convince the Turkish military to relinquish its hold on the \n     jugular of the modern Turkish state.''\n       Rouleau then describes the ways in which the National \n     Security Council (NSC) operates and notes the objections of \n     the EU to the military's budgeting, its ownership of \n     industries, its own court system and, above all, the \n     military's dominance over civilian authority.\n       Concludes Rouleau: ``Turkey's EU candidacy has crystallized \n     the way in which two very different visions of the country \n     are now facing off. . . . On the one side stands the Turkey \n     of . . . the `Kemalist republicans,' those who see the \n     military as the infallible interpreter of Ataturk's legacy \n     and the sole guardian of the nation and the state. . . .\n       ``On the other side stand . . . the `Kemalist democrats' . \n     . . proud of the revolution carried out by the founder of the \n     republic eight decades ago, but a the same time . . . believe \n     that the regime should adapt to modernity and Western norms. \n     This group includes intellectuals . . . business circles . . \n     . and . . . Kurds and Islamists hopeful that Brussels will \n     ensure that their legitimate rights are recognized and \n     guaranteed.''\n\n\n                      TUSIAD FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORM\n\n       What, I must tell you, seems to me a particularly \n     significant statement about the place of the military is the \n     following sentence, under the heading, ``Democratization and \n     the Reform Process in Turkey,'' in the document prepared for \n     the visit of the TUSIAD Board of Directors to Washington, DC, \n     and New York last month (``TUSIAD Views on Various Issues''):\n       ``8. National Security Council (NSC) should be eliminated \n     as a constructional body and its sphere of activity be \n     restricted to national defense.''\n       While one group of TUSIAD leaders was in the U.S., speaking \n     in Paris at the same time at a panel sponsored by Le Monde, \n     was Dr. Erkut Yucaoglu, former TUSIAD Chairman. Here are his \n     words:\n       ``. . . TUSIAD has been in the forefront of the struggle \n     for political reform in Turkey. . . . Our report on \n     democratization challenged the most sacred tenets of the \n     existing order in the country, be it freedom of expression of \n     all sorts, the role of the National Security Council, or \n     private broadcasting in all languages, or the political \n     parties law. We have consistently defended the integration \n     with the EU and called for a speedy implementation of the \n     Copenhagen criteria without reference to Turkey's special \n     conditions. . . .\n       ``. . . It is no secret . . . that the Turkish political \n     system as it is presently functioning is in a crisis, perhaps \n     a terminal one. The political parties have lost the \n     confidence of the public a long time ago. . . .\n       ``By now, every thinking person in Turkey knows that if the \n     country wishes to fulfill its own promise of greatness and \n     become prosperous, the political system must change . . . .''\n       Dr. Yucaoglu went on to praise the President of the \n     Republic as ``a national leader'' who enjoys `'the support of \n     an overwhelming percentage of the population, who is \n     committed to Turkey's European vocation. Mr. Sezer stands for \n     the rule of law, civilian supremacy, anti-corruption, \n     integration with the globalizing world and perhaps most \n     important, for an unfettered democracy. . . .''\n       Now I am aware that I have spoken to you very candidly \n     about the challenges--and opportunities--Turkey faces as your \n     country moves into the 21st century.\n       You will observe, however, that most of the voices I have \n     cited that are pressing for reform in Turkey are Turkish!\n       I certainly don't want to suggest that we in the United \n     States have a perfect political system. As you know, far too \n     few of our eligible citizens bother to vote, and the scramble \n     for money to finance our political campaigns is an ongoing \n     threat to the integrity of American democracy. Even now, \n     Congress is acting on measures to reform campaign financing.\n       Moreover, as you are all aware, the Presidential election \n     in my country last year was finally determined by our Supreme \n     Court in a decision that has caused leaders of both our \n     Democratic and Republican Parties to call for reform of our \n     election laws.\n       I have noted that the election of President Sezer seems to \n     be regarded by Turkish champions of democracy as a great \n     victory. Like the leaders of TESEV and TSIAD, I have also \n     been impressed by President Sezer's commitment to the rule of \n     law and to rooting out corruption, and by all accounts, \n     President Sezer has won the confidence of over 80% of the \n     citizens of Turkey.\n       I have said that the combination of the current economic \n     crisis, Turkish candidacy for entry into the European Union \n     and the increasing influence of the leaders of civil society \n     make this a moment of extraordinary opportunity for the \n     people of Turkey.\n       So now let me say some words about civil society.\n\n\n                      civil society and democracy\n\n       What do we mean by the term?\n       Civil society is the space that exists between, on the one \n     hand, the state--government--and, on the other, individual \n     citizens. This space is where citizens act with one another \n     through non-governmental organizations (NGOs), foundations, \n     and independent media\n       For as I am sure you will agree the state cannot--and \n     should not--in any country do everything.\n       Indeed, I believe it significant that last year German \n     Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, as you know, a Social Democrat, \n     declared:\n       ``One of the great illusions of Social Democratic policies \n     has been the idea that `more state' guarantees more justice. \n     However, providing or even extending the `classical' means of \n     state intervention--law, power, and money--can no longer be \n     considered sufficient solutions for a society where movement \n     `has become as important as regulation' (Alain Touraine).  .  \n     .  .''\n       Added Schroder, ``Subsidiarity, giving responsibility back \n     to those who are willing and capable of assuming this \n     responsibility, should not be understood as a gift from the \n     state, but, rather, as a socio-political necessity.'' (``The \n     Civil Society Redifining the Responsibilities of State and \n     Society,'' Die neue Gesellschaft, No. 4, April, 2000, \n     Frankfurt.)\n       For the health of democracy, then, we must strengthen the \n     institutions of civil society.\n\n\n                         foundations in turkey\n\n       What is the state of civil society in Turkey today, on non-\n     governmental organizations, or as we say, NGOs?\n       Now I do not pretend to be an expert on NGOs in Turkey. But \n     I understand that there are some 75,000 private associations \n     registered in Turkey including more than 10,000 nonprofit \n     foundations. Some foundations make charitable donations to \n     NGOs and individuals; others are so-called ``operating \n     foundations'' which provide social services and\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\n     support education and research. (``Human Rights and Turkey's \n     Future in Europe,'' by Aslan Gunduz, Orbis, Vol. 45, No. 1, \n     Winter 2001, p. 16.)\n       Of these 10,000 foundations, nearly half were started in \n     only the last 30 years.\n       Of course, Turkey has a long history of philanthropic \n     foundations. During the Ottoman Empire, many of the services \n     the state now provides, in health care, education and city-\n     planning, were financed by foundations. (Davut Aydin, \n     unpublished book chapter.)\n       I am sure that you here can tell me how NGOs gained a new \n     prominence in Turkey through their effective relief work \n     after the earthquake.\n       But you also know that NGOs have often faced intense \n     scrutiny, and sometimes harassment, from the government. So I \n     cannot emphasize enough the importance of philanthropic \n     support from the business community in sponsoring NGO \n     activities.\n       Last year, by the way, I delivered a speech in Athens in \n     which I sharply criticized the Greek law that imposes a 20% \n     tax on philanthropic contributions, reduced by half in the \n     December 2000 budget but still an anomaly in a land that gave \n     us the word philanthropia.\n       I hope that Turkish law will include further incentives to \n     create foundations and expand the services they provide.\n\n\n               NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY IN TURKEY\n\n       I can also tell you that the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, which, as I have said, I chaired for several \n     years, has supported several non-governmental organizations \n     in Turkey. I'll say something about a few to illustrate the \n     kinds of civil society groups--and their activities--that \n     contribute to a strong democracy:\n       First, I note that the Center for the Research of Societal \n     Problems, (TOSAM), founded by Professor Dogu Ergil, has been \n     a NED grantee since 1997.\n       An NGO called the Foundation for Research of Societal \n     Problems (TOSAV) was established in 1996 to explore possible \n     solutions to the Kurdish issue. After TOSAV published a \n     Document of Mutual Understanding on possible peaceful \n     solutions, TOSAV's founders were brought to trial at State \n     Security Court and the document was banned.\n       To continue their work, TOSAV members established TOSAM, \n     which produces Democracy Radio, broadcasting bi-weekly \n     programs on such themes as democracies and minorities, the \n     role of the media in a democracy, and the relationship \n     between central and local government.\n       The Helsinki citizens' Assembly--Turkey (HCA--Turkey) has \n     been a NED grantee since 1997.\n       Founded in 1990, HCA is an international coalition that \n     works for the democratic integration of Europe and on \n     conflict resolution in the Caucasus and the Middle East. \n     HCA--Turkey was established by jurists, human rights \n     activists, mayors, trade unionists, journalists, writers and \n     academics.\n       HCA brings together representatives of civil society \n     organizations from different cities, legal experts, academics \n     and representatives of municipalities to develop and advocate \n     an agenda for reform of the law governing NGOs in Turkey.\n       Women Living Under Muslim Law--Turkey (SLUML--Turkey) has \n     been a recipient of NED grants since 1995. Founded in \n     December 1993, this NGO provides information and advice to \n     women's organizations throughout the country. WLUML-Turkey \n     sponsors a project to train social workers, psychologists and \n     teachers from community centers throughout Turkey in \n     conducting legal literacy group sessions for women.\n       An active civil society, then, provides a check on a \n     powerful state. For in a genuine democracy, non-governmental \n     associations have the responsibility of keeping a close eye \n     on the operations of government. So you and I know that if \n     governments, in order to discourage or eliminate criticism, \n     seek to crush free and independent newspapers, radio and \n     television, or to control NGOs, democracy will be gravely \n     weakened.\n\n\n                 education crucial to future of turkey\n\n       It will not surprise you, given my history in Congress and \n     as a university president, that I believe a key ingredient of \n     civil society, fundamental to the success of democracy and a \n     modern economy, is education.\n       Certainly, education is crucial to the future of Turkey, \n     where 30% of the population is below the age of 15! (``EU-\n     Turkey Relationship: Less Rhetoric, More Challenges,'' by \n     Bahadir Kaleagasi, Private View, No. 9, Autumn 2000, p. 22.)\n       Although I am a strong champion of both state and private \n     support of education, I must note the growth in recent years \n     of private universities in Turkey. As one who helped raise \n     nearly $1 billion in private funds for New York University, I \n     am impressed that several of your private universities have \n     been founded with the generous support of Turkish business \n     leaders. I think here particularly of Bilkent University, \n     Sabanci University and Koc University.\n       I add that I have myself accepted the invitation of one of \n     Turkey's outstanding business leaders, Mr. Rahmi Koc, to \n     serve on the Board of Friends of Koc University, an American \n     foundation chaired by the respected Turkish-American founder \n     of Atlantic Records, and a good friend, Mr. Ahmet Ertegun, \n     even as I have agreed to serve on the Board of Anatolia \n     College in Thessaloniki. And I am pleased that these two \n     institutions are cooperating in a joint training program.\n       These universities also make an important contribution to \n     emerging civil society in Turkey. Founded through acts of \n     philanthropy and charging tuition fees, they teach students \n     that there can be institutions, independent of the state, \n     serving social needs.\n       And as I speak of universities, let me say that while it is \n     imperative that the United States and Turkey maintain their \n     strategic alliance, I would very much like to see our \n     relationships broadened to include expanded educational and \n     cultural links. For most Americans, even educated ones, don't \n     know very much about Turkish history or culture.\n       I shall add that in respect of another important question \n     affecting U.S. policy toward Turkey, Turkish relations with \n     Greece, I have for several years now proposed that Turkish \n     universities establish departments of Greek studies and Greek \n     universities create department of Turkish studies, the better \n     for each society to understand the other.\n       As I conclude his talk, I realize that I have certainly not \n     covered every subject relevant to my central thesis. I have \n     not attempted to be exhaustive; I hope I have been \n     instructive.\n\n\n              historic opportunity for democracy in turkey\n\n       My thesis is straightforward. It is that there are three \n     powerful developments that, it seems to me, provide an \n     historic opportunity for genuine democratic advance in \n     Turkey.\n       The first is the economic and financial crisis that your \n     country is now facing.\n       The second is Turkey's application for membership in the \n     European Union.\n       And the third is rising importance of the institutions of \n     civil society in Turkish life.\n       I have drawn particular attention to the movement for \n     democratic change-for freedom of expression, a free market \n     economy and reform of the political system-pressed by the \n     business leaders of Turkey, like those at TESEV and TUSIAD.\n       Although the friends of Turkey in my own country and \n     elsewhere will do what we can to encourage reform, for your \n     great country to become a vigorous and vibrant democracy is, \n     in the final analysis, up to the people of Turkey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8456-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING THE BIG THOMPSON FLOOD\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor those who lost their \nlives, as well as those who survived, Colorado's Big Thompson Flood of \n1976. Twenty-five years ago today more than one foot of rain fell in a \nmatter of hours, creating a flash flood in Big Thompson Canyon which \nkilled 144 people and caused over $30 million in property damage. We \nremember those who died in this natural disaster, and also the \nsurvivors who had to rebuild their lives, working as a community to \nstart over again. Today, outside of my hometown of Loveland, Colorado, \n1,000 survivors of this tragedy will gather to commemorate the Big \nThompson Flood. Though I cannot be with them in this ceremony, my \nthoughts and prayers are with them and I speak on the Senate floor \ntoday as a tribute to this special event.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letter, which I wrote for \nthe commemoration ceremony of the Big Thompson Canyon Flood of 1976, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Greetings to the families and friends of the victims of the \n     Big Thompson Canyon Flood\n       As we look back twenty-five years ago today we remember the \n     shock and devastation that took place in this canyon. Joan \n     and I arrived just after the crest from the Big Thompson \n     flood had passed through Loveland and were astounded by the \n     destruction. At the time I was a county health officer and I \n     had a number of clients up the canyon ravaged by the flash \n     flood who had animals at my hospital. I was devastated by the \n     tragedies which affected our community.\n       Since that time the people of the communities in the canyon \n     have worked together to rebuild their lives and their \n     property. We have heard of many sad stories and yet, many \n     stories of kindness and concern for others through the years.\n       Today, as survivors, families and friends congregate to \n     commemorate the Big Thompson Canyon flood, my thoughts and \n     prayers are with you.

Mr. President, once in awhile, the world is confronted \nwith a national government so extreme in its violation of basic human \nrights and\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\nworker rights and so morally bankrupt that it requires exceptional, \ncoordinated action on the part of all civilized nations. A case in \npoint is the Burmese military junta that has been in power since 1988 \nand which continues to terrorize this nation of 48 million people to \nthis day.\n  This is a despicable military dictatorship that is quite simply \nbeyond the pale.\n  It uses forced labor as a normal way of conducting business and \ninternational trade.\n  It uses forced child labor to build roads and dams, to transport \ngoods for the military, and to tend the fields.\n  It exploits 50,000 child soldiers--the most of any nation on Earth.\n  It is a drug trafficker of the first order--the No. 1 source of \nheroin on our streets in America.\n  It routinely confiscates and operates apparel and other factories, \ndirectly and indirectly, to earn foreign exchange to keep its brutal \ngrip on power.\n  It brazenly ignores the democratic yearnings of its own people who \noverwhelmingly elected the National League for Democracy to power in \nthe national elections in 1990.\n  It has kept Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically elected national \nleader of Burma and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, under house arrest and \ncutoff from outside communication for most of the past decade, while \nimprisoning, torturing, and killing tens of thousands of Burmese \nprodemocracy supporters.\n  For all of these reasons, I introduced legislation, S. 926, in late \nMay to establish a complete U.S. trade ban with Burma. I am greatly \nheartened that Senators Helms, Leahy, McConnell, Hollings, Wellstone, \nFeingold, Schumer, Feinstein, Lieberman, Clinton, Torricelli, Dayton, \nCorzine, and Mikulski have already joined as cosponsors of this bill to \nmake more effective the limited sanctions enacted by a bipartisan \nmajority in 1997.\n  Now we need President Bush to throw his support behind this measure \nas well. I am hopeful that he will follow his words with action because \nhe wrote to many of us nearly two months ago pledging that ``we \nstrongly support Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's heroic efforts to bring \ndemocracy to the Burmese people.''\n  Now is not the time to hesitate. We already have fresh evidence that \neven the threat of enactment of this legislation is making life much \nmore difficult for the Burmese generals in several ways.\n  First, the Wall Street Journal on July 9th carried an in-depth story \nunder the headline, ``Myanmar Faces Dual Blow from U.S. Proposed Ban.'' \nIn this account, a ranking officer of the Myanmar Garment Manufacturing \nAssociation reports that orders for Burmese apparel have already begun \nto decline in the country's largest quasi-private sector industry. Not \nsurprisingly, Burmese government officials and textile industry \nexecutives are denouncing our legislation, claiming that it will hurt \ntens of thousands of Burmese textile and apparel workers and their \nfamilies. But, in fact, S. 926 enjoys the solid support of the Free \nTrade Union Movement of Burma, FTUB, and it was developed in close \nconsultation with Burmese workers at the village and farm level inside \nthat besieged nation. Small wonder given that the per capita GDP in \nBurma has now fallen to less than $300 a year and the U.S. Embassy in \nRangoon last summer cabled home that wages in the textile and apparel \nfactories typically start at 8 cents an hour for a 48-hour work week.\n  Second, the Burmese military junta for the first time has recently \nannounced that it will allow a team of investigators from the \nInternational Labor Organization (ILO) to visit Burma for three weeks \nin September to follow up the mountain of evidence compiled about the \nwidespread use of forced labor. I hope this is not a cynical ploy on \nthe part of the Burmese generals whereby ILO officials are carefully \nsteered to sanitized work sites, after which the ILO mission issues a \nreport stating that they saw little first-hand evidence of forced labor \nor that it is in decline due to the government's efforts to stop it.\n  To forestall this possibility, the following important precautions \nneed to be taken now to prevent the Burmese generals from \n``whitewashing'' their longstanding use of forced labor:\n  There should be regular ILO fact-finding teams sent to Burma every \nsix months for the foreseeable future, not a onetime visit.\n  Every ILO fact-finding team sent into Burma should include at least \none of the members of the ILO Commission of Inquiry which compiled the \nbody of evidence of widespread use of forced labor in Burma. It was \nthat Commission's report which led to the ILO invoking Article 33 \nprocedures for the first time in history in 1999 and twice, since then, \ncalling for the 175 member nations of the ILO to adopt stronger \nsanctions against this outlaw regime.\n  Before any ILO inspection team is dispatched, the Burmese generals \nmust rescind their decree which prohibits any gathering of more than 5 \nBurmese civilians at one time. This will enable Burmese forced laborers \nor witnesses on their behalf to feel more secure in coming forward.\n  The ILO must also insist in advance that other UN agencies help \nmonitor the whereabouts and safety of any Burmese forced laborers or \nwitnesses thereto, once the ILO fact-finding teams leave the country.\n  Finally, the embassies of Japan and other ASEAN countries who lobbied \nhard for the dispatch of such ILO fact-finding teams must take on \nspecial, added responsibilities and function as conscientious monitors \nagainst forced labor and other egregious worker rights violations \ninside Burma whenever ILO fact-finding teams are not on the ground.\n  Third, now that more and more American consumers are learning for the \nfirst time that U.S. trade with Burma is actually growing, they are \nbringing their own pressure to bear on this sordid business. Last May \n23rd, for example, Wal-Mart executives issued a statement that ``Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. does not source products from Burma and we do not \naccept merchandise from our suppliers sourced in Burma and Wal-Mart -\nCanada will also not accept any merchandise sourced from Burma moving \nforward.'' I hope this claim can be verified soon and that other \ncompanies that have been doing business in Burma will follow suit.\n  Fourth, I am also hopeful that the U.S. Customs Service will move \npromptly to enforce its recent rulings and make certain that no \nproducts enter the U.S. labeled only ``Made in Myanmar''. Until such \ntime that my trade ban legislation is enacted, it is very important \nthat all American consumers be able to clearly identify whether a \ngarment or other imported product is made in Burma.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, it is unconscionable that apparel and \ntextile imports from Burma, for example, have increased by 372 percent \nsince supposedly ``tough'' sanctions were enacted in the U.S. in 1997. \nThey increased by 118 percent last year alone, providing more than $454 \nmillion in hard currency that flows mostly into coffers of the Burmese \nmilitary dictatorship. By what reasoning, do we currently have quotas \non textile and apparel imports from virtually every other country in \nthe world, but not Burma?\n  We need to promptly cut off the hard currency that is helping sustain \nthe Burmese gulag.\n  We need to demonstrate anew our solidarity with the pro-democracy in \nBurma and its leaders.\n  We need to curb the flow of illegal drugs pouring into our country \nfrom Burma. We need to answer the call of the ILO to disassociate our \ncountry from the Burmese military junta which routinely uses forced \nlabor and the worst forms of child labor, while defying the community \nof civilized nations to do anything about it.\n  We can accomplish all of these worthy policy objectives, the sooner \nwe enact S. 926.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8457-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8457-S8458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PREPARING FOR BIOTERRORISM . . . WHAT TO DO NEXT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to address a subject on which I \nrecently chaired a hearing in the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services concerning \nwhat the Federal Government is doing to better prepare our communities \nfor an act of bioterrorism.\n  Mr. Bruce Baughman, the Director of Readiness and Planning for the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, testified on terrorism programs, the \nnewly established Office of National Preparedness, and FEMA's plans to \nenact a nationally coordinated plan for terrorism preparedness. Dr. \nScott Lillibridge, the first Special Assistant to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, for National Security and Emergency \nManagement, discussed the current and future bioterrorism preparedness \nand response programs within HHS.\n  They were followed by two expert witnesses, whose testimony and \nexperience were very helpful in laying out what the country should be \ndoing, on a national, State, and local level, to respond to \nbioterrorism.\n  Dr. Tara O'Toole, of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Civilian \nBiodefense Studies, discussed the nature of the threat and the \nchallenges facing response efforts. As she aptly noted, ``nothing in \nthe realm of natural catastrophes or man-made disasters rivals the \ncomplex response problems that would follow a bioweapon attack against \ncivilian populations.''\n  Dr. Dan Hanfling, a physician in the Emergency Department at Inova \nFairfax Hospital, and an active member in regional disaster response \nplanning, shared his views on the ability of local emergency rooms to \nrespond to biological agents. He explained how, with emergency room \novercrowding and ambulance diversions, emergency departments and \nhospitals are operating in a `disaster mode' from day to day.\n  Throughout the hearing, I heard three recurring concerns that must be \naddressed to prepare properly for bioterrorism. First, the medical and \nhospital community is not engaged fully in bioterrorism planning. \nSecond, the partnerships between medical and public health \nprofessionals are not as strong as they need to be. And, third, \nhospitals must have the resources to develop surge capabilities.\n  All three will require long-term efforts to correct these problems. \nHowever, I believe that we can make considerable progress with some \nsimple measures that can be implemented quickly.\n  First, we need to improve awareness of the threat among the medical \ncommunity, thereby increasing engagement with physicians and hospitals. \nDr. O'Toole suggested Congressional support for curriculum development \nfor medical and nursing schools. Such support would require funding for \nthe development of biological weapon and emerging infectious disease \ncurricula, which could be shared to educate, train, and retrain medical \nprofessionals.\n  Second, FEMA must ensure that our medical and hospital communities \nhave a place at the table in the planning and implementing of \nbioterrorism programs. Both Dr. Hanfling and Dr. O'Toole emphasized the \nnecessity of involving the public health and medical communities in \nresponse planning for all acts of terrorism. The medical community is \nalways called upon for assistance in disasters by traditional first \nresponders. For acts of bioterrorism, they become the first responders. \nThis will require funding to provide physicians, nurses, and hospital \nadministrators the resources and time to attend meetings, training \nsessions, and planning activities.\n  Third, we can also enhance the surveillance and monitoring \ncapabilities of the local and state public health departments. This is \ncrucial in order to detect outbreaks as early as possible. One step in \naccomplishing this would be to include veterinarians in current \nmonitoring and surveillance networks. Dr. Lillibridge and Dr. O'Toole \nagreed that the veterinary community can offer many things to the \nbioterrorism effort.\n  For example, most physicians do not have clinical experience with \nlikely bioterrorist agents, such as plague, anthrax, and small pox. \nHowever, many veterinarians have field experience with anthrax and \nplague. Veterinarians could also help in detecting unusual biological \nevents because many emerging diseases, such as West Nile Virus, appear \nin animals long before humans.\n  Dr. Lillibridge said HHS is considering some options to actively \nengage the animal health community. I would suggest creating a senior \nlevel position within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nresponsible for communicating and coordinating with the veterinary \nassociations, local and State animal health officials, and practicing \nand research veterinarians on a routine basis. I hope that HHS will act \nquickly in determining the best course of action.\n  These three actions can help move bioterrorism response forward. Will \nthey solve all the problems we face? No. But with Congressional \nleadership, FEMA's coordination, and HHS's implementation, we should be \nable to improve awareness and engagement by the medical and hospital \ncommunity. We can also expand partnerships between the medical, public \nhealth, and veterinary communities. These are small steps to tackling a \nproblem which, at times, may seem daunting and overwhelming.\n  Our bioterrorism preparedness effort will be helped by developing new \nactivities and communicating with other interested parties. I look \nforward to working with the different stakeholders in their efforts to \nprepare our communities for a possible act of bioterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8458-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8458-S8459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF CARROLL O'CONNOR\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to a great \nAmerican, Carroll O'Connor, who died June 21, 2001 of a heart attack. \nMr. O'Connor was a talented actor who is fondly remembered for his role \nas Archie Bunker in the television show ``All in the Family,'' which \nran successfully from 1971-1979 and for which he won four Emmys. \nEveryone will agree that Mr. O'Connor's portrayal of Archie Bunker \nhelped start a dialogue in this country about serious issues that had \nuntil then been avoided. Issues such as racism, bigotry, and religious \nand gender discrimination were tackled by the cast of ``All in the \nFamily,'' and Mr. O'Connor led the discussion. His loyal fans will \nalways remember the contributions he made to changing attitudes in \nAmerica.\n  As much as I admired Mr. O'Connor for his role in bringing social \nissues to the forefront of American thought, today I would like to talk \nabout another important issue that Mr. O'Connor helped bring to the \nattention of the American public. Mr. O'Connor was a tireless advocate \nfor preventing kids from using drugs. He spoke publicly about the \nimportance of keeping illegal drugs away from our kids. He passionately \npleaded for parents to get between drugs and their kids so as to avoid \nthe heartache that he himself suffered while witnessing his son Hugh \nstruggle with his own addiction to cocaine and ultimately, as a result \nof his addiction, commit suicide. At a time when many would retreat in \ntheir own sorrow and grief, Carroll O'Connor mustered the strength to \nspeak out about the dangers of drug abuse. He was a true public servant \nwho undoubtedly touched the hearts of millions through his public \nservice announcements that intimately described how he lost his son to \ndrug addiction. I truly believe that his moving announcements prompted \nmany parents to talk to their children about drugs.\n  I was fortunate to meet several times with Mr. O'Connor to discuss \nour country's drug control strategy. He had many interesting and \ninnovative ideas as how to best solve the problem. In fact, just a few \nmonths ago he appeared via satellite at a Judiciary Committee hearing I \nheld to testify in favor of S. 304, the Drug Abuse Education, \nPrevention, and Treatment Act of 2001, which I introduced along with \nSenators Leahy, Biden, DeWine, Thurmond, and Feinstein. I want to quote \na passage from his opening statement, which I believe exemplifies his \ndedication to the issue of drug abuse.\n\n       We only know that there is hardly a family in America, on \n     any level of life, that has not been wounded lightly or \n     severely or fatally by the assault of the drug empire upon \n     our country. The loved ones of insensate addicts, like my own \n     poor son, write to me every day imploring my help, as if I, \n     being well-known, might persuade our leaders to protect and \n     defend them in this war, or at the very least help them care \n     for their wounded and dying. This Committee, by this \n     legislation, is now directing serious attention to the care \n     for the wounded and dying.\n\n  I deeply regret that Mr. O'Connor will not be here when the Senate \npasses S. 304, but importantly, his legacy is secure in the form of the \ncontribution he has made to publicizing this issue\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\nand the tireless work toward the passage of this legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that Mr. O'Connor's March 14, 2001 opening statement \nbefore the Judiciary Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement by Carroll O'Connor to the Senate Judiciary Committee, March \n                                14, 2001\n\n       Good morning. My dear Senators, I'm honored by your \n     invitation to be here. I'm deeply involved in our war on \n     drugs but only as a wounded victim of it, without expertise \n     in the conduct of it. I am presuming here simply to speak for \n     five million other victims. Or should I say ten million? Is \n     there a true number? We only know that there is hardly a \n     family in America, on any level of life, that has not been \n     wounded lightly or severely or fatally by the assault of the \n     drug empire upon our country.\n       The loved ones of insensate addicts, like my own poor son, \n     write to me every day imploring my help, as if I, being well-\n     known, might persuade our leaders to protect and defend them \n     in this war, or at the very least help them care for their \n     wounded and dying. This committee, by this legislation, is \n     now directing serious attention to the care of the wounded \n     and dying. This is a good bill. This war against the drug \n     empire is a good war, and except for some who call it a lost \n     war, who would legalize drugs and turn the country over to \n     the invader, the American people are not clamoring to \n     withdraw from this war.\n       This war is raging in the streets around them. They tell me \n     in their letters that they don't understand why we are not \n     fighting this war and winning it. They understand that they \n     are spending billions to raise blockades and sanctions \n     against so-called enemy countries like Libya and Cuba, and to \n     fly bomber patrols over Iraq to prevent the Iraqis from \n     making chemical weapons to use against us, but they know that \n     the only country in the world attacking us daily with the \n     poisons it makes is Colombia, the key country in the drug \n     empire; Colombia which says to us ``Control your own deadly \n     habits; we don't create them, we merely supply them. \n     Meanwhile can you let us have two billion dollars and some \n     American troops to deal with our rebels down here?''\n       If this is an unsophisticated picture of our foreign \n     relations, it is nevertheless starkly real to our despairing \n     people. The picture might better be presented to some other \n     committee of the congress, but it is impossible to leave it \n     out of any consideration of the drug war. I cannot guess how \n     our people will receive the proposals advanced by this good \n     legislation, and I am afraid that the expenditures here \n     proposed for treatment and rehabilitation are not going to be \n     enough by half. I would have said that we needed new, free \n     rehabilitation centers in all of the major counties of our \n     fifty states. How many? Two hundred, three hundred? At what \n     cost? Perhaps a billion? a low guess? just to start the \n     program.\n       Addicts cannot help themselves; they have to learn control, \n     to re-regulate brain cells in expert medical facilities, \n     places with living facilities closely available that will \n     receive them without delay when they are ready to offer \n     themselves. Our people are not ungenerous but they are not \n     well informed.

GIOCONDA\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntruly great American, Brigadier General Thomas F. Gioconda, USAF. \nGeneral Gioconda has served this Nation with distinction for 31 years.\n  A native of Philadelphia, PA, General Gioconda is a graduate of St. \nJoseph's University, Philadelphia, PA, class of 1970. He has earned two \nmasters degrees, one in School Administration from Seton Hall \nUniversity, and another in Business Administration from the University \nof Montana. His military career began in 1970 with an assignment to \nMalstrom AFB, MT, where he served as a missile launch officer. After 4 \nyears as a wing missile operations crew instructor, he served as an \nAFROTC instructor at his alma mater for two years, followed by another \ntwo years at New Jersey Institute of Technology. He then served as a \nmissile operations instructor and section chief at the 4315th Combat \nCrew Training Squadron, Vandenberg AFB, CA.\n  General Gioconda has also served as the principal liaison officer to \nCongress for both General Colin Powell (Ret) and General John \nShalikashvili (Ret) during momentous times in our Nation's history--the \nend of the Cold War, Operations Desert Storm, Provide Promise, Provide \nHope, Provide Comfort, Southern Watch, Deny Flight, and Restore \nDemocracy, and Joint Endeavor, as well as countless other military \noperations and deployments.\n  General Gioconda came to Department of Energy Defense Programs in \nAugust 1997 to serve as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nMilitary Application (DP-2). During his 4-year tenure, General Gioconda \nserved as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs and later \nas the Acting Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, for almost as \nlong as he has served in the DP-2 position. Under this leadership, the \nStockpile Stewardship Program, one of the country's most challenging \nscientific and engineering programs is delivering results of the \nAmerican people, results that make this a safer country for us all. His \nsteady hand, clear vision, decency, candor, and sense of humor has also \nhelped the program overcome profound challenges over the last several \nyears.\n  At the conclusion of his first tour as Acting Deputy Administrator, \nhis accomplishments were justly rewarded with the presentation of the \nDepartment of Energy's highest honor, the Secretary's Gold Medal. \nGeneral Gioconda has made great personal professional sacrifices to \nensure the success of the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the Nation \nowes him a depth of gratitude for this service. I know that the men and \nwomen of the National Nuclear Security Administration will sorely miss \nhis leadership, commitment to excellence, and untiring efforts to look \nout for their welfare.\n  In addition to his Department of Energy award, General Gioconda has \nbeen awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior \nService Medal (with Oak Leaf Cluster), the Defense Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal (four Oak Leaf Clusters), three \nAir Force Commendation Medals, the Air Force Achievement Medal, the \nCombat Readiness Medal, the Outstanding Voluntary Service Medal, and \nthe Command Missile Badge. We wish Tom, his wife Anita, and their three \nsons, Tom, Jr., Anthony, and Timothy, the very best.\n  It is a great honor and personal privilege for me to present his \ncredentials and this tribute to General Thomas F. Gioconda before the \nCongress today. I have enjoyed working with the General over the years \nand I will miss his wise counsel. General Gioconda's extraordinary \ncommitment has helped sustain our Nation's security during his tenure \nand beyond and reflects great credit upon himself, the Departments of \nthe Air Force and Energy, and the United States of America. His actions \nreflect the highest professional standards of the Air Force. He is an \nofficer of the highest honor, integrity, and purpose. Please join me in \nwishing this patriotic American every success in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8459-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8459-S8460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DR. FRED CRAWFORD\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to \nrecognize the accomplishments of Dr. Fred Crawford,\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\nchief heart surgeon at the Medical University of South Carolina. Dr. \nCrawford grew up in rural South Carolina and still enjoys the simple \nlife, but his sophisticated approach to work is on par with any big-\ncity surgeon. He has done a tremendous job of bolstering the medical \ncommunity's perception of MUSC during his more than 20 years on staff, \nby building a world-class team of physicians and nurses and by \nfostering excellence in his students. I ask that Clay Barbour's profile \nof Dr. Crawford, which appeared in The Post and Courier newspaper \nfollows:\n\n                Surgeon Strives Toward Goal for Program\n\n                           (By Clay Barbour)\n\n       In August 1995, former New York City Mayor David Dinkins \n     experienced severe chest pains and dizziness while on \n     vacation in Hilton Head.\n       When it was confirmed that the 68-year-old Dinkins needed \n     triple bypass surgery, there were discussions over where he \n     should receive treatment.\n       New York, after all, offered a plethora of world-class \n     physicians.\n       But after consulting physicians back home, Dinkins' wife \n     decided to place her husband's heart in the very capable \n     hands of Dr. Fred Crawford, MUSC's chief heart surgeon.\n       Crawford says despite Dinkins' high-profile status, his \n     care was the same as the other 800 heart procedures performed \n     at the Medical University of South Carolina that year.\n       But in truth, Dinkins' decision to trust MUSC in such an \n     important matter differed from the others in one key aspect.\n       It was tangible proof of MUSC's standing in the medical \n     community and validation for Crawford and his heart surgery \n     program.\n       When Crawford took over as MUSC's chief cardiothoracic \n     surgeon in 1979, he had one goal--to turn the oft-overlooked \n     program into a major force in medicine.\n       ``We were losing too many people to hospitals out of state, \n     and I wanted that to stop,'' he says. ``I wanted this program \n     to carry the weight of other high-profile programs in the \n     country.\n       But changing perceptions was easier said than done. And \n     even Crawford admits his goal was the naive dream of a young, \n     idealistic surgeon.\n       But as the Dinkins' choice to stay instate proves, with \n     persistence, high standards and skilled personnel, even \n     perceptions can change.\n\n\n                              country boy\n\n       As Crawford climbs atop the tractor, garbed in flannel and \n     denim, the 58-year-old doctor looks out of place.\n       Yet it is here, on his farm amid the corn and sorghum that \n     MUSC's head of surgery is most at home.\n       Crawford was raised here, in the community of Providence, \n     not far from where his 400-acre farm now sits. He met his \n     wife of 35 years, Mary Jane, here. And his mother still lives \n     nearby.\n       He bought the land 12 years ago, right after Hurricane Hugo \n     battered the state. And though he lives in Mount Pleasant, \n     this rustic getaway serves as a weekend retreat, where he can \n     leave the stress of surgery behind and return to a simpler \n     time.\n       Crawford was born in 1942 to a pair of educators. His \n     father was the principal at the local high school. His mother \n     was the principal at the local elementary.\n       So he knows where he developed a fondness for academics and \n     teaching. But he's not exactly sure what originally led him \n     to medicine.\n       He remembers being impressed by an uncle who practiced \n     medicine. And he always admired the family doctor.\n       In 1960, Crawford applied to, and was accepted at, Duke \n     University in Durham, N.C.\n       ``And for a country boy in South Carolina, Duke was about \n     as far out as you could get,'' he says. ``I doubt I'd even \n     heard of any Ivy League schools at the time.''\n       What started in 1960 was Crawford's 16-year relationship \n     with Duke.\n       During his freshman year, Crawford met the man who would \n     become his lifelong mentor, Dr. Will Sealy, a respected heart \n     surgeon and educator at Duke, had a profound influence on \n     Crawford.\n       ``One week after I met him, I knew I wanted to be a \n     surgeon,'' Crawford says. ``After two weeks, I knew I wanted \n     to be a heart surgeon. And after three weeks, I knew I wanted \n     to be an academic heart surgeon.''\n       Crawford finished three years undergraduate work at Duke \n     and was then accepted to the university's prestigious medical \n     school. After finishing medical school, he began a seven-year \n     surgical residency at the university.\n       But the world would intrude on his education.\n\n\n                                vietnam\n\n       ``I think all surgeons, if they're honest with themselves, \n     wonder at some point if they have the hands to do the job,'' \n     Crawford says.\n       Any questions Crawford harbored about his ability were \n     answered between 1969 and 1971--the years he spent in \n     Vietnam.\n       After finishing two years of his residency, Crawford was \n     called to duty in the Army. He arrived at the 24th Evacuation \n     Hospital in Long Binh in 1970. Day in and day out, the young, \n     inexperienced Crawford operated on wounded soldiers. Immersed \n     in work, Crawford soon forgot his doubts and concentrated on \n     his patients.\n       ``I knew after that experience that I had what it took to \n     do the job,'' he says.\n       In 1971, Crawford returned to Duke and completed the last \n     five years of his residency. Finishing in 1976, he accepted a \n     position as chief of cardiac surgery at the University of \n     Mississippi.\n       ``Which tells you more about the state of that program at \n     the time than it does about how good I was,'' he says.\n       Crawford stayed in Mississippi for three years. Then on a \n     fishing trip to South Carolina in 1978, he met former South \n     Carolina Gov. James Edwards and fate stepped in.\n       ``I was impressed with him,'' Edwards says. ``He was an \n     extremely well-trained South Carolina boy. A very together \n     and prepared person.''\n       Edwards asked Crawford when he was coming home. It wasn't \n     the first time Crawford had considered returning to the \n     Palmetto State, but this time something clicked.\n       And as luck would have it, the position for MUSC's head of \n     cardiothoracic surgery opened up soon after the fishing trip. \n     Crawford decided he'd make a run at it.\n       Edwards, an oral surgeon by training, heard that Crawford \n     was not receiving the consideration due his reputation in the \n     industry. So he stepped in.\n       ``I checked up on him before going to bat for him,'' \n     Edwards says.\n       ``I was told he had two of the finest hands a surgeon could \n     have, and his decision-making skills were second to none.''\n       It wasn't long before Edwards reaped the benefits of his \n     decision to back Crawford. In 1983, the former governor \n     accepted a position as MUSC's president.\n\n\n                         home again, home again\n\n       In 1979, Crawford accepted the MUSC job and moved home to \n     South Carolina with the dream of turning MUSC into a world-\n     class heart surgery program.\n       He knew he had to fight public perception to make his dream \n     come true. But to do that, he needed a plan. He started by \n     recruiting world-class physicians and building a team of \n     talented professionals around them.\n       ``You can't have a world-class heart surgery program \n     without world-class nurses, and world-class \n     anesthesiologists,'' he says. ``It takes everybody to make it \n     work.''\n       He then had to lobby for upgraded facilities, a part of the \n     plan he's still working on.\n       ``We're operating in a building that's 55 years old,'' he \n     says. ``In the very near future we're going to have to do \n     something about that.''\n       Crawford says that while he has worked hard on making a \n     name for MUSC's heart surgery program, he has never forgotten \n     that he is also an educator. And that's the part of the job \n     he loves best.\n       ``There is just something about knowing that you've played \n     a part in turning a young student into a great surgeon,'' he \n     says. ``And as they go out and succeed in the profession, \n     they take a little of you with them.''\n       But just because he loves working with students doesn't \n     mean he's easy on them. ``Fred has very high expectations for \n     residents and faculty, and he lets us know when we don't live \n     up to them,'' says Dr. Robert Sade, MUSC's director of Human \n     Values and Healthcare, a medical ethics and health policy \n     think tank.\n       Sade has worked with Crawford for close to 22 years, and \n     says the diminutive surgeon can be gruff in a professional \n     environment.\n       ``But he's a great guy, with a sharp sense of humor,'' he \n     says. ``It's just that surgery is serious work, and Fred \n     takes it very seriously. But without a doubt, he is probably \n     one of the most intelligent and well-organized physicians \n     I've ever worked with.''\n       It's an opinion shared by many in the surgical community. \n     Crawford is the chairman of the American Board of Thoracic \n     Surgery and is the president-elect of the American \n     Association of Thoracic Surgeons, the most prestigious group \n     of its kind in the world.\n       ``That was an honor that really blew me away,'' Crawford \n     says.\n       At 58, Crawford has years left in his hands, and a job \n     that's not quite finished. He intends to continue toward his \n     goal with the same drive that led him to where he is now.\n       ``A year ago I was diagnosed with colon cancer,'' he says. \n     ``I'm better now, but that scare made me aware of how short \n     our time here is. I didn't waste a lot of time before. I \n     don't waste any now.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8460-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8460-S8461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JOHN CLEMSON DUCKWORTH, SR.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear friend, John Clemson Duckworth, of Tuscaloosa, AL. Clemson \nDuckworth died this past Tuesday, July 24th, at the age of 94.\n  Clemson was born in Tuscaloosa in 1907 and attended the University of \nAlabama. He joined the National Guard at the age of 18 and served as \nhis unit's commander when they were activated in 1940 for World War II. \nClemson served in several areas of the Pacific. He rose to the rank of \nfull colonel, earned a Bronze Star and the Legion of Merit.\n  He returned to Tuscaloosa after World War II to his job as a loan \nofficer at First Federal Savings and Loan. He eventually became \nPresident and\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\nChairman of the bank, as well as Chief Executive Officer before he \nretired in 1979 after 50 years of service. During his years of \nleadership at First Federal Savings and Loan, he encouraged home \nownership among the city's residents and guided Tuscaloosa in the \ncity's long-term planning. He served as the first head of the city \nplanning commission.\n  In his church, First United Methodist, Clemson served as Chairman of \nthe Administrative Board and President of the Board of Trustees. He \nserved on several committees of the North Alabama Conference of the \nUnited Methodist Church.\n  At the University of Alabama, he served as an adjunct professor, \nteaching economics and insurance. He was active in a number of \nphilanthropic and social organizations on campus.\n  Clemson Duckworth definitely left a mark on the Tuscaloosa community. \nIn addition to his service to the City Planning Commission, he was also \nactive in the city's Rotary Club. He was a member of the Druid City \nHospital Foundation Board and played an active role in many of its fund \nraising projects. He served as Chairman and President of the Community \nChest Drive, President of the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama and \nthe Junior Chamber of Commerce, and Director and Treasurer of the \nBuilding Fund of YMCA. For his lifetime of service to his country and \ncommunity, Clemson Duckworth was honored as Tuscaloosa's Citizen of the \nYear.\n  Clemson also found time to raise a family. He and his wife Susie \nraised a daughter, Virginia Duckworth Cade; and two sons, John Clemson \nDuckworth, Jr. and Joe Brown Duckworth. They were also blessed with \nseven grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren.\n  Clemson Duckworth was a good friend, a patriarch of the Tuscaloosa \ncommunity, a decorated veteran of World War II, and a much-beloved \nfamily man. He will be greatly missed by many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8461-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8461-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8461-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAQ--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 38\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

For these reasons, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to maintain in force the broad authorities necessary to apply \neconomic pressure on the Government of Iraq.\n                                                         George Bush.  \nThe White House, July 31, 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8461-5", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8461-S8462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 12:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1954.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to jurors' \n     compensation; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 104\n\n       Whereas, While jury service is a civic duty for many \n     Americans, extended jury service can create significant \n     financial hardship on jurors, and for many citizens the honor \n     and privilege of serving on a jury becomes instead a burden \n     that not only tends to limit participation in jury service \n     but ultimately reduces the representativeness of juries in an \n     increasingly diverse society; and\n       Whereas, Under current Texas law, jurors are entitled to \n     reimbursement of expenses in an amount not less than $6 nor \n     more than $50 for each day of jury service, with the actual \n     amount being determined by the county commissioners court; \n     the law also allows a presiding judge, under certain \n     circumstances, to increase the daily reimbursement above the \n     amount set by the commissioners court provided that \n     reimbursement does not exceed the maximum allowable amount of \n     $50 per day, with the additional costs in these cases being \n     shared equally by the parties involved; and\n       Whereas, Because jurors' compensation often falls at the \n     lower end of this reimbursement schedule, jury duty \n     participation may cause undue financial hardships on citizens \n     who incur substantial traveling and other daily expenses when \n     responding to a jury summons; and\n       Whereas, Furthermore, because Texas law does not require \n     employers to pay employees for the time they take off work to \n     perform jury service, the financial hardship falls most \n     heavily on hourly wage earners who cannot afford the \n     different between the $6 per day compensation and the amount \n     of wages lost; and\n       Whereas, Consequently, minorities, young adults, and other \n     lower-income individuals are significantly underrepresented \n     on many Texas juries, which may potentially violate a \n     constitutional requirement that juries represent a cross-\n     section of the community; and\n       Whereas, While county commissioners courts may provide for \n     juror compensation above the state minimum, courts in poorer \n     communities may be hard pressed to do so, and even in those \n     communities that do pay above the minimum, the higher \n     compensation still does not offset the amount of wages a \n     juror may forgo during an extended jury trial; additional \n     incentives are needed to lessen or remove jurors' financial \n     burdens and thus ensure greater public participation in jury \n     service and safeguard constitutional guarantees; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully request the Congress of the United States \n     to pass legislation amending the Internal Revenue Code to \n     give each person who serves on a jury under certain \n     circumstances or in certain localities a $40 tax credit per \n     day of service and to give each person who is summoned and \n     appears, but does not serve, a one-time $40 tax credit for \n     that day; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-166. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to Canadian \n     lumber, to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 98\n\n       Whereas, Lumber is an important natural resource and a \n     vital industry for both the United States and Texas; the U.S. \n     and Texas timber industries' ability to compete in a global \n     economy, however, is hampered by the continuing influx of \n     Canadian lumber, which is heavily subsidized by the \n     provincial governments; and\n       Whereas, Canadian softwood lumber producers obtain most of \n     their timber supply from government-owned forests, and the \n     provinces subsidize lumber production by selling timber to \n     Canadian lumber companies at noncompetitive prices for a \n     fraction of the timber's market value; and\n       Whereas, Artificially low provincial timber prices, minimum \n     harvesting restrictions, and other practices that encourage \n     overharvesting and overproduction have helped Canadian \n     imports gain a 36 percent share of the U.S. softwood lumber \n     market; and\n       Whereas, Highly subsidized Canadian lumber imports unfairly \n     compete with U.S. lumber companies, jeopardizing thousands of \n     jobs and driving down the market value of U.S. forestlands; \n     and\n       Whereas, U.S. industry and labor groups, U.S. and Canadian \n     environmental organizations, and Native American groups have \n     called for an end to these subsidies in order to establish \n     fair trade practices; and\n       Whereas, The United States must fully enforce trade laws to \n     offset the subsidies and mitigate injury to the U.S. softwood \n     lumber industry if the Canadian subsidies are not \n     discontinued; and\n       Whereas, The only protection for U.S. timber growers \n     against these unfair market conditions is the current United \n     States-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement, which is scheduled \n     to expire on the last day of March 2001; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States \n     to:\n       (1) make the problem of subsidized Canadian lumber imports \n     a top trade priority to be addressed immediately;\n       (2) take every possible action to end Canadian lumber \n     subsidy practices through open and competitive sales of \n     timber and logs in Canada for fair market value or, if Canada \n     will not agree to end the subsidies immediately, provide that \n     the subsidies be offset in the United States;\n       (3) encourage open and competitive timber sales at fair \n     market prices; and\n       (4) if Canada does not agree to end subsidies for lumber:\n       (A) enforce vigorously, promptly, and fully the trade laws \n     with regard to subsidized and dumped imports;\n       (B) explore all options to stop unfairly traded imports; \n     and\n       (C) limit injury to the U.S. lumber industry; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all members of the Texas delegation to the \n     congress with the request that this resolution be entered in \n     the Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-167. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to enacting \n     the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of \n     2001; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 210\n\n       Whereas, The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement \n     Act of 2000 was approved in a bipartisan effort by 391 \n     members of the United States House of Representatives in the \n     106th Congress, including 20 members from the Texas \n     delegation to the congress; and\n       Whereas, Even though more than 80 United States senators \n     signed letters of support for this legislation in 2000, the \n     bill never came up for a vote in the full senate; and\n       Whereas, An identical bill addressing railroad retirement \n     reform is now before the 107th Congress to modernize the \n     financing of the railroad retirement system for its 748,000 \n     beneficiaries nationwide, including more than 38,000 in \n     Texas; and\n       Whereas, The act provides tax relief to freight railroads, \n     Amtrak, and commuter lines; it also provides benefit \n     improvements for surviving spouses of rail workers, who \n     currently suffer deep cuts in income when the rail retiree \n     dies; and\n       Whereas, Railroad management and labor and retiree \n     organizations have agreed to support this legislation; and\n       Whereas, No outside contributions from taxpayers are needed \n     to implement the changes called for in this legislation as \n     all costs relating to the reforms will come from within the \n     railroad industry, including a full share by active \n     employees; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     enact the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act \n     of 2001; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-168. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to the \n     development of an agreement or treaty with Mexico to address \n     health issues; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 21\n\n       Whereas, Border health conditions not only pose an \n     immediate risk to those who live along either side of the \n     United States-Mexico border, but also are a health concern \n     for all of the United States, and unaddressed health concerns \n     in this region will only continue to worsen as the border \n     population and its mobility increase, thereby escalating the \n     risks to other areas of exposure and transmission of disease; \n     and\n       Whereas, While the State of Texas has attempted to address \n     many of the health issues facing the border population in \n     Texas, binational cooperation at the federal level is \n     essential to addressing these health concerns; and\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\n       Whereas, In 1999, the Texas Legislature called for an in-\n     depth study of the public health infrastructure and barriers \n     to a cooperative effort between Texas and Mexico; results of \n     the study indicate that differences in technology and \n     limitations on the exchange of technology, disparities in \n     methods of collecting data and confidentiality provisions \n     that restrict information sharing, and cultural differences \n     that affect interaction between local and state health \n     departments all combine to inhibit collaboration on health \n     issues of mutual concern; and\n       Whereas, An example of the consequences of such barriers to \n     cooperation occurred in 1999, when an outbreak of dengue \n     fever in South Texas was traced back to Mexican cities and \n     was thought to have been brought from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, \n     to Laredo, Texas; and\n       Whereas, Despite the implications for an outbreak across \n     the border, Mexican health officials were limited in their \n     ability to confirm cases of the mosquito-borne illness, and \n     provisions in the Mexican Constitution restricted them from \n     sharing the results of tests performed on Mexican citizens \n     with Texas' health officials; and\n       Whereas, Similar instances have occurred where incidences \n     of tuberculosis, salmonella, and malaria around the United \n     States were found to have started in the Texas-Mexico border \n     region; and\n       Whereas, It is in the interest of the United States to \n     control the spread of diseases, beginning in the places where \n     they originate, and poverty and poor health conditions along \n     the United States-Mexico border region provide a large \n     incubation ground for diseases; however, the efforts of one \n     state or country alone will not address conditions that are \n     present on both sides of the border, or legal issues that \n     create incompatibilities between approaches, making a \n     cooperative binational effort vitally important; and\n       Whereas, The United States and Mexico have worked in \n     concert in forming NAFTA and related side agreements that \n     address environmental infrastructure issues, creating the \n     Border Environment Cooperation Commission and establishing \n     the North American Development Bank; the success of these \n     joint ventures suggests that forming similar international \n     agreements to improve the public health infrastructure and \n     finding ways to address the exchange of technology and \n     information will improve the quality of life for residents of \n     the border region as well as reduce the public health risks \n     in the spread of disease; and\n       Whereas, Establishing an agreement between the United \n     States and Mexico will show a commitment to the issue of \n     public health and acknowledge that the spread of disease is \n     an international problem without boundaries; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby urge the Congress of the United States to initiate the \n     development of an agreement or treaty with Mexico to address \n     health issues of mutual concern; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8464-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n       S. 1272.

A bill to assist United States veterans who were treated as \nslave laborers while held as prisoners of war by Japan during World War \nII, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with my co-sponsor, Senator \nFeinstein, to introduce legislation that will help a very special cadre \nof Americans, a group of Americans that, over 50 years ago, paid a very \ndear price on behalf of our country. The incredible sacrifice made by \nthese Americans has never properly been acknowledged, and it is high \ntime that they receive some measure of compensation for that sacrifice.\n  On April 9, 1942, Allied forces in the Philippines surrendered the \nBataan Peninsula to the Japanese. Ten to twelve thousand American \nsoldiers were forced to march some 60 miles in broiling heat in a \ndeadly trek known as the Bataan Death March. Following a lengthy \ninternment under horrific conditions, thousands of POWs were shipped to \nJapan in the holds of freighters known as ``Hell Ships.'' Once in \nJapan, the survivors of the Bataan Death March were joined by hundreds \nof other American POWs, POWs who had been captured by the Japanese in \nactions throughout the Pacific theater of war, at Corregidor, at Guam, \nat Wake Islands, and at countless other battlegrounds.\n  After arriving in Japan, many of the American POWs were forced into \nslave labor for private Japanese steel mills and other private \ncompanies until the end of the war. During their internment, the \nAmerican POWs were subjected to torture, and to the withholding of food \nand medical treatment, in violation of international conventions \nrelating to the protection of prisoners of war.\n  More than 50 years have passed since the atrocities occurred, yet our \nveterans are still waiting for accountability and justice. \nUnfortunately, global political and security needs of the time often \novershadowed their legitimate claims for justice, and these former POWs \nwere once again asked to sacrifice for their country. Following the end \nof the war, for example, our government instructed many of the POWs \nheld by Japan not to discuss their experiences and treatment. Some were \neven asked to sign non-disclosure agreements. Consequently, many \nAmericans remain unaware of the atrocities that took place and the \nsuffering our POWs endured.\n\n  Finally, after more than 50 years, a new effort is underway to seek \ncompensation for the POWs from the private Japanese companies which \nprofited from their labor.\n  Let me say at the outset, that this is not a dispute with the \nJapanese people and these are not claims against the Japanese \ngovernment. Rather, these are private claims against the private \nJapanese companies that profited from the slave labor of our American \nsoldiers who they held as prisoners. These are the same types of claims \nraised by survivors of the Holocaust against the private German \ncorporations who forced them into labor.\n  Here in the Senate, we have been doing what we can to help these \nformer prisoners of war. In June of last year, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on the claims being made by the former \nAmerican POWs against the private Japanese companies, to determine \nwhether the executive branch had been doing everything in its power to \nsecure justice for these valiant men.\n  In the fall of last year, with the invaluable assistance of Senator \nFeinstein, we were able to pass legislation declassifying thousands of \nJapanese Imperial Army records held by the U.S. government, to assist \nthe POW's in the pursuit of their claims.\n  We can do even more. Recently, the State of California passed \nlegislation extending the statute of limitations, under state law, to \nallow the POWs to bring monetary claims against the Japanese \ncorporations that unlawfully employed them. Other States are \ncontemplating such legislation.\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\n  The bill we are introducing today makes clear that any claims brought \nin state court, and subsequently removed to Federal court, will still \nhave the benefit of the extended statute of limitations enacted by the \nstate legislatures.\n  The legislators in California, and other States, have recognized the \nfairness of the allowing these claims to proceed for a decision on the \nmerits. In light of the tangled history of this issue, including the \nrole played by the U.S. government in discouraging these valiant men \nfrom pursuing their just claims, it is simply unfair to deny these men \ntheir day in court because their claims have supposedly grown stale.\n  These claims are not stale in their ability to inspire admiration for \nthe men who survived this ordeal. These claims are not stale in their \nability to inspire indignation against the corporations who flouted \ninternational standards of decency.\n  The statute of limitations should not be permitted to cut off these \nclaims before they can be heard on the merits. Today's bill does \nnothing more than ensure that these valiant men receive their fair day \nin court.\n  I hope my fellow Senators will join with me, and with Senator \nFeinstein, on this important legislation. These heroes of World War II \nhave waited too long for a just resolution of their claims.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise alongside my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, to introduce the ``POW Assistance Act of 2001''.\n  This legislation makes an important statement in support of the many \nmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces who were used as slave labor by \nJapanese companies during the Second World War or subject to chemical \nand biological warfare experiments in Japanese POW camps.\n  The core of this bill is a clarification that in any pending lawsuit \nbrought by former POWs against Japanese corporations, or any lawsuits \nwhich might be filed in the future, the Federal court shall apply the \napplicable statute of limitations of the State in which the action was \nbrought.\n  This legislation is important because a recently enacted California \nlaw enables victims of WWII slave labor to seek damages up to the year \n2010 against responsible Japanese companies, just as any citizen can \nsue a private company. Seventeen lawsuits have been filed on behalf of \nformer POWs who survived forced labor, beatings, and starvation at the \nhands of Japanese companies. By asking Federal judges to look to the \nState statute of limitation, this legislation sends a clear message to \nthe courts that we believe that suits with merit should not be \nprecluded.\n  Today, too many Americans and Japanese do not know that American POWs \nperformed forced labor for Japanese companies during the war.\n  American POWs, including those who had been forced through the Bataan \nDeath March, were starved and denied adequate medical care and were \nforced to perform slave labor for private Japanese companies. American \nPOWs toiled in mines, factories, shipyards, and steel mills. Many POWs \nworked virtually every day for 10 hours or more, often under extremely \ndangerous working conditions. They were starved and denied adequate \nmedical care. Even today, many survivors still suffer from health \nproblems directly tied to their slave labor.\n  It is critical that we do not forget the heroism and sacrifice of the \nPOWs, and that the United States government does not stand in the way \nof their pursuit of recognition and compensation. They have never \nreceived an apology or payment from the companies that enslaved them, \nmany of which are still in existence today.\n  The bill that Senator Hatch and I have introduced today does not \nprejudice the outcome of the lawsuits which are pending one way or \nanother. The legislation we have introduced today simply holds that the \nlawsuits filed in California, or any which may still be filed under the \nCalifornia statute of limitations, should be allowed to go forward so \nthat this issue can be settled definitively, without impeding the right \nof the POWs to pursue justice.\n  One of my most important goals in the Senate has been to see the \ndevelopment of a Pacific Rim community that is peaceful and stable. And \nI am pleased that the Government of Japan today is a close ally and \ngood friend of the United States, and a responsible member of the \ninternational community.\n  And I want to clarify that this legislation is not directed at the \npeople or government of Japan. The POWs and veterans are only seeking \njustice from the private companies that enslaved them, and this \nlegislation has been designed in the interest of allowing these claims \nto move forward.\n  But I also believe that if Japan is to play a greater role in the \ninternational community it is important for Japan, the United States, \nand other countries in the Asia-Pacific region to be able to reconcile \ninterpretations of memory and history, especially of the Second World \nWar. If, as Gerrit Gong has written, Japan aspires to be a normal \ncountry, this question of ``remembering and forgetting'' is critical if \nJapan hopes to forge an environment in which its neighbors ``do not \nobject to that country's engaging in a full range of international \nactivities and capabilities.''\n  The goal of this legislation is to remove this outstanding issue in \nU.S.-Japan relations, and to try to heal wounds that still remain. I \nhope that the Senate will see fit to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1273. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nrural health services outreach, rural health network planning and \nimplementation, and small health care provider quality improvement \ngrant programs, and telehomecare demonstration projects; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have introduced the ``Improving Health \nCare in Rural America Act'' that continues a rural health outreach \nprogram that I worked to establish as a part of the fiscal year 1991 \nLabor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. We began this \ninnovative program to demonstrate the effectiveness of outreach \nprograms to populations in rural areas that have trouble obtaining \nhealth and mental health services. Too often, these people are not able \nto obtain health care until they are acutely ill and need extensive and \nexpensive hospital care.\n  Indeed, rural Americans are at triple jeopardy, they are more often \npoor, more often uninsured, and more often without access to health \ncare. Rural America is home to a disproportionately large segment of \nolder citizens who more often require long-term care for their \nillnesses and disabilities. And rural America is not immune from the \nsocial stresses of modern society. This is manifest by escalating needs \nfor mental health services to deal with necessary alcohol- and drug-\nrelated treatment, and by the significantly higher rate of suicide in \nrural areas. Yet, rural Americans are increasingly becoming commuters \nfor their health care. Rural Americans deserve to be treated equitably \nand the legislation that I rise to describe today helps bring high \nquality health care to rural communities to meet their specific needs.\n  This grant program has proven itself highly successful because it \nresponds to local community needs and is directed by the people in the \ncommunity. These innovative grants bring needed primary and preventive \ncare to those people who have few other options. These grants also help \nlink health and social services, thereby reaching the people that most \nneed these services.\n  This program has received overwhelmingly positive response from all \nfifty States because it has had a tremendous impact on improving \ncoordination between health care providers and expanding access to \nneeded health care.\n  In Iowa, the Ida County Community Hospital receives funds to improve \nthe quality of life for older people who are chronically ill by making \nhome visits, providing pain management, and telmonitoring, and other \nneeded services.\n  In Maquoketa, IA, every school-age child is being given timely, high \nquality care because the local school district used their grant to team \nup with almost every health care provider in the county to provide \nservices.\n  In Mason City, IA, the North Iowa Mercy Health Center is \ncollaborating\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\nwith the Easter Seals Society of Northern Iowa, Rockwell Community \nNursing, and the Pony Express Riders of Iowa to make sure seniors have \naccess to physician, therapy, and dental services. This program also \nrecycles and repairs assistive technology equipment to help seniors \nthat are unable to afford new equipment.\n  The ``Improving Health Care in Rural America Act'' also establishes a \ntelehomecare demonstration program for five separate projects to allow \nhome health care professionals to provide some services through \ntelehealth technologies. This program will allow rural residents to \nhave better access to daily health care services and will reduce health \ncare costs. This program is designed to improve patient access to care, \nquality of care, patient satisfaction with care while reducing the \ncosts of providing care. Nurses and other health care professionals \nwill be trained in how to use this advanced technology to provide \nbetter, more effective care. This programs applies the highly effective \ntelehealth technology to an area of health care that will benefit \ngreatly.\n  As ranking member and as chairman of the Labor-HHS Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have been pleased to be able to provide funding for \nthis program during the previous decade. This bill will extend this \nhighly successful program for 5 more years and I look forward to \nprovide its funding. Programs that work this well deserve the support \nof Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nprograms for the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of stroke; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                 1_____\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Feingold, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1275. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants for public access defibrillation programs and public access \ndefibrillation demonstration projects, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kennedy to \nintroduce two pieces of legislation, the STOP Stroke Act and the \nCommunity Access to Emergency Defibrillation Act. These bills represent \nour next step in the battle against cardiac arrest and stroke and are \ncritical to increasing access to timely, quality health care.\n  The first bill we are introducing today focuses attention on stroke, \nthe third leading cause of death and the leading cause of serious, \nlong-term disability in the United States, through the implementation \nof a prevention and education campaign, the development of the Paul \nCoverdell Stroke Registry and Clearinghouse, and the provision of \ngrants for statewide stroke care systems and for medical professional \ndevelopment. The untimely death of Senator Paul Coverdell points to the \nneed to provide more comprehensive stroke care and to learn more about \nproviding better quality care to the more than 700,000 Americans who \nexperience a stroke each year. Our first step in doing so is the \nintroduction of the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act (STOP \nStroke Act).\n  One of the most significant factors that affects stroke survival \nrates is the speed with which one obtains access to health care \nservices. About 47 percent of stroke deaths occur out of the hospital. \nMany patients do not recognize the signs of a stroke and attribute the \ncommon symptoms, such as dizziness, loss of balance, confusion, severe \nheadache or numbness, to other less severe ailments. To increase \nawareness of this public health problem, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services will implement a national, multimedia campaign to \npromote stroke prevention and encourage those with the symptoms of \nstroke to seek immediate treatment. This crucial legislation also \nprovides for special programs to target high risk populations. For the \nprofessional community, continuing education grants are included to \ntrain physicians in\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\nnewly-developed diagnostic approaches, technologies, and therapies for \nprevention and treatment of stroke. With a more informed public and up-\nto-date physicians, our ability to combat the devastating effects of a \nstroke will be enhanced.\n  The Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry and Clearinghouse, \nauthorized in the STOP Stroke Act, establish mechanisms for the \ncollection, analysis, and dissemination of valuable information about \nbest practices relating to stroke care and the development of stroke \ncare systems. In order to facilitate the process of implementing \nstatewide stroke prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation systems that \nreflect the research gathered by the Registry and Clearinghouse, grants \nwill be made available to States that will ensure that stroke patients \nhave access to quality care.\n  These legislative efforts have already proved successful. Lives are \nbeing saved. We can do more.\n  Therefore, we are moving today to expand on these successes by \nintroducing the Community Access to Emergency Defibrillation Act. This \nimportant legislation will provide $50 million for communities to \nestablish public access defibrillation programs that will train \nemergency medical personnel, purchase AEDs for placement in public \nareas, ensure proper maintenance of defibrillators, and evaluate the \neffectiveness of the program.\n  Each year, over 250,000 Americans suffer sudden cardiac arrest. \nSudden cardiac arrest is a common cause of death during which the heart \nsuddenly stops functioning. Most frequently, cardiac arrest occurs when \nthe electrical impulses that regulate the heart become rapid, \nventricular tachycardia, or chaotic, ventricular fibrillation, causing \nthe heart to stop beating altogether. As a result, the individual \ncollapses, stops breathing and has no pulse. Often, the heart can be \nshocked back into a normal rhythm with the aid of a defibrillator. This \nis exactly what happened when I resuscitated a patient using \ncardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, and electrical cardioversion in the \nDirksen Senate Office Building in 1995.\n  When a person goes into cardiac arrest, time is of the essence. \nWithout defibrillation, his or her chances of survival decrease by \nabout 10 percent with every minute that passes. Thus, having an \nautomated external defibrillator, AED, accessible is not only \nimportant, but also could save lives. AEDs are portable, lightweight, \neasy to use, and are becoming an essential part of administering first \naid to victims of sudden cardiac arrest.\n  We have seen that in places where AEDs are readily available, \nsurvival rates can increase by 20-30 percent. In some settings, \nsurvival rates have even reached 70 percent. Therefore, Congress has \ntaken several important steps to increase access to AEDs over the past \ntwo Congresses.\n  In the 105th Congress, I authored the Aviation Medical Assistance \nAct. This bill directed the Federal Aviation Administration to decide \nwhether to require AEDs on aircraft and in airports. As a result of \nthis law, many airlines now carry AEDs on board, and some airports have \nplaced AEDs in their terminals. At Chicago O'Hare, just four months \nafter AEDs were placed in that airport, four victims were resuscitated \nusing the publicly available AEDs.\n  In the last Congress, we passed two important bills expanding the \navailability of AEDs: the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act and the Rural \nAccess to Emergency Devices Act. Respectively, these bills address the \nplacement of automated external defibrillators, AEDs, in Federal \nbuildings and provide liability protection to persons or organizations \nwho use AEDs, as well as grants to community partnerships to enable \nthem to purchase AEDs. The bills also provide defibrillator and basic \nlife support training.\n  I am pleased to introduce these important pieces of legislation and I \nlook forward to their ultimate enactment into law. I want to thank my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, for his work on these life saving \nproposals.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleague, \nSenator Frist, to introduce the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention \nAct. Stroke is a cruel affliction that takes the lives and blights the \nhealth of millions of Americans. Senator Frist and I have worked \nclosely on legislation to establish new initiatives to reduce the grim \ntoll taken by stroke, and I commend him for his leadership. We are \njoined in proposing this important legislation by our colleagues on the \nHealth Committee, Senators Dodd, Hutchinson, Jeffords, Collins, \nBingaman, Edwards, and Murray. The STOP Stroke Act is also supported by \na broad coalition of organizations representing patients and the health \ncare community.\n  Stroke is a national tragedy that leaves no American community \nunscarred.\n  Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. \nEvery minute of every day, somewhere in America, a person suffers a \nstroke. Every three minutes, a person dies from one. Strokes take the \nlives of nearly 160,000 Americans each year. Even for those who survive \nan attack, stroke can have devastating consequences. Over half of all \nstroke survivors are left with a disability.\n  Since few Americans recognize the symptoms of stroke, crucial hours \nare often lost before patients receive medical care. The average time \nbetween the onset of symptoms and medical treatment is a shocking 13 \nhours. Emergency medical technicians are often not taught how to \nrecognize and manage the symptoms of stroke. Rapid administration of \nclot-dissolving drugs can dramatically improve the outcome of stroke, \nyet fewer than 3 percent of stroke patients now receive such \nmedication. If this lifesaving medication were delivered promptly to \nall stroke patients, as many as 90,000 Americans could be spared the \ndisabling aftermath of stroke.\n  Even in hospitals, stroke patients often do not receive the care that \ncould save their lives. Treatment of patients by specially trained \nhealth care providers increases survival and reduces disability due to \nstroke, but a neurologist is the attending physician for only about one \nin ten stroke patients. To save lives, reduce disabilities and improve \nthe quality of stroke care, the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing \nPrevention, STOP Stroke, Act authorizes important public health \ninitiatives to help patients with symptoms of stroke receive timely and \neffective care.\n  The Act establishes a grant program for States to implement systems \nof stroke care that will give health professionals the equipment and \ntraining they need to treat this disorder. The initial point of contact \nbetween a stroke patient and medical care is usually an emergency \nmedical technician. Grants authorized by the Act may be used to train \nemergency medical personnel to provide more effective care to stroke \npatients in the crucial first few moments after an attack.\n  The Act provides important new resources for States to improve the \nstandard of care given to stroke patients in hospitals. The legislation \nwill assist States in increasing the quality of stroke care available \nin rural hospitals through improvements in telemedicine.\n  The Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct \na national media campaign to inform the public about the symptoms of \nstroke, so that patients receive prompt medical care. The bill also \ncreates the Paul Coverdell Stroke Registry and Clearinghouse, which \nwill collect data about the care of stroke patients and assist in the \ndevelopment of more effective treatments.\n  Finally, the STOP Stroke Act establishes continuing education \nprograms for medical professionals in the use of new techniques for the \nprevention and treatment of stroke.\n  These important new initiatives can make a difference in the lives of \nthe thousands of American who suffer a stroke every year. For patients \nexperiencing a stroke, even a few minutes' delay in receiving treatment \ncan make the difference between healthy survival and disability or \ndeath. The Act will help make certain that those precious minutes are \nnot wasted.\n  Increased public information on the symptoms of stroke will help \nstroke patients and their families know to seek medical care promptly. \nBetter training of emergency medical personnel will help ensure that \nstroke patients receive lifesaving medications when they are most \neffective. Improved systems of stroke care will help patients receive \nthe quality treatment\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\nneeded to save lives and reduce disability.\n  This legislation can make a real difference to every community in \nAmerica, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Frist and myself in \nsupporting the STOP Stroke Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that additional material and letters of \nsupport relating to this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        The Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act of 2001\n\n\n                  background and need for legislation\n\n       Stoke is the third leading cause of death in the United \n     States, claiming the life of one American every three and a \n     half minutes. Those who survive stroke are often disabled and \n     have extensive health care needs. The economic cost of stroke \n     is staggering. The United States spends over $30 billion each \n     year on caring for persons who have experienced stroke.\n       Prompt treatment of patients experiencing stroke can save \n     lives and reduce disability, yet thousands of stroke patients \n     do not receive proper therapy during the crucial window of \n     time when it is most effective. Rapid administration of clot-\n     dissolving drugs can dramatically improve the outcome of \n     stroke, yet fewer than 3 percent of stroke patients now \n     receive such medication. Treatment of patients by specially \n     trained health care providers increases survival and reduces \n     disability due to stroke, but a neurologist is the attending \n     physician for only about one in ten stroke patients. Most \n     Americans cannot identify the signs of stroke and even \n     emergency medical technicians are often not taught how to \n     recognize and manage its symptoms. Even in hospitals, stroke \n     patients often do not receive the care that could save their \n     lives. To saves lives, reduce disability and improve the \n     quality of stroke care, the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing \n     Prevention, STOP Stroke, Act authorizes the following \n     important public health initiatives.\n     Stroke prevention and education campaign\n       The STOP Stroke Act provides $40 million, fiscal year 2002, \n     for the Secretary to carry out a national, multi-media \n     awareness campaign to promote stroke prevention and encourage \n     stroke patients to seek immediate treatment. The campaign \n     will be tested for effectiveness in targeting populations at \n     high risk for stroke, including women, senior citizens, and \n     African-Americans. Alternative campaigns will be designed for \n     unique communities, including those in the nation's ``Stoke \n     belt,'' a region with a particularly high rate of stroke \n     incidence and mortality.\n     Paul Coverdell Stroke Registry and Clearinghouse\n       The STOP Stroke Act authorizes the Paul Coverdell Stroke \n     Registry and Clearinghouse to collect data about the care of \n     acute stroke patients and foster the development of effective \n     stroke care systems. The clearinghouse will serve as a \n     resource for States seeking to design and implement their own \n     stroke care systems by collecting, analyzing and \n     disseminating information on the efforts of other communities \n     to establish similar systems. Special consideration will be \n     given to the unique needs of rural facilities and those \n     facilities with inadequate resources for providing quality \n     services for stroke patients. The Secretary is also \n     authorized to conduct and support research on stroke care. \n     Where suitable research has already been conducted, the \n     Secretary is charged with disseminating this research to \n     increase its effectiveness in improving stroke care.\n     Grants for statewide stroke care systems\n       The Secretary will award grants to States to develop and \n     implement statewide stroke prevention, treatment, and \n     rehabilitation systems. These systems must ensure that stroke \n     patients in the State have access to quality care. The \n     Secretary is also authorized to award planning grants to \n     States to assist them in developing statewide stroke care \n     systems. Each State that receives a grant will: implement \n     curricula for training emergency medical services personnel \n     to provide pre-hospital care to stroke patients; curricula \n     may be modeled after a curriculum developed by the Secretary; \n     have the option of identifying acute stroke centers, \n     comprehensive stroke treatment centers, and/or stroke \n     rehabilitation centers; set standards of care and other \n     requirements for facilities providing services to stroke \n     patients; specify procedures to evaluate the statewide stroke \n     care system; and collect and analyze data from each facility \n     providing care to stroke patients in the State to improve the \n     quality of stroke care provided in that State.\n       The Act authorizes this grant program at $50 million for \n     fiscal year 2002, $75 million for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, \n     $100 million for fiscal year 2005, and $125 million for \n     fiscal year 2006.\n     Medical professional development\n       The STOP Stroke Act provides grant authority to the \n     Secretary for public and non-profit entities to develop and \n     implement continuing education programs in the use of new \n     diagnostic approaches, technologies, and therapies for the \n     prevention and treatment of stroke. Grant recipients must \n     have a plan for evaluation of activities carried out with the \n     funding. The Secretary must ensure that any grants awarded \n     are distributed equitably among the regions of the United \n     States and between urban and rural populations.\n     Secretary's role\n       In addition to carrying out the national education \n     campaign, operating the clearinghouse and registry, and \n     awarding grants to States, the Secretary will: develop \n     standards of care for stroke patients that may be taken into \n     consideration by States applying for grants; develop a model \n     curriculum that States may adopt for emergency medical \n     personnel; develop a model plan for designing and \n     implementing stroke care systems, taking into consideration \n     the unique needs of varying communities; report to Congress \n     on the implementation of the Act in participating States.\n       In carrying out the STOP Stroke Act, the Secretary will \n     consult widely with those having expert knowledge of the \n     needs of patients with stroke.\n\n\n                            KEY STROKE FACTS\n\n     The devastating effects of stroke\n       There are roughly 700,000-750,000 strokes in the U.S. each \n     year.\n       Stroke is the 3rd leading cause of death in the U.S.\n       Almost 160,000 Americans die each year from stroke.\n       Every minute in the U.S., an individual experiences a \n     stroke. Every 3.3 minutes an individual dies from one.\n       Over the course of a lifetime, four out of every five \n     families in the U.S. will be touched by stroke.\n       Roughly 1/3 of stroke survivors have another one within \n     five years.\n       Currently, there are four million Americans living with the \n     effects of stroke.\n       15 percent to 30 percent of stroke survivors are \n     permanently disabled. 55 percent of stroke survivors have \n     some level of disability.\n       40 percent of these patients feel they can no longer visit \n     people; almost 70 percent report that they cannot read; 50 \n     percent need day-hospital services; 40 percent need home \n     help; 40 percent have a visiting nurse; and 14 percent need \n     Meals on Wheels.\n       22 percent of men and 25 percent of women who have an \n     initial stroke die within one year.\n     The staggering costs of stroke\n       Stroke costs the U.S. $30 billion each year.\n       The average cost per patient for the first 90 days \n     following a stroke is $15,000.\n       The lifetime costs of stroke exceed $90,000 per patient for \n     ischemic stroke and over $225,000 per patient for \n     subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n     Improvements can be made\n       When a stroke unit was first established at Mercy General \n     Hospital in Sacramento, CA in December of 1990, the average \n     length of stay for a Medicare stroke patient in the immediate \n     care setting was 7 days and total hospital charges per \n     patient were $14,076. By June of 1994, the average length of \n     stay was 4.6 days and the charges per patient were $10,740. \n     Overall, in the three and a half years during which the \n     stroke unit was in operation, Mercy General's charges to \n     Medicare for stroke patients declined $1,621,296.\n       In a national survey of acute stroke teams ASTs, Duke \n     University researchers found that the majority of ASTs cost \n     only $0-$5,000, far less than the average cost for \n     hospitalization of stroke patients.\n\n\n       Stroke patients often do not receive effective treatments\n\n       Nationally, only 2 percent to 3 percent of patients with \n     stroke are being treated with the clot-busting drug, tPA.\n       In the year following FDA approval of tPA, it was \n     determined that only 1.5 percent of patients who might have \n     been candidates for tPA therapy actually received it.\n       In a study of North Carolina's stroke treatment facilities, \n     66 percent of hospitals did not have stroke protocols and 82 \n     percent did not have rapid identification for patients \n     experiencing acute stroke.\n       A recent study of Cleveland, OH found that only 1.8 percent \n     of area patients with ischemic stroke received tPA.\n       In a 1995 study of the Reading, Ohio Emergency Medical \n     Services System EMS, almost half of all stroke patients who \n     went through the MES system were dispatched as having \n     something other than stroke and a quarter of all patients \n     identified as having stroke by paramedics were later \n     discovered to have another cause for their illness.\n       Out of 1000 hours of training for paramedics in Cincinnati, \n     only 1 percent is devoted to recognition and management of \n     acute stroke.\n       A 1993 study of patients who had a stroke while they were \n     inpatient found a median delay between stroke recognition and \n     neurological evaluation of 2.5 hours.\n       Neurologists are the attending physicians for only 11 \n     percent of acute stroke patients.\n\n\n              public awareness of stroke symptoms is poor\n\n       In a 1989 survey by the American Heart Association of 500 \n     San Francisco residents, 65 percent of those surveyed were \n     unable to correctly identify any of the early stroke warning \n     signs when given a list of symptoms.\n       In a national survey conducted by the American Heart \n     Association, 29 percent of respondents could not name the \n     brain as the site of a stroke and only 44 percent identified \n     weakness or loss of feeling in an arm or leg as a symptom of \n     stroke.\n       The International Stroke Trial found that only 4 percent of \n     the 19,000 patients studied presented within 3 hours of \n     symptom onset only 16 percent presented within 6 hours.\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\n                               tPA facts\n\n       A seminal NIH study found an 11 to 13 percent increase in \n     the number of tPA-treated patients exhibiting minimal or no \n     neurological deficits or disabilities compared with placebo \n     treated patients.\n       That same study reported a 30 to 55 percent relative \n     improvement in clinical outcome for tPA-treated patients \n     compared with placebo-treated patients.\n\n\n     NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING

American Heart Association,\n\n                                        Dallas, TX, July 20, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: On behalf of the American Heart \n     Association, our American Stroke Association division and our \n     more than 22.5 million volunteers and supporters, thank you \n     for leading the fight against stroke--the nation's third \n     leading cause of death.\n       It has been our privilege to work with you and your staff \n     to draft the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act \n     (STOP Stroke Act). This vital legislation will help raise \n     public awareness about stroke and dramatically improve our \n     nation's stroke care. More specifically, the legislation will \n     conduct a national stroke education campaign; provide \n     critical resources for states to implement statewide stroke \n     care systems; establish a clearinghouse to support \n     communities aiming to improve stroke care; offer medical \n     professional development programs in new stroke therapies; \n     and conduct valuable stroke care research.\n       Stroke touches the lives of almost all Americans. Today, \n     4.5 million Americans are stroke survivors, and as many as 30 \n     percent of them are permanently disabled, requiring extensive \n     and costly care. In Massachusetts alone, stroke kills more \n     than 3,300 people every year. Unfortunately, most Americans \n     know very little about this disease. On average, stroke \n     patients wait 22 hours after the one set of symptoms before \n     receiving medical care. In addition, many health are \n     facilities are not equipped to treat stroke aggressively like \n     other medical emergencies.\n       Your legislation helps build upon our successful stroke \n     programs. In 1998, the American Hearth Association launched a \n     bold initiative--Operation Stroke--to improve stroke care in \n     targeted communities across the country by strengthening the \n     stroke ``Chain of Survival.'' The Chain is a series of events \n     that must occur to improve stroke care and includes rapid \n     public recognition and reaction to stroke warning signs; \n     rapid assessment and pre-hospital care; rapid hospital \n     transport; and rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n       The STOP Stroke Act will help ensure that the stroke Chain \n     of Survival is strong in every community across the nation \n     and that every stroke patient has access to quality care. We \n     strongly support this legislation and look forward to \n     continuing to work with you and Senator Frist to fight this \n     devastating disease. Thank you again for your leadership and \n     vision!\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence B. Sadwin,\n       Chairman of the Board.\n     David P. Faxon, M.D.,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Stroke Association,\n\n                                     Englewood, CO, March 8, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing on behalf of the \n     national Stroke Association (NSA) to express our strong \n     commitment to helping you bring attention to, and secure \n     passage of, the ``Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act \n     of 2001'' (the ``STOP Stroke Act'').\n       NSA is a leading independent, national nonprofit \n     organization which dedicates 100 percent of its resources to \n     stroke including prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, \n     research, advocacy and support for stroke survivors and their \n     families. Our mission is to reduce the incidence and impact \n     of stroke--the number one cause of adult disability and 3rd \n     leading cause of death in America.\n       NSA believes that your proposed legislation is historic--\n     never before has comprehensive legislation been introduced to \n     address this misunderstood public health problem. In fact, \n     stroke has not been given the level of attention, focus or \n     resources commensurate with the terrible toll it takes on \n     Americans in both human and economic terms. We are grateful \n     for your leadership in bringing this issue to the top of the \n     public health agenda.\n       The STOP Stroke Act clearly recognizes an urgent need to \n     build more effective systems of patient care and to increase \n     public awareness about stroke. We are hopeful that the Stroke \n     Prevention and Education Campaign which it authorizes will go \n     a long way toward disseminating the most accurate and timely \n     information regarding stroke prevention and the importance of \n     prompt treatment. NSA is encouraged that the state grant \n     program will facilitate the establishment of a comprehensive \n     network of stroke centers to reduce the overwhelming \n     disparity in personnel, technology, and other resources and \n     target assistance to some of the smaller, less advanced \n     facilities. We also believe that the research program is a \n     necessary component of the STOP Stroke Act in order to assess \n     and monitor barriers to access to stroke prevention, \n     treatment, and rehabilitation services, and to ultimately \n     raise the standard of care for those at risk, suffering or \n     recovering from stroke.\n       Over the past few months NSA has convened leaders in \n     medicine, nursing, rehabilitation, healthcare, business, and \n     advocacy to work with your staff on developing this important \n     legislation. NSA is pleased to have contributed its ideas and \n     expertise on this critical health issue. We look forward to \n     working in partnership with you and your colleagues on \n     getting the legislation passed by Congress.\n       Please count on us to work with you in any way possible to \n     ensure we STOP stroke.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Patti Shwayder,\n     Executive Director/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Association of Neurological Surgeons; Congress \n           of Neurological Surgeons,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Ted Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The American Association of \n     Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological \n     Surgeons (CNS), representing over 4,500 neurosurgeons in the \n     United States, thank you for your leadership and vision in \n     crafting the ``STOP Stroke Act (Stroke Treatment and Ongoing \n     Prevention Act) of 2001.'' We strongly endorse this bill and \n     pledge to work with you to ensure its passage. Your \n     legislation would not only educate the public about the \n     burden of stroke and stroke-related disability, but would \n     encourage states to develop stroke planning systems through \n     the matching grant concept.\n       Stroke is the nation's third leading cause of death and is \n     the leading cause of disability in our country creating a \n     huge human and financial burden associated with this disease. \n     The advances in research and treatment related to stroke over \n     the last decade have been truly remarkable. For example, \n     surgical techniques such as carotid endarterectomy have been \n     proven effective and saved lives. Also, the discovery of \n     therapeutic drugs that can be administered within three hours \n     of the onset of a stroke have allowed many survivors to \n     recover in a way that was impossible to imagine in even \n     recent years.\n       What was once viewed as an untreatable and devastating \n     disease has the potential to become as commonly treatable as \n     heart attacks if appropriate resources are directed to the \n     problem. Senator Kennedy, your legislation will allow all \n     Americans to take advantage of these rapid advances in stroke \n     treatment and prevention.\n       Once again, we strongly endorse this legislation. On behalf \n     of all neurosurgeons and the patients we serve, thank you for \n     your leadership on this issue. Please feel free to contact us \n     should you need further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stewart B. Dunsker, MD,\n       President, American Association of Neurological Surgeons.\n     Issam A. Awad, MD,\n       President, Congress of Neurological Surgeons.\n\n[[Page S8473]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                    National Association of Public\n\n\n                                 Hospitals and Health Systems,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Association of Public Hospitals & Health Systems \n     (NAPH) to express our support for the ``STOP Stroke Act of \n     2001,'' legislation to help states improve the level of \n     stroke care that is offered to patients and to improve public \n     education about the importance of seeking early emergency \n     care to combat the effects of stroke.\n       NAPH represents more than 100 of America's metropolitan \n     area safety net hospitals and health systems. The mission of \n     NAPH members is to provide health care services to all \n     individuals, regardless of insurance status or ability to \n     pay. More than 54 percent of the patients served by NAPH \n     systems are either Medicaid recipients or Medicare \n     beneficiaries; another 28 percent are uninsured.\n       We applaud your efforts to raise public awareness about the \n     signs and symptoms of this pernicious disease and to assure \n     that all Americans--including our nation's poorest and most \n     vulnerable--have access to state-of-the-art stroke treatment. \n     In particular, we are pleased that your legislation would:\n       Establish a grant program to provide funding to states--\n     with a particular focus on raising the level of stroke \n     treatment in underserved areas--to assure that all patients \n     have access to high-quality stroke care;\n       Ensure that all appropriate medical personnel are provided \n     access to training in newly developed approaches for \n     preventing and treating stroke;\n       Authorize a national public awareness campaign to educate \n     Americans about the signs and symptoms of stroke and the \n     importance of seeking emergency treatment as soon as symptoms \n     occur; and,\n       Create a comprehensive research program to identify best \n     practices, barriers to care, health disparities, and to \n     measure the effectiveness of public awareness efforts.\n       NAPH has long supported efforts to assure that all \n     Americans are afforded access to the highest quality health \n     care services and most current technology that is available. \n     Indeed, it is critical that facilities that provide acute \n     care services to stroke patients have the resources necessary \n     to assure patients access to a minimum standard of stroke \n     care. Unfortunately, uncompensated care costs and high rates \n     of uninsured patients often make it difficult for safety net \n     providers to dedicate sufficient resources to meet these \n     goals.\n       We are pleased that your legislation, through its state \n     grants program, attempts to direct additional resources \n     toward the providers that are most in need of updating their \n     stroke care systems. We urge you to consider amending your \n     legislation to allow local government and safety net \n     providers to participate directly in this grants program. \n     Allowing public hospitals and other safety net providers who \n     seek to improve their stroke care infrastructure to apply for \n     these grants will go a long way toward assuring that the \n     providers most in need of these resources get access to them.\n       As the American population ages and promising discoveries \n     are being made to improve the early detection and treatment \n     of stroke, it is becoming increasingly important that \n     additional resources be directed at stroke awareness, \n     prevention and treatment programs. And, as federal funds are \n     provided, it is critical that all of our citizens, in \n     particular those who frequently slip through the cracks, are \n     given access to the best available stroke-related \n     specialists, diagnostic equipment and life-saving treatments \n     and therapies.\n       We thank you for your ongoing leadership in developing \n     legislation to preserve and improve our nation's public \n     health systems and the healthy care safety net. We look \n     forward to working with you further to develop solutions to \n     the problems of our nation's poor and uninsured.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Larry S. Gage,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Partnership for Prevention,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2001.\n     Re Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act of 2001.\n\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: We commend the introduction of the \n     Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act of 2001 (STOP \n     Stroke Act). As you well know, stroke is the third leading \n     cause of death in the United States, a principal cause of \n     cardiovascular disease death, and a major cause of disability \n     for Americans.\n       The STOP Stroke Act creates a framework for the nation to \n     begin systematically addressing some important tertiary \n     stroke prevention issues, namely timely diagnosis and \n     treatment. We concur that much more can and should be done to \n     ensure stroke patients are treated according to clinical \n     guidelines based on up-to-date scientific evidence.\n       Investing in primary and secondary prevention is the best \n     strategy for stopping stroke. Hypertension is the top \n     contributor to stroke, followed by heart disease, diabetes, \n     and cigarette smoking. According to the National Institutes \n     of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), prevention of stroke requires addressing the critical \n     risk factors.\n       To prevent or delay hypertension, experts at both agencies \n     recommend community-based interventions that promote healthy \n     diets, regular physical activity, tobacco cessation, and \n     limited alcohol intake. The Public Health Service's clinical \n     guidelines on treating tobacco use and dependence is another \n     resource to help Americans kick the habit. Lifestyle \n     modifications for hypertension prevention not only contribute \n     to overall cardiovascular health, but also reduce risk \n     factors associated with other chronic diseases (e.g., \n     obesity, diabetes, and cancer).\n       A second essential step is to improve management of \n     hypertension once it develops. Recent studies indicate \n     effective hypertension treatment can cut stroke incidence and \n     fatality rates by at least a third. To advance hypertension \n     treatment, we must invest in disease management systems that \n     enable health care providers to prescribe the most effective \n     therapies and assist patients with pharmacological regimens \n     and healthy lifestyles.\n       The main prevention components in the STOP Stroke Act \n     (i.e., the proposed research program and national stroke \n     awareness campaign) should be coordinated with--and even \n     integrated into--the CDc comprehensive cardiovascular disease \n     program. Involving nearly every state, this program offers an \n     integrated network that is addressing the underlying causes \n     of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases.\n       Partnership welcomes the STOP Stroke Act and its intent to \n     address stroke, a serious health problem. We also encourage \n     strengthened primary and secondary prevention policies to \n     protect health before strokes happen.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Ashley B. Coffield,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Brain Attack Coalition,\n\n                                        Bethesda, MD, May 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The Brain Attack Coalition is a group \n     of professional, voluntary and governmental organizations \n     dedicated to reducing the occurrence, disabilities and death \n     associated with stroke.\n       Stroke is our nations third leading cause of death and the \n     leading cause of adult long-term disability. Recent advances \n     in stroke treatment can lead to improved outcomes if stroke \n     patients are treated shortly after symptom onset. Currently \n     only two to three percent of stroke patients who are \n     candidates for thrombolytic therapy receive it. This must be \n     remedied.\n       We urgently need to educate the public about stroke \n     symptoms and the importance of seeking medical attention \n     immediately. We also need to provide training to medical \n     personnel in the new approaches for treating and preventing \n     stroke. The Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act of \n     2001 (STOP Stroke Act) is designed to address these issues \n     and to establish a grant program to provide funding to states \n     to help ensure that stroke patients in each state have access \n     to high-quality stroke care.\n       The members of the Brain Attack Coalition strongly support \n     the STOP Stroke Act and hope for prompt enactment of this \n     legislation. Please not that the National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention are not included in this endorsement \n     because the Administration has not taken a position on the \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Michael D.

Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express the strong \n     support of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) \n     for the ``Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act of \n     2001,'' which you plan to introduce soon.\n       As you know, stroke is the third leading cause of death in \n     the United States, and is one of the leading causes of adult \n     disability. APTA believes your legislation is critical to \n     establishing a comprehensive system for stroke prevention, \n     treatment and rehabilitation in the United States. We \n     appreciate your modification to the legislation to highlight \n     the important role physical therapists play in stroke \n     prevention and rehabilitation.\n       Every day, physical therapists across the nation help \n     approximately 1 million people alleviate pain, prevent the \n     onset and progression of impairment, functional limitation, \n     disability, or changes in physical function and health status \n     resulting from injury, disease, or other causes. Essential \n     participants in the health care delivery system, physical \n     therapists assume leadership roles in rehabilitation \n     services, prevention and health maintenance programs. They \n     also play important roles in developing health care policy \n     and appropriate standards for the various elements of \n     physical therapists practice to ensure availability, \n     accessibility, and excellence in the delivery of physical \n     therapy services.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this issue. Please \n     call upon APTA to assist in the passage of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ben F. Massey, PT,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n[[Page S8474]]\n\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator Frist and I are introducing \nthe ``Community Access to Emergency Defibrillation Act of 2001.''\n  Every 2 minutes, sudden cardiac arrest strikes down another person. \nCardiac arrest can strike at any time without any warning. Without \nrapid intervention, is unavoidable.\n  One thousand people will die today from cardiac arrest, and 200,000 \npeople will lose their lives this year to this devastating disease. The \ngood news is that we know that 90 percent of cardiac arrest victims can \nbe saved, if immediate access is available to an automated external \ndefibrillator, an AED.\n  We could save thousands of lives every year if AEDs are available in \nevery public building. Yet few communities have programs to make this \ntechnology widely accessible.\n  That is why Senator Frist and I today are introducing the ``Community \nAED Act''. Its goal is to provide funding for programs to increase \naccess to emergency defibrillation. It will place AEDs in public areas \nlike schools, workplaces, community centers, and other locations where \npeople gather. It will provide training to use and maintain the \ndevices, and funding for coordination with emergency medical personnel.\n  Furthermore, it also funds the development of community-based \nprojects to enhance AED access and place them in unique settings where \naccess is more difficult to achieve. Our bill also emphasizes \nmonitoring cardiac arrest in children and putting AEDs in schools--so \nthat we can also deal with cardiac arrest when it affects our youth.\n  Sudden cardiac arrest is a tragedy for families all across America. \nCommunities that have already implemented programs to increase public \naccess to AEDs--like the extremely successful ``First Responder \nDefibrillator Program'' in Boston--have been able to achieve survival \nrates of up to 50 percent. That's 100,000 lives that we can save each \nyear if every community implements a program like this one. This bill \nwill enable communities to save lives in public buildings, in \nworkplaces, and in schools all across the nation, and I urge you to \nstand with Senator Frist and I in support of this legislation--\nlegislation that will have a lifesaving impact on us all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary for the ``Community \nAccess to Emergency Defibrillation Act of 2001'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The Community Access to Emergency Defibrillation Act of 2001\n\n\n                  background and Need for Legislation\n\n       Cardiac arrest is not a heart attack--it is instant heart \n     paralysis for which defibrillation is the only effective \n     treatment. Every minute that passes after a cardiac arrest, a \n     person's chance of surviving decreases by 10 percent. Cardiac \n     arrest takes a tremendous toll on the American public; each \n     year, it kills over 220,000 people.\n       The good news is that 90 percent of cardiac arrest victims \n     who are treated with a defibrillator within one minute of \n     arrest can be saved. In addition, cardiac arrest victims who \n     are treated with CPR within four minutes and defibrillation \n     within ten minutes have up to a 40 percent chance of \n     survival. However, few communities have programs to make \n     emergency defibrillation widely accessible to cardiac arrest \n     victims. Communities that have implemented public access \n     programs have achieved average survival rates for out-of-\n     hospital cardiac arrest as high as 50 percent.\n       Automated external defibrillators, AEDs, have a 95 percent \n     success rate in terminating ventricular fibrillation. Wide \n     use of defibrillators could save as many as 50,000 lives \n     nationally each year, yet fewer than half of the nation's \n     ambulance services, 10-15 percent of emergency service fire \n     units, and less than 1 percent of police vehicles are \n     equipped with AEDs.\n       The Community Access to Emergency Defibrillation, Community \n     AED Act, provides for the following public health initiatives \n     to increase public awareness of emergency defibrillation and \n     to expand public access to lifesaving AEDs:\n     Community Grants Program to establish comprehensive \n         initiatives to increase public access to AEDs\n       The Community AED Act provides $50 million for communities \n     to establish public access defibrillation programs. \n     Communities receiving these grants will: train local \n     emergency medical services personnel to administer immediate \n     care, including CPR and automated external defibrillation, to \n     cardiac arrest victims; purchase and place automated external \n     defibrillators in public places where cardiac arrests are \n     likely to occur; train personnel in places with \n     defibrillators to use them properly and administer CPR to \n     cardiac arrest victims; inform local emergency medical \n     services personnel, including dispatchers, about the location \n     of defibrillators in their community; train members of the \n     public in CPR and automated external defibrillation; ensure \n     proper maintenance and testing of defibrillators in the \n     community; encourage private companies in the community to \n     purchase automated external defibrillators and train \n     employees in CPR and emergency defibrillation; and collect \n     data to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in \n     decreasing the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival \n     rate in the community.\n     Community demonstration projects to develop innovative AED \n         access programs\n       The Community AED Act provides $5 million for community-\n     based demonstration projects. Grantees will develop \n     innovative approaches to maximize community access to \n     automated external defibrillation and provide emergency \n     defibrillation to cardiac arrest victims in unique settings. \n     Communities receiving these grants must meet many of the same \n     requirements for equipment maintenance, public information, \n     and data collection included in the larger grants program.\n     National Clearinghouse to promote AED access in schools\n       The Community AED Act provides for a national information \n     clearinghouse to provide information to increase public \n     awareness and promote access to defibrillators in schools. \n     This center will also establish a database for information on \n     sudden cardiac arrest in youth and will provide assistance to \n     communities wishing to develop screening programs for at risk \n     youth.\n       The Community AED Act is supported by these and other \n     leading health care organizations:\n       American Heart Association; American Red Cross; Agilent \n     Technologies; American College of Emergency Physicians'; \n     Cardiac Science; Citizen CPR Foundation; Congressional Fire \n     Services Institute; Medical Device Manufacturers Association; \n     Medical Research Laboratories, Inc.; Medtronic; MeetingMed: \n     National Center for Early Defibrillation; National Emergency \n     Medical Services Academy; National Fire Protection \n     Association; National SAFE KIDS Compaign; National Volunteer \n     Fire Council; and Survivalink.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1276. A bill to provide for the establishment of a new \ncounterintelligence polygraph program for the Department of Energy, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nmodifies the requirements for polygraphs at facilities operated by the \nDepartment of Energy. I appreciate that Senator Bingaman joins me as a \nco-sponsor.\n  Polygraph requirements were added by Congress in response to concerns \nabout security at the national laboratories. A set of mandates was \nfirst created in the Senate Armed Services Authorization Bill for \nFiscal Year 2000, and they were expanded with broader mandates in \nFiscal Year 2001.\n  Security at the our national security facilities is critically \nimportant, and General Gordon is working diligently as Administrator of \nthe National Nuclear Security Administration to improve security \nthrough many initiatives. But frankly, I fear that Congress has given \nthe General a little too much help in this particular area.\n  The effect of our past legislation was to require polygraphs for very \nbroad categories of workers in DOE and in our DOE weapons labs and \nplants. But the categories specified are really much too broad, some \ndon't even refer to security-related issues. They include many workers \nwho have no relevant knowledge or others who may be authorized to enter \nnuclear facilities but have no unsupervised access to actual material. \nMany of the positions within these categories already require a two-\nperson rule, precluding actions by any one person to compromise \nprotected items.\n  This bill provides flexibility to allow the Secretary of Energy and \nGeneral Gordon to set up a new polygraph program. Through careful \nexamination of the positions with enough sensitivity to warrant \npolygraphs, I fully anticipate that the number of employees subject to \npolygraphs will be dramatically reduced while actually improving \noverall security.\n  My bill seeks to address other concerns. Polygraphs are simply not \nviewed as scientifically credible by Laboratory staff. Those tests have \nbeen the major contributor to substantial degradation in worker morale \nat the labs. This is especially serious when the labs and plants are \nstruggling to cope with the new challenges imposed\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\nby the absence of nuclear testing and with the need to recruit new \nscientific experts to replace an aging workforce.\n  I should note that these staff concerns are not expressed about drug \ntesting, which many already must take. They simply are concerned with \nentrusting their career to a procedure with questionable, in their \nminds, scientific validity.\n  A study is in progress by the National Academy of Sciences that will \ngo a long ways toward addressing this question about scientific \ncredibility of polygraphs when they are used as a tool for screening \nlarge populations. By way of contrast, this use of polygraphs is in \nsharp contrast to their use in a targeted criminal investigation. That \nAcademy's study will be completed in June 2002. Therefore, this bill \nsets up an interim program before the Academy's study is done and \nrequires that a final program be established within 6 months after the \nstudy's completion.\n  This bill addresses several concerns with the way in which polygraphs \nmay be administered by the Department. For example, some employees are \nconcerned that individual privacies, like medical conditions, are not \nbeing protected using the careful procedures developed for drug \ntesting. And facility managers are concerned that polygraphs are \nsometimes administered without enough warning to ensure that work can \ncontinue in a safe manner in the sudden absence of an employee. And of \ngreatest importance, the bill ensures that the results of a polygraph \nwill not be the sole factor determining an employee's fitness for duty.\n  With this bill, we can improve worker morale at our national security \nfacilities by stopping unnecessarily broad application of polygraphs, \nwhile still providing the Secretary and General Gordon with enough \nflexibility to utilize polygraphs where reasonable. In addition, we set \nin motion a process, which will be based on the scientific evaluation \nof the National Academy, to implement an optimized plan to protect our \nnational security.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation \nbeing introduced by Senator Domenici that will help correct what I \nconsider to be overzealous action on the part of the Congress to \naddress security problems at our Department of Energy national \nlaboratories. We're all aware of the security concerns that grew out of \nthe Wen Ho Lee case. That case, and other incidents that have occurred \nsince then, quite rightly prompted the Department of Energy and the \nCongress to assess security problems at the laboratories and seek \nremedies. Last year, during the conference between House and Senate on \nthe Defense Authorization bill, a provision was added, Section 3135, \nthat significantly expanded requirements for administering polygraphs \nto Department of Energy and contractor employees at the laboratories. \nThat legislative action presumed that polygraph testing is an \neffective, reliable tool to reveal spies or otherwise identify security \nrisks to our country.\n  The problem is that the Congress does not have the full story about \npolygraph testing. I objected when Section 3135 was included in the \nconference mark of the Defense bill last year, but it was too late in \nthe process to effectively protest its worthiness. It has since become \nclear that the provision has had a chilling effect on current and \npotential employees at the laboratories in a way that could risk the \nfuture health of the workforce at the laboratories. The laboratory \ndirectors have expressed to me their deep concerns about recruitment \nand retention, and I'm certain that the polygraph issue is a \ncontributing factor. Indeed, I've heard directly from many laboratory \nemployees who question the viability of polygraphs and who have raised \nlegitimate questions about its accuracy, reliability, and usefulness.\n  In response to those questions and concerns, I requested that the \nNational Academy of Sciences undertake an effort to review the \nscientific evidence regarding polygraph testing. Needless to say, there \nare many difficult scientific issues to be examined, so the study will \nrequire considerable effort and time. We are expecting results next \nJune. Once the Congress receives that report, I am hopeful that the \nDepartment of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and \nthe national laboratories will be better able to consider the \nworthiness of polygraph testing to its intended purposes and determine \nwhether and how to proceed with a program.\n  Until that time, however, the Congress has levied a burdensome \nrequirement on the national laboratories to use polygraph testing \nbroadly at the laboratories with the negative consequences to which I \nhave alluded. I believe the legislation that Senator Domenici and I are \nintroducing today will provide a more balanced, reasoned approach in \nthe interim until the scientific experts report to the Congress with \ntheir findings on this very complex matter. The bill being introduced \nwill provide on an interim basis the security protection that many \nbelieve is afforded by polygraphs, but will limit its application to \nthose Department of Energy and contractor employees at the laboratories \nwho have access to Restricted Data or Sensitive Compartmented \nInformation containing the nation's most sensitive nuclear secrets. It \nspecifically excludes employees who may operate in a classified \nenvironment, but who do not have actual access to the critical security \ninformation we are seeking to protect.\n  Other provisions in the bill would protect individual rights by \nextending guaranteed protections included under part 40 of Title 49 of \nthe Code of Federal Regulations and by requiring procedures to preclude \nadverse personnel action related to ``false positives'' or individual \nphysiological reactions that may occur during testing. The bill also \nseeks to ensure the safe operations of DOE facilities by requiring \nadvance notice for polygraph exams to enable management to undertake \nadjustments necessary to maintain operational safety.\n  Let me emphasize once again, that this legislation is intended as an \ninterim measure that will meet three critical objectives until we have \nheard from the scientific community. This bill will ensure that \ncritical secret information will be protected, that the rights of \nindividual employees will be observed, and that the ability of the \nlaboratories to do their job will be maintained. I thank Senator \nDomenici for his work on this bill, and urge my colleagues to support \nits passage. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 1277. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to guarantee \nloans to facilitate nuclear nonproliferation programs and activities of \nthe Government of the Russian Federation, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fissile Material \nLoan Guarantee Act of 2001. This Act is intended to increase the suite \nof programs that reduce proliferation threats from the Russian nuclear \nweapons complex. I'm pleased that Senator Lugar joins me as a co-\nsponsor of this Act.\n  This Act presents an unusual option, which I've discussed with the \nleadership of some of the world's largest private banks and lending \ninstitutions. I also am aware that discussions between Western lending \ninstitutions and the Russian Federation are in progress and that \ndiscussions with the International Atomic Energy Agency or IAEA have \nhelped to clarify their responsibilities.\n  This Act would enable the imposition of international protective \nsafeguards on new, large stocks of Russian weapons-ready materials in a \nway that enables the Russian Federation to gain near-term financial \nresources from the materials. These materials would be used as \ncollateral to secure a loan, for which the U.S. Government would \nprovide a loan guarantee. The Act requires that loan proceeds be used \nin either debt retirement for the Russian Federation or in support of \nRussian non-proliferation or energy programs. It also requires that the \nweapons-grade materials used to collateralize these loans must remain \nunder international IAEA safeguards forevermore and thus should serve \nto remove them from concern as future weapons materials.\n  This Act does not replace programs that currently are in place to \nensure that weapons-grade materials can never be used in weapons in the \nfuture. Specifically, it does not displace materials already committed \nunder earlier\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\nagreements. The Highly Enriched Uranium or HEU Agreement is moving \ntoward elimination of 500 tons of Russian weapons-grade uranium. The \nPlutonium Disposition Agreement is similarly working on elimination of \n34 tons of Russian weapons-grade plutonium, primarily by its use in MOX \nfuel.\n  The HEU agreement removes material usable in 20,000 nuclear weapons, \nwhile the plutonium disposition agreement similarly removes material \nfor more than 4,000 nuclear weapons. Both of these agreements enable \nthe transition of Russian materials into commercial reactor fuel, \nwhich, after use in a reactor, destroys its ``weapons-grade'' \nattributes. There should be no question that both these agreements \nremain of vital importance to both nations.\n  But estimates are that the Russian Federation has vast stocks of \nweapons-grade materials in addition to the amounts they've already \ndeclared as surplus to their weapons needs in these earlier agreements.\n  If we can provide additional incentives to Russia to encourage \ntransition of more of these materials into configurations where it is \nnot available for diversion or re-use in weapons, we've made another \nsignificant step toward global stability. And furthermore, this \nproposed mechanism provides a relatively low cost approach to reduction \nof threats from these materials.\n  Senator Lugar and I introduced a similar bill near the end of the \n106th Congress, to provide time for discussion of its features. Those \ndiscussions have progressed, and this bill has some slight refinements \nthat grew out of those discussions. Since then, we have received \nadditional assurances that this bill provides a useful route to reduce \nproliferation threats, and thus we are reintroducing this bill in the \n107th Congress.\n  Within the last few months, former Senator Howard Baker and former \nWhite House Counsel Lloyd Cutler completed an important report \noutlining the importance of the non-proliferation programs accomplished \njointly with Russia. They noted, as their top recommendation, that:\n\n       The most urgent unmet national security threat to the \n     United States today is the danger that weapons of mass \n     destruction or weapons-usable material in Russia could be \n     stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation states and \n     used against American troops or citizens at home. This threat \n     is a clear and present danger to the international community \n     as well as to American lives and liberties.\n\n  This new Act provides another tool toward reducing these threats to \nnational, as well as global, security.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Breaux, \n        and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1278. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nUnited States independent film and television production wage credit; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S. \nIndependent Film and Television Production Incentive Act of 2001, a \nbill designed to address the problem of ``runaway'' film and television \nproduction. I am joined by Senators Snowe, Durbin, Breaux, and \nLandrieu.\n  Over the past decade, production of American film projects has fled \nour borders for foreign locations, migration that results in a massive \nloss for the U.S. economy. My legislation will encourage producers to \nbring feature film and television production projects to cities and \ntowns across the United States, thereby stemming that loss.\n  In recent years, a number of foreign governments have offered tax and \nother incentives designed to entice production of U.S. motion pictures \nand television programs to their countries. Certain countries, such as \nAustralia, Canada, New Zealand, and several European countries, have \nbeen particularly successful in luring film projects to their towns and \ncities through offers of large tax subsidies.\n  These governments understand that the benefits of hosting such \nproductions do not flow only to the film and television industry. These \nproductions create ripple effects, with revenues and jobs generated in \na variety of other local businesses. Hotels, restaurants, catering \ncompanies, equipment rental facilities, transportation vendors, and \nmany others benefit from these ripple effects.\n  What began as a trickle has become a flood, a significant trend \naffecting both the film and television industry as well as the smaller \nbusinesses that they support.\n  Many specialized trades involved in film production and many of the \nsecondary industries that depend on film production, such as equipment \nrental companies, require consistent demand in order to operate \nprofitably. This production migration has forced many small- and \nmedium-sized companies out of business during the last ten years.\n  Earlier this year, a report by the U.S. Department of Commerce \nestimated that runaway production drains as much as $10 billion per \nyear from the U.S. economy.\n  These losses have been most pronounced in made-for-television movies \nand miniseries productions. According to the report, out of the 308 \nU.S.-developed television movies produced in 1998, 139 were produced \nabroad. That's a significant increase from the 30 produced abroad in \n1990.\n  The report makes a compelling case that runaway film and television \nproduction has eroded important segments of a vital American industry. \nAccording to official labor statistics, more than 270,000 jobs in the \nU.S. are directly involved in film production. By industry estimates, \n70 to 80 percent of these workers are hired at the location where the \nproduction is filmed.\n  And while people may associate the problem of runaway production with \nCalifornia, the problem has seriously affected the economies of cities \nand States across the country, given that film production and \ndistribution have been among the highest growth industries in the last \ndecade. It's an industry with a reach far beyond Hollywood and the west \ncoast.\n  For example, my home State of Arkansas has been proud to host the \nproduction of a number of feature and television films, with benefits \nboth economic and cultural. Our cinematic history includes the opening \nscenes of ``Gone With the Wind,'' and civil war epics like ``the Blue \nand the Gray'' and ``North and South.'' It also includes ``A Soldier's \nStory,'' ``Biloxi Blues,'' ``the Legend of Boggy Creek,'' and, most \nrecently, ``Sling Blade,'' an independent production written by, \ndirected by, and starring Arkansas' own Billy Bob Thornton. So even in \nour rural State, there is a great deal of local interest and support \nfor the film industry. My bill will make it possible for us to continue \nthis tradition, and we hope to encourage more of these projects to come \nto Arkansas.\n  But to do this, we need to level the playing field. This bill will \nassist in that effort. It will provide a two-tiered wage tax credit, \nequal to 25 percent of the first $25,000 of qualified wages and \nsalaries and 35 percent of such costs if incurred in a ``low-income \ncommunity'', for productions of films, television or cable programming, \nmini-series, episodic television, pilots or movies of the week that are \nsubstantially produced in the United States.\n  This credit is targeted to the segment of the market most vulnerable \nto the impact of runaway film and television production. It is, \ntherefore, only available if total wage costs are more than $20,000 and \nless than $10 million (indexed for inflation). The credit is not \navailable to any production subject to reporting requirements of 18 USC \n2257 pertaining to films and certain other media with sexually explicit \nconduct.\n  My legislation enjoys the support of a broad alliance of groups \naffected by the loss of U.S. production, including the following: \nnational, State and local film commissions, under the umbrella \norganization Film US as well as the Entertainment Industry Development \nCorporation; film and television producers, Academy of Television Arts \nand Sciences, the Association of Independent Commercial Producers, the \nAmerican Film Marketing Association, the Producers Guild; organizations \nrepresenting small businesses such as the post-production facilities, \nThe Southern California Chapter of the Association of Imaging \nTechnology and Sound, and equipment rental companies (Production \nEquipment Rental Association); and organizations representing the \ncreative participants in the entertainment industry, Directors Guild of \nAmerica, the Screen Actors Guild and Recording Musicians Association. \nIn addition, the United States Conference\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\nof Mayors formally adopted the ``Runaway Film Production Resolution'' \nat their annual conference in June.\n  Leveling the playing field through targeted tax incentives will keep \nfilm production, and the jobs and revenues it generates, in the United \nStates. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill in \norder to prevent the further deterioration of one of our most American \nof industries and the thousands of jobs and businesses that depend on \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 1279. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe active business definition under section 355; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce tax legislation \nwhich proposes only a small technical modification of current law, but, \nif enacted, would provide significant simplification of routine \ncorporate reorganizations. The legation is identical to S. 773 which I \nintroduced on April 13 of last year.\n  This proposed change is small but very important. It would not alter \nthe substance of current law in any way. It would, however, greatly \nsimplify a common corporate transaction. This small technical change \nwill alone save corporations millions of dollars in unnecessary \nexpenses and economic costs that are incurred when they divide their \nbusinesses.\n  Past Treasury Departments have agreed, and I have no reason to \nbelieve the current Treasury Department will feel any differently, that \nthis change would bring welcome simplification to section 355 of the \nInternal Revenue Code. Indeed, the Clinton Administration in its last \nbudget submission to the Congress had proposed this change. The last \nscoring of this proposal showed no loss of revenue to the U.S. \nGovernment, and I am aware of no opposition to its enactment.\n  Corporations, and affiliated groups of corporations, often find it \nadvantageous, or even necessary, to separate two or more businesses. \nThe division of AT from its local telephone companies is an example \nof such a transaction. The reasons for these corporate divisions are \nmany, but probably chief among them is the ability of management to \nfocus on one core business.\n  At the end of the day, when a corporation divides, the stockholders \nsimply have the stock of two corporations, instead of one. The Tax Code \nrecognizes this is not an event that should trigger tax, as it includes \ncorporate divisions among the tax-free reorganization provisions.\n  One requirement the Tax Code imposes on corporate divisions is very \nawkwardly drafted, however. As a result, an affiliated group of \ncorporations that wishes to divide must often engage in complex and \nburdensome preliminary reorganizations in order to accomplish what, for \na single corporate entity, would be a rather simple and straightforward \nspinoff of a business to its shareholders. The small technical change I \npropose today would eliminate the need for these unnecessary \ntransactions, while keeping the statue true to Congress's original \npurpose.\n  More specifically, section 355, and related provision of the Code, \npermits a corporation or an affiliated group of corporations to divide \non a tax-free basis into two or more separate entities with separate \nbusinesses. There are numerous requirements for tax-free treatment of a \ncorporate division, or ``spinoff,'' including continuity of historical \nshareholder interest, continuity of the business enterprises, business \npurpose, and absence of any device to distribute earning and profits. \nIn addition, section 355 requires that each of the divided corporate \nentities be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. The \nproposed change would alter none of these substantive requirements of \nthe Code.\n  Section 355 (b)(2)(A) currently provides an attribution or ``look \nthrough'' rule for groups of corporations that operate active \nbusinesses under a holding company, which is necessary because a \nholding company, by definition, is not itself engaged in an active \nbusiness.\n  This lookthrough rule inexplicably requires, however, that \n``substantially all'' of the assets of the holding company consist of \nstock of active controlled subsidiaries. The practical effect of this \nlanguage is to prevent holding companies from engaging in spinoffs if \nthey own almost any other assets. This is in sharp contrast to \ncorporations that operate businesses directly, which can own \nsubstantial assets unrelated to the business and still engage in tax-\nfree spinoff transactions.\n  In the real world, of course, holding companies may, for many sound \nbusiness reasons, hold other assets, such as non-controlling, less than \n80 percent, interests in subsidiaries, controlled subsidiaries that \nhave been owned for less than five years, which are not considered \n``active businesses'' under section 355, or a host of non-business \nassets. Such holding companies routinely undertake spinoff \ntransactions, but because of the awkward language used in section 355 \n(b)(2)(A), they must first undertake one or more, often a series of, \npreliminary reorganizations solely for the purpose of complying with \nthis inexplicable language of the Code.\n  Such preliminary reorganizations are at best costly, burdensome, and \nwithout any business purpose, and at worst, they seriously interfere \nwith business operations. In a few cases, they may be so costly as to \nbe prohibitive, and cause the company to abandon an otherwise sound \nbusiness transaction that is clearly in the best interest of the \ncorporation and the businesses it operates.\n  There is no tax policy reasons, tax advisors agree, to require the \nreorganization of a consolidated group that is clearly engaged in the \nactive conduct of a trade or business, as a condition to a spinoff. Nor \nis there any reason to treat affiliated groups differently than single \noperating companies. Indeed, no one had ever suggested one. The \nlegislative history indicates Congress was concerned about non-\ncontrolled subsidiaries, which is elsewhere adequately addressed, no \nconsolidated groups.\n  For many purposes, the Tax Code treats affiliated groups as a single \ncorporation. Therefore, the simple remedy I am proposing today for the \nproblem created by the awkward language of section 355 (b)(2)(A) is to \napply the active business test to an affiliated group as if it were a \nsingle entity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \ncarry out construction projects for the purpose of improving, \nrenovating, and updating patient care facilities at Department of \nVeterans Affairs medical centers; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President. I am very proud to be a Vietnam veteran \nand to have served as director of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nVA, from 1977 to 1980. The VA has continued to provide high quality \nhealth care to our Nation's veterans and is a health care system leader \non patient safety tracking, long-term care, Post-Traumatic Stress \ndisorder treatment and dozens of other innovative health care programs. \nThe VA Health Care System has also enhanced its access to veterans with \nthe development of approximately 600 community-based outpatient \nclinics, CBOC's, across the Nation.\n  But as I visit the VA medical centers in Georgia and across the \nNation, I am very alarmed to see patient care areas which look as if \nthey have not been renovated or upgraded in decades. These VA medical \ncenters serve as the hub for all major health care activities and can \nnot be compromised without affecting veterans' care. The president's \nannual budget for the VA has not requested crucial funding for major \nmedical facility construction. The VA is currently reevaluating their \npresent VA facility infrastructure needs through a process known as \nCARES or the ``Capital Assets Realignment for Enhanced Services.'' \nVeteran health care and safety may pay the price as this process may \ntake years to complete. With the increasing numbers of female veterans, \nmany inpatient rooms and bathrooms continue to be inadequate to provide \nneeded space and privacy. Many VA facilities, like the VA Spinal Cord \nInjury Center in Augusta, Georgia, which serves veterans from Alabama, \nGeorgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee have long waits \nfor care. At least 25 VA construction projects across the Nation would \nbe appropriate for consideration. A Price Waterhouse report recommended \nthat VA spend from 2 to 4 percent of its plant replacement value, PRV, \non upkeep and replacement of current medical centers. Based on a PRV of \n$35 billion, for fiscal year 2001, VA would need approximately $170 \nmillion to meet these basic safety and upkeep needs. The VA health care \nsystem is the largest health care provider in the nation, yet we are \nnot maintaining these essential medical centers. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Veterans Hospitals Emergency Repair Act and to provide \nthe crucial assistance needed now for our veterans. This proposal would \ngive the VA Secretary limited authority to complete identified medical \nfacility projects thus helping to preserve the VA health care system \nuntil the CARES process can be completed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1280\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Hospital Emergency \n     Repair Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECTS FOR \n                   PATIENT CARE IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is \n     authorized to carry out major medical facility projects in \n     accordance with this section, using funds appropriated for \n     fiscal year 2002 or fiscal year 2003 pursuant to section 3. \n     The cost of any such project may not exceed $25,000,000.\n       (2) Projects carried out under this section are not subject \n     to section 8104(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code.\n       (b) Purpose of Projects.--A project carried out pursuant to \n     subsection (a) may be carried out only at a Department of \n     Veterans Affairs medical center and only for the purpose of \n     improving, renovating, and updating to contemporary standards \n     patient care facilities. In selecting medical centers for \n     projects under subsection (a), the Secretary shall select \n     projects to improve, renovate, or update facilities to \n     achieve one or more of the following:\n       (1) Seismic protection improvements related to patient \n     safety.\n       (2) Fire safety improvements.\n       (3) Improvements to utility systems and ancillary patient \n     care facilities.\n       (4) Improved accommodation for persons with disabilities, \n     including barrier-free access.\n       (5) Improvements to facilities carrying out specialized \n     programs of the Department, including the following:\n       (A) Blind rehabilitation centers.\n       (B) Facilities carrying out inpatient and residential \n     programs for seriously mentally ill veterans, including \n     mental illness research, education, and clinical centers.\n       (C) Facilities carrying out residential and rehabilitation \n     programs for veterans with substance-use disorders.\n       (D) Facilities carrying out physical medicine and \n     rehabilitation activities.\n       (E) Facilities providing long-term care, including \n     geriatric research, education, and clinical centers, adult \n     day care centers, and nursing home care facilities.\n       (F) Facilities providing amputation care, including \n     facilities for prosthetics, orthotics programs, and sensory \n     aids.\n       (G) Spinal cord injury centers.\n       (H) Facilities carrying out traumatic brain injury \n     programs.\n       (I) Facilities carrying out women veterans' health programs \n     (including particularly programs involving privacy and \n     accommodation for female patients).\n       (J) Facilities for hospice and palliative care programs.\n       (c) Review Process.--(1) Before a project is submitted to \n     the Secretary with a recommendation that it be approved as a \n     project to be carried out under the authority of this \n     section, the project shall be reviewed by an independent \n     board within the Department of Veterans Affairs constituted \n     by the Secretary to evaluate capital investment projects. The \n     board shall review each such project to determine the \n     project's relevance to the medical care mission of the \n     Department and whether the project improves, renovates, and \n     updates patient care facilities of the Department in \n     accordance with this section.\n       (2) In selecting projects to be carried out under the \n     authority of this section, the Secretary shall consider the \n     recommendations of the board under paragraph (1). In any case \n     in which the Secretary selects a project to be carried out \n     under this section that was not recommended for approval by \n     the board under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include in \n     the report of the Secretary under section 4(b) notice of such \n     selection and the Secretary's reasons for not following the \n     recommendation of the board with respect to the project.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income of individual taxpayers discharges of indebtedness \nattributable to certain forgiven residential mortgages obligations; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mortgage \nCancellation Act of 2001. This bill would fix\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\na flaw in the tax code that unfairly harms homeowners who sell their \nhome at a loss.\n  Today, our Nation has achieved an amazing 67.5 percent rate of \nhomeownership, the highest rate in our history. It is notable that in \nrecent years, the largest category of first-time homebuyers has been \ncomprised of immigrants and minorities. This is a great success story. \nHomeownership is still the most important form of wealth accumulation \nin our society.\n  From time to time, however, the value of housing in a whole market \ngoes down through no fault of the homeowner. A plant closes, \nenvironmental degradations are found nearby, a regional economic slump \nhits hard. This happened during the 1980s in the oil patch and in \nSouthern California and New England at the beginning of the 1990s. A \ngeneral housing market downturn can be devastating to what is very \noften a family's largest asset. Unfortunately, a loss in value to the \nfamily home may not be the worst of it. Sometimes when people must sell \ntheir homes during a downturn, they get a nasty surprise from the tax \nlaw.\n  For example, suppose Keith and Mary Turner purchased a home for \n$120,000 with a five percent down payment and a mortgage of $114,000. \nFour years later, the local housing market experiences a downturn. \nWhile the market is down, the Turners must sell the home because Keith \nwas laid off and has accepted a job in another city. The house sells \nfor $105,000. However, the Turners still owe $112,000 on their \nmortgage. They are $7,000 short on what they owe on the mortgage, but \nhave no equity and received no cash.\n  Often, homeowners who must sell their home at a loss are able to \nnegotiate with their mortgage holder to forgive all or part of the \nmortgage balance that exceeds the selling price. However, under current \ntax law, the amount forgiven is taxable income to the seller, taxed at \nordinary rates.\n  In the case of the Turner family, the mortgage holder agreed to \nforgive the $7,000 excess of the mortgage balance over the sales price. \nHowever, under current law, this means the Turners will have to \nrecognize this $7,000 as taxable income at a time when they can least \nafford it. This is true even though the family suffered a $15,000 loss \non the sale of the home.\n  I find this predicament both ironic and unfair. If this same family, \nunder better circumstances, had been able to sell their house for \n$150,000 instead of $105,000, then they would owe nothing in tax on the \ngain under current tax law because gains on a principal residence are \ntax-exempt up to $500,000. I believe that this discrepancy creates a \ntax inequity that begs for relief.\n  It is simply unfair to tax people right at the time they have had a \nserious loss and have no cash with which to pay the tax. The bill I \nintroduce today, the Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act, will relieve \nthis unfair tax burden so that in the case where the lender forgives \npart of the mortgage, there will be no taxable event.\n  Who are the people that are most vulnerable to this mortgage \nforgiveness tax dilemma? Unfortunately, people who have a very small \namount of equity in their homes are most likely to experience this \nproblem. Today, about 4.6 million households have low equity in their \nhomes. Of those, about 2 million have no equity in their homes, which \nis defined as less than 10 percent of the value of the home. In a \nhousing value downturn, these people would be wiped out first if they \nhad to sell.\n  Sixty-seven percent of these low-equity owners are first-time \nhomebuyers, and 26 percent of them have less than $30,000 of annual \nfamily income. The median value of their homes is $70,000, while the \nmedian value of all homes nationally is $108,000. More than half of \nthese low equity owners live in the South or in the West.\n  I want to emphasize that now is the time to correct this inequity. \nToday, the National Association of Realtors reports that there are no \nmarkets that are in the woeful condition of having homes lose value. \nStill, in our slowing economy, families are vulnerable. Because today's \nreal estate market is strong, now is the optimal time to correct this \nfundamental unfairness. The bill applies only to the circumstance in \nwhich a lender actually forgives some portion of a mortgage debt and is \nnot intended to be an insurance policy against economic loss. My bill \nprovides safeguards against abuse and will help families at a time when \nthey are most in need of relief.\n  The estimated revenue effect of this bill is not large. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation last year estimated that this correction would \nresult in a loss to the Treasury of only about $27 million over five \nyears and $64 million over ten years.

A bill to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to introduce the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  Civil rights is the unfinished business of the Nation. The Civil \nRights Act of 1964 has long prohibited job discrimination based on \nrace, ethnic background, gender, or religion. It is long past time to \nprohibit such discrimination based on sexual orientation, and that is \nwhat the Employment Non-Discrimination Act will do.\n  Its provisions are straight-forward and limited. It prohibits \nemployers from discriminating against individuals because of their \nsexual orientation when making decisions about hiring, firing, \npromotion and compensation. It does not require employers to provide \ndomestic partnership benefits, and it does not apply to the armed \nforces or to religious organizations. It also prohibits the use of \nquotas and preferential treatment.\n  Too many hard-working Americans are being judged today on their \nsexual orientation, rather than their ability and qualifications. For \nexample, after working at Red Lobster for several years and receiving \nexcellent reviews, Kendall Hamilton applied for a promotion at the \nurging of the general manager who knew he was gay. The application was \nrejected after a co-worker disclosed Kendall's sexual orientation to \nthe management team, and the promotion went instead to an employee of \nnine months whom Kendall had trained. Kendall was told that his sexual \norientation ``was not compatible with Red Lobster's belief in family \nvalues,'' and that being gay had destroyed his chances of becoming a \nmanager. Feeling he had no choice, Kendall left the company.\n  Fireman Steve Morrison suffered similar discrimination. His co-\nworkers saw him on the local news protesting an anti-gay initiative, \nand incorrectly assumed he was gay. He soon lost workplace \nresponsibilities and was the victim of harassment, including hate mail. \nAfter lengthy administrative proceedings, he was finally able to have \nthe false charges removed from his record, but he was transferred to \nanother station.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans oppose this kind of flagrant \ndiscrimination. Businesses of all sizes, labor unions, and a broad \nreligious coalition all strongly support the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act. America will not achieve its promise of true \njustice and equal opportunity for all until we end all forms of \ndiscrimination.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senators \nKennedy, Specter, Jeffords and many other colleagues as an original \ncosponsor of this important legislation, the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act of 2001. By guaranteeing that American workers \ncannot lose their jobs simply because of their sexual orientation, this \nbill would extend the bedrock American values of fairness and equality \nto a group of our fellow citizens who too often have been denied the \nbenefit of those most basic values.\n  Two hundred and twenty-five years ago this month, Thomas Jefferson \nlaid out a vision of America as dedicated to the simple idea that all \nof us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with the inalienable \nrights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. As Jefferson \nknew, our society did not in his time live up to that ideal, but since \nhis time, we have been trying to. In succeeding generations, we have \nworked ever harder to ensure that our society removes unjustified \nbarriers to individual achievement and that we judge each other solely \non our merits and not on characteristics that are irrelevant to the \ntask at hand. We are still far from perfect, but we have made much \nprogress, especially over the past few decades, guaranteeing equality \nand fairness to an increasing number of groups that traditionally have \nnot had the benefits of those values and of those protections. To \nAfrican- Americans, to women, to disabled Americans, to religious \nminorities and to others we have extended a legally enforceable \nguarantee that, with respect to their ability to earn a living at \nleast, they will be treated on their merits and not on characteristics \nunrelated to their ability to do their jobs.\n  It is time to extend that guarantee to gay men and lesbians, who too \noften have been denied the most basic of rights: the right to obtain \nand maintain a job. A collection of one national survey and twenty city \nand State surveys found that as many as 44 percent of gay, lesbian and \nbisexual workers faced job discrimination in the workplace at some time \nin their careers. Other studies have reported even greater \ndiscrimination, as much as 68 percent of gay men and lesbians reporting \nemployment discrimination. The fear in which these workers live was \nclear from a survey of gay men and lesbians in Philadelphia. Over \nthree-quarters told those conducting the survey that they sometimes or \nalways hide their orientation at work out of fear of discrimination.\n  The toll this discrimination takes extends far beyond its effect on \nthe individuals who live without full employment opportunities. It also \ntakes an unacceptable toll on America's definition of itself as a land \nof equality and opportunity, as a place where we judge each other on \nour merits, and as a country that teaches its children that anyone can \nsucceed here as long as they are willing to do their job and work hard.\n  This bill provides for equality and fairness, that and no more. It \nsays only what we already have said for women, for people of color and \nfor others: that you are entitled to have your ability to earn a living \ndepend only on your ability to do the job and nothing else.\n  This bill would bring our Nation one large step closer to realizing \nthe vision that Thomas Jefferson so eloquently expressed 225 years ago \nwhen he wrote that all of us have a right to life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to give my support \nfor the Employment Non Discrimination Act of 2001 or ENDA. I believe \nthat every American should have the opportunity to work and should not \nbe denied that opportunity for jobs they are qualified to fill. In both \nmy private and public life I have hired without regard to sexual \norientation and have found both areas to be enriched by this decision.\n  ENDA would provide basic protection against job discrimination based \non sexual orientation. Civil Rights progress over the years has slowly \nextended protection against discrimination in the workplace based on \nrace, gender, national origin, age, religion and disability. It is time \nnow to extend these protections to cover sexual orientation, the next \nlogical step to achieve equality of opportunity in the workplace.\n  As a Republican, I do not believe that this discrimination in the \nworkplace can be categorized as a conservative/liberal issue. Barry \nGoldwater once wrote:\n\n       I am proud that the Republican Party has always stood for \n     individual rights and liberties. The positive role of limited \n     government has always been the defense of these fundamental \n     principles. Our Party has led the way in the fight for \n     freedom and a free market economy, a society where \n     competition and the Constitution matter, and sexual \n     orientation should not . . .\n\n  Indeed my Republican predecessor in this seat, Mark Hatfield was also \na strong supporter of ENDA and viewed discrimination as a serious \nsocietal injustice, in both human and economic terms:\n\n       As this Nation turns the corner toward the 21st century, \n     the global nature of our economy is becoming more and more \n     apparent. If\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\n     we are to compete in this marketplace, we must break down the \n     barriers to hiring the most qualified and talented person for \n     the job. Prejudice is such a barrier. It is intolerable and \n     irrational for it to color decisions in the workplace.\n\n  I believe that ENDA is a well thought-out approach to rectifying \ndiscrimination in the workplace. ENDA contains broad exemptions for \nreligious organizations, the military and small businesses. It \nspecifically rules out preferential treatment or ``quotas'' and does \nnot affect our nation's armed services. I am confident that this bill \nwill pass this Senate by a bipartisan majority.\n  ENDA is a simple, narrowly-crafted solution to a significant omission \nin our civil rights law. I strongly believe that no one should be \ndenied employment on the basis of sexual orientation or any other \nfactor not related to ability to do a particular job. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to pass ENDA and strengthen fundamental \nfairness in our society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 1285. A bill to provide the President with flexibility to set \nstrategic nuclear delivery system levels to meet United States national \nsecurity goals; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nStrategic Arms Flexibility Act of 2001, that would restore the \nPresident's authority to manage the size of our Nation's nuclear \nstockpile by repealing an obsolete law that now prevents him from \nreducing the number of nuclear weapons. The Strategic Arms Flexibility \nAct of 2001 would reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident or \nterrorist incident, reduce tensions throughout the world, and save \nsubstantial taxpayer dollars.\n  We have far more nuclear weapons than would ever be necessary to win \na war. Based on START counting rules, we have 7,300 strategic nuclear \nweapons. Yet, as Secretary of State Colin Powell has said, we could \neliminate more than half of these weapons and still, ``have the \ncapability to deter any actor.'' Furthermore, the U.S. nuclear arsenal \nis equipped with sophisticated guidance and information systems that \nmake our nuclear weapons much more accurate and effective than those of \nour adversaries. This is one reason why we should not be overly \ninfluenced by calls for maintaining strict numerical parity.\n  While the huge number of nuclear arms in our arsenal is not necessary \nto fight a war, maintaining these weapons actually presents significant \nrisks to national security.\n  First, it increases the risk of a catastrophic accident. The more \nweapons that exist, the greater chance that a sensor failure or other \nmechanical problem, or an error in judgment, will lead to the \ndetonation of a nuclear weapon. In fact, there have been many times \nwhen inaccurate sensor readings or other technical problems have forced \nnational leaders to decide within minutes whether to launch nuclear \nweapons. In one incident, a Russian commander deviated from standard \nprocedures by refusing to launch, even though an early detection system \nwas reporting an incoming nuclear attack, a report that was inaccurate.\n  The second reason why maintaining excessive numbers of nuclear \nweapons poses national security risks is that it encourages other \nnations to maintain large stockpiles, as well. The more weapons held by \nother countries, the greater the risk that a rogue faction in one such \ncountry could gain access to nuclear weapons and either threaten to use \nthem, actually use them, or transfer them to others. Such a faction \ncould obtain weapons through force. For example, there are many poorly \nguarded intercontinental ballistic missiles that are easy targets for \nterrorists. Senator Bob Kerrey, who introduced this legislation in the \nlast Congress, speculated that a relatively small, well-trained group \ncould overtake the few personnel who guard some of the smaller \ninstallations in Russia.\n  Alternatively, a hostile group might be able simply to purchase \nballistic missiles on the black market. This risk may be especially \nrelevant in Russia, where many military personnel are poorly paid and a \nfew may feel financial pressure to collaborate with those hostile to \nthe United States. In addition, some have speculated that the high cost \nof maintaining a large nuclear stockpile could encourage some nuclear \npowers themselves to sell weapon technologies as a mean of financing \ntheir nuclear infrastructure.\n  By reducing our own stockpile, we can encourage Russia to reduce its \nstockpile and discourage other nuclear states from expanding theirs. In \nparticular, Russia is faced with the exorbitant annual cost of \nmaintaining thousands of unnecessary ICBMs. The present state of \nRussia's economy leaves it ill-equipped to handle these costs, a fact \nreadily admitted by Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev. Russia has \nexpressed an interest in reducing its stockpile dramatically, from \nabout 6,000 weapons to fewer than 1,000. However, Russia is unlikely to \nmake such reductions without a commensurate reduction by the United \nStates. If the United States takes the first step, it would provide \nRussia with a face-saving way to do the same, without waiting for START \nII, which now appears unlikely to be ratified in the short term.\n  Beyond the benefits to national security of reducing our nuclear \nstockpile, such a reduction also would save taxpayers significant \namounts of money. According to the Center for Defense Information, in \nFY 01, the United States spent $26.7 billion on operations, \nmaintenance, and development related the United States' nuclear \nprogram. Of that $26.7 billion, $12.4 billion, just under half, goes to \nbuild, maintain, and operate our arsenal of tactical and strategic \nnuclear weapons. Although a precise cost estimate is not available, it \nseems clear that reducing the stockpile of nuclear weapons would \nprovide major cost savings.\n  While a reduction in the nuclear stockpile would improve national \nsecurity and reduce costs, the 1998 defense authorization act now \nprevents the President from reducing such weapons until the Russian \nDuma approves the START II treaty. The Bush Administration has made it \nclear that it wants this law repealed, and would like the authority to \nunilaterally reduce the nuclear stockpile. In hearings before various \nSenate Committees, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy \nSecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, have expressed the \nAdministration's desire to retire immediately 50 unnecessary MX \npeacekeeper missiles with some 500 warheads. The Administration is \nstill conducting a more comprehensive review and may well propose \nadditional reductions. However, as Secretary Wolfowitz has testified, \n``we will need the support of the Congress to remove the current \nrestrictions that prohibit us from getting rid of a nuclear system that \nwe no longer need.''\n  Some might question whether it is appropriate to reduce the United \nStates stockpile without a direct assurance that other nations would \nreduce theirs by the same amount. However, this is flawed Cold War \nthinking. As Secretary Powell has stated, we have far more weapons than \nnecessary to devastate any opponent, real or imagined, many times over. \nClearly, we can reduce our stockpile without in any way reducing our \nnuclear deterrent, or our national security.\n  Having said this, reducing the stockpile is not enough. We also need \nto encourage and assist others in doing so. In particular, it is \nimportant that we help Russia by providing aid for dismantling weapons \nand by offering other economic assistance. We also need to continue to \nnegotiate arms reductions and non-proliferation agreements with other \ncountries, including, but not limited to Russia. Unilateral action can \nprovide many benefits, but we need multilateral agreements to more \nfully reduce the nuclear threat, and prevent the spread of nuclear \ntechnology. Ultimately, the nuclear threat is a threat to all of \nhumanity, and all nations need to be part of a coordinated effort to \nreduce that threat.\n\n  In recent months, we have renewed a long-standing debate about \nwhether to deploy a national missile defense. Proponents of such a \nsystem argue that it would reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons \nby giving us the capacity to deflect incoming nuclear weapons. However, \nmany have raised serious concerns about this approach, and the risk \nthat it actually could reduce our national security by creating a new \narms race and heightening international tensions.\n  The bill I am introducing today offers a proven way to reduce the \nnuclear\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\nthreat that can be accomplished quickly and without the controversy \nassociated with a national missile defense system.\n  There are few issues more important than reducing the risks posed by \nnuclear weapons. For the past half century, the world has lived with \nthese weapons, and it is easy to underestimate the huge threat they \nrepresent. Yet it is critical that we remain vigilant and do everything \nin our power to reduce that threat. The fate of the world, quite \nliterally, is at stake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this simple but powerful measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8482-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 142--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n  UNITED STATES SHOULD BE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE UNITED NATIONS \n   WORLD CONFERENCE ON RACISM, RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, XENOPHOBIA AND \n                          RELATED INTOLERANCE\n\n  Mr. DODD submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 142\n\n       Whereas racial discrimination, ethnic conflict, and \n     xenophobia persist in various parts of the world despite \n     continuing efforts by the international community;\n       Whereas in recent years the world has witnessed campaigns \n     of ethnic cleansing;\n       Whereas racial minorities, migrants, asylum seekers, and \n     indigenous peoples are persistent targets of intolerance and \n     violence;\n       Whereas millions of human beings continue to encounter \n     discrimination solely due to their race, skin color, or \n     ethnicity;\n       Whereas early action is required to prevent the growth of \n     ethnic hatred and to diffuse potential violent conflicts;\n       Whereas the problems associated with racism will be \n     thoroughly explored at the United Nations World Conference \n     against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related \n     Intolerance, to be held in Durban, South Africa from August \n     31 to September 7, 2001;\n       Whereas this conference will review progress made in the \n     fight against racism and consider ways to better ensure the \n     application of existing standards to combat racism;\n       Whereas the conference will increase the level of awareness \n     about the scourge of racism and formulate concrete \n     recommendations on ways to increase the effectiveness of the \n     United Nations in dealing with racial issues;\n       Whereas the conference will review the political, \n     historical, economic, social, cultural, and other factors \n     leading to racism and racial discrimination and formulate \n     concrete recommendations to further action-oriented national, \n     regional, and international measures to combat racism;\n       Whereas the conference will draw up concrete \n     recommendations to ensure that the United Nations has the \n     resources to actively combat racism and racial \n     discrimination; and\n       Whereas the United States is a member of the United \n     Nations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should attend and participate fully \n     in the United Nations World Conference on Racism, Racial \n     Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance;\n       (2) the delegation sent to the conference by the United \n     States should reflect the racial and geographic diversity of \n     the United States; and\n       (3) the President should support the conference and should \n     act in such a way as to facilitate substantial United States \n     involvement in the conference.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the possibility that \nthe United States will not send a full delegation to the United Nations \nWorld Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and \nRelated Intolerance. I believe this is both a worthwhile and important \nendeavor, and I am greatly troubled by the prospect that the United \nStates may not attend.\n  According to a Washington Post article last week, the Bush \nAdministration's reservations about attending the conference stem from \nconcerns regarding certain proposed items on the agenda. The \nAdministration's concerns are legitimate ones, but it is my belief that \nthe Conference organizers are so anxious to have high level U.S. \nparticipation in Durban that contentious issues can be resolved prior \nto the August event, provided the United States signals its genuine \ninterest in participating. Clearly the overarching objectives of the \nconference are of great importance to the American people and to \npeoples throughout the planet. As members of the global community, and \nas a global leader and vocal advocate for human rights, it would be \ntragic if the United States could not find a way to support the \nconference's honorable ambitions.\n  I do not need to list for my colleagues all the many injustices that \noccur each day, worldwide, that can be attributed to racism and \nignorance, racism's frequent collaborator. As we all know, despite the \nbest efforts of the international community, the effects of racial \ndiscrimination, ethnic conflict, and xenophobia continue to threaten \nand victimize people the world over. We have seen the violent \ndevastations of racism in the former Yugoslavia, in Indonesia, and \nsadly, at home in America as well. The hateful term ``ethnic \ncleansing'' is now all too often used to describe violent international \nconflicts, and, increasingly, international humanitarian relief efforts \nfocus on the tides of refugees fleeing persecution based on skin color, \nreligion, and ethnic heritage. The task that lays before all nations \ntherefore, is to peer deeply into the corners of our societies that we \nfind most distasteful and hurtful, and to shine some light honestly \nonto the devastation that racism has inflicted.\n  In my view, the United Nations World Conference on Racism is the \nplace to begin this difficult, but crucial process of racial \nintrospection. It is not enough for the United States to pay lip \nservice to the ideals of racial equality. We should attend this \nconference, and lend our full support to this worthy cause. I believe \nthat in the conference we have a unique opportunity to work with other \nnations, our neighbors and partners, to begin the process of addressing \nthe many crimes caused by racism, and the underlying societal causes of \nracism itself. This conference has the power to raise awareness about \nthese issues, to form international consensus on best to combat racism, \nand to educate the international community on the ravages of racially \nmotivated persecution and conflict.\n  It is my hope, that the Bush Administration will conclude that our \npresence at the United Nations Conference on Racism, Racial \nDiscrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance is vital and \nappropriate, and will work to ensure that problems related to U.S. \nparticipation are resolved before the conference convenes next month. I \nwould also hope that the President would designate Secretary of State \nColin Powell to lead a racially and geographically diverse delegation \nfrom the United States to the conference in South Africa. Toward that \nend, I am submitting a resolution which urges the active participation \nof the United States in the conference, and it is my hope that my \ncolleagues will support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8482-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8482-S8484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 143--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON VETERANS' CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE \nCOUNTRY AND THE DESIGNATION OF THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 11 THROUGH NOVEMBER \n           17, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL VETERANS AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Graham, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nSantorum, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Dorgan, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Miller, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Byrd, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Rockefeller, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Warner, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Domenici, Mr. Voinovich, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Chafee, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Thurmond, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Carper, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Smith of New \nHampshire, and Mr. Bond) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I have the honor of joining with 51 \nof my colleagues in submitting a resolution expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the week that includes Veterans' Day this year be \ndesignated as ``National Veterans Awareness Week.'' The purpose of \nNational Veterans Awareness Week is to serve as a focus for educational \nprograms designed to make students in elementary and secondary schools \naware of the contributions of veterans and their importance in \npreserving American peace and prosperity.\n  Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action \nhas become necessary because we are victims of our own success with \nregard to the superior performance of our armed forces. The plain fact \nis that there are just fewer people around now who have had any \nconnection with military service. For example, as a result of \ntremendous advances in military technology and the resultant \nproductivity increases, our current armed forces now operate \neffectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than \njust 10 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer \ncareer-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in \ntoday's military than in previous eras when conscription was in place. \nFinally, the number of veterans who served during previous conflicts, \nsuch as World War II, when our military was many times larger than \ntoday, is inevitably declining.\n  The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire \npopulation that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a \nchange that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during \nWorld War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that \ndid not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous \nfamilies that include no military veterans at all. As a consequence of \nthis lack of opportunity for contacts with veterans, many of our young \npeople have little or no connection with or knowledge about the \nimportant historical and ongoing role of men and women who have served \nin the military. This omission seems to have persisted despite ongoing \neducational efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the \nveterans service organizations.\n  This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in \nour society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, \ncivilian control of the armed forces is the key tenet of military \ngovernance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and \nlimitations of the armed forces, and to its critical role throughout \nour history, can make decisions that have unexpected and unwanted \nconsequences. Even more important, general recognition of the \nimportance of those individual character traits that are essential for \nmilitary success, such as patriotism, selflessness, sacrifice, and \nheroism, is vital to maintaining these key aspects of citizenship in \nthe armed forces and even throughout the population at large.\n  Among today's young people, a generation that has grown up largely \nduring times of peace and extraordinary prosperity and has embraced a \n``me first'' attitude, it is perhaps even more important to make sure \nthat there is solid understanding of what it has taken to attain this \nlevel of comfort and freedom. The failure of our children to understand \nwhy a military is important, why our society continues to depend on it \nfor ultimate survival, and why a successful military requires integrity \nand sacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters \nbecome of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility \nthat is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it \nhas been in the past, knowledge of the contributions of those who have \nserved in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the \nextent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our \ncountry in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our \nresponsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations we owe, both \ntangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on \nour behalf.\n  The importance of this issue was brought home to me last year by \nSamuel I. Cashdollar, who was then a 13-year-old seventh grader at \nLewes Middle School in Lewes, Delaware. Samuel won the Delaware VFW's \nYouth Essay Contest that year with a powerful presentation titled ``How \nShould We Honor America's Veterans''? Samuel's essay pointed out that \nwe have Nurses' Week, Secretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly \nemphasize the importance of these occupations, but the contributions of \nthose in uniform tend to be overlooked. We don't want our children \ngrowing up to think that Veterans Day has simply become a synonym for \ndepartment store sale, and we don't want to become a Nation where more \nhigh school seniors recognize the name Britney Spears than the name \nDwight Eisenhower.\n  Now, it is appropriate to ask, ``We already have Veterans Day, why do \nwe need National Veterans Awareness Week?''. Historically, Veterans Day \nwas established to honor those who served in uniform during wartime. \nAlthough we now customarily honor all veterans on Veterans Day, I see \nit as a holiday that is focused on honoring individuals, the courageous \nand selfless men and women without whose actions our country would not \nexist as it does. National Veterans Awareness Week would complement \nVeterans Day by focusing on education as well as commemoration, on the \ncontributions of the many in addition to the heroism and service of the \nindividual. National Veterans Awareness Week would also present an \nopportunity to remind ourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of \nthose who have served in peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups \nwork unending hours and spend long periods away from their families \nunder conditions of great discomfort so that we all can live in a land \nof freedom and plenty.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate adopted my amendment to the education \nbill calling on the Department of Education to assist in the \ndevelopment of educational programs to enlighten our country's students \nabout the contributions of veterans. Last year, my Resolution \ndesignating National Veterans Awareness Week had 60 cosponsors and was \napproved in the Senate by unanimous consent. I ask my colleagues to \ncontinue this trend of support for our veterans by endorsing this \nresolution again this year. Our children and our childrens' children \nwill need to be well informed about what veterans have accomplished in \norder to make appropriate decisions as they confront the numerous \nworldwide challenges that they are sure to face in the future.\n\n[[Page S8484]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8482-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8482-S8484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 143--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON VETERANS' CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE \nCOUNTRY AND THE DESIGNATION OF THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 11 THROUGH NOVEMBER \n           17, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL VETERANS AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Graham, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nSantorum, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Dorgan, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Miller, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Byrd, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Rockefeller, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Warner, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Domenici, Mr. Voinovich, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Chafee, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Thurmond, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Carper, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Smith of New \nHampshire, and Mr. Bond) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 62\n\n       Whereas August 24, 2001, marks the tenth anniversary of the \n     restoration of independence in Ukraine;\n       Whereas the United States, having recognized Ukraine as an \n     independent state on December 25, 1991, and having \n     established diplomatic relations with Ukraine on January 2, \n     1992, recognizes that fulfillment of the vision of a Europe \n     whole, free, and secure requires a strong, stable, democratic \n     Ukraine fully integrated in the Euro-Atlantic community of \n     democracies;\n       Whereas, during the fifth anniversary commemorating \n     Ukraine's independence, the United States established a \n     strategic partnership with Ukraine to promote the national \n     security interests of the United States in a free, sovereign, \n     and independent Ukrainian state;\n       Whereas Ukraine is an important European nation, having the \n     second largest territory and sixth largest population in \n     Europe;\n       Whereas Ukraine is a member of international organizations \n     such as the Council of Europe and the Organization on \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as \n     international financial institutions such as the \n     International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the \n     European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD);\n       Whereas in July 1994, Ukraine's presidential elections \n     marked the first peaceful and democratic transfer of \n     executive power among the independent states of the former \n     Soviet Union;\n       Whereas five years ago, on June 28, 1996, Ukraine's \n     parliament voted to adopt a Ukrainian Constitution, which \n     upholds the values of freedom and democracy, ensures a \n     citizen's right to own private property, and outlines the \n     basis for the rule of law in Ukraine without regard for race, \n     religion, creed, or ethnicity;\n       Whereas Ukraine has been a paragon of inter-ethnic \n     cooperation and harmony as evidenced by the OSCE's and the \n     United States State Department's annual human rights reports \n     and the international community's commendation for Ukraine's \n     peaceful handling of the Crimean secession disputes in 1994;\n       Whereas Ukraine, through the efforts of its government, has \n     reversed the downward trend in its economy, experiencing the \n     first real economic growth since its independence in fiscal \n     year 2000 and the first quarter of 2001;\n       Whereas Ukraine furthered the privatization of its economy \n     through the privatization of agricultural land in 2001, when \n     the former collective farms were turned over to corporations, \n     private individuals, or cooperatives, thus creating an \n     environment that leads to greater economic independence and \n     prosperity;\n       Whereas Ukraine has taken major steps to stem world nuclear \n     proliferation by ratifying the START I Treaty on nuclear \n     disarmament and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons, subsequently has turned over the last of its \n     Soviet-era nuclear warheads on June 1, 1996, and in 1998 \n     agreed not to assist Iran with the completion of a nuclear \n     power plant in Bushehr thought to be used for the possible \n     production of weapons of mass destruction;\n       Whereas Ukraine has found many methods to implement \n     military cooperation with its European neighbors, as well as \n     peacekeeping initiatives worldwide, as exhibited by Ukraine's \n     participation in the KFOR and IFOR missions in the former \n     Yugoslavia, and offering up its own forces to be part of the \n     greater United Nations border patrol missions in the Middle \n     East and the African continent;\n       Whereas Ukraine became a member of the North Atlantic \n     Cooperation Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance \n     (NATO), signed a NATO-Ukraine Charter at the Madrid Summit in \n     July 1997, and has been a participant in the Partnership for \n     Peace (PfP) program since 1994 with regular training \n     maneuvers at the Yavoriv military base in Ukraine and on \n     Ukraine's southern-most shores of the Black Sea;\n       Whereas on June 7, 2001, Ukraine signed a charter for the \n     GUUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Moldova) \n     alliance, in hopes of promoting regional interests, \n     increasing cooperation, and building economic stability; and\n       Whereas 15 years ago, the Soviet-induced nuclear tragedy of \n     Chornobyl gripped Ukrainian lands with insurmountable curies \n     of radiation which will affect generations of Ukraine's \n     inhabitants, and thus, now, Ukraine promotes safety for its \n     citizens and its neighboring countries, as well as concern \n     for the preservation of the environment by closing the last \n     Chornobyl nuclear reactor on December 15, 2000: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) as a leader of the democratic nations of the world, the \n     United States congratulates the people of Ukraine on their \n     tenth anniversary of independence and supports peace, \n     prosperity, and democracy in Ukraine;\n       (2) Ukraine has made significant progress in its political \n     reforms during the first ten years of its independence, as is \n     evident by the adoption of its Constitution five years ago;\n       (3) the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and \n     independence of Ukraine within its existing borders is an \n     important factor of peace and stability in Europe;\n       (4) the President, the Prime Minister, and Parliament of \n     Ukraine should continue to enact political reforms necessary \n     to ensure that the executive, legislative, and judicial \n     branches of the Government of Ukraine transparently represent \n     the interests of the Ukrainian people;\n       (5) the Government and President of Ukraine should promote \n     fundamental democratic principles of freedom of speech, \n     assembly, and a free press;\n       (6) the Government and President of Ukraine should actively \n     pursue in an open and transparent fashion investigations into \n     violence committed against journalists, including the murders \n     of Heorhiy Gongadze and Ihor Oleksandorv\n       (7) the Government of Ukraine (including the President and \n     Parliament of Ukraine) should uphold international standards \n     and procedures of free and fair elections in preparation for \n     its upcoming parliamentary elections in March 2002;\n       (8) the Government of Ukraine (including the President and \n     Parliament of Ukraine) should continue to accelerate its \n     efforts to transform its economy into one founded upon free \n     market principles and governed by the rule of law;\n       (9) the United States supports all efforts to promote a \n     civil society in Ukraine that features a vibrant community of \n     nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and an active, \n     independent, and free press;\n       (10) the Government of Ukraine (including the President and \n     Parliament of Ukraine) should follow a westward-leaning \n     foreign policy whose priority is the integration of Ukraine \n     into Euro-Atlantic structures;\n       (11) the President of the United States should continue to \n     consider the interests and security of Ukraine in reviewing \n     or revising any European military and security arrangements, \n     understandings, or treaties; and\n       (12) the President of the United States should continue to \n     support and encourage Ukraine's role in NATO's Partnership \n     for Peace program and the deepening of Ukraine's relationship \n     with NATO.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Con. Res. 63\n\n       Whereas more than 76,000 men, women, and children currently \n     await life-saving transplants;\n       Whereas every 14 minutes another name is added to the \n     national transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas people of all ages and medical histories are \n     potential organ, tissue, and blood donors;\n       Whereas more than 2,300 of those awaiting transplants are \n     under the age of 18;\n       Whereas approximately 14,000 children and young adults \n     under the age of 18 have donated organs or tissue since 1988;\n       Whereas science shows that acceptance rates increase when \n     donors are matched to recipients by age;\n       Whereas organ donation is often a family decision, and \n     sharing a decision to become a donor with family members can \n     help to ensure a donation when an occasion arises;\n       Whereas nationwide there are up to 15,000 potential donors \n     annually, but consent from family members to donation is \n     received for less than 6,000;\n       Whereas educating young people about organ and tissue \n     donation promotes family discussions over the desire of \n     family members to become organ donors;\n       Whereas Youth For Life: Remembering Walter Payton is \n     committed to educating young adults about organ donation and \n     encouraging students to discuss this decision with their \n     family and register to be organ donors;\n       Whereas the Youth For Life: Remembering Walter Payton \n     program is dedicated to football legend Walter Payton, who \n     broke the NFL career rushing record on October 7, 1984; and\n       Whereas Youth For Life: Remembering Walter Payton Day will \n     be held on October 9, 2001: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the purposes and objectives of Youth For Life: \n     Remembering Walter Payton; and\n       (2) encourages all young people to learn about the \n     importance of organ, tissue, bone marrow, and blood donations \n     and to discuss these donations with their families and \n     friends.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I stand before my colleagues today to \nacknowledge the contributions made by a dedicated group of young people \nfrom my home State of Illinois. John McCaskey, Erin Kinsella and Mark \nPendleton have initiated a unique program to raise awareness among \nyoung adults about organ donation.\n  Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton works in partnership with \nthe National Football League, NFL, to urge students to become organ \ndonors. Informational school forums will acquaint students with the \nissue and those who decide to sign an organ donor card will receive an \nautograph from an NFL player. Program organizers call it ``an autograph \nfor an autograph,'' and to date, they have enlisted the help of \nplayers, coaches and alumni from every NFL team.\n  The program honors Walter Payton, the Illinois football star who \nbrought to the Nation's attention the difficulties patients face while \non the waiting list for a donated organ. The NFL's all-time rushing \nleader, Payton died two years ago while waiting for a liver transplant \nat age 46.\n  Walter Payton broke Jim Brown's all-time rushing record on October 7, \n1984, and the Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton program \norganizers have decided to launch their efforts on October 9, 2001 to \ncommemorate this accomplishment. While his record-breaking performance \non the football field as a Chicago Bear set him apart from his \ncompetitors, his struggle to find a suitable organ donor is all too \ncommon.\n  More than 2,300 individuals suffering from a condition serious enough \nto place them on the waiting list for an organ or tissue transplant are \nunder the age of 18. Last year, 641 of those patients were between the \nages of 11 and 17. The Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton \nprogram highlights the fact that Americans of all ages need organ and \ntissue transplants. Many factors influence whether or not a transplant \nwill be successful, and matching donor and recipient age is one way to \nimprove surgery outcomes. Anyone can become an organ and tissue donor, \nand I would also like to emphasize how important it is that young \npeople both learn about organ and tissue donation and share that \nknowledge with their families.\n  I am submitting a resolution that will support the purposes and \nobjectives of the Youth for Life: Remembering Walter Payton program and \nencourage more young people to learn about organ and tissue donation. I \nam pleased that Senators Allen, Kennedy and Frist have joined me in \ncosponsoring this resolution. In the House of Representatives, \nRepresentative Brown of Ohio and Representative Largent of Oklahoma \nhave also chosen to lend their support to this program.\n  My colleagues know how far we have come in this field of medicine, \nespecially Senator Frist, himself a transplant surgeon. The first \nsuccessful transplant was the result of a kidney donation from one \nidentical twin to another. It occurred 47 years ago, without the use of \nany anti-rejection medication. The first liver and heart transplants \nfollowed, and progress has continued at breakneck speed. Today, \ntransplant procedures are more common, successful and safe. Patients \nsuffering from kidney failure, diabetes, heart disease and hepatitis C \nare just some of the individuals whose lives have been saved or vastly \nimproved by advances in heart, liver, lung and tissue transplant \nscience.\n\n  In addition to expanding the list of disorders treatable or curable \nwith an organ or tissue transplant, doctors and scientists have \nimproved the success and safety of transplant surgery. Organ and tissue \nrecipients survive and thrive today because investments in biomedical \nresearch have broadened our understanding of the immunological factors \nthat can enhance donor and recipient compatibility. Work in the \nlaboratory has led to the discovery of various immunosuppressive drugs \nthat decrease the likelihood of organ and tissue rejection. Increased \nrates of success have inspired more and more insurers to include \ntransplant procedures and medication as part of the coverage they \noffer. Yet we continue to neglect an important part of the equation for \nsaving and improving the lives of those patients waiting list for an \norgan or tissue transplant: Identifying and referring potential donors.\n  Progress in the field of transplant science is truly remarkable. This \nprogress is why I vote time and time again to invest in medical \nresearch. This progress is also why I stand before my colleagues once \nagain to emphasize the critical role played by groups like Youth for \nLife: Remembering Walter Payton.\n  The number of registered organ and tissue donors remains woefully \ninadequate. Every 14 minutes another individual joins the waiting list \nfor an organ or tissue donation. Identifying more donors and \nencouraging them to discuss consent with their next-of-kin is a part of \nthe battle against disease that we are not winning. We cannot afford to \nneglect the important work of groups that raise awareness about organ \nand tissue donation. Increasing knowledge about and inspiring interest \nin this issue is the only way we can ensure that innovations in the \nlaboratory and increased proficiency among medical providers make a \ndifference in the lives of those patients waiting for a transplant. The \nneed for more donors is acute, and without groups like Youth for Life: \nRemembering Walter Payton, the number of patients who die while waiting \nfor a transplant will only increase.\n  I introduced my ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' resolution in 1999, which \nemphasized the importance of discussing organ and tissue donation with \nfamily members to ensure that the desire to donate would be honored. At \nthat time, there were 66,000 patients waiting for transplants. 76,000 \nindividuals are waiting today. Of the 16,000 potential donors each \nyear, less than half will actually result in a donation of an organ or \ntissue, because too many potential donors fail to discuss their desire \nto donate with family members.\n  For those 76,000 Americans who are on the waiting list for an organ \nor tissue donation, identifying and referring more donors is a matter \nof life or death. Once the decision to become a donor is made, family \nmembers must be made aware of the donor's intention. Youth for Life: \nRemembering Walter Payton is a commendable program because it tackles \nboth of these barriers to linking organ and tissue donors with patients \nin need. Not only does the program encourage more individuals to become \ndonors, it also recognizes that young people can take a leading role in \ninitiating family discussion about intentions to be an organ and tissue \ndonor.\n  This resolution affirms the goals and ideas of the Youth for Life: \nRemembering Walter Payton program, and\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\nurges young people to learn more about the value of organ and tissue \ndonation and share that information with family members. I commend the \nprogram's founders for all the good work they have done thus far, and \nask that my colleagues join me in recognizing their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/31/senate-section/article/S8486-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1190.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY\n\n     ``Sec. 1. Statement of purpose, findings and declaration of \n       policy\n\n       ``The purpose of this compact is to recognize the \n     interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the \n     prerogative of the states under the United States \n     Constitution to form an interstate commission for the \n     southern region. The mission of the commission is to take \n     such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability \n     of dairy farming in the south, and to assure consumers of an \n     adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.\n       ``The participating states find and declare that the dairy \n     industry is an essential agricultural activity of the south. \n     Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors \n     and retailers are an integral component of the region's \n     economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of \n     pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the \n     health and welfare of the region.\n       ``The participating states further find that dairy farms \n     are essential and they are an integral part of the region's \n     rural communities. The farms preserve land for agricultural \n     purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural \n     communities.\n       ``In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority \n     over the region's fluid milk market by this compact, the \n     participating states declare their purpose that this compact \n     neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the \n     merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact \n     itself set forth this basic principle.\n       ``Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to \n     changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains \n     a contingency provision should the federal order system be \n     discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission is \n     authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the \n     order system. This contingent authority does not anticipate \n     such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is \n     only provided should developments in the market other than \n     establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the \n     order system.\n       ``By entering into this compact, the participating states \n     affirm that their ability to regulate the price which \n     southern dairy farmers receive for their product is essential \n     to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable \n     price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk \n     to the market and the vitality of the southern dairy \n     industry, with all the associated benefits.\n       ``Recent, dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced \n     downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the \n     southern dairy region. Historically, individual state \n     regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy \n     available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The \n     federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural \n     Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum \n     prices paid to producers for raw milk, without preempting the \n     power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum \n     levels so established.\n       ``In today's regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, \n     rather than individual state action is needed to more \n     effectively address the market disarray. Under our \n     constitutional system, properly authorized states acting \n     cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate \n     commerce than they may assert individually without such \n     authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke \n     their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent \n     of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.\n\n          ``ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION\n\n     ``Sec. 2.
