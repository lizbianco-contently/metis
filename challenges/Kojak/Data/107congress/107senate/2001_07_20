Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that whatever time I \nconsume not be charged against the two managers of these nominations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there will be 30 minutes of debate in \nrelation to the three judicial nominations, followed by three rollcall \nvotes beginning at approximately 9:50 a.m.\n  Mr. President, the first vote will be under the regular order. The \nnext votes will be 10 minutes each. These are the only rollcall votes \ntoday. The next rollcall votes will occur Monday at approximately 5:45 \np.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 30 minutes for debate, to be equally divided between the \nSenators from Vermont and Utah or their designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I see my good friend from Utah is here, \nas well as the Senators from Montana and Virginia.\n  Mr. President, it took the Senate the entire month of June to pass S. \nRes. 120, a very simple resolution in which we organized our \ncommittees. As one Senator, I am sorry we lost the month of June to the \nprocess of reorganizing the Senate, but I am proud of the very quick \nstart of the Judiciary Committee on holding hearings and reporting \nnominees.\n  I sent out official notice of the committee's first hearing on \njudicial nominations within 10 minutes after the majority leader \nannounced an agreement had been reached on reorganization. The hearing \non judicial nominations was held the very first day after committee \nmembership assignments were completed earlier this month.\n  We expedited committee consideration of the nominees by urging all \nSenators to propound such followup written questions as they thought \nnecessary as soon as possible after the hearing. I included them on the \ncommittee agenda for our business meeting this week.\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\n  At that meeting yesterday, the Judiciary Committee voted unanimously \nto report each of the judicial nominations. Each vote was 19-0, and the \nother nominations on the calendar were voice voted.\n  These are the first judicial nominations heard before the committee, \nthe first judicial nominations considered by the committee, and they \nwill now be the first judicial nominations considered by the Senate \nthis year.\n  I have only served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee since June \n5, the Senate did not adopt its reorganizing resolution until June 29, \nand committee assignments were not made until July 10. So we have been \nmoving pretty rapidly since the Senate allowed us to go forward.\n  There were no hearings on judicial nominations and no judges \nconfirmed by the Senate during the months in which I was privileged to \nserve as the ranking Democrat. I chaired the first hearing on July 11. \nThat was the first hearing on judicial nominations all year.\n  The first judge we confirm today will be the first judge confirmed in \nthe 107th Congress. I heard the rumors that those on our side of the \naisle would not hold hearings and would not consider any of President \nBush's judicial nominations. We even heard some words that the \nDemocrats might block all judges. Of course, we demonstrated very \nclearly that is not the case.\n  We set a pace, one of the fastest paces I have seen in my 25 years on \nthe committee under both Democratic and Republican Chairs. We held a \nhearing noticed minutes after the Senate's reorganization. We proceeded \nwith nominees of both the court of appeals and district court the day \nafter committee assignments were made. We proceeded with expedited \ncommittee consideration yesterday. We are proceeding today with Senate \nconsideration of what I hope will be the confirmation of the first of \nPresident Bush's nominations.\n  First is the nomination of Judge Roger Gregory. I know Judge Gregory, \nhis family, and indeed all the people who live in the area covered by \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, have been \nwaiting a long time for this day.\n  Judge Gregory was first nominated for this position in June 2000--\nmore than a year ago. He has the strong bipartisan support of both his \nhome State Senators, John Warner and Chuck Robb, but no hearing was \never scheduled on President Clinton's nomination of Roger Gregory.\n  President Clinton's attempts to fill a number of vacancies on the \nFourth Circuit met with resistance, delaying the inevitable integration \nof the court. Judge Beaty, a U.S. district court judge for the Middle \nDistrict of North Carolina, was nominated by President Clinton 6 years \nago, in December of 1995, but he never received a hearing. Judge Beaty \nwas renominated in 1997. Again, the committee scheduled no hearing for \nhim. Judge Beaty waited a period of 34 months without a hearing.\n  President Clinton tried again in 1999, nominating another African-\nAmerican, James Wynn. Judge Wynn, a North Carolina Court of Appeals \njudge, was also denied a hearing before the committee, but President \nClinton sent him back to the Senate one more time to give the Senate \none more opportunity to hear him at the start of the 107th Congress in \nJanuary of this year. After pending for a total of 16 months without a \nhearing, Judge Wynn's nomination was among those withdrawn by President \nBush in March of this year.\n  Roger Gregory was initially nominated, as I noted, over a year ago. \nLike the others, his nomination languished without a hearing. Because \nthere was no action taken by the Senate on Mr. Gregory's nomination, \nPresident Clinton used his powers of recess appointment to make Roger \nGregory the first African-American judge to sit on the Fourth Circuit \nand sent his nomination for a permanent position on that court back to \nthe Senate at the beginning of this year.\n  President Bush initially withdrew Judge Gregory's nomination in \nMarch, but after careful reconsideration, President Bush--and I applaud \nhim for this--sent Judge Gregory's name back to us in May. Again, he \nhad the strong support of both Senators from Virginia.\n  During this time, Virginia was represented by three different \nSenators, two of whom I am privileged to serve with today--one \nDemocrat, two Republicans. All three strongly supported Judge Gregory. \nTo their credit, all three resisted political importuning from either \nside.\n\n  This makes Judge Gregory actually one of the few nominees ever to be \nnominated for the same position by Presidents of different parties. He \nis in the unique position of serving by means of an appointment whose \nterm expires at the end of this session of the Senate unless his \nnomination to a full lifetime appointment is acted upon before we \nadjourn this year.\n  Judge Gregory received his B.A. in 1975 from Virginia State \nUniversity and his juris doctorate from the University of Michigan in \n1978. Prior to his appointment to the Fourth Circuit, he was active in \nprivate practice in Virginia.\n  His law practice was a mix of civil and criminal in both State and \nFederal courts, including criminal defense, personal injury, domestic \ncases, real estate, work as general counsel for an urban school \ndistrict, and defense cases for large insurance companies and large \ncorporations such as General Motors and K Mart. He was an active \nlitigator.\n  He also taught as adjunct professor of constitutional law at Virginia \nState University. He was a member of the faculty of the Virginia State \nBar Ethics and Professional Responsibility Committee for all recent \nadmittees to the State bar.\n  Judge Gregory was very active in community and bar activities before \nhe took the bench, including service on the board of directors of the \nCentral Virginia Legal Aid Society, the Richmond Bar Association, and \nthe Virginia Association of Defense Attorneys.\n  His life and career have been exemplary and his qualifications for \nthis position are stellar. His service on the bench since his \nappointment has been uniformly praised. He conducted himself with \ndistinction at his confirmation hearing this month.\n  Based on all these considerations, it seems appropriate that Judge \nGregory's nomination be the first considered by the committee and the \nSenate this year.\n  As I said before, I commend my good friend, the senior Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, as well as the distinguished Senator, Mr. Allen, \nand Representative Bobby Scott when they appeared before the committee \nearlier this month to urge Judge Gregory's confirmation, giving him \ntheir bipartisan stamp of approval.\n  At our hearing, Senator Warner, who is truly the gentleman of the \nSenate, as we all know, was characteristically generous in praising \nSenator Robb and Governor Wilder for their efforts on behalf of Roger \nGregory as well.\n  I add my praise of both Presidents, one a Democrat and one a \nRepublican. I praise President Bush for doing the right thing in this \ncase. President Bush deserves great credit for renominating Judge \nGregory and allowing the Senate a third chance to consider and confirm \nthis outstanding nominee. Senator Allen served with distinction both as \nGovernor of the State of Virginia and now as U.S. Senator from Virginia \nand knows well the qualifications.\n\n  Then we have two nominees to the district court in Montana. They are \nboth well qualified and well respected. My two friends from Montana, \nthe two Senators from Montana, came to me and asked if we could move \nthese judges forward. I thought they had done what is a model. They \nworked together with the White House to get two well-qualified judges. \nSenator Baucus and Senator Burns both told me the same thing on \ndifferent occasions: They had a desperate need for judges. They had one \njudge handling far more than they should have to, sort of home alone. \nThey said, please send somebody to help.\n  Recommended to the President, and the President to us, Richard Cebull \nis currently a United States Magistrate for the District Court of \nMontana. He spent his career in private practice before his appointment \nas a magistrate. Judge Cebull received a unanimous well-qualified \nrating from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, where \nthe ABA has been helpful to us, to Senators Baucus and Burns, as well \nas the White House.\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\n  Judge Cebull is a native of Billings, Montana. He received his B.S. \nfrom Montana State University in 1966, and his J.D. from the University \nof Montana Law School in 1969. Before his appointment as a magistrate, \nJudge Cebull spent his career in private practice in Billings, \nlitigating civil cases with an emphasis on insurance defense and \nmedical malpractice defense.\n  He was active in trial lawyer associations and a speaker at CLE \nprograms on practical litigation issues. He also served as a member of \nthe Montana Pattern Jury Instruction Commission, which wrote civil jury \ninstructions for Montana courts, and was Chairman of the Civil Justice \nReform Act Advisory Group, which wrote the District of Montana Local \nRules. For a short time in the 1970's, he served as a Trial Judge in \nthe Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court, presiding over criminal trials of \ntribal members charged with violating tribal ordinances. He has also \nserved as a settlement master in a variety of civil cases. Judge Cebull \nreceived a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating from the ABA's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary.\n  Sam Ellis Haddon is an attorney in private practice in Missoula, \nMontana. Mr. Haddon is a 1959 graduate of Rice University and received \nhis J.D. in 1965 from the University of Montana School of Law. He was \nan immigration patrol inspector for the U.S. Border Patrol, and a \ncriminal investigator for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. His legal \ncareer has been spent in private practice, focusing primarily on civil \nlitigation in a variety of areas of law.\n  He has been very active in bar activities and Montana Supreme Court \ncommissions over the years. His many memberships include the ABA, the \nAmerican College of Trial Lawyers, the American Academy of Appellate \nLawyers, the American Judicature Society, the American Law Institute, \nand he is a fellow of the American Bar Foundation.\n  As a young attorney he was active in the Montana State Bar, and later \non served on an advisory commission making recommendations to the \nState's Supreme Court about the standards for admission to practice in \nMontana. He was also chair of a commission to study and suggest \nrevisions to the State's laws of evidence, and since 1986 has served on \nthe Montana Supreme Court's Commission on Practice, screening and \nhearing ethics complaints against attorneys admitted in the State.\n  For the last five years he has served as the chair of this \nCommission. Mr. Haddon has been an adjunct instructor at the University \nof Montana Law School for nearly 30 years, teaching contracts, \nprofessional responsibility and trial practice. Like Judge Cebull, Mr. \nHaddon also received a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating from the \nABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\n  Judge Cebull and Sam Haddon are both strongly supported by their \nhome-state Senators, Max Baucus and Conrad Burns, who each testified \nenthusiastically on behalf of these nominees at their July 11 hearing. \nThe Senators from Montana also echoed the plea we had heard from Chief \nJudge Molloy, who is the only active Judge for the District of Montana, \nto quickly confirm these nominees.\n  I hope the Senate will respond to their plea and approve these \nnominations today. Confirmation of these nominations for Montana will \ndemonstrate that the Senate can act promptly on consensus nominees with \nbroad bipartisan support. When the White House works closely with home-\nstate Senators of both parties, with both Democrats and Republicans, \nSenate consideration is made much easier. I commend Senators Baucus and \nBurns for their constructive approach to filling the vacancies that \nwere plaguing their District Court.\n  I am happy to support these two nominees for the District Court in \nMontana as well as Roger Gregory for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit, and hope to be able to support many more of the \nPresident's judicial nominees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know there is tremendous interest in these \nnominees involving two States and a number of Senators. However, we \nhave received a number of inquiries and we will not be able to extend \nthe time. People are waiting. If there is a request to extend the time \nfor additional speakers this morning, I will have to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate \ntoday will consider the first of President Bush's nominees for the \nfederal judiciary. The three nominees are Judge Roger Gregory for the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and Judge \nRichard Cebull and Mr. Sam Haddon for the United States District Court \nfor the District of Montana.\n  My review of these nominees has convinced me that they will serve the \njudiciary with competence, fairness, and honor. Judge Gregory's \nextensive legal experience, character, and good judgment make him an \nexcellent choice for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. His \nnomination by President Bush--with the hard work and support of \nSenators Warner and Allen--is well deserved. It is also, by the way, a \nclear gesture of bipartisanship by President Bush, which is \nunprecedented in modern times.\n  The two nominees for the District of Montana also demonstrate the \nrewards of bipartisanship. Judge Cebull and Mr. Haddon enjoy the \nsupport of both Montana senators--Republican Senator Burns and Democrat \nSenator Baucus. And it's easy to see why. Judge Cebull has an \noutstanding record as a lawyer with 28 years of experience in private \npractice and as a federal magistrate judge. Mr. Haddon has also \ndeveloped considerable expertise in a broad range of litigation \ntopics--both at the trial and appellate levels. These judges will not \nonly perform their duties with distinction, but also will help ease the \nexcessive caseload currently being handled by Montana's single full-\ntime federal district judge.\n  So, Mr. President, we have three solid nominees before the Senate, \nand I hope and expect that all of them will be confirmed today. I also \nwant to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Leahy for moving these \nnominees. I must note, however, that there are ten other judicial \nnominees who have been pending before the committee for more than two \nmonths without even a hearing. I urge Senator Leahy to move forward \nexpeditiously on these and the remaining 26 judicial nominees pending \nbefore the committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent the distinguished senior Senator from \nVirginia be permitted to speak for 5 minutes, and then the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, be permitted to speak \nfor 5 minutes, and the remaining time be given to the distinguished \nSenator from Montana.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers. \nIndeed, we are fortunate here in the Senate to have two such \noutstanding Senators to head up the very important Judiciary Committee \nbecause the third branch of our government is the Federal judiciary.\n  Throughout the nearly 23 years I have been privileged to serve as a \nUnited States Senator, I have taken a very active and conscientious \nrole in making recommendations to our Presidents for nominees to serve \non the Federal judiciary.\n  We are at a historic moment here today with Judge Gregory, as we are \nabout to confirm the first African-American Judge to the United States \nCourt of Appeals on the Fourth Circuit. Virginia, and indeed all the \nStates within the Fourth Circuit, is diverse in its citizenry. Our \nJudiciary should reflect the broad diversity of the citizens it serves.\n  Accordingly, I had the privilege and the honor of recommending to \nPresident Reagan the first African-American in the nearly 200 year \nhistory of the Commonwealth of Virginia to serve on the Federal bench. \nThat judge, Judge James Spencer, a United States district judge, has \nserved with great distinction.\n  I also had the privilege and honor of recommending to the first \nPresident Bush, the first woman to serve on the United States District \nCourt in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Ms. Rebecca Smith. Judge Smith, \nlikewise, has served with great distinction.\n  And, today, the Senate will confirm Judge Gregory and another chapter \nof\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\nhistory is documented between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the \nFederal judiciary.\n  I remember very well when Roger Gregory's name first came to the \nUnited States Senate. I had not known him directly, and shortly after \nhe was nominated, I quickly made arrangements to confer with him.\n  Soon, we established a close professional relationship and personal \nfriendship; I have stood by his side ever since through a rather \nchallenging and unusual process of confirmation.\n  Judge Gregory is eminently qualified for a lifetime judgeship on the \nFourth Circuit.\n  Former Governor of Virginia, Governor Douglas Wilder, the only \nAfrican-American in the history of the United States in this century to \nserve as chief executive of one of our States, addressed a letter to \nme, my colleague Senator Allen, and Congressman Scott, in support of \nJudge Gregory. I would like to read portions of this letter into the \nRecord. I submit the letter in its entirety for the Record. Although \nthe House of Representatives is not directly involved in the judicial \nconfirmation proceedings, Members do play an active role. I thank \nCongressman Scott for his strong support throughout the Gregory \nconfirmation process. And, I also submit a letter of support from \nCongressman Scott to be printed in the Record.\n  Governor Wilder stated:\n\n       Gentlemen: I first want to thank you for the strong and \n     unwavering support relative to the nomination of Roger L. \n     Gregory for a position on the United States Fourth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. It has been invaluable in the process.\n       I also want to thank the Chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee, Senator Leahy . . . as well as the former \n     Chairman, Senator Hatch, for the courtesies extended to the \n     nominee.\n       I also commend Senator Charles S. Robb for starting the \n     process by recommending Judge Gregory to President Clinton \n     for the bench. Needless to say, there are a number of persons \n     who have played a pivotal role in bringing this nomination to \n     this point; but none more outstanding than the nominee \n     himself. I have long felt confident that once a hearing was \n     in place, others would more widely see the sterling \n     qualification of the individual . . .\n       I have known the judge since his college days at Virginia \n     State University through the present. I have known him as a \n     student, law partner and friend. I know that he enjoys a \n     splendid reputation with the bench and bar, as well as, being \n     an integral part of the community at state and local events. \n     His devotion to family and civic responsibilities is \n     outstanding and his character is beyond reproach. \n     Impartiality, integrity and resourcefulness will guide him in \n     his decision making.\n       I am confident he will make a very lasting contribution . . \n     .\n\n  Mr. President, over the history of the Fourth Circuit, there has been \na total of 41 judges who have served on the court. Throughout my 23 \nyears in the United States Senate, I have had the honor of \nparticipating in the Senate's ``advise and consent'' constitutional \nrole for 16 of these judges.\n  In fact, of the 11 active judges currently on the court, I have \nparticipated in and supported the confirmation of 10 of these judges. \nOnly Judge Widener, who was confirmed in 1972 and who is a jurist I \nhave come to know and greatly respect, has a confirmation that preceded \nmy Senate service.\n  Roger Gregory has been a respected member of the Virginia bar since \n1980. He has worked for one of Virginia's most respected law firms, \nHunton & Williams, and he co-founded his own firm in 1982 with Governor \nDoug Wilder. Judge Gregory is well known as a skilled litigator.\n  Judge Gregory, I believe, also has the requisite judicial \ntemperament. Many, if not all Senators are concerned about judicial \nactivism. The Judiciary's role is to interpret the law, not to make \nlaw. Judge Gregory assured me he will follow this traditional, \nconstitutional, role.\n  From my conversations with Judge Gregory, and based on his judicial \nquestionnaire, I am confident that he recognizes the importance of the \nseparation of powers laid out in our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, Judge Roger Gregory is obviously a very accomplished \nAmerican. He is well qualified to continue service on this important \ncourt, and I am certain that he will continue to serve on this court \nwith honor, integrity, and distinction.\n  It is time to confirm Judge Gregory to a lifetime appointment. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this fine nominee for confirmation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from former Governor Doug \nWilder and a letter form Congressman Bobby Scott be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Laurence Douglas Wilder,\n\n                                       Richmond, VA, July 6, 2001.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. George Allen,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: I first want to thank you for the strong and \n     unwavering support relative to the nomination of Roger L. \n     Gregory for a position on the United States Fourth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. It has been invaluable in the process.\n       I also want to thank the Chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee, Senator Leahy, for scheduling the hearings as well \n     as the former Chairman, Senator Hatch, for the courtesies \n     extended the nominee.\n       I also commend Senator Charles S. Robb for starting the \n     process by recommending Judge Gregory to President Bill \n     Clinton for the bench. Needless to say, there are a number of \n     persons who have played a pivotal role in bringing this \n     nomination to this point; but none more outstanding than the \n     record of the nominee himself. I have long felt confident \n     that once a hearing was in place, others would more widely \n     see the sterling qualification of the individual. I regret \n     very much that due to a previously scheduled vacation \n     starting last Saturday, I will not be in the country to \n     witness and attest in this regard.\n       I have known the judge since his college days at Virginia \n     State University through the present. I have known him as a \n     student, law partner and friend. I know that he enjoys a \n     splendid reputation with bench and bar, as well as, being an \n     integral part of the community at state and local events. His \n     devotion to family and civic responsibilities is outstanding \n     and his character is beyond reproach. Impartiality, integrity \n     and resourcefulness will guide him in his decision making.\n       I am confident he will make a very lasting contribution to \n     his state and country and again many thanks for making this \n     happen.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                L. Douglas Wilder,\n     Former Governor of Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 20, 2001.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Senator, U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am very pleased to see that the \n     Senate has Scheduled a vote on confirming Judge Roger \n     Gregory's appointment to the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Fourth Circuit. I want to take this opportunity to \n     express my great appreciation for all of your dedication and \n     commitment to getting Judge Gregory appointed, reappointed, \n     considered and confirmed.\n       As you know, Judge Gregory is from Richmond, Virginia--a \n     part of which is in the Third Congressional District which I \n     represent. His nomination to the Fourth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals is a source of pride for all Virginians.\n       Judge Gregory has stellar professional and legal \n     credentials. He is a summa cum laude graduate of Virginia \n     State University and a graduate of the University of Michigan \n     School of Law. After practicing with two law firms, he became \n     a founding member and managing partner of the law firm of \n     Wilder and Gregory in Richmond.\n       Judge Gregory is truly a consensus candidate for a \n     permanent appointment to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     He has bipartisan support from members of the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation, the Governor and other political \n     leaders from Virginia. He also has the support of many \n     organizations and individuals across Virginia and beyond. And \n     as a judge sitting on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals for \n     the past several months, he has earned the respect of his \n     colleagues on the bench.\n       I have known Judge Gregory for over 20 years and have \n     worked with him in several organizations, including the Old \n     Dominion Bar Association. I am confident that he will \n     distinguish himself and Virginia as a member of the Court.\n       With your continued able leadership, Judge Gregory will \n     have an excellent chance for confirmation, and, again, I \n     thank you.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                        Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, John Warner, for his \nremarks. I reflect on the first statement I made on this Senate floor \non January 25 when I rose to address the appointment of Roger Gregory \nto the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. When I \nspoke, I asked my colleagues to move the nomination of Judge Gregory on \nthe basis of his qualifications. I asked my colleagues, and indeed the \nPresident, to not view\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\nRoger Gregory based upon the former President's political \nmanipulations.\n  Fortunately, President Bush has heeded my advice and the advice of my \ngood friend and colleague, Senator John Warner, who stood with me on \nthat first speech back in January. Fortunately, President Bush has \nacted.\n  As a Virginian and as an American, I am proud to rise again today in \nsupport of the confirmation of Judge Roger Gregory. I am also proud to \nsee that Members of both parties in the Senate and President Bush have \nrisen above the past procedural aggravation and have acted in a \nstatesmanlike manner. It is my belief that in Roger Gregory the Fourth \nCircuit and indeed America have a well-respected and honorable jurist \nwho will administer justice with integrity and dignity. He will, in my \njudgment, decide cases based upon and in adherence to duly adopted laws \nand the Constitution.\n  He is the first African-American to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. This is a good and historic vote we are about to take. I \nshare the salient reasons I support Roger Gregory, whom we are about to \nvote to confirm. We hear a lot of inspirational stories. Yesterday, in \nthe Small Business Administration hearings on the nomination of Hector \nBarreto Jr., John Ensign and I thought what an inspirational story \nabout that young man and his father who came to this country. What a \nsuccess story.\n  Roger Gregory is an inspirational story, as well. Judge Roger Gregory \nis a testament to what can be achieved in America through hard work and \npersonal determination. He is the first person in his family to finish \nhigh school. He went on to graduate summa cum laude from Virginia State \nUniversity, where his mother had once worked as a maid. Before his \ninvestiture as a judge, he was a founding partner of the firm of Wilder \n& Gregory, a highly respected litigator representing municipal and \ncorporate clients in the Richmond area. He has been active in civic and \ncommunity affairs. He and I both served together on the board of the \nHistoric Riverfront Foundation in Richmond. He has an AV rating in \nMartindale-Hubbell, which is the highest combined legal ability and \ngeneral recommendation rating given to lawyers.\n\n  What is most important to me, what truly impressed me, is he has a \nproper judicial philosophy. He understands that the role of the \njudiciary is to administer the law based on the facts and the evidence, \nadministering the law, not legislating from the bench. He will follow \nthe rule of law, not participate--in his words--in an activist court as \nresult-oriented judges are very dangerous.\n  In particular, I also think it is important he understands, and \nstated to me an understanding of our Federal system, that the States \nhave broad prerogatives and you apply the Constitution and you do not \neasily overrule the laws enacted by legislators which ought to be \nupheld and respected by the courts.\n  I commend the chairman, Chairman Patrick Leahy, the Senator from \nVermont, and Senator Hatch for the dispatch in which they have moved \nthe nomination of Roger Gregory. Let me congratulate President Bush for \nthe confidence and good judgment he has shown in nominating Judge \nGregory to be the first African-American to hold a permanent seat on \nthe Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Roger L. Gregory is an exemplary citizen of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. He has a sense of the properly restrained role of the \njudiciary and is eminently qualified to serve with distinction for many \nyears, many decades to come.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to join me in confirming Judge \nGregory to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, first I thank the President of the United \nStates for his selection, moving the two judges from Montana; I thank \nSenator Leahy, my good friend; we have served together in a lot of \ndifferent capacities, it seems, over the last 12 years; and my good \nfriend Senator Hatch, on the Judiciary Committee, for having the \nhearings and moving them very quickly. Also, I thank my good friend \nfrom Montana, Senator Baucus. We worked together in order to get these \ntwo judges appointed and confirmed because the workload of the one \njudge in Montana is very high right now.\n  I had the honor of presenting both Sam Haddon and Richard Cebull to \nthe Judiciary Committee, and now I have the high honor of speaking for \nthem here on the floor of the Senate. They are without a doubt among \nMontana's finest. They are men of the land, but they are also men of \nthe law. They come with the highest ratings from their peers, and they \nfully understand equal justice under law.\n  Both are outdoorsmen. Both have labored in the vineyards, so to \nspeak, of their profession, and I highly recommend their confirmation. \nI thank them for their willingness to serve the judiciary system, and I \ncongratulate them and wish them well in their endeavors.\n  I have no doubt in my mind, and neither should anyone in this body or \nthe President of the United States, that these two men will serve in \nthe highest traditions of the American judiciary. I congratulate them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may speak for 30 \nseconds.\n  Throughout this procedure I worked hard in this case for Roger \nGregory, of course, but I want to extend special recognition to my \nstaff member, Christian Yiahilos, who has been untiring in his efforts \nin research and other matters relating to this nomination. I think we \nought to recognize the valuable support we get from staff, including my \nchief of staff, Susan Magill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is truly a historic day for the Senate.\n  For the first time in our history, this body will confirm an African \nAmerican to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  The fact that the Fourth Circuit is home to the highest percentage of \nAfrican American residents than all of the Circuit Courts of Appeals \nmakes this day even more historic.\n  More importantly, however, the man that the Senate has confirmed to \nthe Fourth Circuit is truly deserving of this honor.\n  Roger Gregory is not only a fine legal jurist, he is a good, decent \nman.\n  I commend President Clinton for having the courage to make a recess \nappointment of Roger Gregory last year.\n  I also commend President Bush for showing leadership by reappointing \nJudge Gregory earlier this year.\n  I congratulate the Senate Judiciary Committee for its quick and \nunanimous action with respect to this nomination.\n  Last year, I had the privilege and honor of recommending the first \nAfrican American woman to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit.\n  Judge Johnnie Rawlinson has served the Ninth Circuit with \ndistinction, and I cannot begin to tell you how proud I am, as are so \nmany other fellow Nevadans.\n  Roger Gregory will also bring honor and distinction to the United \nStates Court of Appeals, and I wish him and his family all the best.\n  I also congratulate Sam Haddon and Richard Cebull on their \nconfirmation to the United States District Court for the District of \nMontana.\n  The Haddon and Cebull nominations were also reported out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee by a unanimous vote.\n  Mr. President, this is so important, because it highlights what the \nnomination and confirmation process should be--bipartisan.\n  There are too many vacancies in the Federal judiciary, and Democrats \nand Republicans--the Senate and the White House--must work together in \na bipartisan fashion for the benefit of the federal judiciary and, \nultimately, the American people.\n  That is precisely what happened with these two highly qualified \njudges from Montana, a State that boasts a Democratic Senator in Max \nBaucus and a Republican in Conrad Burns.\n  These two Senators, working closely with President Bush and the White \nHouse, put aside party differences for the benefit of the federal \njudiciary in Montana--and ultimately the people of Montana.\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\n  They should be commended.\n  The relationship between Senator Baucus and Senator Burns reminds me \nof what Senator Ensign and I have committed to do for the benefit of \nNevada's federal bench.\n  Recently, Senator Ensign recommended to President Bush several \ncandidates for the federal bench in Nevada: State District Judges Mark \nGibbons and Jim Mahan, Las Vegas attorney Walter Cannon, and former \nWashoe County District Attorney Larry Hicks.\n  Senator Ensign and I discussed every candidate before they were \nrecommended to President Bush, and I fully support his selections.\n  It has truly been a bipartisan approach with respect to the Federal \nbench in Nevada.\n  Mr. President, that is how it should be.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time. I know we \nare committed to a vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield back whatever time I may have, \nbut first I ask unanimous consent it be in order to ask for the yeas \nand nays on the three judicial nominations and ask for the yeas and \nnays on all three of them en bloc now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back. Under the \nprevious order, the Senate will now proceed to vote on Executive \nCalendar No. 250.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Roger L. Gregory, of Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Fourth Circuit? On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

I am sorry that we lost \nthe month of June to the process of re-organizing the Senate, but I am \nproud of the very quick start that the Committee has gotten on holding \nhearings and reporting nominees.\n  I sent out official notice of the Committee's first hearing on \njudicial nominations within 10 minutes after Majority Leader Daschle \nannounced that an agreement had been reached on reorganization. The \nhearing was held the day after Committee membership assignments were \ncompleted earlier this month.\n  We expedited Committee consideration of the nominees by urging all \nSenators to propound such follow-up written questions as they thought \nnecessary as soon as possible after the hearing. I included them on the \nCommittee agenda for our business meeting this week. At that meeting \nyesterday, the Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to report each of \nthe nominations. Each vote was 19 to 0.\n  These are the first nominations heard before the Committee, the first \nnominations considered by the Committee and will now be the first \njudicial nominations considered by the Senate this year. I have only \nserved as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee since June 5, the Senate \ndid not adopt its reorganizing resolution until June 29 and Committee \nassignments were not made until July 10.\n  There were no hearings on judicial nominations and no judges \nconfirmed by the Senate during the months in which I was privileged to \nserve as the Ranking Democrat. I chaired the first hearing on July 11. \nThat was the first hearing on judicial nominations all year and one \nmore than the Republican Majority had held. The first judge we \nconfirmed today is one more than all the judges confirmed by the \nRepublican Majority in the first six months of this year.\n  I had heard the rumors that Democrats would not hold hearings and \nwould not consider any of President Bush's judicial nominations and \nwould not allow the confirmation of any judges. The word was that \nDemocrats in the Senate would block all the judges. Well, here we are, \nhaving held a hearing noticed minutes after the delay in the Senate's \nreorganization finally ended, having proceeded with nominees to both \nthe Court of Appeals and the District Court the day after Committee \nassignments were made, having proceeded with expedited Committee \nconsideration yesterday and proceeding today to Senate consideration \nand what I hope will be confirmation of the first of President Bush's \njudicial nominations.\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROGER GREGORY\n\n  I know that Judge Roger Gregory, his family, and indeed, all of the \npeople who live in the area covered by the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit have been waiting a long time for this \nday. Judge Gregory was first nominated for this position in June, 2000 \nmore than a year ago. He had the bipartisan support of both his home-\nstate Senators, John Warner and Chuck Robb. Unfortunately, no hearing \nwas ever scheduled on President Clinton's nominations of Roger Gregory.\n  President Clinton's attempts to fill a number of vacancies on the \nFourth Circuit met with resistance, delaying the inevitable integration \nof the court. James Beaty, a U.S. District Court Judge for the Middle \nDistrict of North Carolina, was nominated by President Clinton in \nDecember of 1995, but he never received a hearing. Judge Beaty was \nrenominated in 1997, and again, the Committee scheduled no hearing for \nhim. Judge Beaty waited a period of 34 months without a hearing.\n  President Clinton tried again in 1999, nominating another African-\nAmerican, James Wynn. Judge Wynn, a North Carolina Court of Appeals \nJudge, was also denied a hearing before the Committee, but President \nClinton sent him back to the Senate one more time, at the start of the \n107th Congress in January this year. After pending for a total of 16 \nmonths without a hearing, Judge Wynn's nomination was among those \nwithdrawn by President Bush in March of this year.\n  Roger Gregory was initially nominated, as I noted, over a year ago. \nLike the others, his nomination languished without a hearing last \nyear. Because there was no action taken by the Senate on Mr. Gregory's \nnomination, President Clinton used his powers of recess appointment to \nmake Roger Gregory the first African-American Judge to sit on the \nFourth Circuit and sent his nomination for a permanent position on that \nCourt back to the Senate at the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, \nPresident Bush withdrew Judge Gregory's nomination in March.\n\n  After careful reconsideration, the President sent Judge Gregory's \nname back to us in May, again with the strong support of both Senators \nfrom Virginia. This makes Judge Gregory one of the few nominees ever to \nbe nominated by Presidents of different parties.\n  In addition, Judge Gregory is in the unique position of serving by \nmeans of an appointment whose term would expire at the end of this \nsession of the Senate, unless his nomination to a full lifetime \nappointment had been acted upon before we adjourn this year.\n  Judge Gregory received his B.A. in 1975 from Virginia State \nUniversity, and his J.D. from the University of Michigan in 1978. Until \nhis appointment to the Fourth Circuit, he was in private practice in \nVirginia. Mr. Gregory's law practice was a mix of civil and criminal, \nin both State and federal courts, including criminal defense, personal \ninjury, domestic cases, real estate, work as general counsel for an \nurban school district, and defense cases for large insurance companies \nand other corporations such as General Motors and KMart. He was an \nactive litigator, trying several cases a year. He also taught as an \nadjunct professor of constitutional law at Virginia State University, \nand as a member of the faculty of the Virginia State Bar Ethics and \nProfessional Responsibility course for all recent admittees to the \nState bar.\n  Judge Gregory was very active in community and bar activities before \nhe took the bench, including service on the Board of Directors of the \nCentral Virginia Legal Aid Society, the Richmond Bar Association, and \nthe Virginia Association of Defense Attorneys. He had often spoken to \nstudents and churches. He has the strong endorsements of the National \nBar Association, the Virginia Association of Defense Attorneys, the \nMaryland Defense Counsel Board of Directors, and many others.\n  His life and career have been exemplary and his qualifications for \nthis position are stellar. His service on the bench since his \nappointment has been\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\nuniformly praised. He conducted himself with distinction at his \nconfirmation hearing this month. Based on all these considerations, it \nseems appropriate that Judge Gregory's nomination be the first \nconsidered by the Committee and the Senate this year.\n  I commended my good friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, as well as Senator Allen and Representative Bobby Scott when \nthey appeared before the Committee earlier this month to urge Judge \nGregory's confirmation. I do so, again, here on the floor of the \nSenate. The broad, bipartisan support for this nomination has been \nextremely helpful.\n  At our hearing Senator Warner was characteristically generous in \npraising Senator Robb and Governor Wilder for their efforts on behalf \nof Roger Gregory, as well. I would also add my praise of two \nPresidents, one a Democrat and one a Republican. President Clinton \nfirst nominated Judge Gregory and when he appointed him to the bench \nbroke a barrier that had extended too long at the Fourth Circuit.\n  President Bush deserves credit for renominating Judge Gregory and \nallowing the Senate a third chance to consider and confirm this \noutstanding nominee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, just prior to the vote on the nomination of \nRoger Gregory, Chairman Leahy made a couple of comments that require a \nresponse.\n  Let me make it clear that I agree with President Bush's judgment that \nJudge Gregory is well qualified to serve as a judge on the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I commend Senators Warner and Allen for their \nrecommendation of Judge Gregory to President Bush. The controversy over \nhis nomination by President Clinton, and his recess appointment in \nDecember 2000, had nothing to do with his qualifications. Rather, the \ncontroversy was over President Clinton's decision in late June of \n2000--in the last 6 months of his Presidency--to nominate a Virginia \nresident for a Fourth Circuit seat that has been regarded as belonging \nto North Carolina. In doing so, the President could not have doubted \nthat his action would cause a great deal of discord in the Senate--\nespecially because it was done without consultation with both home-\nstate senators. I worked very hard to resolve the conflicts created by \nthat nomination among the various interested parties. Unfortunately, \nthe discord was only amplified by President Clinton's recess \nappointment that occurred after George Bush's election as President.\n  In my view, all these facts are now in the past. President Bush, in a \nvery significant gesture aimed at changing the tone in Washington, \nfocused on Judge Gregory's qualifications and, with the support of \nSenators Warner and Allen, nominated Judge Gregory to a lifetime \nappointment. This was a clear gesture of bipartisanship by President \nBush which is unprecedented in modern times. In the past 50 years, \nthere has never been a case of which I am aware where a new President \nof one party has re-nominated a circuit judge originally nominated by \nthe previous President of the other party.\n  Chairman Leahy also made some remarks about how quickly he scheduled \nJudge Gregory's confirmation hearing. Indeed, he did so very soon after \nthe Senate's organizational resolution was passed on June 29. However, \nthis fact does not accurately describe the entirety of the Judiciary \nCommittee's record on judicial nominees. Prior to the organizational \nresolution, Chairman Leahy did not hold a single hearing on any of \nPresident Bush's executive or judicial nominees. He implies that he \ncould not have held such hearings without the organizational \nresolution. But that is not true. Between June 5 and June 29, at least \nseven other Senate committees under Democratic chairmen held a total of \n16 confirmation hearings on 44 nominees. One committee--Veterans' \nAffairs--even held a markup on a nomination. Further, the lack of an \norganizational resolution did not stop Chairman Leahy from holding \nhearings on such topics as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, racial \ndisparities of capital punishment, and counsel competency requirements \nfor death penalty cases. We also had a subcommittee hearing on \ninjecting political ideology into the committee's process of reviewing \njudicial nominations. From this record, it appears that the decision \nnot to hold hearings on nominees was simply a calculated tactic to \ndelay President Bush's nominees.\n\n  The Judiciary Committee's comparative lack of progress continues to \nthis day. Since the reorganization was completed, other committees have \nconsidered nominees at a much faster pace. For example, the Foreign \nRelations Committee on July 10 held a markup on 16 nominees. In \ncontrast, the Judiciary Committee has considered only three of the \npending Bush judicial nominees and only three Department of Justice \nnominees.\n  As of this morning, we have 111 vacancies in the Federal district and \ncircuit courts, including a number on the Fourth Circuit. I encourage \nChairman Leahy to start scheduling frequent hearings and markups for \nthese nominees. I look forward to working closely with him to review \nand confirm President Bush's nominees in a timely fashion.\n  If Chairman Leahy believes that I, as Chairman, did not move Clinton \nnominees and was unfair--which the facts and the record clearly show \notherwise--then I would hope he would do the right thing and move \nnominees at a faster pace than I did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S7994-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7994-S7995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF RALPH F.

The question is, shall the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nominations?\n  The nominations are confirmed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we have moved very rapidly to consider \nmatters before the Judiciary Committee having noticed these hearings \nwithin minutes of the time the Senate reorganized, meeting within days. \nWe have five nominations through this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise to congratulate Sam Haddon and \nUnited States Magistrate Judge Richard Cebull, whom the Senate today \nconfirmed to serve as Montana's U.S. District Court judges. These \nconfirmations are of great importance to my State of Montana. Currently \nonly one of our three judgeships is filled, which has placed a large \nburden on the shoulders of our remaining judge, Don Malloy.\n  I thank the Judiciary Committee for taking up these nominations in \nsuch a timely manner, especially Senator Leahy who has been very \nhelpful, and Senator Hatch as well. I also thank them for putting up \nwith the enthusiasm of Senator Burns and myself as we, in some sense, \npestered or hectored the two Senators for getting up these nominations \nso quickly.\n  In addition, I thank the leader for scheduling these nominations to \nbe confirmed this morning, at this time.\n  I could not think of two men who are more qualified to serve as \nMontana's Federal judges than Sam Haddon and Magistrate Judge Cebull. \nWe in Montana tend to know each other, or if we do not know each other \npersonally, we tend to know each other by reputation. I know Sam \nHaddon. I know Richard Cebull. I also know their reputations. They are \nsterling men and will serve as first-rate, highly distinguished U.S. \nFederal judges.\n  Sam Haddon is a graduate of the University of Montana Law School. \nAfter\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\nserving with the Border Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in \nthe late 1950s and early 1960s, he worked in private practice. I know \nhe has dreamed of being a Federal judge. His dream has now come true. I \nmight say, as an example of the hard-working industry of Sam Haddon, he \nis the first member of his family to go off to college and he now will \nbecome, when he is sworn in, a U.S. Federal judge. We are all extremely \nproud of Sam Haddon.\n  Before serving as U.S. Magistrate in Great Falls, MT, Richard Cebull \nserved as a Billings attorney for close to 30 years. He was born and \nraised in our State and has earned the respect of everyone in our State \nwho has had the good fortune and privilege of meeting him, engaging \nwith him as a magistrate or in a nonprofessional capacity. He and Sam \nHaddon are two people who are just perfect representatives of the \nquality of the people in our State of Montana.\n  It is a great honor and with great pride I join in thanking them for \nwanting to serve, and I thank the Senate for confirming both of them so \nwe in Montana now have all our judgeships filled.

The Senate will now resume consideration of \nH.R. 2299, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2299) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Murray/Shelby amendment No. 1025, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the \nTransportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002.\n  This bill was reported unanimously by both the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Transportation as well as the full Appropriations \nCommittee. This bill has been carefully crafted with the regular input \nof Senator Shelby and his staff.\n  The tradition of this subcommittee has always been one of \nbipartisanship. So long as I have the privilege of chairing this \nsubcommittee, I intend to continue that tradition.\n  The bill as approved by the Appropriations Committee totals $60.1 \nbillion in total budgetary resources. That includes obligations \nreleased from the highway and airway trust funds as well as \nappropriations from the general fund. This funding level is higher than \nthe level requested by the President. There are four reasons why this \nbill exceeds the President's request.\n  First, the administration's budget--rather than requesting \nappropriated dollars for railroad safety and hazardous materials \nsafety--asks us to impose new user fees on the transportation industry.\n  Some opponents of this approach have called these proposals ``George \nW. Bush's new taxes.'' The committee bill rejects these new user fees \nand provides the funds necessary for these critical safety functions.\n  Second, the bill increases funding for highways above the level \nrequested by the President.\n  Under the administration's budget, the President launches two new \ninitiatives at the expense of highway construction dollars to the \nStates. They are the New Freedom Initiative for the disabled and an \ninvestment in new truck safety inspection stations at the United \nStates-Mexico border.\n  The bill before you fully funds these two new initiatives. In fact, \nthe bill adds $15 million to the level requested by the administration \nfor border truck safety activities.\n  However, in order to ensure that funding for these initiatives is not \nprovided at the expense of highway construction funds in all 50 States, \nthe bill increases funding for highways to a level that holds all \nStates harmless.\n  Under the committee bill, every State will receive more highway \nconstruction funding than they would receive either under the \nPresident's budget or under the levels assumed in TEA-21.\n  Third, the bill includes a number of small but important safety \ninitiatives that were not included in the President's budget.\n  Within the Federal Aviation Administration, the bill includes funding \nto hire an additional 221 safety inspectors.\n  Following the ValuJet crash in May 1996, the Transportation \nsubcommittee has been increasing the inspection work force every year \nin order to get to the level of 3,300 inspectors. That was the minimum \nlevel identified as necessary by the panel of experts that was convened \nfollowing that crash. It was also the level identified by the National \nCivil Aviation Review Commission, which was chaired by now-Secretary \nNorm Mineta.\n  While the funds for these additional inspectors were not included in \nthe President's budget this year, the bill as approved by the committee \ndoes provide them.\n  In the area of highway safety, the bill includes funds that were not \nrequested to boost seat belt use, especially among at-risk populations. \nThe Administration has articulated a very aggressive goal to increase \nseat belt use. Unfortunately, when our subcommittee reviewed the \nbudget, we found no additional resources were requested to match the \nrhetoric.\n  Today, it is a tragic fact that African-American children, ages 5 to \n12, face almost three times the risk of dying in a car crash than white \nchildren.\n  The bill before us includes additional, unrequested funds to tackle \nthat problem. The committee has also provided funding above the \nPresident's request in the area of pipeline safety. I became involved \nin this issue after a tragic liquid pipeline accident that claimed \nthree young lives in Bellingham, WA.\n  The bill before us provides funding that is $11 million more than the \nlevel provided last year. Increased funding will be available to boost \nstaffing for the Community Right to Know Initiative and other critical \nsafety measures.\n  I am proud that this bill provides record funding to make pipelines \nsafer. It is the right thing to do.\n  Finally, the funding in the bill is higher than the administration's \nrequest due to my insistence that we address chronic staffing, \ntraining, and equipment shortfalls at the Coast Guard's search and \nrescue stations.\n  The bill provides the Coast Guard's operating budget with $45 million \nmore than the administration's request in order to address these search \nand rescue deficiencies and fund the mandatory pay and benefit costs \nfor our Coast Guard service members.\n  Before I close, I would like to turn to the issue of Mexican trucks, \nwhich is explained in detail on page 85 of the committee report. Here, \nour challenge has been to make sure that commerce can move between our \ntwo borders while--at the same time--ensuring the safety of all who use \nour highways.\n  President Bush requested $88 million to improve the truck safety \ninspection capacity at the United States-Mexico border. Unfortunately, \nthe Transportation bill as passed by the House of Representatives does \nnot include even one penny for that request.\n  The bill before you includes $103 million--$15 million more than the \nlevel requested by the President--for these border truck safety \nactivities.\n  The House bill also includes a provision that prohibits the DOT from \ngranting any Mexican trucking firm an operating certificate to begin \nthe cross-border trucking activity that was anticipated by NAFTA.\n  I believe we have found a good compromise that will promote free \ntrade and ensure safety on our roads. We crafted a provision based on \nthe serious safety risks cited by the inspector general, the General \nAccounting Office, and several state law enforcement authorities.\n  Our provision, which is in this bill, is designed to ensure that a \nmeaningful safety monitoring and enforcement regime is in place before \nMexican trucks are allowed to travel anywhere in the United States.\n  The provision establishes several enhanced truck safety requirements \nthat are intended to ensure that this new\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\ncross-border truck activity does not pose a safety risk.\n  This provision was adopted unanimously by both the Transportation \nSubcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee.\n  My door is always open to Secretary Mineta and the White House, and I \nwill of course listen to their concerns. But I believe that my \nprovision--as it currently stands--will allow our mutual goals of free \ntrade and safe highways to proceed side by side.\n  This provision will substantially raise the safety standards that \nwill have to be in place before cross-border trucking can begin. I \nbelieve that this is a far better approach than the one taken by the \nHouse bill--which has now drawn a veto threat by the administration.\n  I want to thank Senator Shelby for all his input into this bill.\n  I also want to thank Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens for granting \nour subcommittee an allocation that made it possible to fund the \nimportant safety initiatives in this bill.\n  We could not have done it without their help.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise in support of the fiscal year \n2002 Transportation appropriations bill put before the Senate today by \nSenator Murray. I do support the package reported unanimously from the \nCommittee on Appropriations and just described by the Senator from \nWashington in pretty good detail.\n  There is the first year for the Senator from Washington as \nchairperson of the Appropriations Transportation Subcommittee. I \nbelieve she has accounted for herself well on this bill. We have worked \ntogether. She has put a lot into it, and I believe this is basically a \nbalanced bill.\n  I believe that every Member can look at this bill and find a great \ndeal that they can agree with. But, I also think it is safe to say that \nif you look hard enough, just about everyone can find something they \nwould probably disagree with.\n  Clearly, that is the case with the Mexican truck issue. I believe \nthat everyone in this body is supportive of ensuring the safety of \ntrucks on our highways. I believe that many in this body consider the \napproach to Mexican trucks adopted on the House floor as being heavy-\nhanded, and contrary to the goal of improving the safety of trucks at \nour borders, within the commercial zone, and ultimately, beyond the \ncommercial zone on the balance of our Nation's highways.\n\n  Senator Murray has crafted a provision, section 343, that takes a \ndifferent approach. It provides for Mexican truck access to our \nhighways beyond the commercial zone once the Department has an adequate \ninspection regime in place and can assure that those carriers and \ntrucks meet articulated safety and insurance standards.\n  The approach of the Senator from Washington moves the debate on this \nissue forward and allows a resolution of this issue based on safety \nstandards rather than prohibiting any action by the Department to \nmanage the truck safety issues we face at our southern border under \nNAFTA.\n  For my colleagues who would support the House language, some of whom \nmay offer a similar provision during consideration of this bill, I \nwould point out that provision does little, if anything, to promote \ntruck safety on our highways. It may keep some unsafe trucks from \ngaining entry to our country, but it doesn't create a framework or any \nincentive to improve the safety of Mexican trucks. I have to tell you, \nthat I am probably less troubled by an outright prohibition than is the \nSenator from Washington. But, I am willing to pursue this issue with \nher through the Senate and to address my colleagues' concerns during \nconference to ensure that traffic beyond the commercial zone is safe.\n  To do that, it is incumbent on us to provide the necessary resources \nto begin adequately inspecting motor carriers at the border. I am \npleased that the bill before us provides a total of $103.2 million to \nenhance safety at the border--$15 million more than the President \nrequested. Specifically, the bill includes $13.9 million to hire an \nadditional 80 safety inspectors, $18 million for enhanced Motor Carrier \nSafety Grants to border states, and $71.3 million for motor carrier \nsafety inspection facilities along the United States-Mexican border.\n  That is a quantum leap forward in terms of ensuring safe \ntransportation of goods across the border for the benefit of American \nconsumers. While we must provide the tools to the Department, we must \nalso provide the Department with the flexibility to put forth a policy \nfor operations beyond the commercial zones, so long as the policy would \nnot undermine the safety of American families on our highways.\n  The Murray language does just that. It allows the Department to \nprocess applications of Mexican-based motor carriers after the \nDepartment remedies deficiencies highlighted by the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General and after Mexican-domiciled carriers \nmeet the strict safety requirements that this bill demands.\n  Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens have provided the Transportation \nSubcommittee with a generous allocation, and that has allowed this bill \nto fund the programs and the initiatives that the Senator from \nWashington has just described. I would like to take a few minutes to \nhighlight a couple of those items.\n  For the Coast Guard, this bill provides $45 million more than the \nPresident's request for operating expenses--and that is in addition to \nthe $92 million that was just agreed to in the supplemental conference \nreport for fiscal year 2001. While the Coast Guard isn't overfunded, it \nis not underfunded. The resources are in this bill to continue and grow \nlifesaving, fisheries enforcement, drug interdiction, and migrant \ninterdiction activities in fiscal year 2002.\n  I believe we need to continue vigorous oversight to make sure that \nthese dollars get to the Coast Guard districts and to the men and women \nwho volunteer to put their lives at risk to save lives, and to meet the \nCoast Guard's other missions. I continue to be concerned about the \ngrowth in overhead at the headquarters. The increasing costs there are \ntroubling.\n  I would also like to point out the bill provides the $325.2 million \nfor the first year of construction funding for the Coast Guard's \nIntegrated Deepwater Project. This funding represents the first \nsignificant installment of a 20-year, $10 billion Coast Guard program \nto put in place a systems integrator to design, develop, and construct \nnew surface ships, aircraft, sensors, and communications equipment--or \nmodernize legacy assets--used to conduct operations 50 miles offshore \nand beyond.\n  I have serious reservations about the long-term funding prospects of \nthis procurement, the inherent schedule and cost risks of the \nacquisition strategy, and with Coast Guard's ability to manage a \ncontract of this magnitude and complexity. While I am merely raising \nthese concerns now, I intend to discuss them in greater detail later \nduring the consideration of this bill in this Senate Chamber.\n  The FAA is generously funded in this bill. The funding levels match \nthe AIR 21 levels for the FAA's two capital accounts, and the funding \nfor FAA operations exceeds the President's budget request. While the \ncost efficiencies from the controller agreement have yet to show up in \nthe operations account, and there continue to be significant slippages \nand cost escalations in several of the FAA procurement programs that \nare critical to modernization of the National Airspace System, the bill \nbefore the Senate provides badly needed funding to continue the \noperations and to support an aggressive modernization program.\n\n  Accordingly, the committee-reported bill also more than meets the \nTEA-21 highway and transit funding levels and increases the obligation \nlimitation for highways and provides additional resources for transit \nnew start systems. This funding commitment by the committee bill \nrecognizes the priorities on these accounts reflected in the requests \nfrom Members of the Senate. I commend the Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, for her attention to the interests of the Department and the \nSenate in constructing the package before the Senate today.\n  While the bill commits a fair amount of funding for the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System, I would note that a great deal more funding \nis required to complete the commitment that has been made to this \nsystem. The\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\nADH system is far less complete than the National Highway System and \nmany years at these funding levels will be required to improve some of \nthe most deficient and dangerous segments of the rural highway system \nin all of America.\n  The bill provides $521 million for Amtrak and authorizes the railroad \nto immediately use all of these funds in one fiscal year. For the past \nseveral years, the bill has limited Amtrak to using 40 percent of its \nfunding in the first year so the balance would be available for the \nnext. Keep in mind that this money is appropriated for capital \nactivities and investments, so the provision and anticipation that it \nwould all spend out is unusual in and by itself. My sense is that this \nextraordinary action is at best a short-term solution.\n  Amtrak, as a lot of you know, is engaging in short-term borrowing to \ncover operational and debt service costs and Amtrak's cash shortfall is \ngrowing to unsustainable levels. Allowing the cash-starved Amtrak to \nspend its entire appropriation for fiscal year 2002 will allow, \nhowever, Amtrak to squeak through to the Spring of 2002, when this \nfailed experiment, I believe, will again be out of money.\n  I hope that we can move this legislation quickly through the Senate \nand through the conference. During Senate consideration of the \nTransportation appropriations bill, I will cover some of these issues \nin more detail, as will Senator Murray. But I look forward to working \nwith the Senator from Washington, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Committee on Appropriations, and with interested Members to \nconsider and pass this legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to applaud the committee for \nincluding the $5 million grant for the Eighth Paralympiad for the \nDisabled cited in this bill. This funding is for the 2002 Paralympic \nGames not the 2002 Olympic Games. It is important to remember that \nwhile the Paralympics are being held in conjunction with the Olympics \nin Salt Lake City, all the funding for the Paralympic Games has been \nvery carefully and very clearly separated from that for the Olympics. \nThis funding will be spent only for Paralympic costs and includes both \nFederal and private sources of funding.\n  This funding supports the disabled athletes who compete at Olympic \nlevels. These elite disabled athletes deliver amazing performances that \nare wonderful to behold. For example, they ski with one leg or they ski \nblind. We ask them to perform on Olympic courses, at Olympic levels, \nand finish in times within Olympic ranges.\n  The Paralympics and Special Olympics are events our country \ntraditionally recognizes as important priorities. That is, to encourage \nthe development of sports among special populations. Moreover, it has \nbeen an advantage to have the Olympic Committee, for the first time, \nhost the Paralympic Games. This ensures that the Paralympic athletes \nare recognized as Olympic level competitors and ensures they are \ntreated as Olympians. It also allows for synergy in developing \noperational plans thus making the Paralympics far more efficient.\n  Note that the Paralympic's association with the Olympic Committee has \nbrought yet another benefit. The Federal funding for these Paralympic \ngames is far less than ever before. For the benefit of my colleagues, \nlet me put this issue in perspective. These games will cost \napproximately $80 million. The Atlanta Paralympics were also about $80 \nmillion. But there the comparison ends. In Atlanta, $32 million were \nfunded by the Federal Government. In the Salt Lake Paralympics, Federal \nfunding will only be $10 million.\n  Why are the Salt Lake City Paralympics requesting far less Federal \nfunding than the Atlanta Paralympics? The Salt Lake Olympic Committee \nis paying $40 million of the costs and raising another $30 million from \nprivate sources. The Atlanta Olympic Committee paid $15 million and \nraised $33 million for the Paralympics. Because the Salt Lake Olympic \nCommittee is contributing more to the Paralympics, the amount of \nFederal funding has been reduced from $32 million for the Atlanta games \nto $10 million for the Salt Lake games. And, this bill only asks for $5 \nmillion for transportation while the Atlanta transportation cost to the \nFederal Government was $5.6 million.\n  This is a wise use of Federal funds. The $5 million requested for the \nParalympics are well justified. Additionally, these costs are most \nreasonable when compared to the Atlanta games and given the careful \nfinancial management on the part of the 2002 Salt Lake Olympic \nCommittee.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

Mr. President, I rise to spend a couple minutes talking \nabout an issue that has received some notoriety in recent months and \nsome specific attention over the last few weeks. That is the issue of \nthe island of Vieques in Puerto Rico and the incarceration of a number \nof people who went down to express their opposition to the continued \nuse of Vieques as a bombing site.\n  First of all, I say to those who have demonstrated there and have \nbeen sentenced to 30 days--in one case, I think 60 days--I think all of \nthese people involved certainly were aware that when you engage in \ncivil disobedience, there will be a price to be paid for that civil \ndisobedience. I will address the underlying issue of Vieques, but my \nhope is that the authorities will recognize that there is some sense of \nbalance in all of this and that 30 days and 60 days may be a bit \nexcessive, to put it mildly, in light of some of the sentences we see \nmeted out on crimes that are far more serious in our society.\n  I take particular note of my friend Bobby Kennedy from the State of \nNew York and his wife Mary who are wonderful parents. During this \nperiod of incarceration, a new son was born to them. Bobby Kennedy, \nobviously, could not be there for the birth of his son because of his \nincarceration in Puerto Rico. I know how difficult and painful this was \nfor him and his family. I want them to know that they have my strong \nsympathies and expressions of support. My hope would have been that \nBobby Kennedy might have been able to be with his family during that \nimportant moment, despite the fact that he would be the first one to \ntell us that he understood fully the implications to the action he \nwould take to express what were not only his views but the views of \nthousands of others within Puerto Rico and beyond the island over the \nissue of whether or not Vieques ought to be used as a continued site \nfor targeting practice by the U.S. military.\n  I express my sympathies for Bobby Kennedy, Dennis Rivera, and others \nwho are in prison at this moment for those actions.\n  There has been a long history here of divergence of interest with \nrespect to the people of Puerto Rico and the Navy's interest in \nmaintaining the capability for important live training exercises on the \nisland of Vieques. Over the years, efforts have been made to reconcile \nthese different interests. During the Clinton administration, in fact, \nan agreement was reached with the then-Governor of Puerto Rico, Pedro \nRossello, that called for the holding of a referendum in November of \nthe year 2001 to allow the residents of Puerto Rico to choose whether \nto end the military's use of Vieques by 2003 or to indefinitely permit \nmilitary exercises to continue after that date.\n  That seemed at the moment to reduce the tensions over this matter and \nto provide a way for the people of Puerto Rico to express their views. \nOn the idea of a referendum, I was thinking to myself, living in \nConnecticut, along Long Island Sound where there are small islands off \nthe coast of Connecticut, that if one of our islands were being used as \na target by the military, how long we would allow it to persist if the \npeople of my State felt strongly about it. I see the Presiding Officer \nfrom the State of Florida with a huge coastline. In many cases, of \ncourse, people have tolerated and supported it in their jurisdictions \nor States.\n  This is a matter which has provoked tremendous interest on the island \nof Puerto Rico, a part of the United States, of course.\n\n  Since the inauguration of Sila Maria Calderon, the new Governor of \nPuerto Rico, in January of this year, the efforts by President Clinton \nand Pedro Rossello, it has become clear that the resolution calling for \nthe referendum in November of 2001 has been sort of put aside, that the \nplan did not resolve these tensions, despite the good efforts of those \ninvolved in crafting that particular solution.\n  On June 14, in response to continued tensions, President Bush, in \nconsultation with the U.S. Navy, announced that all military exercises \nin Vieques would cease by May 1, 2003.\n  That provoked serious voices of dissent within this Chamber. In fact, \nthere were those who were very disappointed by President Bush's \ndecision. I happen to think he made the right decision. I know it was \nnot an easy one to make, but he did listen to the various sides of this \nstory and decided that, given all the information and facts, this was \nthe right decision to make. Naval training on the island was to proceed \nbetween then and May of 2003.\n  In addition, in accordance with the earlier agreement, the Navy \nreturned more than a third of its Vieques holdings to the island on May \n1, 2001.\n  Notwithstanding the Bush announcement, a number of issues have led to \nincreasingly vocal opposition to the continued use of Vieques by the \nNavy in the interim period. Puerto Rican critics of the Navy cite the \nloss of economic development opportunities on the island because access \nto most of the island's land is restricted. They also mention the \nfailure of the Navy to live up to pledges to compensate for these lost \neconomic opportunities.\n  Damage to the environment and ecology have also been mentioned. Most \nworrisome, concerns have been raised about the impact the Atlantic \nFleet Weapons Training Facility has had on the health and safety of the \npeople on the island of Vieques. Were we to put ourselves in the shoes \nof the mothers and fathers of the children on the island of Vieques, we \nmight better understand to some degree why there is increasing \nimpatience and concern about having to wait 3 years before a potential \ndanger to their loved ones will cease.\n  The relationship between the Navy and the people of Vieques has been \na rocky one, to put it mildly, over the years. More recently the \nsituation has grown from bad to worse. Visits by prominent Members of \nCongress and other well-known public figures, including the wife of \nJesse Jackson and Robert Kennedy Jr., have served to educate Americans \nwrit large about the Vieques issue.\n  Overly harsh treatment of these protesters by the court has only \nserved to make, in my view, the matter even worse. It seems to me that \nthe time has passed for the relationship between the Navy and the \npeople of Vieques to ever be mended in a satisfactory manner that would \nallow both to coexist on this little island.\n  The matter is going to get even more heated, in my view, as the July \n29 referendum called for by the Governor of\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\nPuerto Rico draws near. It seems fairly obvious what the results of the \nreferendum will be. And while I appreciate President Bush's decision to \nend the use of Vieques by the year 2003, at this juncture I believe \nthat is not going to be satisfactory. Those are the realities, Mr. \nPresident. Many wish it would be otherwise, but I don't think it is \ngoing to be so.\n  As a practical matter, continued civil disobedience is going to make \nthe Navy's use of its facilities impossible. We need to accept it and \nmove on, in my view.\n  Certainly, we need to find a way for our military to conduct training \nexercises. That is extremely important, and I don't, in any way, \nminimize the significance of that particular issue. The question is \nwhether or not there are alternatives to this particular venue which is \nprovoking so much dissent and so many problems for both the Navy and \nthe people of the island of Puerto Rico. A Department of Defense panel \nhas already recommended that the Navy work toward ceasing all training \nactivities on Vieques within 5 years. In light of recent events, that \ntimeframe will clearly have to be accelerated. I find it hard to \nbelieve that some interim locations can't be found where much of the \nnecessary training that the Navy needs to conduct could take place. \nSearch for alternative sights needs to be given a much higher priority \nthan was anticipated.\n  I don't fault those who tried to come up with a time line that would \nbe satisfactory, but the realities are such that I don't think that is \nany longer possible. The steps I have outlined can begin the process \nfor moving forward on this very difficult and contentious matter that \nundoubtedly has important implications for the people of Puerto Rico \nand for our national defense.\n  Mr. President, again, I salute my friends who have gone down to \nexpress not only their views but the views of the overwhelming majority \nof the people on Vieques. My plea at this particular hour, after having \nthese members serve two weeks in incarceration, is that the courts \nmight find it possible for them to have expressed their obligations by \nincarcerating these people in light of their civil disobedience, but I \nthink moving on is the best course of action.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. Yesterday, \nMr. Lawrence Lindsey, the President's chief economic adviser, attacked \nme in a speech before the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia. In that \nspeech, he repeatedly misrepresented my views, my clear positions, and \nmy record.\n  Mr. Lindsey, the President's chief economic adviser, for some reason \nfeels compelled to take my positions and twist them into something that \nis unrecognizable. These are not my positions, not my statements. This \nis not my voting record. I call on Mr. Lindsey to recant these false \nstatements. This does not improve the level of debate about serious \nissues and what is to be done about our economy and the management of \nthe fiscal affairs of our country.\n  Yesterday, Mr. Lindsey, in this speech in Philadelphia before the \nFederal Reserve, said at one point early in the speech, for example:\n\n       The new chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has alleged \n     the recent tax cuts are driving the country right into the \n     fiscal ditch.\n\n  He got that part of it right. I applaud him for that. He then went on \nto say:\n\n       These views reflect one side of the political debate--one \n     that ultimately favors allocating more of our Nation's \n     resources to government.\n\n  Mr. Lindsey, you know better. That was not the proposal of this \nSenator. The proposal of this Senator in the budget debate this year \nwas to continue to reduce the role of the Federal Government. That was \nmy clear position. That is the clear record, and no attempt by him to \ndistort it can change the facts.\n  Here are the facts. The spending proposal I put before my colleagues \nwould have continued to reduce the share of our national income going \nto the Federal Government from 18 percent of gross domestic product to \n16.4 percent of gross domestic product, which is the lowest level since \n1951. Mr. Lindsey, facts are stubborn things. Mr. Lindsey then went on \nto say:\n\n       The criticisms of the tax cut and comments on the budget \n     made by Senator Conrad hearken back to views widely held in \n     the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n  He went on to describe those views supposedly widely held. He \nconcluded that their solution was to raise taxes. The top income-tax \nrate was raised from 24 percent to 63 percent. The result, of course, \nwas economic disaster. Mr. Lindsey ascribes those views to me.\n  Mr. Lindsey, that is false. You know it is false, and that it is a \ntotal misrepresentation of the record of this Senator.\n  Let's turn to what I proposed to our colleagues. These are the charts \nthat were used on the floor of the Senate during the budget debate \nhighlighting the Democratic alternative.\n  No. 1, we protected the Social Security and Medicare trust funds in \nevery year. Does Mr. Lindsey disagree with that? Let's hear an honest \ndebate about that issue.\n  No. 2, we paid down the maximum amount of publicly held debt.\n  Next, we provided for an immediate fiscal stimulus of $60 billion. \nThat was a tax cut, not a tax increase, Mr. Lindsey. That was a tax \ncut. I was one of the first to propose a significant tax cut--in fact, \na tax cut to help stimulate the economy that was far bigger than what \nthe administration proposed.\n  Let's look at what the administration proposed in terms of a fiscal \nstimulus for the current year, at a time when we are suffering an \neconomic slowdown. All one has to do is turn to the proposal. This is \nfrom the President. Their proposal: No tax cut in 2001. None. Zero. \nThat was their proposal. They had no fiscal stimulus. They had no tax \ncut at a time of economic slowdown. It was largely Democrats who \ninsisted on providing a bigger tax cut this year to provide a fiscal \nstimulus to help this struggling economy.\n  And now, for Mr. Lindsey to twist that around and suggest that I was \nfor a tax increase at a time of economic slowdown, Mr. Lindsey, shame \non you. That is false. That is misrepresenting my clear record and my \nviews. Shame on you. You should not engage in debate in that way. You \nshould not take my clear positions, my clear record, and stand them on \ntheir head. I am not going to allow it to happen.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what could be more clear. We provided not \nonly a substantial tax cut this year, but the budget plan I put before \nmy colleagues also provided significant tax relief for all Americans, \nincluding rate reduction, marriage penalty relief, and estate tax \nreform. That is my record--not proposing tax increases at a time of \neconomic slowdown.\n  That is not my record, that is not my position, and that is not my \nvotes.\n  We also reserved resources for high-priority domestic needs, \nincluding improving education, a prescription drug benefit, \nstrengthening national defense, and funding agriculture, and we \nprovided $750 billion to strengthen Social Security and address our \nlong-term debt. That is my record. Those were my proposals. Those were \nmy positions. And for Mr. Lindsey to go to the Federal Reserve Bank of \nPhiladelphia yesterday and suggest otherwise is flat dishonest.\n  What has them all fussed up down at the White House? Why do they \nengage in these ad hominem attacks on the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and others of us who believe that this administration has put \nus right into the fiscal ditch?\n  I think what triggered all of this was a press conference I had after \nMr. Lindsey himself said that the revenue they were forecasting this \nyear is going to come in below what they had projected.\n  What we find, if we follow through this, what some in the media have \ncalled this amazing shrinking surplus, is that we started out with a \nforecast of $275 billion of surplus for this year, but after you take \nout the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare, the cost of the \ntax bill, and other related budget items, you get down to only $6 \nbillion available this year, and that is\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\nbefore Mr. Lindsey said the revenue is not coming in as forecast.\n  That puts us in a negative position. That puts us in a non-trust-fund \ndeficit. That is, when you take out the trust funds of Social Security \nand Medicare, you see red ink for this year, and I pointed out it is \nnot just this year, this time of economic slowdown, but looking ahead \nto next year when the administration forecasts strong economic growth \nthat we find the situation is becoming even more serious. This is after \nthe administration promised us a budget plan that could do everything. \nThey said they had a budget plan that would allow for a massive tax \ncut. They said they could also accommodate a major defense buildup, \nthey could protect Social Security, and they could have maximum paydown \nof the national debt. They said it all added up. It does not all add \nup. That is what is becoming more and more clear.\n  If we look at 2002, the next fiscal year, with a projected surplus of \n$304 billion, if we take out Medicare and Social Security, we get down \nto $95 billion. Then take out their tax cut and the budget resolution \nthat passed Congress, and we get down to $25 billion available. But \nthat is before we see a further reduction in the economic forecast \nbecause of the economic slowdown.\n  The economic slowdown this year will mean we have less revenue next \nyear. We had three economists testify before the Budget Committee that \nwe could see a reduction of anywhere from $50 billion to $75 billion \nnext year from what was forecasted in revenue for the Federal \nGovernment. That wipes out the available surplus and puts us into a \nraid on the Medicare trust fund next year, and it even suggests that \nthis administration may be using some of the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  That is not at a time of economic slowdown; that is a time in which \nthey are projecting strong economic growth, and yet we see their \nproposal will be using Medicare and Social Security trust funds to \nfinance other programs of Government at a time they are forecasting--\nthis is the administration's projection--strong economic growth. Yet \ntheir proposal will mean we are using Social Security and Medicare \ntrust fund money to finance the other programs of the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  This is what I have raised questions about. Does it make sense for \nthis country to use Medicare and Social Security trust fund money to \nfinance the other programs of the Federal Government at a time that the \nadministration is forecasting strong economic growth? I do not think \nso. I do not think we should finance the other programs of Government, \nhowever meritorious, by using the trust funds of Social Security and \nMedicare at a time of strong economic growth.\n  Why? Because we all know that in the next decade the baby boom \ngeneration starts to retire and these surpluses in the trust funds turn \nto big deficits.\n  I should point out that we see trouble next year in terms of the \ntrust funds of Social Security and Medicare being used to finance other \nprograms of Government before the big increase in defense the President \nhas requested.\n  If we look at what that will do, and we look at 2002, we see we are \nalready in trouble before the President has requested a substantial \nincrease for defense. That just makes the raid on the trust funds \ndeeper and broader.\n  When we look ahead and put in the Bush defense request, when we put \nin new money for education, which just passed nearly unanimously in the \nSenate but is not in the budget, when we put in money for natural \ndisasters, which is not in the budget--but we just had a natural \ndisaster in Ohio the night before last, we just had a natural disaster \nin West Virginia, we just had natural disasters in Texas--when we put \nin money for natural disasters, when we address the tax extenders, the \npopular expiring provisions of the Tax Code we all know are going to be \nextended that are not in the budget, when we look at fixing the \nalternative minimum tax fiasco created by this tax bill, which is going \nto take us from fewer than 2 million people being caught up in the \nalternative minimum tax to 35 million people being caught up in the \nalternative minimum tax, and if we just look at the cost of fixing that \nproblem caused by this tax bill, it costs $200 billion to fix, and if \nwe look at additional economic revisions because of the economic \nslowdown we are experiencing and the associated interest costs, what we \nsee is that every year for the next 9 years this administration's \neconomic plan will be using Medicare trust funds and Social Security \ntrust funds to pay for the other programs of the Federal Government \nunless some change is made.\n  One can look at these and say: Gee, I don't think we are going to add \nany new money for education. Or one can say: I don't think we are going \nto pay for natural disasters. Or: I don't think we are going to pay to \nfix the alternative minimum tax that is going to affect 35 million \nAmerican taxpayers by the end of this period, nearly 1 in 4 taxpayers \nin this country. Or one can say: We don't think the Bush defense \nrequest will be granted.\n  Fine. One can use one's own assumptions. I just say to my colleagues, \nthis reveals just as clearly as can be that their economic plan, their \nbudget plan, does not add up, did not add up, and puts us right back \ninto the deficit ditch. That is what I have said and that is what I \nmeant, and I believe the record is clear.\n  Mr. President, I think they realize they are in trouble, so their \nresponse has been: Oh, there really isn't a Medicare trust fund \nsurplus. That has been one of their responses. We have heard it in this \nChamber, and we have heard it from people in the administration. That \nis an interesting idea, but if one looks at the report of the \nCongressional Budget Office on page 19 of the budget outlook, under \n``Trust Fund Surpluses''--this is a report of the Congressional Budget \nOffice--it shows that Social Security has big surpluses every \nyear. Medicare, hospital insurance, Part A: big surpluses every year.\n\n  Part B, the administration claims, has a deficit. That is not what \nthe records show. The records show that it is in rough balance and \nactually has a slight surplus over the period of the 10 years in this \nbudget. It is not just the Congressional Budget Office documents that \nshow there is a Medicare trust fund surplus; it is the administration's \nown documents issued by the Office of Management and Budget that show \nMedicare, Federal hospital insurance, HI trust fund surpluses each and \nevery year.\n  It is not just Medicare Part A; it is Medicare Part B the \nadministration is now claiming is in deficit. But look at their own \nreports. Here is Part B, the Federal supplementary medical insurance \ntrust fund; look at the reports they have issued. They show that over \nthe 10-year period of time they are in rough balance in Part B. What \nthey have tried to do is say, because Medicare Part B is financed 25 \npercent from premiums and 75 percent from the general fund, the general \nfund contribution represents a deficit. It does not. If we were to \napply that standard, every other Federal Government program would be in \ndeficit because they are funded, by and large, by 100-percent \ncontributions from the general fund.\n  Is this administration claiming the defense budget is in deficit \nbecause it is financed 100 percent from the general fund? I have never \nheard that from them. I never heard from them that education is in \ndeficit because it is funded 100 percent by the general fund. That is \nprecisely how you fund most Government programs.\n  Medicare Part B physician services actually has an additional funding \nmechanism. Some of it comes from the general fund, but part of it--25 \npercent, roughly--comes from the premiums paid by Medicare-eligible \npeople.\n  Now, is this administration saying that in a deficit they are \nproposing a big increase in the premiums that senior citizens pay? I \nwould like to hear the answer to that. Is that what they are \nsuggesting? They have a problem because I believe it is wrong to use \nMedicare and Social Security trust fund money to pay for the other \nprograms of Government. Their own congressional leadership doesn't \nagree with them.\n  If they are saying that my views are the views of the 1930s, are they \nmaking that same accusation with respect to the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives--the Republican Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives? This is what he said on that question on March 2 of \nthis year:\n\n       We are going to wall off Social Security trust funds and \n     Medicare trust funds. And consequently, we pay down the \n     public debt\n\n[[Page S8001]]\n\n     when we do that. So we are going to continue to do that. \n     That's in the parameters of our budget and we are not going \n     to dip into that at all.\n\n  That is the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives. Is \nthe White House saying he has 1930s economic views?\n  It doesn't stop there. This is a quote from the House majority \nleader, Dick Armey, a Republican. He said, this month:\n\n       Let me just be very clear on this. The House of \n     Representatives is not going to go back to raiding Social \n     Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\n  Does Mr. Lindsey think Dick Armey, the Republican majority leader in \nthe House of Representatives, has 1930s economic views?\n  It doesn't stop there. Here is a quote from July 11 from the House \nBudget chairman in the House of Representatives, Mr. Jim Nussle:\n\n       This Congress will protect 100 percent of the Social \n     Security and HI trust funds. Period. No speculation. No \n     supposition. No projections. The Congress has voted \n     unanimously, or almost unanimously. There were a few that \n     didn't see it this way for lockboxes and all sorts of \n     different mechanisms to make sure this occurred. Both parties \n     prepared budgets that did so. We will protect 100 percent of \n     Medicare and Social Security.\n\n  Does Mr. Lindsey say the Republican House Budget Committee chairman \nhas 1930s economic views? What say you, Mr. Lindsey? It appears to me \nyou are contradicting the elected leadership of your own party in the \nHouse of Representatives. And it is not just in the House of \nRepresentatives. If we come to the Senate and look at the statement \nfrom the former chairman of the Budget Committee, the very \ndistinguished and able Senator Pete Domenici, this is his quote:\n\n       For every dollar you divert to some other program, you are \n     hastening the day when Medicare falls into bankruptcy, and \n     you are making it more and more difficult to solve the \n     Medicare problem in a permanent manner into the next \n     millennium.\n\n  Mr. Lindsey, does Senator Domenici, the former Republican chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, have 1930s economic views?\n  It is not just the former chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nthe former Republican chairman, and not just the elected leadership of \nthe House of Representatives--all Republicans--who have said very \nclearly that they intend to protect both Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds. Every Republican Senator, every single one, voted 4 months \nago, on language that said the following:\n\n       Preserving the Social Security and Medicare hospital \n     insurance surpluses would restore confidence in the long-term \n     financial integrity of Social Security and Medicare.\n\n  That is what they said. They said very clearly the same thing I am \nsaying.\n  Mr. Lindsey, does every Republican Senator have 1930s economic views? \nI don't think so.\n  We ought to have a thorough and honest debate. But Mr. Lindsey, don't \nmisrepresent my view and misrepresent my record. It is there for \nanybody to check. I proposed not a tax increase this year; I proposed a \nsignificant tax reduction, a much bigger tax reduction than this \nadministration proposed for this year. I proposed a real fiscal \nstimulus at a time of economic downturn. I didn't just propose it; I \nvoted for it. My record is clear.\n  Interestingly enough, this administration proposed no fiscal stimulus \nfor this year. I am holding up their plan. I will submit it for the \nRecord because it is right here. If Mr. Lindsey thinks we have \nforgotten who proposed what, he is dead wrong. We remember very well.\n  Who stood where on the question of fiscal stimulus for this year? I \nnot only proposed significant tax relief for this year; I proposed \nsignificant tax relief going forward. It is true, not as big a tax cut \nin future years as the administration proposed, because I could see \nthey were putting us in danger of raiding the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds in the future, at times when even they say the \neconomy will be growing strongly. That is their economic plan. That is \ntheir budget plan that has put this country in jeopardy, that has put \nus in a position of violating the trust with the American people. It is \ntheir budget plan, it is their tax plan, that has us on a collision \ncourse with going back into the deficit ditch.\n  Mr. Lindsey is the chief economic adviser to the President of the \nUnited States and the architect of this failed plan. He will be held \naccountable by history. He said they had a plan that added up. I \nconfess, I didn't know when I was on the floor day after day after day \nquestioning the wisdom of their plan that it would be revealed in this \nyear how flawed it really was. I did not think we would face a problem \nuntil perhaps 2003 or 2004. But already we are in trouble; already this \nadministration is using Medicare and Social Security trust fund money--\nat least Medicare trust fund money this year, clearly Medicare trust \nfund money next year and perhaps even Social Security trust fund \nmoney--and that is before their request for a substantial increase in \ndefense expenditures.\n\n  I am willing to engage in a tough and spirited debate on these issues \nwith any representative of the administration. But I do not expect them \nto misrepresent my positions and my clear record. That is unacceptable. \nThat is absolutely unacceptable.\n  All of this is especially ironic, given the headlines in the \nWashington Post today: ``Social Security Future Grim, Bush Panel \nSays.'' Here is the first paragraph of that article:\n\n       A commission assigned by President Bush to redesign Social \n     Security yesterday offered a bleak appraisal of a ``broken'' \n     system, warning that deep benefit cuts, tax increases, or \n     ``massive'' federal debt are inevitable unless Congress \n     allows the personal retirement accounts the White House \n     favors.\n\n  What irony, warning that:\n\n       . . . deep benefit cuts, tax increases, or ``massive'' \n     federal debt are inevitable unless Congress allows the \n     personal retirement accounts the White House favors.\n\n  I have always believed it is inappropriate to say I told you so, but, \nI told you so. When we had the budget debate, the proposal I put before \nour colleagues protected the Social Security and Medicare trust funds \nin each and every year, but, more than that, set aside $750 billion out \nof the surpluses of today to prepay some of the Social Security \nliability tomorrow. This administration said no. This administration \nturned their back on an opportunity not only to protect the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds in each and every year but, more than \nthat, to set aside money to prepay part of the liability that is \ncoming, which they now say threatens massive debt, tax increases, or \ndeep benefit cuts.\n  Where were they when just months ago we had that exact debate? They \ndidn't know this? We all knew it. We all knew that is where we were \nheaded. Yet Mr. Lindsey, as the chief economic adviser to the \nPresident, and the rest of this economic team, plunged ahead with a \nbudget and tax plan that never added up, that doesn't add up, that \nrisks putting us back into the budget ditch, and now are \nmisrepresenting my record by trying to assert that I favor tax \nincreases at a time of economic downturn when my record shows \nabsolutely to the contrary, that I proposed a far bigger tax cut this \nyear than did the administration.\n  Finally, for them to assert that my budget plan meant more resources \ngoing to the Federal Government--nonsense. The budget proposal I put \nbefore our colleagues continued to shrink the role of the Federal \nGovernment, from 18 percent of gross domestic product today to 16.4 \npercent of gross domestic product at the end of this budget period, the \nlowest level of GDP since 1951.\n  Mr. Lindsey, that is my record. Those are my positions. No attempt by \nyou to distort them or misrepresent them is acceptable.\n  I thank the Chair.

Madam President, I take the floor to join some of my \nother colleagues on the Banking Committee to express my admiration for \nand thanks to Jackie Clegg, who is serving her last day as Vice \nChairman of the Export-Import Bank. Jackie Clegg might otherwise be \nknown somewhere as Mrs. Chris Dodd. She began her career on the Banking \nCommittee, where she met Senator Dodd, as a staffer for my predecessor, \nJake Garn from Utah. She is a Utah alumna in Washington, of whom we are \nall very proud.\n  She has performed expert service as a member of the Banking Committee \nstaff and now in her new assignment on the Export-Import Bank. We wish \nher well as she ends her career there.\n  I wish to note that Jackie has her priorities straight. One of the \nreasons she is leaving the Export-Import Bank is because she is \nexpecting a child. It will be her first. It will also be Senator Dodd's \nfirst. I wish them both well in their new anticipated careers as \nparents.\n  Jackie understands the importance of a family, and her willingness to \ngive public service has been greatly appreciated, and her willingness \nnow to give a different kind of service that perhaps will have a longer \nlasting impact as she prepares to bear and raise a child will be \nsomething for which she should be congratulated also.\n  I join with the other members of the Banking Committee in saying to \nJackie as she ends her service with the Export-Import Bank: Well done. \nWe are grateful for your service. We are grateful for your leadership. \nWe are grateful for the expenditure of your talents on behalf of your \ncountry.\n  I say to her and Chris: Good luck and best wishes as you embark on \nthe sea of parenthood. My wife and I have had six children. We now have \n16 grandchildren. And we tell you, Jackie and Chris, it is very much \nworth it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka).

Mr. President, I wish to rise for a few moments today \nbefore we adjourn the Senate for the weekend to speak about one of the \nappropriations bills that we are going to be dealing with when we \nreturn next week and that we will work on through this summer session \ninto the fall. That appropriations bill is the District of Columbia \nappropriations, which I have the great honor and privilege and \nopportunity to serve now as Chair, along with my distinguished \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, the ranking member. He and I have \nworked together very closely for the last several months on that \nappropriations committee. With the change in leadership, I find myself \nas Chair of this important committee. I want to spend a minute talking \nabout that role and about some of the responsibilities that I see \ncoming along with that role.\n  First, let me say that Senator DeWine and I have been in close \ncommunication on many issues that are important to the District. I have \ngreat respect for the Mayor and members of the city council, and for \nDelegate Eleanor Holmes Norton for the great work she does for the \nDistrict. I look forward to working with them, along with the business \nleaders, the community leaders, and the labor leaders in the city to \nhelp this city be all that it can be and all that it should be.\n  I am a supporter of home rule and am a supporter of city leaders \nmaking decisions for themselves in great measure about how this city \nshould be run, and I have great confidence in the ability of those \nleaders that I just mentioned.\n  Particularly, I share the Mayor's vision for this city in large \nmeasure. But one of the things that Senator DeWine and I, and others, \nhave spoken about--there are many Members of the Senate and the House, \nnot the least of whom is the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Robert \nByrd, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, and the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, all of whom play a vital role in the oversight, \nif you will, of the District of Columbia. I have shared many of my \nthoughts with them about proceeding in this particular role.\n  I want to outline a few issues that I would like to focus on and that \nI will be conducting hearings on--and the many discussions with Members \nof Congress on some of these issues.\n  One is the proper role of the chief financial officer. I think it is \nthe cornerstone of our post-Control-Board reform. The District has made \ntremendous progress--4 years of surpluses, 4 years of better \nmanagement, and 4 years of developing policies that are helping the \nDistrict to regain its financial footing.\n  I think it is very important for us to focus on the role of the chief \nfinancial officer to make sure that the new responsibilities he has \nbeen given--it is my understanding that about 26 weighty \nresponsibilities for the financial operations of this District have \nbeen handed to him by the city council and by our own laws here in \nCongress--are matched with the proper authority and a proper power to \ncarry out those responsibilities.\n  I have spent a good bit of this week reading a very excellent report \nby the DC Appleseed Center, entitled ``After the Control Board: The \nChief Financial Officer and Financial Management of the District of \nColumbia,'' which is the sole focus of this report:\n  The DC Appleseed Center is an independent non-profit advocacy \norganization dedicated to making the District of Columbia and the \nWashington Metropolitan area a better place to live and work, focusing \nprimarily on strengthening the financial health of the District and \nenhancing the performance of governmental institutions that affect the \nDistrict.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of the board of directors and \nstaff be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Board of Directors\n\n     Daniel M.

Lowe, Program Associate\n     Sara Pollock, Program Associate\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is an outstanding board of directors \nwith a very able staff.\n  I believe the District of Columbia council and the Mayor have \nreferred\n\n[[Page S8003]]\n\nvery positively to this report. I myself will use it as a guideline as \nI take responsibility of this committee because there are many terrific \nsuggestions outlined here about this particular issue--about the proper \nauthority and power of the CFO.\n  It is important that the financial officer who is assuming much of \nthe responsibility of the Control Board be properly balanced between \nbeing responsive to the Mayor, the chief executive officer of this \ncity, if you will, and his responsibility to the public generally to \ngive independent, accurate, and timely financial information so we can \ncontinue on this road to reform. This report will serve as great \nguidance, and it will be the subject of much of our discussion.\n  Second, as I said in a public meeting last week with the Mayor and \nwith Delegate Norton, I agree with them on the structural changes that \nthe District needs to come to grips with that are necessary to provide \nlong-term financial health and prosperity for the District. There are, \nindeed, some real problems, some structural flaws and some structural \ndeficits that are preventing the city from gathering the tax base and \nthe revenue base necessary to support such a strong and vibrant \ncommunity. That will be subject to some of our focus.\n  In addition, I assure all who look to the District of our continuing \npush for modernization, streamlining operations of the District, and \nreform of regulatory operations so that we minimize regulation and \nmaximize good results for everyone who lives and works here. That is \nimportant.\n  I commend the Mayor for his extraordinary vision about what the \nschools can be and should be in the District of Columbia. We have this \nchallenge everywhere around the Nation--every city, large and small, \nevery community, particularly a community with the large population of \ncitizens who may be under the poverty line; where citizens who may be \nat some disadvantage economically and are struggling with how to create \nvibrant, well-run and well-managed schools; where teachers are highly \nmotivated, well paid, and highly skilled; where students are getting \nthe kind of nurturing and support they need as well as a place where \ntime-honed values are presented to children with the right combination \nof discipline and nurturing for them so they can grow, develop, and be \nall that God intended when he created them.\n  I share the Mayor's vision for strengthening of the schools. I look \nforward to working with the new initiatives on the development of \ncharter schools--with more flexibility and choice for parents and a \nstronger academic outcome. I commend him for the work he is doing.\n  Also, of great interest, not only to me but to many Members of the \nSenate, is the push for reforming the court system in the District. \nUnfortunately, we have had these problems everywhere in our Nation. \nThere have been some real breakdowns in our child welfare system. We \nhave let many children down. We have not always come to their rescue \nwhen they have cried. We have sometimes left children languishing in \nfoster care. We have taken their only parent they knew away from them, \nand then failed to provide them with another one.\n  The system in the United States has caused a lot of pain and a lot of \ngrief. We have not supported our courts and our social workers and our \nfront line staffers the way we need to around this Nation. It is no \ndifferent here in the District.\n  So I am going to work very closely with Senator DeWine, the father of \neight children, who is a great leader for child welfare on the other \nside of the aisle, and with Delegate Norton and Congressman DeLay, who \nare very focused on this issue, to modernize and strengthen the courts, \nto create a family- and child-centered court system so we stop letting \nchildren fall through the cracks.\n  I read in a book recently that when we say, oh, well, the children \njust fall through the cracks, actually that is not true because there \nare no real cracks for children to fall through. What they fall through \nare our fingers. They fall through our hands, hands that once held \nthem. They have fallen through. So it is our responsibility to make \nsure the court system at every level and the child welfare system at \nevery level, as much as we can, are strengthened in the District.\n  Finally, in terms of issues, because of the great support and \nfeedback I have gotten from a wide variety of people--elected leaders, \nas well as friends and neighbors of mine as a resident here in the \nDistrict, and actually living on Capitol Hill--I believe in the \nimportance of the recreational opportunities for children of the \nDistrict, to enhance those recreational opportunities to be \ncommensurate with the surrounding suburbs. In the State of Maryland and \nin the State of Virginia, there are outstanding facilities where \nchildren of those States are able to participate in first-class and \nworld-class sports and recreational activities. I think that is very \nimportant for the children and families of this District. We want them \nto have the same kinds of opportunities that children have in this \nregion and across the Nation.\n  I am pleased that the National Soccer Association, the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce--a broad bipartisan group of citizens around this city--are \nrallying to the cause of creating this kind of atmosphere that is not \nonly important to children and families, but it is important to the \nbusiness community. It gives children something to say yes to.\n  I think, as adults, we have a responsibility to not just say no to \nthem but to give them some things to say yes to, such as outdoor \nactivities and recreation and team sports that build character and keep \nchildren occupied at very positive activities.\n  So with those issues I just outlined, I want to conclude by simply \nexpressing, again, my support for the concept of home rule, but also to \nrecognize my role as the Chair of this subcommittee, to say that every \ncitizen in our Nation--every citizen, from every walk of life--has a \nspecial interest in the District of Columbia. This city has to \nfunction, obviously, and be responsive to the residents who live here--\nthe approximately 500,000 residents--but this District has a special \nresponsibility.\n  Unlike any other city--unlike New York or Philadelphia or New Orleans \nor San Francisco or Chicago, or smaller communities around the Nation--\nthis city has a particular responsibility to every citizen of the \nNation because every citizen of this Nation looks to this city as the \nCapital. It is part of our democratic heritage that we share as a \nnation of citizens. So I will be trying to represent the interests of \nthose citizens in this debate as much as my ability will allow.\n  Finally, in my role as chair, I also see responsibility to the \nFederal Government as an employer. We are the largest employer in this \nDistrict. In relation to large employers anywhere--whether it is Boeing \nin Seattle or another large employer in another city somewhere in \nAmerica--the Federal Government employs more people in the District of \nColumbia directly and indirectly, by far, than any other employer.\n  As an employer, we have an inherent interest in the financial \nmanagement of the city that we are in about its daily operations, and \nwe have standing in those discussions. So there is a balance between \nhome rule and the Federal Government's proper and legitimate \nexpressions, as the largest employer in this city, of how this \ncommunity should operate and how it should function.\n  Then, thirdly, there is a place at the table for the citizens in \nevery State and community about the District. I hope to be able to \nbalance those three truths as carefully as I can as chair.\n  I want to say one more thing about large employers. If Boeing is \ndissatisfied with the way the city of Seattle was being run, they have \ntremendous leverage. They can basically pick up and move their \noperations. We have seen large corporations use that leverage many \ntimes. We have seen employers pick up literally 10,000, 15,000 \nemployees, and move out of a city to another place. They vote with \ntheir feet. If they do not like the way things are run, they have that \nopportunity, and employers everywhere exercise that option.\n  But I will point out, for this discussion, the Federal Government, as \nan employer, does not truly have that option. We cannot move the \nCapital. Some Senators have tried, but the Capital is here, and it is \ngoing to stay here. We cannot move the central operation of this \nNation.\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\n  So while I would not want to use the word ``hostage'' in the wrong \nway, we are subject to not have the same leverage that other large \nemployers have. So in the role as chair of this committee, I take on \nextra responsibility to try to communicate, in as constructive a way as \npossible, the views of the Federal Government as an employer. \nParticularly in the areas of public safety and transportation, our \nemployees who work in the District, who are employed by the Federal \nGovernment, have a legitimate standing in those debates.\n  So let me say, in closing, that I look forward to working with many \nof my colleagues. Senator Byrd, himself, the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, served for 7 years in the capacity as chair of this \ncommittee. I cannot say at this date that I will serve as chair for 7 \nyears--for as long as Senator Byrd served--but I can promise you, it \nwill be no less than 4 years. If I can make it 7, I may try, because it \nis a lot of responsibility and it is a lot of work.\n  But I come to this chair at a time of great promise for this city, \nand with a great leadership team to work with, the Mayor and the city \ncouncil, and who are poised for reform, some men and women who have \nliterally given blood, sweat, and tears to lift this District to a \nplace that holds great promise for not only the residents who live \nhere, including every single child who lives here today, but for \nfamilies everywhere.\n  So I am looking forward to that with great anticipation and great \nenthusiasm and will, again, focus on these important issues.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8004-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8004-S8008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today we are considering the conference \nreport on H.R. 2216, the Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2001.\n  My colleague, Senator Stevens, is momentarily off the floor. He has \nsome constituents. He understands that we are beginning our discussions \nand has indicated his willingness for me to proceed. But he will come \nto the floor shortly and have some things to say also about the \nconference report.\n  On June 1, 2001, President Bush asked Congress to consider a \nsupplemental request for $6.5 billion primarily for the Department of \nDefense. The conference report the Senate will adopt later today totals \n$6.5 billion--not one dime above the President's request.\n  The conference report contains no emergency designations. The \nPresident has said he will not support such emergency designations, so \nthe conferees have not included any emergency designations in this \nbill. Unrequested items in the bill are offset.\n  The conference report is the product of the hard work and cooperation \nof all of the conferees, especially Senator Stevens, ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee in the Senate, and Chairman Bill Young, \nthe House Appropriations Committee chairman, and the ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee in the House of Representatives, David \nObey.\n  I cannot say enough about the cooperation of my friend and colleague, \nthe former chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate and \nnow the ranking member, Ted Stevens. The word really isn't \n``cooperation.'' It is better than that. It is ``leadership''--\nleadership on the part of Senator Ted Stevens. Ted Stevens has been \nexemplary in his cooperation and support as we have crafted this \nconference report, as we have crafted this agreement in a bipartisan \nand collegial way.\n  The distinguished ranking member is on the floor now. As I indicated \nearlier, ``cooperation'' is not really the word. There is a better word \nthan that. The word is ``leadership.'' I compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, on his leadership in crafting this \nagreement.\n  It was not an easy task to craft an agreement that had no emergency \ndesignation, that offset all unrequested items, an agreement which \nconformed to Senate rule XXVIII and was not one dime over the \nPresident's request. I thank all of the conferees for their \ncooperation.\n  The conference report includes a number of offsets to pay for \nunrequested items, and Members should know--and perhaps be reminded--\nthat with passage of the bill, we are at the statutory cap for budget \nauthority in fiscal year 2001.\n  H.R. 2216 funds the President's defense request for a net increase of \n$5.5 billion, including $1.6 billion for defense health care, $515 \nmillion for military pay and benefits, $3.25 billion for increased \nmilitary readiness, including the high costs of natural gas and other \nutilities, for increased military flying hours, and for other purposes. \nThe conference report also includes $278 million for defense-related \nprograms of the Department of Energy.\n  While the conferees have approved the President's request for the \nDepartment of Defense, I stress the importance of accountability for \nthese and future funds. Financial accountability remains one of the \nweakest links in the Defense Department's budget process. This is no \ncriticism of the Secretary of Defense. He is a new man on the job. He \nhas been there before, but he inherited this. It is an accumulation \nover years and years.\n  Recently, the General Accounting Office reported that, of $1.1 \nbillion earmarked for military spare parts in the fiscal year 1999 \nsupplemental, only about $88 million could be tracked to the purchase \nof spare parts. The remaining $1 billion--or 92 percent of the \nappropriation--was transferred to operations and maintenance accounts, \nwhere the tracking process broke down. We must do better in making sure \nthese dollars that are requested for spare parts go where they are \nintended.\n  The conference report includes report language requiring the \nSecretary of Defense to follow the money and to provide Congress with a \ncomplete accounting of all supplemental funds that are appropriated for \nspare parts. I am gratified that the administration recognizes this \nproblem and included $100 million for strengthening the DOD financial \nmanagement systems in their recent budget amendment for fiscal year \n2002.\n  The conference report provides $300 million for the Low Income Energy \nAssistance Program, an increase of $150 million above the President's \nrequest, to help our citizens cope with high energy costs. The \nconference agreement also includes $161 million for grants to local \neducation agencies under the Education for the Disadvantaged Program in \nresponse to the most recent poverty and expenditure data. Also provided \nis $100 million as an initial U.S. contribution to a global trust fund \nto combat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n  A special request was made to me by our leader on this side of the \naisle, Mr. Daschle. In conformity with his request, I worked to have \n$100 million included for that purpose, and it is here in this \nconference report. In addition, $92 million requested by the President \nfor the Coast Guard is included, as is $115.8 million requested for the \nTreasury Department for the cost of processing and mailing out the tax \nrebate checks.\n  The conference report includes $3 million for the Department of \nAgriculture for inspection and enforcement activities to protect and \npromote humane treatment of animals.\n  The American people are becoming increasingly sensitive to the \ntreatment of animals. In the past few weeks, in the local papers here \nin Washington--the Washington Post and the Washington Times--I have \nread reports of animals being processed while still alive--processed \nfor food products while still alive. They were not adequately stunned; \nthey could still feel pain. So we are trying to do something about that \non appropriations. The American people are becoming sensitive to it. \nReports of cruelty to animals through improper livestock production and \nslaughter practices have hit a nerve with the American people. So this \nprovision attempts to address their growing concern. Additional \ninspectors are being provided by moneys\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\nthat were added in our committee--the $3 million added for additional \ninspectors to enforce the laws that are already on the books. We expect \nthose laws to be enforced.\n\n  The bill includes authority to make payments during fiscal year 2001 \nfrom the radiation exposure trust fund to provide compensation to the \nvictims of radiation exposure for individuals who were involved in the \nmining of uranium ore and those who were downwind from nuclear weapons \ntests during the cold war. These victims have waited for too long for \nthis, and I compliment the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and \nSenator Ted Stevens for their insistence upon a proper response by the \nCongress, by the Government, to the needs of these people who have been \npromised assistance.\n  The conference agreement includes critical disaster assistance \nthrough the Corps of Engineers and the Departments of Agriculture, \nInterior, Transportation, and Defense in response to recent flooding, \nice storms, earthquakes, and other natural disasters across the Nation. \nThese are the kinds of items, certainly, that are eligible to be called \nemergencies. These are acts of God--not the acts of man but the acts of \nGod--and they ought to be designated emergencies. That is what they \nare. They are unforeseen and they are very costly--many times in human \nlives. There has to be help, and there is a certain area of assistance \nwhen these disasters come that can only be supplied by the Federal \nGovernment. They cost all of the people. So there are times when there \nmust be items in appropriations bills that are properly designated as \nemergencies. But even so, we don't have any emergencies in this bill; \nno items are designated emergency. There was $473 million in the House \nbill designated as emergencies but not in this conference agreement. We \nhelped the House to find offsets for these items.\n  I am particularly pleased that this supplemental bill does include \ndisaster assistance in response to recent floods in West Virginia. \nDuring the weekend of July 7 and 8, communities in eight southern West \nVirginia counties were ravaged by torrential floodwaters. Entire towns \nwere buried in mud. For many families, this latest flood came just \nweeks after cleanup efforts were completed from heavy rains in May that \nprompted a Federal disaster declaration. In this latest round of \ndevastating flooding, more than 3,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, \nand the severe impact on the infrastructure in the southern part of my \nState--from roads, bridges, water and sewer, to power sources--has \nbrought a normal way of life to a screeching halt.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture funding of $8 million is provided \nin the supplemental to remove debris and obstruction from waterways and \nto protect property. Additionally, $8 million is provided in the \nsupplemental for the Corps of Engineers to assist in the recovery \neffort. FEMA estimates that its costs of cleanup and recovery in West \nVirginia will be at least $180 million. FEMA funding is available \nthrough existing appropriations, and the committee has included $2 \nbillion for FEMA in the fiscal year 2002 VA-HUD appropriations bill. We \ndid that yesterday in our Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  I am very appreciative and grateful for the cooperation my colleagues \nhave demonstrated with regard to the funding that has been added, which \nwill accelerate the pace of recovery in West Virginia. West Virginia is \nnot the only State that has been hurt in this regard. But true to the \nnature and character of the people of West Virginia, West Virginians \nimmediately began to reclaim their communities. I have seen this happen \ntime after time after time over the long years in which I have served \nin the Senate--the mud, the muck, the misery that accompanies these \nsudden storms. West Virginia is prone to these things because we have \nthese steep mountains that run up suddenly from the deep hollows, which \nlend themselves to these sudden storms and floods.\n  This aid will help to repair the state's injured infrastructure and \nclear the debris that has clogged our waterways.\n  The conference agreement does not include additional funding for FEMA \ndisaster relief or Forest Service firefighting programs. On July 17, \n2001, OMB Director Mitch Daniels sent the Appropriations Committee a \nletter which indicates that the Administration believes that these \nprograms have adequate funding through the end of this fiscal year. We \nwill closely monitor this situation and if there is need for additional \nresources, we will address those needs in the fiscal year 2002 \nappropriations bills, which as I say we already began yesterday. We \nbegan addressing many of these needs that exist in several States by \nincluding $2 billion for FEMA.\n  In its June 19, 2001 Statement of Administration Policy on House \naction on the supplemental, the Administration states that, ``emergency \nsupplemental appropriations should be limited to extremely rare \nevents.'' So I say again and again and again, this conference agreement \ncontains no emergency designations. I do believe that it is appropriate \nfor Congress and the President to use the emergency authority from time \nto time in response to natural disasters and other truly unforseen \nevents. How rare such events may be, is up to a power greater than the \nCongress or the White House. There is such a power.\n  Mr. President, during debate on the recent tax-cut bill, I argued \nthat the tax cuts contained in that bill could return the Federal \nbudget to the deficit ditch. I stressed that the tax cuts were based on \nhighly suspect 10-year surplus estimates and that if those estimates \nproved illusory, the tax-cut bill would result in spending the Medicare \nsurplus.\n  While we are confronted with this problem, we on the Appropriations \nCommittee are very sensitive to it. We are very sensitive to it. We are \ntrying to be responsible. We are trying to be responsive to the needs \nof the country, and I think the action by the conferees, and \nparticularly by this Senate and more especially by our committee, has \nindicated that we know how to be responsive and we know how to be \nresponsible.\n  I thank my colleagues. Again, I thank the benign hand of destiny for \nallowing me to work with a Senator of the stature of Ted Stevens. This \nis not the first time I have said things like this, and it ought not be \nthe last time, either.\n  I have been on the committee 43 years. This is my 43rd year. No \nSenator in history has ever served on the Appropriations Committee 43 \nyears, other than I. I have seen chairmen come and I have seen them go \nand, in the main, they have all been good chairmen.\n  When we are in a time such as this when we have to scrimp and save \nand hold on to every penny, as it were, and I find myself chairman of \nthe committee, I would be an ungrateful wretch if I did not thank my \ncolleague, Senator Stevens, and the other members of the committee on \nboth sides of the aisle for my good fortune.\n  I thank them for my good fortune in having them on board that \ncommittee at a time when responsibility of being chairman devolves upon \nme.\n  Again, I say this bill has not one thin dime--not one thin dime, not \none Indian head copper penny--above the President's request; not one \npenny, not one thin Indian head copper penny above the President's \nrequest. Do you hear me down there at the other end of the avenue? We \nare not one thin dime above the White House request.\n  I think that is something to ponder upon. This bill is within the \nstatutory spending limits. It is a responsible bill. I urge Members to \nsupport it.\n  We had planned to have this matter before the Senate on Monday, but \nthe administration has indicated its need for action on this bill \ntoday. Senator Stevens has responded. He is here at his post of duty. \nWe are working with the leaders on both sides of the aisle who also \nhave implored us to move on this, and we are doing that.\n  Mr. President, I shall shortly turn to my colleague Senator Stevens, \nbut first, we are moving just a little bit ahead of calling up the \nconference report. Let me do that now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 2216, the supplemental appropriations bill; \nthat once Senator Stevens has concluded his remarks, the conference \nreport be adopted; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\n  The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. \n     2216, having met, after full and free conference, have agreed \n     to recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by all conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nJuly 19, 2001.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I certainly commend our chairman, Senator \nByrd, for taking the action he has taken and the leadership of the \nSenate, Senator Daschle in particular. We did have an urgent plea from \nthe military that we act today on this bill rather than wait for \nMonday. We have responded to that request. It is a supplemental. It is \nprimarily concerned with Defense appropriations, and it is vitally \nneeded. We hope these supplementals will not be long needed, as Senator \nByrd has indicated.\n  If we plan our bills properly and they are executed properly by the \nexecutive branch of our Government, we would not have requests for \nsupplementals unless because of an act of God or because of an \nunforeseen event we were called upon to provide additional moneys for \nthe current fiscal year. This is money for this current fiscal year.\n  Because of the practices of the past, moneys have been diverted from \nthe operation and maintenance account. We tried to account for those. \nIt has not really been possible to account for them as much as we would \nlike. Senator Byrd has indicated we want greater specificity of how the \nmoney is spent, particularly from the supplemental, so we can determine \nwhether they are needed in the future.\n  This one, I am confident, is needed. If Members of the Senate will \nremember the long delays in the last part of last year and the basic \nproblem of utilizing some of the moneys from the O account, as I \nindicated for peacekeeping and other matters, we have gotten into the \nhabit by the time we reach the fourth quarter of the fiscal year of the \nDepartment of Defense needing more money.\n  We hope we are addressing that situation in the bill for 2002 so that \nwill not happen. I join Senator Byrd in saying we do not look forward \nto holding the Senate up on Friday afternoons dealing with a \nsupplemental unless it truly is for an emergency or for an unforeseen \nsituation. This is not that bill. This is a supplemental because enough \nmoney was not provided for the Department of Defense for the current \nfiscal year. These moneys are necessary.\n\n  I do believe this conference report meets the needs as defined by the \nPresident in the submission he made in a request for supplemental. It \nwas an urgent defense supplemental but not an emergency bill that we \nreceived. As Senator Byrd said, there is no emergency money in this \nbill. No account required emergency spending. It provides additional \nresources for critical readiness and for quality of life and medical \nprograms.\n  At the end of the last Congress, we passed two bills, one dealing \nwith health care and another dealing with pay affecting the Department \nof Defense. In order to fund those, they had to take money out of the \nfirst three quarters of this calendar year and use it for the programs, \nmeaning the other programs, particularly the readiness programs which \nare involved in the steaming hours, the flying hours, the use of tanks \nin the field, the maneuvers. These cost money. This bill is to fund \nthose. That is why it was urgent we finish this bill today.\n  However, there are other priorities, some of which Senator Byrd has \nmentioned. He mentioned the radiation compensation. I point out also \nthere is money for the new problems that have come up with regard to \nthe Salt Lake City Olympics, for the defense nuclear programs. I \ncommend Senator Byrd particularly for calling to the attention of the \ncommittee the President's request for additional money to respond to \nthe international AIDS crisis. There is money here. That is a \nlegitimate supplemental request. It may even come under the heading of \nbeing an emergency one of these days. It is a near world emergency. At \nleast we have jumped the gun and made moneys available now, which the \nPresident actually requested for 2002, and the President has indicated \nan appreciation of that action, and I am sure he will be pleased to \nsign this bill.\n  We have started off under a new management. A slight revolution went \non here and we changed positions, but this bill demonstrates we can \nwork together in a bipartisan fashion. I think the supplemental \nconference we had with our friends in the House, the chairman of the \nHouse committee, Congressman Bill Young, and the ranking member, \nCongressman Obey, had probably the best--there is no other word for it \nthan ambience, the best feeling I have had in a long time. We all \nrealized we had a lot to do in a short time to do it. We are behind the \ncurve as far as our bills are concerned. This bill came through \nconference between the House and Senate in record time.\n  It does represent a lot of things. As Senator Byrd mentioned, there \nare some things for his State, there are a couple things that affect my \nState. I will point that out.\n  Over the Fourth of July recess, I went home and examined the area and \ntalked to the Forest Service about that area of our State where a \ncontrolled fire got out of control, a fire on Forest Service lands that \nactually had gone into the beetle kill area. We have an enormous amount \nof our forests in Alaska that have already been killed by beetles. This \nfire left the Federal lands and swooped into an area that already had \nbeen planned for scheduled harvest of timber from State lands. We had \nprovided for that. It is not emergency money, but it is money to assist \nthe Forest Service to deal with the Kenai Spruce Bark Beetle Task \nForce, allowing them to respond to the wildfires that are taking place \nnow in Alaska due to this problem, the enormous fire in the kill area \nwhere the beetles have killed so many of our trees.\n  It also has a provision to allow funds that we \npreviously appropriated for the State of Alaska to construct a seed \nlaboratory in Palmer, our agricultural area. The law had to be changed \nso that those funds could be used. The money was made available, but \nthere was a defect in the previous law. It makes permanent a provision \nthat Congress has included in previous bills recognizing those tribes \nin our State of Alaska that are entitled to tribal priority \nallocations, and also makes some corrections regarding legislation \npreviously funded, when there were banned inadvertently 11 of our crab \nvessels from participating in our fishing operations.\n\n  When we handled these, we were able to make technical changes in the \nlaw, enabling previously appropriated funds to be used as we intended \nthem to be used. There are several of those technical corrections in \nthis bill that affect my State. Again, I express my appreciation to \nSenator Byrd and other members of the committee for being willing to \naddress those and to allow making these small changes that are \nnecessary so these funds already appropriated for this year can be used \nthis year. That is why the provisions are in this bill.\n  Mr. President, the Supplemental Appropriations conference report \ncontains two provisions that are very important to the North Pacific \nfishing industry. The first provision makes changes to the American \nFisheries Act to ensure that U.S. lenders may continue to offer \nfinancing to fishermen and fishing companies after October 1, 2001. The \nsecond provision makes changes to a fishing vessel capacity reduction \nprogram to ensure that all vessels which meet the standards set by the \nNorth Pacific Fishery Management Council may participate in the Bering \nSea crab fisheries.\n  The American Fisheries Act, AFA, helped ``Americanize'' the domestic \nfisheries by requiring that U.S. fishing vessels be 75 percent owned \nand controlled by U.S. citizens at all tiers of ownership and in the \naggregate. The AFA also limits the class of lenders that may hold a \npreferred mortgage on a fishing vessel to ``fisheries citizens'' who \nmeet the 75 percent standard,\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\nstate- or federally-chartered financial institutions which meet the \ncontrolling interest (51 percent) requirement in section 2(b) of the \nShipping Act of 1916, or lenders using a mortgage trustee which \nqualifies as a fisheries citizen. These standards apply to the more \nthan 36,000 U.S. fishing vessels in our domestic fleets. The Maritime \nAdministration's implementing regulations give special scrutiny to \nvessels 100 feet in length or greater.\n  Since these regulations were promulgated, Congress has been told that \nmost large lenders cannot prove that they are U.S. citizens under \nMarad's rules. Proof can only be made through an examination of \nshareholder records, which is a practical impossibility for widely-held \ncompanies. Shares in these lending institutions are traded thousands of \ntimes a day, and are often held by mutual funds on behalf of the real \nequity owners. The same proof problems have discouraged financial \ninstitutions from acting as mortgage trustees.\n  Section 2202(a) moves the provisions defining a mortgage trustee from \nChapter 121 of title 46, which deals with vessel documentation, to \nchapter 313, which deals with vessel mortgages. This will prevent the \nloss of a fishery endorsement by a vessel if that vessel's mortgage \ntrustee falls out of compliance with the statute.\n  Section 2202(b) expands the class of lenders eligible to hold a \npreferred mortgage to include state- or federally-chartered financial \ninstitutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, farm \ncredit lenders, specific banks created under state law, and eligible \ncommercial lenders. This provision more accurately reflects the types \nof lenders currently making loans to the fishing industry.\n  Section 2202(c) expands the class of eligible mortgage trustees to \ninclude any entity eligible to hold a preferred mortgage directly, \nprovided that it also meets other requirements. Marad will specifically \nanalyze the trust arrangements of beneficiaries which are not \ncommercial lenders, or are not eligible to hold preferred mortgages \ndirectly.\n  Section 2202(d) delays the effective date of these changes until 2003 \nto give Marad time to develop new regulations. I strongly encourage \nMarad to promulgate draft regulations by March 1, 2002, and final \nregulations not less than 180 days later, so that Congress may review \nthe new rules before they take effect. Additionally, Congress's \nsignificant concern over foreign control of fishing vessels that led to \nthe AFA has not lessened since it was enacted in 1998. In promulgating \nnew rules that take into account the specific legislative changes made \nby this provision, Marad should also take every step necessary to \nensure that foreign capital is neither impermissibly invested in nor \ncontrolling our fisheries.\n  Finally, Section 2202(e) addresses commerce treaties between the \nUnited States and certain foreign countries. After consultation with \nthe State Department, Marad recently determined that these treaties \nexempt foreign ownership of U.S. fishing vessels from the AFA's 75 \npercent U.S. ownership standards. Section 213(g) of the AFA as enacted \nwould exempt additional foreign investments made between now and \nOctober 1, 2001. This provision closes that window, and freezes the \nforeign ownership at today's levels.\n  The other provision in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, section \n2201, corrects an interpretation of law that inadvertently disqualified \nseveral vessels from the crab fisheries. This provision restores the \neligibility of those permit holders which used the fishing history from \nmultiple vessels to meet the qualifying periods agreed to by the North \nPacific Council.\n  My last comment is that we have expressed a desire from our majority \nleader that we try to move nine bills before the August recess. That is \n2 weeks away. I am committed to try and work with Senator Byrd and \nother Members to achieve that goal. I think it is important to do it, \nif possible.\n  The fact this is a fair and balanced agreement and one that has come \nout of our committees on a bipartisan basis is a harbinger of good \nthings ahead. I hope we can work on the other bills the way we have on \nthis one and demonstrate our commitment to catch up on the \nappropriations process and deliver on the request of the majority \nleader: that we report out and get to conference prior to the time we \nleave for the August recess the nine bills that have been outlined by \nthe chairman.\n  Again, I am grateful and humbled by the comments of my friend from \nWest Virginia, having been my mentor for so many years. To have him \nmake the comments he did concerning me is a humbling matter. It is more \nthan a privilege to serve with Senator Byrd. It is really a great \nhonor. To be able to stand here now as the ranking Republican is \nsomething I wasn't sure would ever occur to me, just as I am not sure I \nwould become chairman, but I fervently hope some day I might become \nchairman again.\n  (Ms. STABENOW assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Upon his completing his statement, the Senate will have \nacted on this conference report.\n  Let me refer to some things I inadvertently overlooked. One is the \nsplendid staff work that was demonstrated in bringing this conference \nreport to the floor and bringing the meeting of the minds of conferees \nin both Houses, the meeting of the minds together. It was the most \nremarkable display of statecraft that I have seen in my service on \ncommittees in the Senate, the way our staffs worked.\n  The Senate appropriations staff on both sides is a class act, a class \nact.\n  I thank Terry Sauvain and Chuck Kieffer and Steve Cortese. These are \nremarkable men in the way they worked together and the way they worked \nin the House. I want to extend the same expressions of thanks and \nadmiration to the House staff, Jim Dyer and Scott Lily. It is \nremarkable. This is a real class act to watch. I also want to thank our \nranking members, Mr. Stevens and others on that side of the aisle, Thad \nCochran and the other Members on the Republican side of the aisle in \ncommittee. These are fine people to work with, never a hint of \npartisanship. None.\n  In closing, I also inadvertently omitted the name of Senator Bingaman \nwhen I spoke about the authority to make payments during fiscal year \n2001 from the reparation exposure trust fund.\n  I mentioned the leadership of Senator Stevens and Senator Domenici in \nthis area. I inadvertently overlooked the name of Senator Bingaman. He \nwas an original Senate sponsor of this effort. He is not on the \ncommittee, but he certainly attends to his duties and responsibilities \ntoward the people of New Mexico. In this instance they can be proud of \nhim, likewise.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair. My, ``how sweet it is,'' as \nJackie Gleason used to say, how sweet it is to serve with men and women \nlike we have on our Appropriations Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I thank Senator Byrd for his comments \nin honor of Terry Sauvain who is now staff director of the full \ncommittee. This is his first bill in that capacity. This demonstrates \nhis basic approach, and we are blessed by his presence and knowledge, \nthat he also has decided to proceed, as Senator Byrd and I have, on a \nbipartisan basis. He has been very gracious to all Members on our side. \nI thank Senator Byrd for commenting about Steve Cortese, a brilliant \nformer staff director, now staff director for the minority. He really \nis a key man in the Senate as far as I am concerned; and Andy Givens \nhere, working with me along with Lisa Sutherland; and I am pleased \nSenator Byrd mentioned Senator Thad Cochran, who is here, who was a \nmember of our conference and has really contributed greatly to the \noutcome of this bill.\n  It is my understanding when I yield the floor the bill will pass; is \nthat correct, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield. Forgive me for asking him to yield \none more time. In speaking of our ranking member, I must not overlook \nthe splendid work of the paradigm of patriotism that is constantly and \nconsistently and always and never-endingly shown by Danny Inouye, the \nranking member of our committee on this side of the aisle, and how \nfortunate we are to have, in this particular bill which deals mostly \nwith defense, how fortunate we are to have the guidance and the \nleadership of\n\n[[Page S8008]]\n\nthe chairman, Ted Stevens, and the ranking member, Danny Inouye of the \nDefense Appropriations Committee subcommittee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Turn that over. We have just changed seats.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. OK.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Chairman Inouye and Ranking Member Stevens.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct. But those two, Ted Stevens and \nDanny Inouye, are just like Ted Stevens and Robert Byrd. It really \ndoesn't make a difference. If it weren't for the fact that I am \nexpected, if I leave the Chair momentarily, to call on a Democrat, I \nwould just be as sure and as confident and secure if I turned it over \nto Ted Stevens. It would not make a bit of difference to me personally. \nI would say: Ted, I have to go out for a moment to see some \nconstituents. Would you take over?\n  We are fortunate, though, in having Ted Stevens and Danny as the two \nkey members on national defense, active at the helm in our development \nand managing of this supplemental. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was going to mention Senator Inouye because he \nmentioned to me earlier we ought to do something to try to see if we \ncan get this bill finished today. So we have met Senator Inouye's \nrequest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport?\n  If not, under the previous order, the conference report is agreed to. \nThe motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8008-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMPLIMENTING SENATOR STABENOW AND HER FRESHMEN COLLEAGUES\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I would not want this beautiful July \nafternoon to pass without my paying compliments to the Senator who is \npresiding over the Senate at this point. She presides with a dignity \nand bearing and manner and presence that are so rare as a day in June.\n  Just look at that smile. I have never seen a more beautiful smile \nthan that the Presiding Officer today constantly wears.\n  Walt Whitman said:\n\n       A man is a great thing upon the earth and throughout \n     eternity, but every jot of the greatness of man is unfolded \n     out of woman. . . .\n\n  How fortunate we are to have had a degree of presiding \nprofessionalism as we see in the new Members of this Senate as they are \ncalled upon to preside every day. It is a chore. They have to take \ntheir valuable time away from their office and desk where they may be \nreading letters from constituents, signing letters to constituents, \ndictating letters to constituents, or working in a hundred other ways \nevery day in the service of the Nation, the service of the people of \ntheir State. Yet they give their time to come here and preside.\n  This group of Presiding Officers in this new class of Senators is the \nbest overall group I have seen in my 43 years of service in the \nforemost upper body in the world today. This is a good example.\n  The Presiding Officer, Debbie Stabenow from Michigan, is not reading \na magazine. She is not sitting up there reading the newspapers. She is \nnot sitting up there signing mail. There used to be a telephone up \nthere. When I became majority leader, I yanked that telephone out so \npeople who are presiding cannot sit there and talk on the telephone. I \nurge all new Members when they sit up there and preside to pay \nattention to the Senate. Please don't be signing your mail up there. \nPlease don't be reading a magazine. Please don't be reading newspapers. \nBe alert to what is being done on the Senate floor.\n  It is a suggestion that goes over very well at first, but then so \nmany times I have noticed they lapse into the same old habit of reading \nand signing their mail. It just kind of makes my spirit fall. But I do \nnot see these new Senators doing that. They do not bring their mail up \nthere. They sit there, very alert. And when they ask for order, they \nget it.\n  I will have more to say about this on Monday, I promise you. But I \njust couldn't let this occasion pass or this fleeting moment go by \nwithout complimenting the Senator from Michigan, Debbie Stabenow, who \nsets a fine example as a Senator and as a Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment intends to restore a lost \ncapability to assess the effects of science and technology on our \nCongressional policymaking process.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator proposing to restart the former Office of \nTechnology Assessment?\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am not proposing to restart Office of Technology \nAssessment (or OTA). But, I feel that today we lack the analytical \ninsight of its technology assessment process.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How is the Senator proposing that these funds be used?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am proposing a one year pilot program to utilize \ntechnology assessment methodology to analyze current science and \ntechnology issues affecting our Congress. I am proposing to implement \nthis by contracting with outside non-profit agencies such as the \nNational Academy of Sciences. My intent was for the Congressional \nResearch Service to manage this activity as I feel they are better \nsuited to conduct and oversee this type of long term research activity. \nIn doing so. I was hoping that oversight would be provided by the \nSenate Rules and House Administration Committees and through these \nCommittees, the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Who is the Senator now proposing to manage this activity?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It has been suggested that the General Accounting \nOffice can better serve this function. I feel that the General \nAccounting Office may not be suited for such a long term research \nactivity. The GAO is investigative in nature. However, it is better to \nstart an initial pilot program utilizing the OTA technology assessment \nmethod rather than no pilot program at all. So, I offer this amendment \nto use the General Accounting Office. But, I ask the Chairman that \nduring conference, serious consideration be given to my request of \nhaving the Congressional Research Service manage this pilot program.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How will the initial studies be chosen for the pilot \nprogram and how will it be reported?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The General Accounting Office should submit a listing \nof Congressionally relevant technology assessment studies to its \noversight committees, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and \nthe House Committee on Government Reform. From this list, two projects \nshould be chosen, one by each Committee no later than October 31st, \n2001. The technology assessment studies should then begin with a report \ngiven to both Committees, and the House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, no later than June 15, 2002. At that time the decision can \nbe made as to whether this technology assessment process was beneficial \nenough to continue it a second year. If this pilot program is to \ncontinue, I recommend that the funding be executed using the Office of \nTechnology Assessment authorization language. Rather than OTA's 200 \nperson, $20 million budget, the organization would be a small \nlegislative branch staff using outside non-profit groups to perform the \nin-depth research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8009-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8009-S8010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ACCESS TO VA HEALTH CARE IN WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, as chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I want to share with my colleagues some of the \nconcerns voiced by veterans at a recent field hearing in my state of \nWest Virginia.\n  On July 16, the Committee held a hearing in Huntington, West \nVirginia, to examine the challenges facing veterans from rural areas \nwho receive health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \nCommittee held its last West Virginia field hearing on access to rural \nVA health care in 1993. Since then, profound changes in VA's health \ncare delivery--a rapid increase in community clinics, eligibility \nreform that opened the system to more veterans, and the reorganization \nof VA into 22 service networks--have affected how veterans access basic \nand specialized medical care.\n  The challenges that face VA in providing the best health care \npossible to our Nation's veterans are often magnified in rural areas, \nwhere veterans and VA caregivers must stretch already limited resources \nover long distances. West Virginia contends with a unique situation: \neach of our four VA medical centers belongs to a different VA service \nnetwork. While this partitioning creates problems for West Virginians, \nit also offers the Committee the opportunity to study in microcosm the \nproblems facing veterans throughout the VA health care system.\n  Regrettably, many of the problems discussed at the 1993 field hearing \nremain with us: the struggles with an inadequate budget, long waiting \ntimes for care, too few VA personnel to provide specialized care, \ninsufficient long-term care services, and transportation problems for \nveterans traveling to or between VA medical centers. And, with the \naging of the veterans population and continued absence of meaningful \nprescription drug coverage under Medicare, veterans' concerns about \naccess to, and copayments for, prescription drugs grow even more \npressing.\n  It will not be easy to solve these problems; after the President's \nrecent tax cut, there is simply not enough money available--either in \nthe President's budget or the Budget Resolution adopted by the \nCongress--for veterans' health care. That said, we must do our best to \nimprove access to rural health care with the resources that we have.\n  On July 16, West Virginia veterans talked to me about the obstacles \nthey face just to get an appointment at a VA health care facility, and \nthen in getting to that appointment for care. Veterans report to the \nState Veterans Coalition that they regularly wait months for an \nappointment for basic VA medical care--or even longer for a first \nvisit. After veterans have finally seen a doctor for a first exam, they \nmay wait weeks or months longer for a referral to needed specialty \ncare.\n  For veterans in rural areas, referrals frequently require a transfer \nto distant VA medical centers. After hours of driving, veterans may sit \nfor many more hours in a waiting room, without meals or a safe place to \nrest. A shocking number of veterans disabled by spinal cord injuries \nneglect basic medical checkups to avoid travel. One West Virginia \nveteran described making more than 30 round trips to the VA hospital at \nRichmond for tests based on a single referral; and his story, \nunfortunately, is not unique. This is not only inconvenient for the \nveteran, but a waste of VA resources.\n  VA must focus on coordination and management of care between \nfacilities--both to provide the best health care and to consider the \npractical needs of veterans. For veterans who must drive long distances \nor depend on van services, appointments could be scheduled to \naccommodate their traveling times. VA could coordinate tests to \ncompress them into the shortest time span possible, with lodging \narranged when an overnight stay is required. Veterans who served this \ncountry should not be expected to sleep in waiting room chairs and to \ngo hungry when simple attention to details can prevent excessive \ntraveling and long waits. At the very least, VA should have a \nsystemwide plan for communicating how transfers work, and what \nresources are available, to veterans and their families.\n  Although it is impossible to expect that every veteran in the \nNation's vast rural areas can access every health care service close to \nhome, it is essential that--should they require care at distant VA or \nprivate facilities--their transfers happen as simply and efficiently as \npossible. VA's network and hospital directors must eliminate barriers \nto coordinating and managing care between medical centers or between \nnetworks. I will continue to work with VA to find better ways to \ncommunicate with veterans and to make transfers as seamless as \npossible.\n  The Millennium Act, which VA has been shamefully slow to implement, \nwill provide veterans with access to noninstitutional long-term care \nservices. As I heard from the son of a World War II ex-prisoner of war, \nnow being cared for at home at his family's expense, aging veterans \nsuffering from PTSD need caregivers who understand the legacies of war-\ntime experiences. The Committee will continue to oversee VA's efforts \nto bring long-term care services--both nursing beds and \nnoninstitutional services--to the veterans who need it.\n  I have advocated the opening of community-based outpatient clinics, \nwhich bring basic primary health care closer to the veteran. These \noutpatient clinics are enormously important to veterans in rural areas, \nand I will continue to urge VA to make these clinics the best they can \npossibly be--without sacrificing the specialized programs at which VA \nhas excelled.\n  We have to count more than just the number of clinics and hospitals \nwhen\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\nwe talk about access to health care--we must consider waiting times for \nan appointment. Many of the delays in appointments, referrals, and \ntransfers that veterans experience stem from inadequate staffing, \nespecially the increasingly critical shortage of skilled nurses. I have \nrecently introduced legislation to improve VA's ability to recruit and \nretain nurses, whose skills are essential to providing high quality \nhealth care in a timely fashion.\n  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the \nefforts of the many volunteers who help bring rural veterans closer to \nhealth care. Disabled American Veterans (DAV) operates a nationwide \nTransportation Network that helps sick and disabled veterans reach VA \nmedical facilities for care. Since its inception, DAV volunteers in \nWest Virginia have dedicated more than 700,000 hours of time to driving \nveterans to medical appointments, often in vans donated by DAV to the \nVA. Nationally, DAV Hospital Service Coordinators operate 185 such \nprograms, where 8,000 volunteers donated almost 2 million hours last \nyear alone. Although this program does not replace VA's obligation to \nbring services close to the veteran where possible and to smooth \ntransfers between medical centers, this service is certainly \nindispensable to disabled veterans who must reach a VA medical center \nfor necessary medical care.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I look forward to working with VA and my \ncolleagues in the Senate to find the best ways to extend health care \nmore efficiently--and effectively--to veterans in our Nation's rural \nareas. We owe our veterans nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8010-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF THE SIXTH NAVAL BEACH BATTALION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the bravery \nand fortitude of the Sixth Naval Beach Battalion, many of whom gave \ntheir lives for their country on D-Day, June 6, 1944. Recently, a small \ngroup of the living members of the Battalion gathered in Normandy, \nFrance to unveil a commemorative plaque dedicated to their fellow \nsailors who paid the ultimate price for the defense of liberty. This \nmemorial will serve as a small reminder of the tremendous sacrifice \nthat these men made in order to secure the freedoms that we, as a \nnation, now enjoy.\n  Unfortunately, for many years, the Sixth Naval Beach Battalion was \nknown as the ``Forgotten Sailors.'' While many of its members were \nindividually recognized for their bravery, the Battalion as a whole had \nnever been recognized. However, thanks to the persistent efforts of its \nliving members, the Battalion was finally honored last year with the \nPresidential Unit Citation. This great honor was presented to the \nBattalion at its annual reunion last year, and I am proud that the \nvaliance of these men has finally been recognized.\n  The World War II generation is frequently referred to as America's \n``Greatest Generation,'' and this is no more true of the Sixth Naval \nBeach Battalion. They landed on Omaha Beach early in the morning of \nJune 6 and faced extraordinary peril on that historic day. Yet, the \nBattalion demonstrated its courage and fought gallantly despite \noverwhelming odds. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all of the \nmembers of the Battalion, both living and deceased, for the hard-fought \nvictory over tyranny that was achieved on that day.\n  I would like to share my gratitude for the bravery and selflessness \nof the Sixth Naval Beach Battalion. I would hope that America never \nforgets the great sacrifice that the Battalion's members made in the \ndefense of our liberty. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nspeech given by Lieutenant Commander Joseph Vaghi at the unveiling of \nthe commemorative plaque be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Dedication Address of the 6th Naval Beach Battalion Plaque at Omaha \n                        Beach--Normandy, France\n\n                 (By LCDR Joseph P. Vaghi, USNR (Ret.))\n\n       We are here today this 5th day of June 2001, to unveil a \n     plaque dedicated in memory of the men of the 6th Naval Beach \n     Battalion who gave their lives on D-Day, June 6, 1944.\n       A small remnant of living members of our Battalion is also \n     here today to pay tribute to their comrades, who have fallen \n     and paid the ultimate price by giving their lives.\n       Each and every person here for this unveiling shares in the \n     victory of freedom over tyranny by the selfless action which \n     took place 57 years ago on this sacred soil of Omaha Beach.\n       You will remember that for four long years the fate of \n     freedom flickered in the shadow of the world's aggressions.\n       We watched as the war in Europe spread across the English \n     Channel to Britain. Then came Pearl Harbor. We as a nation \n     were at war.\n       It was on these beaches of Normandy that the 6th Naval \n     Beach Battalion made its contribution in the fight for \n     liberty and against tyranny. This became the greatest \n     military operation in all of history.\n       The men of the 6th Naval Beach Battalion had great faith \n     that what was head of us was right and just. We knew what we \n     were doing had to be done.\n       It made little difference if we were 18 or 38 years of age. \n     We knew that what we were about to do was in some manner \n     exactly what God wanted us to do.\n       The men of the 6th Naval Beach Battalion prepared for D-Day \n     at Camp Bradford, VA., and Fort Pierce, FL., on the beaches \n     of Slapton Sands, England, and in training with the 5th \n     Engineer Special Brigade in Swansea, Wales.\n       At each step, we become more aware of the responsibility we \n     would be asked to assume as we landed on the shores of \n     France.\n       Elements of our battalion who were part of the Underwater \n     Demolition Team landed at H-Hour (6:30 in the morning) with \n     the main body of the battalion coming ashore an hour and five \n     minutes after H-Hour at 7:35 a.m.\n       Of the thousands of men who came ashore that day, 9386 are \n     at rest in the cemetery above the cliffs behind us.\n       This plaque we dedicate today is in memory of our comrades, \n     and in extension is in memory of all who were laid to rest in \n     the hallowed ground of the Normandy Cemetery. The plaque will \n     be a perpetual reminder of the sacrifices made here on this \n     beach, not only the 6th Naval Beach Battalion but the Coast \n     Guard and Army too.\n       Last year at the 12th annual reunion of our battalion we \n     were presented with the Presidential Unit Citation. It had \n     been recommended by the Joint Command of Operation Overlord, \n     which was the code name for the invasion of France, both the \n     Army and Navy issued approval and recommendations that the \n     6th Naval Beach Battalion be honored with the citation.\n       When inquiries were made by some of our men, the Defense \n     Department began looking into the situation and in September \n     of last year there followed a full ceremony for the \n     presentation of the award.\n       For 56 years we of the 6th Naval Beach Battalion were known \n     by writers as the ``Forgotten Sailors.'' Many of the officers \n     and men of the Battalion had been recognized for individual \n     heroism but not the Battalion as a unit.\n       Our being here today is the cap-stone of our reson d'etre, \n     the 6th Naval Beach Battalion stands with all the great body \n     of men who have been immortalized here on these beaches. \n     Permit me to close by quoting President Roosevelt, ``The \n     quality of our American fighting men is not all a matter of \n     training, or equipment, or organization. It is essentially a \n     matter of Spirit. That Spirit is expressed in their faith in \n     America!''\n       That was the faith we had then and the faith we have today. \n     Thank you, may God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8010-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 27, 1990 \nin Grand Chute, WI. Two policemen, from Marathon County and \nBlanchardville, were accused of disorderly conduct in the beating of a \ngay man. Witnesses said the officers, who were in a local nightclub, \nbegan taunting the victim on the dance floor with anti-gay slurs. \nWitnesses said they later saw the officers beat and kick the man in the \nparking lot. The victim was treated for bruised ribs and internal \ninjuries.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8010-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8010-S8011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\nhas reported another group of executive branch nominees and that the \nSenate will be acting on the President's nominations to head the Civil \nRights Division and the Tax Division of the Department of Justice so \npromptly.\n  Just as the committee proceeded promptly with the consideration of \nthe President's nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney General, \nwhen I temporarily chaired the committee in January, we are continuing \nto move promptly on other nominations this month. In January, the \nSenate did not receive the nomination of John Ashcroft until January 19 \nand reported it to the Senate the very next day. In deference to the \nPresident, the committee had moved ahead with hearings on the \nnomination the week of January 16 in advance of receiving the \nnomination by the President.\n  The Senate has confirmed the President's nominations of the Attorney \nGeneral, the Deputy Attorney General and a controversial nomination to \nserve as Solicitor General. The President has yet to nominate anyone to \nbe Associate Attorney General, the third highest ranking position at \nthe Department of Justice. We have confirmed nominees to serve as \nDeputy Attorneys General to head the Criminal Division, the Antitrust \nDivision, the Office of Legislative Affairs, and the Office of Legal \nPolicy.\n  In late May, Chairman Hatch conducted a hearing on the nomination of \nRalph F. Boyd, Jr., to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of \nthe Civil Rights Division. I had included Mr. Boyd's nomination on the \nagenda for a business meeting of the Judiciary Committee last week, our \nfirst week in session after the adoption of a Senate organizing \nresolution and the assignment of committee membership. But less than \nhalf of the Republican members of the committee showed up for the \nbusiness meeting on July 12. We were unable to reach a quorum last week \nto report out the President's nominations to the Justice Department. \nYesterday, at our next business meeting of the Judiciary Committee, we \nreported that nomination to the Senate.\n  It took the Senate the entire month of June to pass S. Res. 120, a \nsimple resolution reorganizing the committees. It was only last Tuesday \nthat assignments to committees were completed. Last Wednesday, the \nfirst day after the committee membership was set, we proceeded to hold \na confirmation hearing including additional an executive branch \nnominee, Eileen O'Connor to be Assistant Attorney General for the Tax \nDivision of the Department of Justice. Today the Senate has that \nnomination before it because we were able to expedite its consideration \nby the committee at our business meeting yesterday. I expect the Senate \nwill confirm Ms. O'Connor, another of the President's nominations to a \nkey post at the Department of Justice. I am glad to be able to \naccommodate the request of the Attorney General to expedite her \nconsideration.\n\n  This week the Judiciary Committee proceeded with back-to-back days of \nhearing on the important nominations of Asa Hutchinson to head the Drug \nEnforcement Administration and James Ziglar to head the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. I have noticed another hearing for next Tuesday \nfor judicial and executive branch nominees, including the President's \nnominees to be Assistant Attorney General to head the Office of Justice \nPrograms and to be the Director of the National Institute of Justice.\n  The Senate received the President's nomination of a new FBI Director \non Wednesday of this week and I proceeded that same day to notice \nhearings on that important nomination to begin a week from Monday. It \nis my hope that with the cooperation of all Members and the \nadministration we should be able to make progress and work toward \nSenate consideration of the nomination of Robert Mueller to be Director \nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation before the August recess, if \npossible. I have asked for the cooperation of all members of the \ncommittee, on both sides of the aisle. I noticed the hearings on Robert \nMueller's nomination to begin on July 30. We will see if it is possible \nfor the committee act on that nomination before the August recess, \nwhich would be my preference.\n  I regret that Senators and their staffs will have not have more time \nto prepare for so important a hearing as that on the nominee to be the \nnext Director of the FBI. It is my hope that the series of oversight \nhearings regarding the FBI in which we have been engaged, including our \nhearing this week, have helped and that Senators will be able to adhere \nto an expedited schedule for the hearing, a very brief turnaround time \nfor written follow up questions and immediate Committee consideration.\n  We have set an ambitious schedule of five confirmation hearings this \nmonth on the President's nominees. We have completed three of those \nconfirmation hearings and have another scheduled for each of the next \ntwo weeks. We have also reported a number of nominees, including the \nthree Judicial Branch and two Executive Branch nominees before the \nSenate for consideration today.\n  The nomination of Ralph Boyd, Jr., to head the Civil Rights Division \nwas reported unanimously and without objection by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Senator Kennedy, in particular, has been a strong and \nconsistent advocate for this nomination and I thank him for his \nefforts. This will be one of the least contentious paths for a nominee \nto head the Civil Rights Division in some time. Indeed, the Judiciary \nCommittee refused for the last three years of the Clinton \nadministration even to report to the Senate President Clinton's \nnomination to head the Civil Rights Division. The handling of this \nnomination and the treatment of the nominee by Members not from the \nPresident's party stand in sharp contrast to the treatment of Bill Lann \nLee.\n  I join with Senator Kennedy in urging the Senate to act favorably on \nthe nomination of Ralph Boyd, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8011-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JOHN D.

Madam President, I believe that it is our \nfamilies, friends and communities that create the very essence of our \nbeings. They serve as our roots, instilling the values that shape our \npersonal relationships and our professional careers.\n  In youth, we often fail to realize the crucial role that these people \nplay, and we often lose touch with the people who mold us into whom we \nare today. With the passage of time, we can only wonder what path we \nmight have otherwise taken had we maintained contact. Today, I would \nlike to join a very special group of West Virginians--the Montgomery \nHigh School class of 1951--as its members renew the bonds of youth in \ncelebrating the 50th anniversary class reunion.\n  As the members of Montgomery High School class of 1951 gather for \ntheir 50th anniversary reunion, they will recall the carefree days of \ntheir youth. Once again, they will refer to themselves as the \nGreyhounds of Montgomery High. Visions of victorious football games and \nsummer vacations will waft through their collective memory as they join \nin singing their beloved Alma Mater.\n  They'll reminisce about Saturday nights at the Rockette and spending \nafternoons with friends at Kelly's Drug Store. More importantly, they \nwill remember the diversity that makes Montgomery such a very special \nplace.\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\nCommunities such as Cannelton, Kimberly, Powellton, Smithers, and Deep \nWater joined together, creating a unique bond that remains today.\n  The Class of 1951 should be commended for renewing the bonds fostered \nmore than 50 years ago. In celebrating this occasion, its members \nremind us of the importance of community in our own lives.\n  In honor of Montgomery High School class of 1951, on the occasion of \nits 50th anniversary, I am reminded that ``between the lofty mountains \nwhere the great Kanawha flows, in a valley that is magic and the seed \nof wisdom grows. Hail Montgomery.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8012-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:42 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 2216) making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8012-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill, previously received from the House of \nRepresentatives for concurrence, was read the first and second times by \nunanimous consent, and placed on the calendar:\n\n       H.R. 2500.

A bill to reauthorize the Native American Housing Assistance \nand Self-Determination Act of 1996; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nInouye, Daschle, Johnson, and Burns in introducing a bill that \nreauthorizes the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act, NAHASDA, of 1996, P.L. 104-330. As many of my \ncolleagues know, NAHASDA promotes tribal self-determination and self-\nsufficiency as it builds upon the government-to-government relationship \nthat exists between Indian tribes and the Federal Government.\n  NAHASDA became effective on October 1, 1997 and provides a single, \nflexible block grant for tribes or tribally-designated housing \nentities, TDHE, to administer Federal housing assistance. Under this \nblock grant system, NAHASDA empowers tribes to determine local needs \nand authorizes tribal decision making when it comes to Indian housing \npolicy.\n  Before NAHASDA, the Federal Government dictated the planning, \nfinancing and building of Indian housing. Since NAHASDA's enactment, \ntribes are in the ``driver's seat,'' and have the right to make certain \ndecisions with regard to resource allocation; and also have the \nresponsibility to determine the needs of their members and to make \nevery effort to satisfy those needs.\n\n  In the past five years, NAHASDA has assisted tribes in making great \nstrides in the quality and quantity of housing provided to Indian and \nAlaska Native communities. In fact, HUD estimates that over 25,000 new \nunits of housing have been placed in Indian and Alaska Native \ncommunities under NAHASDA. This number is 10 times the maximum annual \nnumber of units provided for Indian communities under the previous \nIndian housing program.\n  Even with all the success of NAHASDA, Indian communities continue to \nlive in the worst housing conditions in the United States. In fact, \nIndian housing is often and justifiably compared to the conditions \npresent in Third World countries. Some of the startling statistics that \ncharacterize housing in Indian communities show that: 1 out of every 5 \nIndian homes lacks complete plumbing; 40 percent of homes on Indian \nlands are overcrowded and have serious physical deficiencies; and 69 \npercent of homes on Indian lands are severely overcrowded with up to 4 \nor 5 families living in the same two bedroom house.\n  These statistics illustrate that there is still much work to be done. \nNAHASDA has been a good first step in improving living conditions in \nIndian and Alaska Native communities, however there is still a \ntremendous need for adequate housing in these communities.\n  In the first few years of NAHASDA implementation, some bumps in the \nroad were experienced. To provide a better transition from the old HUD \ndominated regime to the new policies of NAHASDA, I introduced a bill to \nprovide technical amendments to strengthen and clarify NAHASDA. These \ntechnical amendments were necessary to ensure the proper implementation \nand enforcement of NAHASDA. With the recent enactment of the Native \nAmerican Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act Amendments of \n1999, P.L. 106-568, NAHASDA is better suited to meet its goals and \nresponsibilities.\n  The bill I am introducing today will extend NAHASDA for an additional \nfive years. With the groundwork now laid, both Indian tribes and HUD \nshould be able to provide improved housing assistance to Indian and \nAlaska Native communities.\n  Moreover, the extension of NAHASDA will encourage greater utilization \nof NAHASDA programs including its Title VI Loan Guarantee program, \ndesigned to aid tribes in leveraging federal funds in partnership with \nthe private sector.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I am committed to \nensuring that NAHASDA is implemented in a fair, efficient and \nproductive manner. It is my hope that the enactment of certain \ntechnical amendments in P.L. 106-568, and the reauthorization of \nNAHASDA will ensure improved housing assistance to all Indian and \nAlaska Native communities for years to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to establish \na program to ensure greater security for United States seaports, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Port and \nMaritime Security Act of 2001. This legislation is long overdue. It is \nneeded to facilitate future technological and advances and increases in \ninternational trade, and ensure that we have the sort of security \ncontrol necessary to ensure that our borders are protected from drug \nsmuggling, illegal aliens, trade fraud, threats of terrorism as well as \npotential threats to our ability to mobilize U.S. military force. I \nintroduced similar legislation in the last Congress, but time did not \nallow us to proceed any further with the legislative process. However, \nthis is just too important an issue to let it go by, and I intend to \nwork with Senator Graham, and others to try and craft a policy to help \nprotect our maritime borders.\n  The Department of Transportation recently conducted an evaluation of \nour marine transportation needs for the 21st Century. In September \n1999, then Transportation Secretary Slater issued a preliminary report \nof the Marine Transportation System, (MTS) Task Force--An Assessment of \nthe U.S. Marine Transportation System. The report reflected a highly \ncollaborative effort among public sector agencies, private sector \norganizations and other stakeholders in the MTS.\n  The report indicates that the United States has more than 1,000 \nchannels and 25,000 miles of inland, intracoastal, and coastal \nwaterways in the United States which serve over 300 ports, with more \nthan 3,700 terminals that handle passenger and cargo movements. These \nwaterways and ports link to 152,000 miles of railways, 460,000 miles of \nunderground pipelines and 45,000 miles of\n\n[[Page S8016]]\n\ninterstate highways. Annually, the U.S. marine transportation system \nmoves more than 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight, \nimports 3.3 billion tons of domestic oil, transports 134 million \npassengers by ferry, serves 78 million Americans engaged in \nrecreational boating, and hosts more than 5 million cruise ship \npassengers.\n  The MTS provides economic value, as waterborne cargo contributes more \nthan $742 billion to U.S. gross domestic product and creates employment \nfor more than 13 million citizens. While these figures reveal the \nmagnitude of our waterborne commerce, they don't reveal the spectacular \ngrowth of waterborne commerce, or the potential problems in coping with \nthis growth. It is estimated that the total volume of domestic and \ninternational trade is expected to double over the next twenty years. \nThe doubling of trade also brings up the troubling issue of how the \nU.S. is going to protect our maritime borders from crime, threats of \nterrorism, or even our ability to mobilize U.S. armed forces.\n  Security at our maritime borders is given substantially less Federal \nconsideration than airports or land borders. In the aviation industry, \nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is intimately involved in \nensuring that security measures are developed, implemented, and funded. \nThe FAA works with various Federal officials to assess threats direct \ntoward commercial aviation and to target various types of security \nmeasures as potential threats change. For example, during the Gulf War, \nairports were directed to ensure that no vehicles were parked within a \nset distance of the entrance to a terminal.\n  Currently, each air carrier, whether a U.S. carrier or foreign air \ncarrier, is required to submit a proposal on how it plans to meet its \nsecurity needs. Air carriers also are responsible for screening \npassengers and baggage in compliance with FAA regulations. The types of \nmachines used in airports are all approved, and in many instances paid \nfor by the FAA. The FAA uses its laboratories to check the machinery to \ndetermine if the equipment can detect explosives that are capable of \ndestroying commercial aircrafts. Clearly, we learned from the Pan Am \n103 disaster over Lockerbie, Scottland in 1988. Congress passed \nlegislation in 1990 ``the Aviation Security Improvement Act,'' which \nwas carefully considered by the Commerce Committee, to develop the \ntypes of measures I noted above. We also made sure that airports, the \nFAA, air carriers and law enforcement worked together to protect the \nflying public.\n  Following the crash of TWA flight 800 in 1996, we also leaped to \nspend money, when it was first thought to have been caused by a \nterrorist act. The FAA spent about $150 million on additional screening \nequipment, and we continue today to fund research and development for \nbetter, and more effective equipment. Finally, the FAA is responsible \nfor ensuring that background checks, employment records/criminal \nrecords, of security screeners and those with access to secured \nairports are carried out in an effective and thorough manner. The FAA, \nat the direction of Congress, is responsible for certifying screening \ncompanies, and has developed ways to better test screeners. This is all \ndone in the name of protecting the public. Seaports deserve no less \nconsideration.\n  At land borders, there is a similar investment in security by the \nFederal Government. In TEA-21, approved $140 million a year for five \nyears for the National Corridor Planning and Development and \nCoordinated Border Infrastructure Program. Eligible activities under \nthis program include improvements to existing transportation and \nsupporting infrastructure that facilitate cross-border vehicles and \ncargo movements; construction of highways and related safety \nenforcement facilities that facilitate movements related to \ninternational trade; operational improvements, including improvements \nrelating to electronic data intercharge and use of telecommunications, \nto expedite cross border vehicle and cargo movements; and planning, \ncoordination, design and location studies.\n  By way of contrast, at U.S. seaports, the Federal Government invests \nnothing in infrastructure, other than the human presence of the U.S. \nCoast Guard, U.S. Customs Service, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, and whatever equipment those agencies have to \naccomplish their mandates. Physical infrastructure is provided by \nstate-controlled port authorities, or by private sector marine terminal \noperators. There are no controls, or requirements in place, except for \ncertain standards promulgated by the Coast Guard for the protection of \ncruise ship passenger terminals. Essentially, where sea ports are \nconcerned, we have abrogated the Federal responsibility of border \ncontrol to the state and private sector.\n\n  I think that the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs Agency are doing an \noutstanding job, but they are outgunned. There is simply too much money \nin the illegal activities they are seeking to curtail or eradicate, and \nthere is too much traffic coming into, and out of the United States. \nFor instance, in the latest data available, 1999, we had more than 10 \nmillion TEU's imported into the United States. For the uninitiated, a \nTEU refers to a twenty-foot equivalent unit shipping container. By way \nof comparison, a regular truck measures 48-feet in length. So in \ntranslation, we imported close to 5 million truckloads of cargo. \nAccording to the Customs Service, seaports are able to inspect between \n1 percent and 2 percent of the containers, so in other words, a drug \nsmuggler has a 98 percent chance of gaining illegal entry.\n  It is amazing to think, that when you or I walk through an \ninternational airport we will walk through a metal detector, and our \nbags will be x-rayed, and Customs will interview us, and may check our \nbags. However, at a U.S. seaport you could import a 48 foot truck load \nof cargo, and have at least a 98 percent chance of not even being \ninspected. It just doesn't seem right.\n  For instance, in my own state, the Port of Charleston which is the \nfourth largest container port in the United States, just recently we \ngot our first unit even capable of x-raying intermodal shipping \ncontainers, and we have the temporary deployment of a canine unit. By \nway of comparison, the Dallas/Fort Worth is the fourth largest airport \nin the United States, it would be inconceivable that an airport of this \nmagnitude have just one single canine, and one piece of screening \nequipment. This is simply not sufficient.\n  The need for the evaluation of higher scrutiny of our system of \nseaport security came at the request of Senator Graham, and I would \nlike to commend him for his persistent efforts in addressing this \nissue. Senator Graham has had problems with security at some of the \nFlorida seaports, and although the state has taken some steps to \naddress the issue, there is a great need for considerable improvement. \nSenator Graham laudably convinced the President to appoint a \nCommission, designed similarly to the Aviation Security Commission, to \nreview security at U.S. seaports.\n  The Commission visited twelve major U.S. seaports, as well as two \nforeign ports. It compiled a record of countless hours of testimony and \nheard from, and reviewed the security practices of the shipping \nindustry. It also met with local law enforcement officials to discuss \nthe issues and their experiences as a result of seaport related crime.\n  For instance, the Commission found that the twelve U.S. seaports \naccounted for 56 percent of the number of cocaine seizures, 32 percent \nof the marijuana seizures, and 65 percent of heroin seizures in \ncommercial cargo shipments and vessels at all ports of entry \nnationwide. Yet, we have done relatively little, other than send in an \nundermanned contingency of Coast Guards and Customs officials to do \nwhatever they can.\n  Drugs are not the only criminal problem confronting U.S. seaports. \nFor example, alien smuggling has become increasingly lucrative \nenterprise. To illustrate, in August of 1999, INS officials found 132 \nChinese men hiding aboard a container ship docked in Savannah, GA. The \nINS district director was quoted as saying; ``This was a very \nsophisticated ring, and never in my 23 years with the INS have I seen \nanything as large or sophisticated''. According to a recent GAO report \non INS efforts on alien smuggling RPT-Number: B-283952, smuggling \ncollectively may earn as much as several billion dollars per year \nbringing in illegal aliens.\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\n  Another problem facing seaports is cargo theft. Cargo theft does not \nalways occur at seaports, but in many instances the theft has occurred \nbecause of knowledge of cargo contents. International shipping provides \naccess to a lot of information and a lot of cargo to many different \npeople along the course of its journey. We need to take steps to ensure \nthat we do not facilitate theft. Losses as a result of cargo theft have \nbeen estimated as high as $12 billion annually, and it has been \nreported to have increased by as much as 20 percent recently. The FBI \nhas become so concerned that it recently established a multi-district \ntask force, Operation Sudden Stop, to crack down on cargo crime.\n  The other issues facing seaport security may be less evident, but \npotentially of greater threat. As a Nation in general, we have been \nrelatively lucky to have been free of some of the terrorist threats \nthat have plagued other nations. However, we must not become \ncomplacent. U.S. seaports are extremely exposed. On a daily basis many \nseaports have cargo that could cause serious illness and death to \npotentially large populations of civilians living near seaports if \ntargeted by terrorism. Most of the population of the United States lies \nin proximity to our coastline.\n  The sheer magnitude of most seaports, their historical proximity to \nestablished population bases, the open nature of the facility, and the \nmassive quantities of hazardous cargoes being shipped through a port \ncould be extremely threatening to the large populations that live in \nareas surrounding our seaports. The same conditions in U.S. seaports, \nthat could expose us to threats from terrorism, could also be used to \ndisrupt our abilities to mobilize militarily. During the Persian Gulf \nWar, 95 percent of our military cargo was carried by sea. Disruption of \nsea service, could have resulted in a vastly different course of \nhistory. We need to ensure that it does not happen to any future \nmilitary contingencies.\n  As I mentioned before, our seaports are international borders, and \nconsequently we should treat them as such. However, I am realistic \nabout the possibilities for increasing seaport security, the realities \nof international trade, and the many functional differences inherent in \nthe different seaport localities. Seaports by their very nature, are \nopen and exposed to surrounding areas, and as such it will be \nimpossible to control all aspects of security, however, sensitive or \ncritical safety areas should be protected. I also understand that U.S. \nseaports have different security needs in form and scope. For instance, \na seaport in Alaska, that has very little international cargo does not \nneed the same degree of attention that a seaport in a major \nmetropolitan center, which imports and exports thousands of \ninternational shipments. However, the legislation we are introducing \ntoday will allow for public input and will consider local issues in the \nimplementation of new guidelines on port security, so as to address \nsuch details.\n  Substantively, the Port and Maritime Security Act establishes a \nmulti-pronged effort to address security needs at U.S. Seaports, and in \nsome cases formalizes existing practices that have proven effective. \nThe bill authorizes the Department of Transportation to establish a \ntask force on port security and to work with the private sector to \ndevelop solutions to address the need to initiate a system of security \nto protect our maritime borders.\n  The purpose of the task force is to implement the provisions of the \nact; to coordinate programs to enhance the security and safety of U.S. \nseaports; to provide long-term solutions for seaport safety issues; to \ncoordinate with local port security committees established by the Coast \nGuard to implement the provisions of the bill; and to ensure that the \npublic and local port security committees are kept informed about \nseaport security enhancement developments.\n  The bill requires the U.S. Coast Guard to establish local port \nsecurity committees at each U.S. seaport. The membership of these \ncommittees is to include representatives of the port authority, labor \norganizations, the private sector, and Federal, State, and local \ngovernment officials. These committees will be chaired by the U.S. \nCoast Guard's Captain-of-the-Port, and will be used to establish \nquarterly meetings with local law enforcement and attempt to coordinate \nsecurity and help facilitate law enforcement.\n  The bill also requires the Coast Guard to develop a system of \nproviding vulnerability assessments for U.S. seaports. After completion \nof the assessment, the seaport would be required to submit a security \nprogram to the Coast Guard for review and approval. The assessment \nshall be performed with the cooperation and assistance of local \nofficials, through local port security committees, and ensure the port \nis made aware of and participates in the analysis of security concerns. \nI continue to believe there is a need to perform background checks on \ntransportation workers in sensitive positions to reveal potential \nthreats to facilitate crime or terrorism. While the bill is silent on \nthis matter, we will continue our discussions with law enforcement and \ntransportation workers to develop a system that facilitates law \nenforcement but focusus more narrowly on those employees who have \naccess to sensitive information.\n  The bill authorizes MarAd to provide loan guarantees to help cover \nsome of the costs of port security infrastructure improvements, such as \ncameras and other monitoring equipment, fencing systems and other types \nof physical enhancements. The bill authorizes $8 million, annually for \nfour years, to cover costs, as defined by the Credit Reform Act, which \ncould guarantee up to $320 million in loans for security enhancements. \nThe bill also establishes a grant program to help cover some of the \nsame infrastructure costs. Additionally, the bill provides funds for \nthe U.S. Customs Service to purchase screening equipment and other \ntypes of non-intrusive detection equipment. We have to provide Customs \nwith the tools they need to help prevent further crime.\n  The bill requires a report to be attached on security and a revision \nof 1997 document entitled ``Port Security: A National Planning Guide.'' \nThe report and revised guide are to be submitted to Congress and are to \ninclude a description of activities undertaken under the Port and \nMaritime Security Act of 2001, in addition to analysis of the effect of \nthose activities on port security and preventing acts of terrorism and \ncrime.\n  The bill requires the Department of Transportation, to the extent \nfeasible, to coordinate reporting of seaport related crimes and to work \nwith state law enforcement officials to harmonize the reporting of data \non cargo theft and alternatively, the feasibility of utilizing private \ndata on cargo theft. Better data will be crucial in identifying the \nextent and location of criminal threats and will facilitate law \nenforcement efforts combating crime. The bill also requires the \nSecretaries of Agriculture, Treasury, and Transportation, as well as \nthe Attorney General to work together to establish shared dockside \ninspection facilities at seaports for federal and state agencies, and \nprovides $1 million, annually for four years, to carry out this \nsection. Currently there are some U.S. ports that do not have \ninspection space in the organic port area. It is crucial that \ninspections occur as close to the point of entry as possible.\n  The bill also establishes a program to train personnel involved in \nmaritime transportation and maritime security. A better prepared \nsecurity force will help enable us to more effectively combat potential \nthreats of crime and terrorism. The bill also requires the Customs \nService to improve reporting of imports at seaports to help ensure that \nCustoms will have adequate information in advance of having the entry \nof cargo, and to do so in a manner consistent with their plans for the \nAutomated Commercial Environmental ACE program.\n  Finally, the bill reauthorizes an extension of tonnage duties through \n2006, and makes the proceeds of these collections available to carry \nout the Port and Maritime Security Act. These fees currently are set at \ncertain levels, and are scheduled to be reduced in 2002. The \nlegislation reauthorizes and extends the current fee level for an \nadditional four years, but dedicates its use to enhancing our efforts \nto fight crime at U.S. seaports and to facilitating improved protection \nof our borders, as well as to enhance our efforts to ward off potential \nthreats of terrorism.\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Port and Maritime Security \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are 361 public seaports in the United States \n     which have a broad range of characteristics, and all of which \n     are an integral part of our Nation's commerce.\n       (2) United States seaports conduct over 95 percent of \n     United States overseas trade. Over the next 20 years, the \n     total volume of imported and exported goods at seaports is \n     expected to more than double.\n       (3) The variety of trade and commerce that are carried out \n     at seaports has greatly expanded. Bulk cargo, containerized \n     cargo, passenger cargo and tourism, intermodal transportation \n     systems, and complex domestic and international trade \n     relationships have significantly changed the nature, conduct, \n     and complexity of seaport commerce.\n       (4) The top 50 seaports in the United States account for \n     about 90 percent of all the cargo tonnage. Twenty-five United \n     States seaports account for 98 percent of all container \n     shipments. Cruise ships visiting foreign destinations embark \n     from 16 seaports.\n       (5) In the larger seaports, the activities can stretch \n     along a coast for many miles, including public roads within \n     their geographic boundaries. The facilities used to support \n     arriving and departing cargo are sometimes miles from the \n     coast.\n       (6) Seaports often are a major locus of Federal crime, \n     including drug trafficking, cargo theft, and smuggling of \n     contraband and aliens. The criminal conspiracies often \n     associated with these crimes can pose threats to the people \n     and critical infrastructures of seaport cities. Seaports that \n     accept international cargo have a higher risk of \n     international crimes like drug and alien smuggling and trade \n     fraud.\n       (7) Seaports are often very open and exposed and, by the \n     very nature of their role in promoting the free flow of \n     commerce, are susceptible to large scale terrorism that could \n     pose a threat to coastal, Great Lake, or riverain \n     populations. Seaport terrorism could pose a significant \n     threat to the ability of the United States to pursue its \n     national security objectives.\n       (8) United States seaports are international boundaries, \n     however, unlike United States airports and land borders, \n     United States seaports receive no Federal funds for security \n     infrastructure.\n       (9) Current inspection levels of containerized cargo are \n     insufficient to counter potential security risks. Technology \n     is currently not adequately deployed to allow for the non-\n     intrusive inspection of containerized cargo. Additional \n     promising technology is in the process of being developed \n     that could inspect cargo in a non-intrusive and timely \n     fashion.\n       (10) The burgeoning cruise ship industry poses a special \n     risk from a security perspective. The large number of United \n     States citizens sailing on international cruises provides an \n     attractive target to terrorists seeking to cause mass \n     casualties. Approximately 80 percent of cruise line \n     passengers are United States citizens and 20 percent are \n     aliens. Approximately 92 percent of crewmembers are aliens.\n       (11) Effective physical security and access control in \n     seaports is fundamental to deterring and preventing potential \n     threats to seaport operations, cargo shipments for smuggling \n     or theft or other cargo crimes.\n       (12) Securing entry points, open storage areas, and \n     warehouses throughout the seaport, controlling the movements \n     of trucks transporting cargo through the seaport, and \n     examining or inspecting containers, warehouses, and ships at \n     berth or in the harbor are all important requirements that \n     should be implemented.\n       (13) Identification procedures for arriving workers and \n     deterring and preventing internal conspiracies are \n     increasingly important.\n       (14) On April 27, 1999, the President established the \n     Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in United States \n     Seaports to undertake a comprehensive study of the nature and \n     extent of the problem of crime in our seaports, as well as \n     the ways in which governments at all levels are responding.\n       (15) The Commission has issued findings that indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Frequent crimes in seaports include drug smuggling, \n     illegal car exports, fraud (including Intellectual Property \n     Rights and other trade violations), and cargo theft.\n       (B) Data about crime in seaports have been very difficult \n     to collect.\n       (C) Internal conspiracies are an issue at many seaports, \n     and contribute to Federal crime.\n       (D) Intelligence and information sharing among law \n     enforcement agencies needs to be improved and coordinated at \n     many seaports.\n       (E) Many seaports do not have any idea about the threats \n     they face from crime, terrorism, and other security-related \n     activities because of a lack of credible threat information.\n       (F) A lack of minimum physical, procedural, and personnel \n     security standards at seaports and at terminals, warehouses, \n     trucking firms, and related facilities leaves many seaports \n     and seaport users vulnerable to theft, pilferage, and \n     unauthorized access by criminals.\n       (G) Access to seaports and operations within seaports is \n     often uncontrolled.\n       (H) Coordination and cooperation between law enforcement \n     agencies in the field is often fragmented.\n       (I) Meetings between law enforcement personnel, carriers, \n     and seaport authorities regarding security are not being held \n     routinely in the seaports. These meetings could increase \n     coordination and cooperation at the local level.\n       (J) Security-related equipment such as small boats, \n     cameras, and vessel tracking devices is lacking at many \n     seaports.\n       (K) Detection equipment such as large-scale x-ray machines \n     is lacking at many high-risk seaports.\n       (L) A lack of timely, accurate, and complete manifest \n     (including in-bond) and trade (entry, importer, etc.) data \n     negatively impacts law enforcement's ability to function \n     effectively.\n       (M) Criminal organizations are exploiting weak security in \n     seaports and related intermodal connections to commit a wide \n     range of cargo crimes. Levels of containerized cargo volumes \n     are forecasted to increase significantly, which will create \n     more opportunities for crime while lowering the statistical \n     risk of detection and interdiction.\n       (16) United States seaports are international boundaries \n     that--\n       (A) are particularly vulnerable to threats of drug \n     smuggling, illegal alien smuggling, cargo theft, illegal \n     entry of cargo and contraband;\n       (B) may present weaknesses in the ability of the United \n     States to realize its national security objectives; and\n       (C) may serve as a vector for terrorist attacks aimed at \n     the population of the United States.\n       (17) It is in the best interests of the United States--\n       (A) to be mindful that United States seaports are \n     international ports of entry and that the primary obligation \n     for the security of international ports of entry lies with \n     the Federal government;\n       (B) to be mindful of the need for the free flow of \n     interstate and foreign commerce and the need to ensure the \n     efficient movement of cargo in interstate and foreign \n     commerce;\n       (C) to increase United States seaport security by \n     establishing a better method of communication amongst law \n     enforcement officials responsible for seaport boundary, \n     security, and trade issues;\n       (D) to formulate guidance for the review of physical \n     seaport security, recognizing the different character and \n     nature of United States seaports;\n       (E) to provide financial incentives to help the States and \n     private sector to increase physical security of United States \n     seaports;\n       (F) to invest in long-term technology to facilitate the \n     private sector development of technology that will assist in \n     the non-intrusive timely detection of crime or potential \n     crime;\n       (G) to harmonize data collection on seaport-related and \n     other cargo theft, in order to address areas of potential \n     threat to safety and security;\n       (H) to create shared inspection facilities to help \n     facilitate the timely and efficient inspection of people and \n     cargo in United States seaports; and\n       (I) to improve Customs reporting procedures to enhance the \n     potential detection of crime in advance of arrival or \n     departure of cargoes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PORT SECURITY TASK FORCE.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a Port \n     Security Task Force--\n       (1) to help implement the provisions of this Act;\n       (2) to help coordinate programs to enhance the security and \n     safety of United States seaports;\n       (3) to help provide long-term solutions for seaport \n     security issues;\n       (4) to help coordinate the security operations of local \n     seaport security committees;\n       (5) to help ensure that the public and local seaport \n     security committees are kept informed about seaport security \n     enhancement developments;\n       (6) to help provide guidance for the conditions under which \n     loan guarantees and grants are made; and\n       (7) to consult with the Coast Guard and the Maritime \n     Administration in establishing port security program \n     guidance.\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) In general.--The Task Force shall include \n     representatives of the Coast Guard and the Maritime \n     Administration.\n       (2) Other agencies.--The Secretary shall consult with the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to invite the participation of the \n     United States Customs Service, and may invite the \n     participation of other departments and agencies of the United \n     States with an interest in port security, port security-\n     related matters, and border protection issues.\n       (3) Required private sector representatives.--The Task \n     Force shall include representatives, appointed by the \n     Secretary of--\n       (A) port authorities;\n       (B) coastwise management units;\n       (C) longshore labor organizations;\n       (D) ocean shipping companies;\n       (E) trucking companies;\n       (F) railroad companies;\n       (G) transportation workers;\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\n       (H) ocean shippers;\n       (I) freight forwarding companies; and\n       (J) other representatives whose participation the Secretary \n     deems beneficial.\n       (c) Subcommittees.--The Task Force may establish \n     subcommittees to facilitate consideration of specific issues, \n     including port security border protection and maritime domain \n     awareness issues.\n       (d) Law Enforcement Subcommittee.--The Task Force shall \n     establish a subcommittee comprised of Federal, State, and \n     local government law enforcement agencies to address port \n     security issues, including resource commitments and law \n     enforcement sensitive matters.\n       (e) Exemption from FACA.--The Federal Advisory Committee \n     Act (5 U.S.C.

COAST GUARD PORT SECURITY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in \n     consultation with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the \n     Center for Civil Force Protection, and other appropriate \n     public and private sector organizations, shall develop \n     standards and procedures for conducting seaport security \n     vulnerability assessments.\n       (b) Initial Schedule.--The Coast Guard, in cooperation with \n     local port authority committee officials with proper security \n     clearances, shall complete no fewer than 10 seaport security \n     vulnerability assessments annually, until it has completed \n     such assessments for the 50 ports determined by the \n     Commandant to be the most strategic or economically strategic \n     ports in the United States. If a seaport security \n     vulnerability assessment has been conducted within 5 years by \n     or on behalf of a port authority or marine terminal \n     authority, and the Commandant determines that it was \n     conducted in a manner that is generally consistent with the \n     standards and procedures developed under subsection (a), the \n     Commandant may accept that assessment rather than conducting \n     another seaport security vulnerability assessment for that \n     port.\n       (c) Review by Port Authority.--The Commandant shall make \n     the seaport security vulnerability assessment for a seaport \n     available for review and comment by officials of the port \n     authority with proper security clearances or marine terminal \n     operator representatives with proper security clearances.\n       (d) Maps and Charts.--\n       (1) Collection and distribution.--The Commandant and the \n     Administrator shall, working through local seaport security \n     committees where appropriate--\n       (A) collect, store securely, and maintain maps and charts \n     of all United States seaports that clearly indicate the \n     location of infrastructure and overt-security equipment;\n       (B) make those maps and charts available upon request, on a \n     secure and confidential basis, to--\n       (i) the Maritime Administration;\n       (ii) the United States Coast Guard;\n       (iii) the United States Customs Service;\n       (iv) the Department of Defense;\n       (v) the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and\n       (vi) the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n       (2) Other Agencies.--The Coast Guard and the Maritime \n     Administration shall establish a process for providing \n     relevant maps and charts collected under paragraph (1), and \n     other relevant material, available, on a secure and \n     confidential basis, to appropriate Federal, State, and local \n     government agencies, and seaport authorities, for the purpose \n     of obtaining the comments of those agencies before completing \n     a seaport vulnerability assessment for each such seaport.\n       (3) Secure storage and limited access.--The Coast Guard and \n     the Maritime Administration shall establish procedures that \n     ensure that maps, charts, and other material made available \n     to Federal, State, and local government agencies, seaport \n     authorities, and local seaport security committees are \n     maintained in a secure and confidential manner and that \n     access thereto is limited appropriately.\n       (e) Annual Status Report to Congress.--Notwithstanding \n     section 7(c) of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (33 U.S.C. \n     1226(c)), the Coast Guard and the Maritime Administration \n     shall report annually to the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on the status \n     of seaport security in a form that does not compromise, or \n     present a threat to the disclosure of security-sensitive \n     information about, the seaport security vulnerability \n     assessments conducted under this Act. The report may include \n     recommendations for further improvements in seaport security \n     measures and for any additional enforcement measures \n     necessary to ensure compliance with the seaport security plan \n     requirements of this Act.\n       (f) Funding.--Of the amounts made available under section \n     17(b) there shall be made available to the Commandant \n     $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2006 \n     without further appropriation to carry out this section, such \n     sums to remain available until expended.\n\n     SEC. 6. MARITIME TRANSPORTATION SECURITY PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Commandant and the Administrator shall \n     jointly initiate a rulemaking proceeding to prescribe \n     regulations to protect the public from threats originating \n     from vessels in maritime transportation originating or \n     terminating in a United States seaport against an act of \n     crime or terrorism. In prescribing a regulation under this \n     subsection, the Commandant and the Administrator shall--\n       (1) consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     Attorney General, the heads of other departments, agencies, \n     and instrumentalities of the United States Government, State \n     and local authorities, and the Task Force; and\n       (2) consider whether a proposed regulation is consistent \n     with--\n       (A) protecting the public; and\n       (B) the public interest in promoting maritime \n     transportation and commerce.\n       (b) Security Programs.--\n       (1) Program to be established.--Each port authority and \n     marine terminal authority for an area designated under \n     section 4(a)(2) at which a port security vulnerability \n     assessment has been conducted under this Act shall establish \n     a maritime transportation security program within 1 year \n     after the assessment is completed.\n       (2) General requirements.--A security program established \n     under paragraph (1) shall provide a law enforcement program \n     and capability at that seaport that is adequate to ensure the \n     safety of the public from threats of crime and terrorism.\n       (3) Specific requirements.--A security program established \n     under paragraph (1) shall be linked to the Captain-of-the-\n     Port authorities for maritime trade and shall include--\n       (A) provisions for establishing and maintaining physical \n     security for seaport areas and approaches;\n       (B) provisions for establishing and maintaining procedural \n     security for processing passengers, cargo, and crewmembers, \n     and personnel security for the employment of individuals and \n     service providers;\n       (C) a credentialing process to limit access to sensitive \n     areas;\n       (D) a process to restrict vehicular access to seaport areas \n     and facilities;\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\n       (E) restrictions on carrying firearms and other prohibited \n     weapons; and\n       (F) a private security officer certification program, or \n     provisions for using the services of qualified State, local, \n     and private law enforcement personnel.\n       (c) Incorporation of Marine Terminal Operator's Program.--\n     Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (b)(3), the \n     Captain-of-the-Port may approve a security program of a port \n     authority, or an amendment to an existing program, that \n     incorporates a security program of a marine terminal operator \n     tenant with access to a secured area of the seaport, if the \n     program or amendment incorporates--\n       (1) the measures the tenant will use, within the tenant's \n     leased areas or areas designated for the tenant's exclusive \n     use under an agreement with the port authority, to carry out \n     the security requirements imposed by the Commandant and the \n     Administration on the port authority; and\n       (2) the methods the port authority will use to monitor and \n     audit the tenant's compliance with the security requirements.\n       (d) Incorporation of Other Security Programs and Laws.--\n     Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (b)(3), the \n     Captain-of-the-Port may approve a security program of a port \n     authority, or an existing program, that incorporates a State \n     or local security program, policy, or law.

A bill to provide for the acquisition, construction, and \nimprovement of child care facilities or equipment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from \nOhio, Senator DeWine, in introducing the Child Care Facilities \nFinancing Act. We are also joined by Senator Snowe, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Roberts, Senator Johnson, Senator Edwards, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Collins, Senator Wellstone, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nMurray as original cosponsors.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 13 million \nchildren under age 6 and 31 million children between the ages of 6 and \n17 have both parents or their only parent in the work force.\n  The demand for quality child care is exploding. But the supply of \ncare has not kept pace, particularly in low-income communities where \ndemand has been stimulated by a strong economy and employment \nrequirements under welfare reform.\n  Studies show that the supply of home-based and center-based child \ncare is far more abundant in affluent areas than in low-income areas. \nMoreover, despite increased child care spending by states and the \nexpansion of Head Start, physical space continues to remain scarce or \nunaffordable in low-income communities.\n  Existing child care programs in too many low-income neighborhoods are \ncrammed into inadequate, temporary quarters, leaky church basements, \napartments, and other locations that were never designed for this \npurpose. Between the overall shortage of child care and inadequate \nexisting facilities, parents have limited choices among inferior \nquality care, at times unsafe care for children.\n  The United States has carried out the most extensive systematic, and \nrigorous research on investing in early education and child care \nprograms. This research has shown that brain development is fastest \nduring a child's earliest years.\n  We know that quality child care can significantly assist in preparing \nchildren for school. The shortage in the supply of quality child care \ntoo often translates to inferior quality care for children.\n  One of the contributing factors to the child care shortage is the \ndifficulty that would-be providers face in financing child care \nfacility development. Financial institutions often view child care \nproviders as high risks for loans.\n  In low-income neighborhoods, child care providers face severely \nrestricted revenues and low real estate values. In urban areas, would-\nbe child care providers must contend with buildings in poor physical \ncondition and high property costs.\n  In all areas, reimbursement rates for child care subsidies are \ngenerally too low to cover the recovery cost of purchasing or \ndeveloping facilities, especially after allowing for the cost of \nrunning the program. In addition, new providers often have no business \ntraining, and may need to learn how to manage their finances and \nbusiness.\n  The Child Care Facilities Financing Act would provide grants to \nintermediary organizations, enabling them to provide financial and \ntechnical assistance to existing or new child care providers--\nincluding both center-based and home-based child care.\n\n  The financial assistance may be in the form of loans, grants, \ninvestments, or other assistance, allowing for flexibility depending on \nthe situation of the child care provider. The assistance may be used \nfor acquisition, construction, or renovation of child care facilities \nor equipment. It may also be used for improving child care management \nand business practices.\n  Grant funds under our legislation are required to be matched 50-50, \nfurther enhancing local capacity by leveraging\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\nFederal funding and creating valuable public/private partnerships. The \nadded benefit in providing this kind of assistance is that it will spur \nfurther community and economic development by building local \npartnerships.\n  Reducing parental anxiety about child care means that parents can \nbecome more reliable and productive workers. An evaluation of \nCalifornia's welfare-to-work program found that mothers participating \nin the program were twice as likely to drop out during the first year \nif they expressed dissatisfaction with the child care provider or \nfacility they were using.\n  Let me share with you an example from my state of Connecticut. In the \nHill neighborhood of New Haven, one of the most underserved areas of \nthe city, there are more than 2,500 children under the age of five, but \njust 200 licensed child care spaces, including family care.\n  LULAC Head Start has been serving the Hill neighborhood since 1983, \noperating a part-day, early childhood program out of a cramped and \npoorly lit church basement. This basement program could no longer be \nlicensed by the state and recently closed. The 54 children being served \nwere moved to another location which is overcrowded.\n  Thanks to a collaboration between the Hill Development Corporation, \nLULAC Head Start and the New Haven Child Development Program, low-\nincome families in the Hill community will have more access to \naffordable and high-quality child care services.\n  A new facility, the Hill Parent Child Center, is under construction \nand will provide multicultural child care, school readiness, and Head \nStart services for 172 low-income children in New Haven.\n  Fortunately for this Hill Community, Connecticut has a new child care \nfinancing program. Connecticut multi-Cities Local Initiatives Support \nCorporation and the National Child Care Initiative joined forces with \nthe State of Connecticut to design a program to finance the development \nof child care facilities.\n  Unfortunately, there are many more children in New Haven and other \nparts of Connecticut as well as across the Nation who sill need child \ncare. Sadly, most States do not have a child care financing system in \nplace.\n  We should do all we can to ensure that safe, affordable, quality \nchild care is available for more families, particularly low-income \nfamilies, so that we can truly leave no child behind. When the economic \nsituation of families improve, distressed communities become \nrevitalized.\n  Expanding the supply of quality child care is an important step in \ninvesting in the needs of families with young children.\n  I hope that you will join with Senator DeWine and me in supporting \nthis legislation to ensure that parents have as many choices as \npossible in selecting child care while they work. It is hard enough for \nlow-income families to make ends meet without the additional anxiety of \npoor choices of care for their children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a brief summary of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                The Child Care Facilities Financing Act\n\n\n                              the problem\n\n       Many low-income communities face a severe shortage of child \n     care and equipment.\n       Child care providers in low-income areas often lack the \n     access to capital and management expertise to expand the \n     capacity and the quality of their programs.\n       A lack of affordable child care threatens the ability of \n     low-income parents to find and maintain stable employment.\n       Quality child care can really make a difference in a \n     child's ability to start school ready to learn.\n\n\n                              the solution\n\n       The Child Care Facilities Financing Act authorizes $50 \n     million annually to fund grants to non-profit intermediaries \n     to enhance the ability of home- and center-based child care \n     providers to serve their communities. Funds will be used to \n     provide:\n       Financial assistance by intermediaries, in the form of \n     loans, grants, and interest subsidies, for the acquisition, \n     construction, or improvement of facilities for home- and \n     center-based child care and technical assistance to improve \n     business management and entrepreneurial skills to ensure \n     long-term viability of child care providers.\n       The Child Care Facilities Financing Act requires that the \n     federal investment be matched, dollar for dollar, by funds \n     from the private sector, stimulating valuable public/private \n     partnerships.\n\n\n                       building on a proven model\n\n       The Child Care Facilities Financing Act draws from the \n     community development model--using small, seed-money \n     investments to leverage existing community resources.\n       Tested in communities across the nation, this approach has \n     been proven to be successful in expanding child care \n     capacity:\n       In New Haven, Connecticut, the Local Initiatives Support \n     Corporation (LISC) established the Community Investment \n     Collaborative for Kids--closing on $3.6 million in public-\n     private financing to construct a new 10 room, 171 child Head \n     Start and child care center on a vacant lot in a low-income \n     neighborhood.\n       The Ohio Community Development Finance Fund offers stable \n     resources for planning, technical assistance and funding for \n     the development of expanded quality child care space. It \n     leverages $26.11 for every $1.00 in public funding and has \n     touched the lives of over 13,000 Ohio children. Wonder World, \n     an urban child car center in Akron, Ohio, was operating in a \n     dingy and poorly lit space of an old church. Despite these \n     conditions the center had a waiting list. With help from the \n     Ohio Community Development Finance Fund, a new eight room \n     child care facility was constructed serving approximately 200 \n     children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8023-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1028.

Madam President, this is the end of the week. I thank my \ncolleagues for the effort that has been made to get as much \naccomplished as we were able to achieve. We passed the energy and water \nappropriations bill. We passed the legislative branch appropriations \nbill. We just now passed the supplemental appropriations conference \nreport. We appointed conferees to the bankruptcy reform legislation. We \nconfirmed 23 nominations, including 3 judicial nominees this week. And \nwe began consideration of the Transportation appropriations bill.\n  While I wish we could have gone further with regard to our work on \nthe Transportation bill, I am pleased that as a result of a bipartisan \neffort to achieve this success at the end of the week I think we have \naccomplished a good deal.\n  I thank the distinguished Republican leader for his efforts in \nallowing this kind of accomplishment to be noted. I appreciate very \nmuch the hard work of the Appropriations Committee and the \nappropriations subcommittees that were very involved in the work of \nthis week; that of Senator Domenici, the ranking member of the energy \nand water appropriations subcommittee, and Senator Reid in particular \nfor his outstanding leadership in bringing about the successful \nconclusion of his bill. Senator Durbin has done an outstanding job with \nhis legislative branch appropriations bill.\n  As my colleague just noted, so much work went into the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I am very pleased that Senator Byrd and Senator \nStevens once again were able to complete their work as expeditiously as \nthey did. I was contacted earlier today by the Vice President who asked \nif we could move this bill today. It was originally my intention to \nhold the bill over the weekend in order to give Senators more of a \nchance to examine the results. The bill was just presented to us this \nmorning. But in order to accommodate a request by the administration, \nwe chose to take up the bill, given the fact that no one had made a \nrequest for a rollcall vote. I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation in not asking for a rollcall on this particular bill so we \ncould move it ahead to accommodate the administration's request.\n  I am also very pleased with the success we have had in confirming 23 \nadditional nominations; as I said, including 3 judicial nominees. That \nmeans that in the last 2 weeks we have now confirmed 77 nominations. I \ndon't know what kind of a record that is, but it has to be one of the \nlargest numbers of appointments confirmed in the shortest period of \ntime. And we will continue to work at achieving just as impressive \nresults in the coming weeks.\n  Madam President, we have had a good week. I look forward to a very \nsuccessful week again next week working on, first, the Transportation \nappropriations bill, and, secondly, other available appropriations \nbills, in addition, of course, to other nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/20/senate-section/article/S8031-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JULY 23, 2001\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.
