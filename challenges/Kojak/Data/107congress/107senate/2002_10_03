Mr. President, this morning's inspirational invocation was \ndelivered by the Rev. Cecil Perry from Oak Hill, WV. I am pleased and \nproud to announce today, October 3, is the Reverend Mr. Perry's 85th \nbirthday.\n  I am also pleased and proud to point out that more than 50 years \nago--as a matter of fact, it was more than 60 years ago--Mr. Perry and \nI worked together as meat cutters in the New River Company Store near \nBeckley, WV. Our careers took us on different paths. Mine became a \ncareer in public service. Mr. Perry became a coal miner. That is a very \nhonorable title, a ``coal miner.'' The man who raised me was a coal \nminer. My wife's father was a coal miner. My wife's brother-in-law\n\n[[Page S9862]]\n\ndied of silicosis pneumoconiosis, which he contracted through working \nin the coal mines. His father was killed by a slate fall in a coal \nmine. So the coal miners have a great heritage of which they can be \nproud.\n  After attending the Appalachian Bible Institute, the Reverend Mr. \nPerry was ordained in 1957 as a Baptist minister. For the next 40 \nyears, he preached the word of God throughout southern West Virginia.\n  The Senate chaplain's office, at my request, invited Mr. Perry to \ncome to the Nation's Capital and deliver the Senate prayer for us \ntoday. I am pleased the Reverend Mr. Perry brought with him his \nwonderful family, including his son David Perry, who is a delegate in \nthe West Virginia State legislature, and also his daughter Nancy James. \nAccompanying them are Cecil Perry's 4 grandchildren and 12 great \ngrandchildren. I am glad the family has come to Washington and is \nvisiting the U.S. Capitol. I trust they will return to the hills of our \nbeloved West Virginia rewarded and informed by their visit here.\n  The Scriptures say: ``Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy \nof double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine''--\n1 Timothy 5:17.\n  The Reverend Mr. Perry has ``ruled well.'' He has ``labor[ed] in the \nword and doctrine.'' He is ``worthy of double honor.''\n  I am delighted, as a Senator from West Virginia, in having this good \nman visit the Senate today, and I thank him for helping us to begin our \nday with his eloquent and uplifting words which were not written but \ncame from the heart. Happy Birthday, Mr. Perry.\n\n     Last night, I passed beside the blacksmith's door\n     And heard the anvil ring the vesper chime\n     And looking in I saw upon the floor\n     Old hammers, worn with beating years of time\n\n     ``How many anvils have you had'', said I\n     ``To wear and batter all these hammers so?''\n     ``Only one,'' the blacksmith said, with twinkling eye.\n     ``The anvil wears the hammers out, you know.''\n\n     And so, the Bible, anvil of God's Word\n     For centuries, skeptic blows have beat upon\n     And though the noise of falling blows was heard,\n     The anvil is unharmed--the hammers, gone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9862-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are considering the conference report \non the Department of Justice Authorization Act. I would like to \nhighlight a few matters in that bill that I believe are important to \njustice in America.\n  I serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee and have wrestled with a \nnumber of these issues, both as a Federal prosecutor and as a member of \nthe committee. I think there are some good things in the bill, and I \nwould like to make a few points that I think are important.\n  One thing I know the chairman is interested in and has been a leader \nin supporting is the Coverdell forensic science legislation, named for \nformer Senator Coverdell of Georgia, who is now deceased. I know that \nSenator Miller, the Acting President pro tempore, has been instrumental \nand helpful in making this bill a reality.\n  The reason it is important is this. Throughout our entire criminal \njustice system, it is my view that delay is hurting justice in America. \nCases take far longer than necessary to reach a conclusion, and justice \ndelayed is justice denied. When a criminal is caught in a significant \ndrug case, dealing drugs or some other offense, and time goes by, month \nafter month after month, and that person is released on bail, back in \nthe community amongst maybe his friends and criminal element and others \nwho are looking to see if anything is going to happen to the person who \ngot caught burglarizing an automobile or home or selling drugs, and a \nyear or more goes by and nothing happens--that is a problem. It \nundermines respect for law. It undermines the integrity of the criminal \njustice system. It is not right.\n  We had in my State recently the worst murder in the history of \nAlabama. No one can think of a more serious one. Six people were \nmurdered. The individual who murdered those people had been out on bail \nand was out on bail at that time because the chemical analysis on the \ndrugs he had sold had not yet come back from the State laboratory.\n  As a professional prosecutor for most of my life, nearly 15 years, I \nwould say to you that on a regular basis in courts all over America, a \ndelay in getting fingerprints, ballistics, drug analysis, and DNA is \nslowing down justice. It is allowing criminals to stay free. It is \nallowing people to remain under a cloud who might be found innocent \nwhen an analysis comes back. It is not a good situation. We need to \nhighlight that, and the Coverdell bill provides States support for \nState laboratories to encourage them to get caught up and stay where \nthey ought to be.\n  In my view, if it takes no more than a few hours to do a laboratory \nanalysis on a powder to find out if it is cocaine, why can't we get it \nback in a matter of days? I think our goal in America should not be \nweeks, it should not be months, but it should be days when these \nreports come back. It does not take more time, and it does not really \ncost more money to have a chemical analysis done today rather than \nwaiting 6 months to do that chemical analysis. So I would just say that \nis important.\n  I am glad we strengthened that bill with some amendments in this \nlanguage. There are appropriations of some $35 million in the \nappropriations bill that will go along with this. We are moving in the \nright direction.\n\n  In my view, the single greatest bottleneck in the criminal justice \nsystem today is the forensic capability. We are far too far behind on \nthat. When you consider all the people we are hiring in police, law \nenforcement, judges, jails, sheriffs, deputies and all those, the very \nfew we have on forensic work that is slowing down all of their work is \na weakness in the system that I think ought to be fixed.\n  This bill does something else that I think is important. The Boys and \nGirls Clubs in America are proven to be some of the finest agencies \nanywhere for the delivery of services, hope, and encouragement to young \npeople in poor areas of our country. They have done tremendous work. I \nhave visited centers in Huntsville, Mobile, and other places. I have \ntalked with their leadership and studied their programs. It is a \ntremendous program.\n  We are providing, through this bill, greater help to them. They are \nmanaging personnel and managing the money that they get efficiently, to \nget the greatest possible benefit for young people in communities all \nacross America. I am glad we are doing that.\n  The bill provides for additional moneys for drug courts. The first \ndrug court began in Miami. Judge Goldstein and a couple of other judges \ndeveloped a concept where many people involved with the criminal \njustice system, both with drug charges and other criminal charges could \nget help with the root of the problem, their serious drug habits. They \nbelieved that if those individuals were carefully monitored under the \nsupervision of a judge who could order them to jail if they did not \ncooperate, improved behavior could occur, the drug use could be \nprevented or reduced, treatment could be carried out effectively, and \nour crime rates would go down.\n  The numbers seem to bear that out. In fact, they cited exceedingly \npositive\n\n[[Page S9863]]\n\nnumbers in the early 1980s. I was a prosecutor as U.S. attorney in \nMobile, AL. I remember participating in bringing Judge Goldstein up to \nour community to talk about it. As a result of his presentation, our \ncommunity established a drug court which has been led most ably for \nmany years by Judge Mike McMaken, a State judge there in Mobile County. \nI believe it works.\n  I also think we have not fully studied drug courts to understand how \nthey work and how they can be made to work better, what are the most \neffective parts of the drug court process, and what should we emphasize \nand what should we deemphasize. I had hearings on this very subject \nwhen I chaired the courts subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee early \nlast year.\n  This bill does require that the General Accounting Office conduct a \nvery rigorous, scientific study of the drug courts to find out what \nworks and what doesn't and to see if we can't do a better job of \nintervening in lives going bad.\n  The way it works is simply this: An individual is arrested for a \nminor crime. Usually, it is the first offense. It could be drugs, or it \ncould be another crime. Hopefully, when they are arrested, they are \ntested for drugs in that system because that is an important thing, in \nmy view. You need to know what is driving that criminal behavior. Every \ndefendant in America arrested for any offense should be immediately \ndrug tested, in my view. A lot of them have a history of drug problems. \nImmediate testing would let us know that this individual, arrested for \nwhatever crime, if it is their first offense, has a drug problem.\n  The way the drug court works is that the judge says they will not \nsend them to jail, and in some cases even allow them to have their \nconviction set aside only if, over a period of months, they conduct \nthemselves under the most rigorous scrutiny in a way that eliminates \ndrug use or criminal activity.\n  The defendant would voluntarily sign up for the drug court procedure. \nThey are drug tested on a weekly basis--maybe three times a week at \nfirst. They report regularly to the probation officer. And on a weekly \nbasis they report personally to the judge. If they come in drug \npositive, he may put them in jail for the weekend. If he believes it is \nhopeless and that they are not going to succeed in the program, he will \nsend them to jail and kick them out of the drug court program. But we \nbelieve there is some success being found with this program.\n  It is spreading all over America. More and more cities are doing it. \nWhen you have a tough judge, a good probation officer, and intense drug \ntesting with the availability of drug treatment, it is quite often \npossible that lives can be turned around as a result of this \nintervention. It is a tough love type of program which does have the \npossibility of being successful.\n  I am glad we are expanding that. I support that. I have been at the \nvery beginning of this kind of program. But I don't think we know \nenough about it yet and what the key parts of it are, or what the \nprogram should contain or maybe what should not be a part of any drug \ncourt program. So the study should help us in that regard.\n  We have a lot of challenges in America in our Federal court system. \nFederal judges are needed in certain districts. Our population has \ngrown. Certain types of criminal activities have grown. We, obviously, \nat various points in time, have districts with surging caseloads that \nneed relief in terms of the number of Federal judges we have.\n  I am not one who believes we ought to just exponentially expand the \nFederal court system. I propose that we take one-half of what the \nAdministrative Office of Courts requested--50-some-odd Federal judges--\nand that we approve 24 Federal judges based on a strict caseload basis \nin the districts where judgeships are most needed, and where those \ncases are based on a weighing of caseload factors--not just on cases \nbut weighted for how big and how difficult the cases are.\n  We know, for example, that southern California has not had any relief \nfor some time. It has been seeing a surge in caseload based on such \nthings as immigration as well as other crimes that go into Federal \ncourt. They are larger numbers when you are on a border like that. This \nwill provide 20 new judges--a number of them temporary. But the net \nresult will be assistance to some critical districts in America, such \nas the western district of Texas, or the southern district of \nCalifornia. I think we are moving in the right direction there.\n  I am also pleased that a bill that Senator Dianne Feinstein and I \noffered--the James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act--was made a \npart of this legislation. This bill dealt with the situation in which \nviolent criminals today are oftentimes better armed and better \nprotected than the police. It is estimated that 25 percent of police do \nnot have body armor available to them. But criminals can go out and buy \nbody armor. It is a crime, for example, for a criminal to have weapons. \nA felon who possesses a gun is in violation of Federal and most State \nlegal systems. But, it is not today a crime for a felon to be wearing \nbody armor, or to wear body armor during the course of a crime.\n\n  James Guelff was murdered as a result of a confrontation with an \nindividual wearing body armor. Chris McCurley, a deputy sheriff in \nAlabama, was out to arrest a criminal. He entered the residence of that \ndefendant and was killed in a shootout. It was discovered that the \ndefendant--the criminal--premeditatedly and calculatedly waited for him \nwhile wearing body armor, prepared himself for a shootout, and killed \nhim on that scene.\n  This bill is named for James Guelff and Chris McCurley. It would add \nintense punishment to criminals who use body armor in the course of \ntheir criminal activity.\n  It has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, and many other national police groups.\n  I think, all in all, there are good things in this legislation. I \nwish we could have done more. I support it, and look forward to voting \nfavorably on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9863-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9863-S9865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONFIRMING CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have heard lately a lot of self-\ncongratulation by our Democratic friends on the Judiciary Committee \nabout confirming judges. However, my friends' self-congratulation is \narrived at not by comparing apples and apples but by cherry-picking the \nperiod of time that will be most advantageous to them.\n  It is beyond a doubt, with respect to circuit court nominees in \nparticular, that President Bush is being treated far worse--\ndramatically worse--than any President in recent history in his first \nterm. In both absolute and relative terms, no President of the United \nStates has been treated as badly as President Bush in their first \nCongress.\n  Let us take a look at the last four Presidents and their record with \nregard to circuit court nominations during the first 2 years of their \nPresidency.\n  During the Reagan years, 1981-1982--President Reagan submitted 20 \nnominations for the circuit court, and 19 of them were confirmed--95 \npercent. President Reagan, of course, had a Republican Senate during \nthose 2 years.\n  President George Bush in his first 2 years, when his party did not \ncontrol the Senate, in a session comparable to the one we are in now, \nsubmitted 23 circuit court nominations, and 22 of them were confirmed--\n96-percent confirmation during the first President Bush's term when his \nparty did not control the Senate, and exactly the situation we find \nourselves in today.\n  With regard to President Clinton in his first 2 years, a period \nduring which his party did control the Senate, he submitted 22 circuit \ncourt nominations, and 19 were confirmed. That is an 86-percent \nconfirmation rate.\n  It is noteworthy, even when his own party controlled the Senate, \nPresident Clinton's percentage of confirmations was slightly less than \nPresident George H. W. Bush when his party did not control the Senate \nduring the first 2 years, but still a hefty percentage, 86 percent.\n  Then we look at the first 2 years of the presidency of George W. \nBush, which is now coming to a conclusion. We are near the end now \nwhere the statistics actually mean something.\n  President George W. Bush has submitted 32 circuit court nominations \nto\n\n[[Page S9864]]\n\nthe Senate, and only 14 have been confirmed, which is 44 percent. \nForty-four percent. This is the worst record in anybody's memory of \nconfirming circuit court nominations of a President in his first 2 \nyears.\n  When you look at comparable situations, as I have just indicated, the \nfirst President Bush, confronted with a Democratic Senate--just like \nthe current President Bush--got 96 percent of his circuit court judges \nconfirmed. This President Bush, with a Democratic Senate, has only \ngotten 44 percent of his circuit court judges confirmed--dramatically \nworse.\n  Now, let me say, our friends on the other side are trumpeting how \nwell they are doing on judicial nominations and do not want us to look \nbehind the curtain of their statistics that have been put out.\n  In relative terms, President Bush has only half as many of his \ncircuit court nominations confirmed as President Clinton did--44 \npercent as opposed to 86 percent. In absolute terms, President Bush has \nfive fewer circuit court nominees confirmed than President Clinton did.\n  It is impossible at this stage for the Senate to catch up, to treat \nPresident Bush as fairly as it treated his predecessors, including \nPresident Clinton. So there is no chance this statistic can be \ndramatically improved this late in the game. But there is still time to \nimprove upon this sorry record and at least have the Senate look as \nthough it tried to treat President Bush with some elementary basic \nfairness.\n  For example, John Rogers, who happens to be from my State of \nKentucky, a nominee to the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which \nuntil August was 50 percent vacant--it has been 50 percent vacant not \nbecause there were not nominations made by the President, but because \nwe have not approved them. We finally approved one from Tennessee right \nbefore the August recess--John Rogers has been languishing in the \nSenate for 285 days.\n  This was not even one of those controversial nominations. He cleared \nthe Judiciary Committee unanimously, and he has been stuck on the \nexecutive calendar for 3 months. The sixth circuit, which is supposed \nto have 16 judges, currently has 9. But one of those nine was only \nconfirmed last July, right at the end before the August recess. So it \nis still almost 50 percent vacant, not because the President has not \nsent up nominations, but because we simply will not act on them. It is \nhard to understand what the problem is.\n  The ABA unanimously rated Professor Rogers--the person I was just \nmentioning--as ``qualified,'' and his services are in dire need. The \nsixth circuit is in the worst shape of any circuit and is almost half \nvacant, as I just said.\n  Shifting to the fourth circuit, Dennis Shedd, a nominee in the fourth \ncircuit, has been before the Senate for over 500 days; in fact, to be \nspecific, 511 days. The ABA rated him ``well-qualified.'' That is the \nhighest rating one can get, and it is about as common as teeth on a \nchicken--not very common.\n  Our friends on the other side used to call the ABA the ``Gold \nStandard''--the ``Gold Standard.'' Judge Shedd was in President Bush's \nfirst batch of nominees. Until this Congress, it was Senate precedent \nfor all nominees in a President's first submission to be confirmed, the \nfirst batch. Until this year, they were all confirmed, and to be \nconfirmed within a year of those submissions.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Shedd, like many of his colleagues, not only \nwill not meet the 1-year rule, he is in jeopardy of not getting \nconfirmed at all.\n  Michael McConnell--no relation, but an outstanding nominee by the \nPresident to the tenth circuit--has also been pending for over 500 \ndays; in fact, the 511 days that Judge Shedd has been pending. The ABA \nhas rated Professor McConnell--now listen to this--unanimously ``well-\nqualified''--unanimously ``well-qualified.''\n  Like Judge Shedd, Professor McConnell was in the President's very \nfirst submission, yet, he, too, is in danger of not getting confirmed \nat all.\n  Miguel Estrada, a nominee to the D.C. Circuit, is yet another nominee \nwho has been pending for 511 days. Like Professor McConnell, Mr. \nEstrada received one of those extremely rare, unanimously ``well-\nqualified'' ratings from the ABA. This is really hard to get. That \nmeans nobody on the ABA committee found the nominee anything other than \n``well-qualified,'' the highest rating the ABA can give a nominee.\n  Like Judge Shedd and Professor McConnell, Mr. Estrada is one of those \nsuperlative nominees whom the President sent up in May of 2001. Now he \nwill not beat the 1-year rule, and he may not get confirmed at all.\n  Even if all four of these nominees I just referred to were confirmed, \nthe Senate would still not be treating President Bush as well as his \npredecessors, either in absolute or in relative terms.\n  As shown on the chart, even if all four of these nominees were \nconfirmed, President Bush would only have 18 circuit court nominees \nconfirmed. President Clinton got 19 confirmed. That would still only be \n56 percent versus 83 percent.\n  Further, President Clinton got his nominees to the Senate much later \nin the first Congress than President Bush did, and President Clinton \nsent up a lot fewer. He nominated fewer people. He sent up fewer \ncircuit court nominees than President Bush did. There were 22 Clinton \ncircuit court nominees sent up versus 32 Bush nominees. So there were a \nlarger number of nominations made by President Bush. That means the \nSenate has had more time, since President Bush sent them up sooner. The \nSenate has had more time, has had more options, but has done less. More \ntime, more options, and done less--far less, far less--for President \nBush than the Senate did for President Clinton.\n  You would think we would be trying to redouble our efforts to solve \nthis sad situation, but it seems we are determined to squander what few \nopportunities we have left.\n  We had a markup originally scheduled for this morning in the \nJudiciary Committee, in which we could have gotten Judge Shedd, \nProfessor McConnell, and Mr. Estrada to the floor of the Senate, but, \ninexplicably, the committee session was cancelled. We will not have a \nhearing until next week, if then. If the markup is delayed any more, we \nwill delay it right out of this Congress.\n  A lot of us are very upset about this situation. I know there has \nbeen some discussion of legislative remedies. I know the conference \nreport to the DOJ reauthorization, for example, is popular among some \nof my Republican colleagues. But it only takes one Senator--one \nperson--to file a point of order to it, and that point would probably \nsucceed.\n  If we see a good-faith effort by our Democratic colleagues, I am \nhopeful we can avert a legislative crisis on the DOJ authorization \nconference report. But it depends on having some level of cooperation.\n  Even if we were to confirm these four fine nominees, President Bush \nstill would have been treated dramatically worse--dramatically worse--\nthan any of the Presidents in recent time.\n  I think it is good not to be distracted by this sort of Enron-style \naccounting, where folks cobble together a few months from here and \nthere to manipulate statistics with regard to what our sorry record is \nwith regard to judicial confirmations. Facts are stubborn things. The \nbottom line is, President Bush is being treated far worse than his \npredecessors on circuit court nominees.\n  So let's just look at it one more time.\n  President Reagan, who had benefited from having a Senate of his own \nparty: 95 percent of his circuit court nominees confirmed in the first \n2 years of his term.\n  The first President Bush, not benefiting from Senate control by his \nown party--a situation directly analogous to the one we have today--got \n96 percent of his circuit court nominees confirmed in the first 2 \nyears.\n  President Clinton, benefiting from having a Senate controlled by his \nparty, had 86 percent of his circuit court nominees confirmed in the \nfirst 2 years. The second President Bush, in a situation analogous to \nhis father, who got 96 percent during the first 2 years, has to date \nonly 44 percent. And even if we process the four nominees that could be \nhandled--Professor Rogers who has been on the calendar for 3 months, \nand Professor McConnell, Judge Shedd, and Miguel Estrada--he\n\n[[Page S9865]]\n\nwould still have a pretty sorry record. But we could improve somewhat \nthis dismal performance on the current President's nominations for \ncircuit court.\n  I hope we will have some action at the end of the session on at least \none of the four nominees who could be acted upon by the full Senate. It \nis not too late to at least partially fix and improve a very sad \nsituation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Madam President, I rise to address our policy in Iraq. \nThe situation remains fluid. Administration officials are engaged in \nnegotiations at the United Nations over what approach we ought to take \nwith our allies to disarm the brutal and dictatorial Iraqi regime.\n  The debate we will have in the Senate today and in the days to follow \nis critical because the administration seeks our authorization now for \nmilitary action, including possibly unprecedented, preemptive, go-it-\nalone military action in Iraq, even as it seeks to garner support from \nour allies on a new U.N. disarmament resolution.\n  Let me be clear: Saddam Hussein is a brutal, ruthless dictator who \nhas repressed his own people, attacked his neighbors, and he remains an \ninternational outlaw. The world would be a much better place if he were \ngone and the regime in Iraq were changed. That is why the United States \nshould unite the world against Saddam and not allow him to unite forces \nagainst us.\n  A go-it-alone approach, allowing a ground invasion of Iraq without \nthe support of other countries, could give Saddam exactly that chance. \nA preemptive, go-it-alone strategy toward Iraq is wrong. I oppose it. I \nsupport ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction through unfettered \nU.N. inspections which would begin as soon as possible. Only a broad \ncoalition of nations, united to disarm Saddam, while preserving our war \non terror, is likely to succeed.\n  Our primary focus now must be on Iraq's verifiable disarmament of \nweapons of mass destruction. This will help maintain international \nsupport and could even eventually result in Saddam's loss of power. Of \ncourse, I would welcome this, along with most of our allies.\n  The President has helped to direct intense new multilateral pressure \non Saddam Hussein to allow U.N. and International Atomic Energy Agency \nweapons inspectors back in Iraq to conduct their assessment of Iraq's \nchemical, biological, and nuclear programs. He clearly has felt that \nheat. It suggests what can be accomplished through collective action.\n  I am not naive about this process. Much work lies ahead. But we \ncannot dismiss out of hand Saddam's late and reluctant commitment to \ncomply with U.N. disarmament arrangements or the agreement struck \nTuesday to begin to implement them. We should use the gathering \ninternational resolve to collectively confront this regime by building \non these efforts.\n  This debate must include all Americans because our decisions finally \nmust have the informed consent of the American people who will be asked \nto bear the cost, in blood and treasure, of our decisions.\n  When the lives of sons and daughters of average Americans could be \nrisked and lost, their voices must be heard in the Congress before we \nmake decisions about military action. Right now, despite a desire to \nsupport our President, I believe many Americans still have profound \nquestions about the wisdom of relying too heavily on a preemptive go-\nit-alone military approach. Acting now on our own might be a sign of \nour power. Acting sensibly and in a measured way, in concert with our \nallies, with bipartisan congressional support, would be a sign of our \nstrength.\n  It would also be a sign of the wisdom of our Founders who lodged in \nthe President the power to command U.S. Armed Forces, and in Congress \nthe power to make war, ensuring a balance of powers between coequal \nbranches of Government. Our Constitution lodges the power to weigh the \ncauses of war and the ability to declare war in Congress precisely to \nensure that the American people and those who represent them will be \nconsulted before military action is taken.\n\n  The Senate has a grave duty to insist on a full debate that examines \nfor all Americans the full range of options before us and weighs those \noptions, together with their risks and costs. Such a debate should be \nenergized by the real spirit of September 11, a debate which places a \npriority not on unanimity but on the unity of a people determined to \nforcefully confront and defeat terrorism and to defend our values.\n  I have supported internationally sanctioned coalition military action \nin Bosnia, in Kosovo, in Serbia, and in Afghanistan. Even so, in recent \nweeks, I and others--including major Republican policymakers, such as \nformer Bush National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft; former Bush \nSecretary of State James Baker; my colleague on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Chuck Hagel; Bush Mid-East envoy General \nAnthony Zinni; and other leading U.S. military leaders--have raised \nserious questions about the approach the administration is taking on \nIraq.\n  There have been questions raised about the nature and urgency of \nIraq's threat and our response to that threat: What is the best course \nof action that the United States could take to address this threat? \nWhat are the economic, political, and national security consequences of \na possible U.S. or allied invasion of Iraq? There have been questions \nraised about the consequences of our actions abroad, including its \neffect on the continuing war on terrorism, our ongoing efforts to \nstabilize and rebuild Afghanistan, and efforts to calm the intensifying \nMiddle East crisis, especially the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n  There have been questions raised about the consequences of our \nactions here at home. Of gravest concern, obviously, are the questions \nraised about the possible loss of life that could result from our \nactions. The United States could post tens of thousands of troops in \nIraq and, in so doing, risk countless lives of soldiers and innocent \nIraqis.\n  There are other questions about the impact of an attack in relation \nto our economy. The United States could face soaring oil prices and \ncould spend billions both on a war and a years-long effort to stabilize \nIraq after an invasion.\n  The resolution that will be before the Senate explicitly authorizes a \ngo-it-alone approach. I believe an international approach is essential. \nIn my view, our policy should have four key elements.\n  First and foremost, the United States must work with our allies to \ndeal with Iraq. We should not go it alone, or virtually alone, with a \npreemptive ground invasion. Most critically, acting alone could \njeopardize our top national priority, the continuing war on terror. I \nbelieve it would be a mistake to vote for a resolution that authorizes \na preemptive ground invasion. The intense cooperation of other nations \nin relation to matters that deal with intelligence sharing, security, \npolitical and economic cooperation, law enforcement, and financial \nsurveillance, and other areas is crucial to this fight, and this is \nwhat is critical for our country to be able to wage its war effectively \nwith our allies. Over the past year, this cooperation has been the most \nsuccessful weapon against terrorist networks. That--not attacking \nIraq--should be the main focus of our efforts in the war on terror.\n  As I think about what a go-it-alone strategy would mean in terms of \nthe consequences in South Asia and the Near East and the need for our \ncountry to have access on the ground, and cooperation of the community, \nand get intelligence in the war against al-Qaida and in this war \nagainst terrorism, I believe a go-it-alone approach could undercut that \neffort. That is why I believe our effort should be international.\n  We have succeeded in destroying some al-Qaida forces, but many \noperatives have scattered. Their will to kill Americans is still \nstrong. The United States has relied heavily on alliances with nearly \n100 countries in a\n\n[[Page S9866]]\n\ncoalition against terror for critical intelligence to protect Americans \nfrom possible future attacks. Acting with the support of allies, \nincluding, hopefully, Arab and Muslim allies, would limit possible \ndamage to that coalition and our antiterrorism effort. But as General \nWes Clark, former Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe, has \nrecently noted, a premature, go-it-alone invasion of Iraq ``would \nsupercharge recruiting for al-Qaida.''\n  Second, our efforts should have a goal of disarming Saddam Hussein of \nall his weapons of mass destruction. Iraq agreed to destroy its weapons \nof mass destruction at the end of the Persian Gulf War and to \nverification by the U.N. and the International Atomic Energy Agency \nthat this had been done. According to the U.N. and the IAEA, and \nundisputed by the administration, inspections during the 1990s \nneutralized a substantial portion of Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction, and getting inspectors back to finish the job is critical. \nWe know he did not cooperate with all of the inspection regime.\n  We know what needs to be done. But the fact is we had that regime, \nand it is important now to call on the Security Council of the U.N. to \ninsist that those inspectors be on the ground. The goal is disarmament, \nunfettered access. It is an international effort, and with that Saddam \nHussein must comply. Otherwise, there will be consequences, including \nappropriate use of force. The prompt resumption of inspections and \ndisarmament, under an expedited timetable and with unfettered access in \nIraq, is imperative.\n  Third, weapons inspections should be enforceable. If efforts by the \nU.N. weapons inspectors are tried and fail, a range of potential U.N. \nsanctions means, including proportionate military force, should be \nconsidered. I have no doubt that this Congress would act swiftly to \nauthorize force in such circumstances. This does not mean giving the \nUnited Nations a veto over U.S. actions. Nobody wants to do that. It \nsimply means, as Chairman Levin has observed, that Saddam Hussein is a \nworld problem and should be addressed in the world arena.\n\n  Finally, our approach toward Iraq must be consistent with \ninternational law and the framework of collective security developed \nover the last 50 years or more. It should be sanctioned by the Security \nCouncil under the U.N. charter, to which we are a party and by which we \nare legally bound. Only a broad coalition of nations, united to disarm \nSaddam Hussein, while preserving our war on terror, can succeed.\n  Our response will be far more effective if Saddam Hussein sees the \nwhole world arrayed against him. We should act forcefully, resolutely, \nsensibly, with our allies--and not alone--to disarm Saddam Hussein. \nAuthorizing the preemptive go-alone use of force right now, which is \nwhat the resolution before us calls for, in the midst of continuing \nefforts to enlist the world community to back a tough, new disarmament \nresolution on Iraq, could be a very costly mistake for our country.\n  Madam President, quite often at the end of debates on amendments, we \nthank our staffs for the work they have done and appreciate their hard \nwork. At the end of my statement today on the floor of the Senate as to \nwhy I am opposed to the resolution before us that we will be debating \ntoday and in the days to come, which is too open-ended and would \nprovide the President with authority for preemptive military action, \nincluding a ground invasion in Iraq, I would like to thank my staff. I \nwould like to thank my staff for never trying one time to influence me \nto make any other decision than what I honestly and truthfully believe \nis right for the State I represent, Minnesota, for my country, and for \nthe world in which my children and my grandchildren live. To all of my \nstaff, I thank you for believing in me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, thousands of working families in Oregon \nfeel as if they have been hit by an economic wrecking ball. From \nOntario to Portland, OR workers have been laid off their jobs, left to \nfend for themselves, while their medical and energy bills skyrocket, \nand they have been left out of what Larry Lindsey and the \nadministration's economic team keep calling an economic recovery.\n  Oregonians are hungry for leadership on the economic issue. We are \ntrying to do our part at home down the road at the election. All of \nOregon's elected officials are going to be working with the private \nsector on a new economic game plan. I think starting in January, with \nthe ISTEA legislation, we will have an opportunity to make some \nimportant investments. But Oregonians expect economic leadership from \nWashington, DC, now. That is what they want today.\n  I am anxious to work with the administration on these issues, but \nthere has just not been the leadership forthcoming. For example, on the \ntrade issue, I cast a vote--unpopular with many with whom I am close--\nto give the President the authority to negotiate trade agreements. \nTrade involves one out of seven jobs in Oregon. The trade jobs pay \nbetter than the nontrade jobs. So I want to meet the administration \nhalfway.\n  Unfortunately, the administration and its economic team is not \nwilling to move forward and, in fact, is moving backward on a host of \nissues. I want to outline several of those this morning, Madam \nPresident.\n  It is very obvious we need a transfusion--immediate transfusion--that \ncan restore our economic health. There is nothing that could bring our \neconomy back faster than getting increased transportation funds for the \nStates. One State after another has shown that money for transportation \nprojects, particularly repaving and other maintenance items, gets money \ninto our economy and creates family wage employment for our workers \nfaster than any other area.\n  A number of Senators, Democrats and Republicans, understand this. \nUnfortunately, the administration's economic team does not agree. They \ncontinue to propose significantly less money than is needed for our \neconomic and transportation needs and push for it.\n  While the transportation officials of my State calculate that the \nadministration's approach will mean tens of millions of dollars less \nfunding for Oregon's struggling economy and hundreds of fewer family \nwage construction jobs that could put our citizens back to work, the \nadministration persists in taking an approach that I think is a huge \nmistake for our country, particularly our economic needs.\n  On the health issue, something the Chair knows much about, we can \nfind common ground, for example, on a measure that could significantly \nlower health costs, a bipartisan approach involving making wider use of \ngeneric drugs, the same drug as essentially the brand name in the \nmajority of instances.\n  Senators of both political parties want to support this issue. There \nis support on the Democratic side and the Republican side. The \nadministration will not support something that could have immediate \nbenefit--immediate benefit--for the economic crunch that our citizens \nface and would have bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  Finally, it seems on issues such as unemployment compensation, we \nhave Senators, again, who would like to move forward to provide what I \ncall this transfusion of assistance to the people who are so hard hit. \nThousands of laid-off workers are exhausting their temporary extension \nof benefits every week. The program expires on December 31 of this \nyear. Anyone laid off before June 30 of this year is going to lose all \ntheir benefits come December 31, and anyone who lost a job after June \n30 will not have any Federal extension in place when their State \nbenefits expire.\n  For my home State with soaring unemployment, this means that nearly \n30,000 laid-off workers currently getting a temporary extension of \nunemployment compensation would see the end of their benefits at the \nend of the year, according to the Department of Labor.\n  Again, it seems to me this is an issue where Democrats and \nRepublicans could, as has happened so often, come together and provide \nsome solace, some actual relief to these families who are hurting in \nour country. I will be talking more about this issue in the days ahead \nwhile working on a significant\n\n[[Page S9867]]\n\nhealth reform proposal that I have been discussing with colleagues.\n  I come back in closing to the central reason I have come to the \nChamber, and that is that in my State and in much of the country, our \nfamilies are hurting and our economy is hemorrhaging. I have listed \nthree issues where, if there was some leadership from the \nadministration--transportation, lowering medical costs immediately, \nparticularly on the prescription side, which has the support of \nSenators of both parties, the expanded access to generic drugs, and \nfinally unemployment compensation--three steps where, with a little bit \nof leadership from the administration on these vital economic issues, \nwe could take steps now that would help working families.\n  Let's not go the wrong way. Let's find an opportunity for Democrats \nand Republicans to work on key issues and go the right way, which means \nproviding economic relief to our working families.\n  I know the Senator from Georgia has been waiting very patiently. I \nyield the floor, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have signed on as an original \ncosponsor of the Iraq resolution that our President has proposed, and I \nwould like to tell you a story that I believe explains why I think that \nis the right path to take.\n  A few weeks ago, we were doing some work on my back porch back home, \ntearing out a section of old stacked rocks, when all of a sudden I \nuncovered a nest of copperhead snakes. I am not one to get alarmed at \nsnakes. I know they perform some valuable functions, like eating rats.\n  When I was a young lad, I kept snakes as pets. I had an indigo snake. \nI had a bull snake. I had a beautiful colored corn snake, and many \nothers. I must have had a dozen king snakes at one time or another. \nThey make great pets, and you only have to give them a little mouse \nevery 30 days.\n  I read all the books by Raymond C. Ditmars, who was before most \nherpetologists of the day--that is a person who is an expert on \nsnakes--and for a while I wanted to be a herpetologist, but the pull of \nbeing a big league shortstop out ran that childhood dream.\n  I reminisce this way to explain that snakes do not scare me like they \ndo most people, and I guess the reason is that I know the difference \nbetween those snakes that are harmless and those that can kill you. In \nfact, I bet I may be the only Senator in this body who can look at the \nlast 3 inches of a snake's tail and tell you whether it is poisonous. I \ncan also tell the sex of a snake, but that is another story.\n  A copperhead snake will kill you. It could kill one of my dogs. It \ncould kill one of my grandchildren. It could kill any one of my four \ngreat-grandchildren. They play all the time where I found those \nkillers.\n  You know, when I discovered those copperheads, I did not call my wife \nShirley for advice, as I usually do on most things. I did not go before \nthe city council. I did not yell for help from my neighbors. I just \ntook a hoe and knocked them in the head and killed them, dead as a \ndoorknob.\n  I guess you could call it unilateral action, a preemptive strike. \nPerhaps if you had been watching me, you could have even said it was \nbellicose and reactive. I took their poisonous heads off because they \nwere a threat to me, they were a threat to my home, they were a threat \nto my family, and all I hold dear. And isn't that what this is all \nabout?\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, Madam \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there is pending legislation we certainly \nwould like to move. We have tried very hard to get some help in this \nregard. This legislation gives the same number of weeks of benefits for \nunemployment compensation as was given under President Bush, Sr., in \nthe early 1990s. Only Oregon and Washington, the States with the \nhighest unemployment in the Nation, will get a little bit more, and \nthat is because of an extension of Congress passed in March. The March \nbill provided up to 65 weeks of benefits for those two States. Our bill \nonly provides up to 7 more.\n  This is extremely important. We have people out of work. That might \nnot sound like much to somebody who has a job, but to someone who does \nnot have a job, it is everything. We have 2 million more Americans \nunemployed than we had 18 months ago. We have economic problems that \nhave been kind of covered up. We have a situation where there is $4.5 \ntrillion lost in the stock market. If someone was going to retire with \ntheir 401(k) or their IRA, they would have to work up to 5 years more, \nhaving lost 30 to 35 percent of the value of their retirement.\n\n  I have people I welcome to Washington every Thursday. They came to me \ntoday saying they do not know what they will do because they lost so \nmuch of the value of what they will retire on. They do not know what \nthey will do.\n  We need to extend unemployment compensation. We did it before under \nPresident Bush senior. There was an emergency then. We did it on more \nthan one occasion. We only want to do it now on one occasion.\n  As I indicated, the bill will provide an additional 20 weeks of \nextended benefits for high unemployment States and an additional 13 \nweeks to all other States for workers who run out or about to run out \nof benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9867-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9867-S9868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3009\n\n  Mr. REID.

I wish to take a moment to express my appreciation and \nadmiration for my good friend from North Carolina, Senator Jesse Helms.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Senator Helms for the past \n30 years. Although he and I do not share the same ideologies, Senator \nHelms has always kept his word to me. In this day and age, \n``trustworthiness'' is a trait that is becoming increasingly rare, \nparticularly in the political arena. Yet Senator Helms has remained \ntrue to himself and his upbringing. Senator Helms is trustworthy.\n  Senator Helms is a true statesman and gentleman, courteous, \ncourageous, and compassionate. He is a man who understands what it \nmeans to do one's duty to God, country, and family. He emulates the \nidea upon which America was founded, the idea that each individual \ncontrols his or her destiny and has a right to pursue and achieve their \ndreams, and that great societies are built by people who are inspired \nand motivated to reach high and work hard.\n  Senator Helms has, on many occasions, inspired and motivated me. He \nhas set an example for me and my colleagues. His life is a model of one \nwho honors and defends the Constitution, works to make our country a \nbetter place, and conducts himself with dignity and respect for others.\n  I thank my dear friend for the many courtesies he has extended to me \nthroughout the years. I will miss his kindness and friendship. To \nSenator Helms and his wife, Dot, I wish them many years of happiness \nand continued good health in the bright years ahead.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhonoring Jesse Helms, the senior Senator from North Carolina, for his \nmany years of service to his State and to the Nation.\n  While Senator Helms has served in the United States Senate for more \nthan a quarter-century, his earlier years were equally active and \nproductive. Following his service in the U.S. Navy during World War II, \nhe became the city editor of the Raleigh Times. He served as \nAdministrative Assistant to two U.S. Senators before becoming Executive \nDirector of the North Carolina Bank Association in 1953. The Tarheel \nBanker became the largest State banking publication in the State while \nJesse Helms was its editor. He was Executive Vice President, Vice \nChairman of the Board, and Assistant Chief Executive Officer of Capitol \nBroadcasting Company in Raleigh, NC from 1960 until his election to the \nSenate in 1972.\n  During his service in the U.S. Senate, Senator Helms has served as a \nmember of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry which he chaired in \nthe 1980s, and the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he was a \nformer chairman and the current ranking member. In 1973, he became the \nfirst Republican, as well as the first Senator from North Carolina, to \nreceive the Golden Gavel, an award presented for presiding over the \nSenate for more than 117 hours. Senator Helms was awarded a second \nGolden Gavel for presiding for more than 120 hours in 1974.\n  It goes without saying that Jesse Helms has become a fixture and a \nlegend in this body. While Senator Helms and I have often differed over \nthe years in our approaches and our positions to the many important \nissues that have come before the Senate for consideration, Senator \nHelms has always been a force to be reckoned with. His public service \nhas been marked by hard work and diligence. I am pleased to have had \nthe opportunity to serve with Senator Helms over these many years and \nwant to join my colleagues in paying tribute to him today.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, over the course of the day, we have heard \nfrom my colleagues many of Senator Jesse Helms' remarkable \naccomplishments over the course of his life. He is a husband, a father, \na Senator, a Navy veteran, a defender of freedom, and a good friend. \nBut above all, Jesse Helms is a man of God.\n  I should also add that he is a man of the people. Senator Helms has \nseen more Senators, staffers, and pages in his tenure than most \nMembers, and he treated all of them like they were from his own family. \nHe is constantly noted for his friendly demeanor to those strangers who \nmeet Jesse for the first time, but go away from their meetings feeling \nlike a personal relationship has just formed. Senator Helms has always \nbeen willing to take those precious extra few minutes when meeting \nsomeone to make personal connections that endure him to many.\n  Rarely do people keep their convictions as strong as Jesse Helms, \nespecially facing the type of scrutiny that politicians do in the \nspotlight. Throughout his 30 years in the Senate, Senator Helms has \nfought hard for the commonsense values that he brought with him from \nthe great State of North Carolina. He has stood for the vision that our \nFounding Fathers imagined when they framed the Constitution. I cannot \nhelp but think that North Carolina and indeed our country is indebted \nto Senator Helms for his service to our country. It has been a \nprivilege to stand with the Senator on so many of the issues that are \nimportant to the United States. I am proud to call Senator Helms a \ncolleague and a friend, and we all know how much his leadership will be \nmissed in this institution.\n  Thank you, Jesse, for your continued dedication not only to the \nSenate, but also your country which is so near and dear to your heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9868-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9868-S9870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what can I say about Strom Thurmond?\n  I remember, back in 1981, the Senate Judiciary Committee had a new \nchairman--and a new ranking member, and there were more than a few \nfolks looking forward to the fireworks.\n  There was a new conservative Republican administration and new \nRepublican majority in the Senate. The Judiciary Committee seemed \ndestined to be one of the main ideological battlegrounds over issues \nthat divided us then and still divide us today.\n  There were more than a few Washington insiders who thought that Strom \nThurmond the seasoned veteran conservative Republican chairman who \nfirst made his mark on the national political scene as an advocate of \nState's rights--and Joe Biden a northeastern Democrat still in his \nthirties whose interest in politics was sparked, in large measure, by \nthe civil rights movement would never find an inch of common ground--\nnot an inch.\n  But I knew that was not going to be the case. I had served with Strom \nfor eight years by then . . .\n  I knew his personal strengths, and admired them greatly, regardless \nof our political differences, and I knew those strengths would guide us \nto consensus rather than gridlock.\n  I knew, with Strom, there would be comity--not enmity.\n  And I knew debate would be civil and constructive rather than \ndivisive and filled with meaningless partisan rhetoric.\n  Strom, as usual, didn't let me down. In his six years as chairman--\nand for several years after that when we switched roles--he exceeded my \nexpectations in every way.\n  There were many heated debates and contentious hearings, but we \nweathered them and we weathered the kinds of controversies which I've \nseen poison the well for other committees for years afterward.\n  But that kind of cooperation would not have happened if it weren't \nfor Strom Thurmond's strength of character.\n  It would not have happened if he were not, first and foremost, a \ngentleman--unfailingly courteous, respectful, and always dignified.\n  Strom's word is his bond, and each of us, even the most partisan \npolitical opponents knows that, in the heat of debate, under \nextraordinary pressure, when the stakes are exceedingly high, Strom \nThurmond will always, always keep his word.\n\n[[Page S9869]]\n\n  There's an old Greek proverb that says: ``The old age of an eagle is \nbetter than the youth of a sparrow.''\n  Well, Strom Thurmond is an eagle among us.\n  He's been my neighbor in the Russell Building for many years now. \nActually, he has most of the offices around me so I'd say he is more \nlike the landlord.\n  He has more seniority in this chamber than any United States Senator \nhas ever had, and more seniority than most Americans will ever dream of \nhaving. But longevity is not the measure of a man like Strom Thurmond.\n  Longevity is a very small part of why we come to this floor to pay \ntribute to him today--a tribute he richly deserves--not only for a long \nlife, but for a grand life, an accomplished life.\n  I joke about it sometimes. About the time, for example, someone came \nup to him and challenged his strength and his tenacity and--right \nthere--Strom took off his coat and started doing push ups.\n  He has lived long and he has lived well. He has served his country \nwell. And, more than any other public figure, he has been a constant \nforce in this nation for the better part of a century. Never stopping. \nNever giving up. Always fighting for his beliefs. Unequivocally. \nUnashamedly.\n  Whether it was his independent run for President 54 years ago, or \nserving the people of South Carolina as Superintendent for Education of \nEdgefield County, as a City and County Attorney, a state senator, a \ncircuit court judge, Governor, or United States Senator--he has been \ntruly, sincerely, honorably, one of America's most engaged, committed, \nand enduring public servants.\n  He was born back in 1902. It was not until a year later, that the \nWright brothers flew the first powered flight. He was 6 when Henry Ford \nintroduced the Model T.\n  He received his degree from Clemson one year after the Yankees signed \nBabe Ruth.\n  When Strom joined the army, Calvin Coolidge was elected President.\n  The Golden Gate Bridge was completed the year Strom was elected to \nthe state senate.\n  Judging from that time-line, you might conclude that American legends \ntend to lead somewhat parallel lives.\n  There is no doubt that Strom Thurmond is an American legend.\n  He served only one term as a State senator, but in that one term most \npeople don't realize he became an education Senator, raising teachers' \npay and extending the school year.\n  Not to mention the fact that he sponsored South Carolina's first \nRural Electrification Act.\n  Legend has it that when the U.S. declared war against Germany--Strom \nwas a circuit court judge at the time--he literally took off his robes \nand volunteered for active duty that day.\n  He went on to earn five battle stars, eighteen decorations, medals, \nand awards--the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, a Purple Heart, \na Bronze Star, the Belgian Order of the Crown and the French Croix de \nGuerre.\n  Then, in 1947, he was elected Governor of South Carolina. He added \n60,000 new private sector jobs. Paved 4100 miles of farm-to-market \nroads, raised teachers' pay again, started a trade and technical \neducation system and lowered property taxes. Not a bad record. But \nStrom was not done.\n  He was elected to this Chamber in 1954. I have been here for 30 \nyears. I consider that to be quite a long time but Strom arrived 18 \nyears earlier. But Strom came the hard way. He was a write-in \ncandidate.\n  I believe he has the distinction of being the first person to be \nelected to a national office that way.\n  It wasn't long before he became an expert on the military and an \nadvocate for a strong national defense. He's been on the Armed Services \nCommittee since the Eisenhower Administration--1959.\n  He was a Democrat back then. We could use you again now, Senator.\n  But seriously, Strom held to his convictions about a strong military \nand, in 1964, said the Republican Party more closely represented his \nviews, so he switched and, when he did, changed the future of South \nCarolina politics.\n  Strom and I may disagree on most issues, but, the fact is, it was \nStrom Thurmond who, one way or another, helped shape the debate on many \nof those issues for the better part of the last century.\n  A long life is the gift of a benevolent God, but a long life with a \npowerful and lasting impact is the treasure of a grateful Nation.\n  He has had that kind of impact, and we are grateful.\n  His achievements, his list of awards, the many schools and buildings \nnamed--for him too many to enumerate here--are only a small tribute to \na man who has done in a hundred years more than most of us could \naccomplish in a thousand. And, the truth is, most of us wouldn't have \nthe energy to even try.\n  The real beneficiaries of Strom Thurmond's legacy are the citizens of \nSouth Carolina.\n  Not since the days of John C. Calhoun has South Carolina enjoyed such \nmemorable representation as it does today with Senator Thurmond and \nSenator Hollings.\n  From his own reflections and experiences, Calhoun wrote the famous \nDisquisition on Government. Some political scientists have said that \nessay is a key to modern American politics, a handbook for defending \nagainst the tyranny of the majority, and for building pragmatic \ncoalitions.\n  In that work, Calhoun wanted to maintain the Constitutional rights of \nStates, and the delicate relationship between federal and state powers.\n  Strom Thurmond wears the mantle of that heritage.\n  Some years back, Senator Thurmond was quoted as saying, ``The \nConstitution means today exactly what it meant in 1787 or it means \nnothing at all.''\n  Armed with that conviction all of his life, he's been an able \nadvocate of State's rights--the balance of power between branches of \nGovernment--individual rights against Government prerogatives and \nusurpations--private enterprise--decentralized Government--and strict \nConstitutional interpretation.\n  He has not only been a successful politician who helped shape the \nlast century, but a political philosopher with whom I do not always \nagree, but for whom I have the deepest respect.\n\n  Let me tell you one of my most memorable stories about Strom.\n  It was when we went down to the White House to try to convince \nPresident Reagan to sign a crime bill.\n  President Reagan was in the beginning of his second term. We sat in \nthat Cabinet room. We were on one side of the table and William French \nSmith, Ed Meese, and someone else, I can't recall whom, were on the \nother side.\n  The President walked in and sat down between Strom and me. We told \nhim why we thought he should sign the bill, why it was important for \nhim to sign it.\n  At first, the President looked like he was thinking about it, and \nthen, to the shock of everyone on the other side of the table, he began \nto look like he was being convinced--that he actually might sign it.--\nThis is absolutely a true story.\n  Ed Meese stood up at that point. He looked at us and then he looked \nat the President and said. ``Mr. President, it's time to go.''\n  The President hesitated. He looked over at Strom and nodded as if he \nwanted to hear more. But Ed Meese said again, ``Mr. President, it's \ntime to go.''\n  At that point, the President made a motion to get up, and Strom \nreached over and put his hand firmly on the President's arm. He grabbed \nit and pulled him back down and said, ``Mr. President, the one thing \nyou got to know about Washington is that when you get as old as I am, \nyou want to get things done, you have to compromise.''\n  There was Ronald Reagan, not that much younger than Strom, and there \nwas Strom, smiling, making the President laugh. And there was Ed Meese \nnot looking very happy as Strom talked the President into his position.\n  That's a remarkable ability, and it works for Strom because people \nalways know where his heart is. They know what his objective is.\n  People know that he believes what he says and says what he believes \nand it's real and it is honest.\n  One more personal story that I will never forget. It was during a \ncontentious hearing on a Supreme Court Justice and a difficult time in \nmy career. Strom and I disagreed on the nominee.\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\nAnd I was being blasted in the press back in 1988.\n  I called a meeting of the entire committee and said that if the \naccusations relevant to me were getting in the way of the work of the \ncommittee, I would resign as Chairman.\n  But before I could get the last word out of my mouth, Strom stood up. \n``That's ridiculous,'' he said. ``You stay as chairman. We all have \nconfidence in you.''\n  I said, ``Don't you want me to explain?''\n  And Strom said, ``There's no need to explain. I know you.''\n  I will never forget what he said that day. ``There's no need to \nexplain. We know you.''\n  I have told this story before, but to this day, I can't think of many \nother people who would, having a significant political advantage, not \nonly not take it, but stand by me. That's the Strom Thurmond I know and \nwill always admire.\n  I have been honored to work with him, privileged to serve with him, \nand proud to call him my friend. As I said earlier: A long life may \nwell be the gift of a benevolent God, but a long life with an impact as \npowerful and lasting as his is the treasure of a grateful Nation.\n  Strom Thurmond is, without doubt, an American treasure.\n  The truth of the matter is that his longevity lies in his strength of \ncharacter, his absolute honesty and integrity, his sense of fairness, \nhis civility and dignity as a gentleman, and his commitment to public \nservice.\n  None of these things are skills you learn. They are qualities that \nburn deep within leaders like Strom Thurmond. And people who know him \nwell can sense them.\n  The measure of Strom Thurmond is not how long he has lived or how \nlong he has served, but the good he has done, the record of success he \nhas achieved, and the standard of leadership he has set.\n  The truth is that Strom's ongoing legacy is not about time, it is \nabout extraordinary leadership and dedicated service to the people of \nSouth Carolina and the nation.\n  And for that we say, ``Thank you, Strom, and a hundred more.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9870-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And I thank, \nalso on his behalf, those Senators who joined in this vote.\n  I do not know what the pleasure of the body is, Mr. President, but I \nam perfectly willing to move forward. I am not going to request a \nrollcall vote. I don't know if anyone else wishes to have one. I think \nto have had such an overwhelming vote--93 to 5--gives a pretty good \nunderstanding of where the body is on a piece of legislation such as \nthis that covers everything from drug abuse in juvenile areas, to \ncreating 20 new judges, to protecting our FBI in dangerous situations.\n  So, Mr. President, I am about to yield the floor, but I am perfectly \nwilling to just go forward on the legislation. Obviously, if anybody \nelse wants to speak on it or ask for a rollcall vote, that is their \nprerogative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ndiscuss the situation with respect to Iraq. At the outset, I compliment \nthe President for coming to Congress. I believe that, as a matter of \nconstitutional law, the President, as Commander in Chief, has the \nauthority to respond to emergencies, but when there is time for \ndiscussion, deliberation, debate, and a decision, then it is the \nresponsibility of the Congress, under the Constitution, to declare war \nand to take the United States to war.\n  Originally, there had been a contention that the President did not \nneed congressional authorization, but the President has decided to come \nto Congress, and I compliment him for doing that.\n  I also think that the President has moved wisely in seeking a \ncoalition of the United Nations, as President Bush in 1991 organized a \ncoalition, came to the Congress, and had authorization for the use of \nforce against Iraq which had invaded Kuwait. The assemblage of an \ninternational coalition is a very important item.\n  The issue of inspections is one which has to be pursued. To say that \nSaddam\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\nHussein is a difficult man to deal with, would be a vast \nunderstatement. He maneuvered and ousted the inspectors from Iraq some \n4 years ago.\n  It seems to me the inspections have to be thorough, total, \nunannounced, intrusive, going everywhere, however, there cannot be an \nexclusion for the President's palaces, which are very large tracts of \nland and could conceal great quantities of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Senator Shelby and I made a trip to the Sudan in August as part of a \ntrip to Africa. In the Sudan, we found that there is an interest on the \npart of the Sudanese Government in cooperating with the United States, \nand they have agreed to inspections of their arms factories and their \nlaboratories. They are no-notice inspections, where inspectors go in \nand break the locks, inspect, and take photographs anywhere, anytime, \nanyplace. I believe that has to be the format for inspections in Iraq.\n  I am concerned about the timing of an authorization or declaration of \nwar. I think an authorization for the use of force is tantamount or the \nequivalent to a declaration of war. That authorizes the President to \nwage war. It is a concern of mine as to whether there is authority for \nthe Congress under the Constitution to make this kind of a delegation.\n  The learned treatise written by Professor Francis D. Wormuth, \nprofessor of political science at the University of Utah, and Professor \nEdwin B. Firmage, professor of law at the University of Utah, engages \nin a very comprehensive analysis of this issue.\n  The background of the issue is that, when the Constitution and the \nthree branches of Government were formulated, Article I gave certain \nauthority to the Congress. One of the authorities that the Congress has \nis the authority to declare war. Article II gave authority to the \nexecutive branch, to the President, and Article III gave authority to \nthe courts.\n  The core legislative responsibilities, such as a declaration of war, \nhave been viewed as being non-delegable. They cannot be given to \nsomeone else. Professors Wormuth and Firmage say at the outset of \nchapter 13, on the delegation of the war power:\n\n       That Congress may not transfer to the executive . . . \n     functions for which Congress itself has been made \n     responsible.\n\n  The treatise further goes on at page 70 to point out--and I am \nleaving out references which are not directly relevant--but the two \nprofessors point out at page 70 that:\n\n       The Framers . . . never supposed that a state of war could \n     arise except as a result of a contemporaneous decision of \n     Congress on the basis of contemporary known facts.\n\n  In the Federalist Papers, Hamilton made an observation on this \nsubject, and it is cited again in the treatise by the two professors \nnoting that Hamilton in the Federalist Papers argued the system was \nsafe precisely because the President would never be able to exercise \nthis power, referring to the power to declare war or the power to use \nforce. While not cast specifically in the dialogue of delegation of \npower, the Federalist tracts, written by Hamilton and cited by Wormuth \nand Firmage, do argue about the limitations of Federal power.\n  The treatise by Professors Wormuth and Firmage then goes on to cite \nChief Justice Marshall, who said--and again I leave out materials which \nare not directly relevant--it will not be contended Congress can \ndelegate powers which are exclusively legislative.\n  Here you have a power, the power to declare war, which is a core \ncongressional power. Chief Justice Marshall has been the author of many \ndoctrines which have survived 200 years since he served as Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court of United States.\n  The treatise by Wormuth and Firmage then goes on to quote Clay, and \nthey cite this reference:\n\n       According to Clay, the Constitution requires that Congress \n     appraise the immediate circumstances before the Nation \n     voluntarily enters into a state of war.\n\n  That is at page 207. The treatise further points out, Clay's argument \nwas that:\n\n       Congress itself cannot make a declaration of a future war \n     dependent upon the occurrence of stipulated facts, because \n     war is an enterprise in which all the contemporary \n     circumstances must be weighed.\n\n  The treatise by Wormuth and Firmage goes on to point out that it is:\n\n       Impossible for Congress to enact governing standards for \n     launching future wars.\n\n  They note it is not possible to authorize the President:\n\n       To initiate a war in a future international environment in \n     which significant details, perhaps even major outlines, \n     change from month to month or even from day to day. The \n     posture of international affairs of the future cannot be \n     known to Congress at the time the resolution is passed.\n\n  So we have the generalized declaration that core congressional \nfunctions may not be delegated as a basic requirement under the \nconstitutional separation of powers, and then an articulation of the \nreasons as to why this is the law. That is because, as noted in the \nauthorities, the circumstances may change in a matter of months or, as \nnoted, even in a matter of days.\n  I am not unaware the Congress is proceeding on a timetable which is \nlikely to eventuate a vote next week, or if not next week, shortly \nthereafter. As is well-known, we are in an election season, with \nelections on November 5. Today is October 3. The closing date of the \nCongress had originally been set at October 4, which would have been \ntomorrow, Friday. It has been extended until October 11. Nobody is sure \nwhen we will adjourn. When asked the question as to when the Senate \nwill adjourn, I say the Senate adjourns when the last Senator stops \ntalking. We do not know precisely when that will be.\n\n  There is a move to have a vote before we leave town. Of course, we \ncould come back. When there is a matter as important as a resolution \nauthorizing the use of force, the equivalent of a declaration of war, \nthere is no congressional responsibility that is weighed more heavily, \nmore solemnly, or more importantly than that.\n  I am not naive enough to think anybody is going to go into court or \nthat a court would consider this, what we lawyers call a justiciable \nissue, or decide this sort of a matter. I do think it is a matter which \nought to be focused on by Members of the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives. I have not seen any public commentary on the issue.\n  I became very deeply involved on the legalisms of the doctrine of \nseparation of power 8 years ago when there was a base closing \ncommission where Congress delegated authority to a commission to decide \nwhich bases would be closed, and I think they inappropriately closed \nthe Philadelphia Navy Yard. I studied the subject in some detail--in \nfact, argued the matter in the Supreme Court of the United States--so \nwhen this issue has arisen, I have been concerned about what the \nCongress is doing. I have studied the issue and have raised these \nconcerns, which I want to share with my colleagues.\n  I am well aware of the argument that it would strengthen the \nPresident's hand to have a very strong vote from the Congress of the \nUnited States, as he is negotiating in the United Nations. Secretary of \nState Powell is seeking a tougher resolution before inspections start. \nThe U.N. inspectors met with the Iraqi officials and are talking about \nstarting inspections in 2 weeks. Secretary Powell yesterday said he \nwould like a tougher resolution so there are more stringent \nrequirements to be imposed on Iraq before the inspections go forward. \nThere are difficulties in dealing with the French, the Russians, and \nthe Chinese.\n  There is no doubt that a strong resolution by Congress supporting the \nPresident would give weight to the President's position. The \npredictions are generalized that the President can expect a very strong \nvote from the House of Representatives, based on what happened \nyesterday with the concurrence of Speaker Hastert and Democrat Leader \nGephardt. The sentiments of the Senate may be somewhat different, \nperhaps a little more deliberative, but the predictions are that a \nresolution will come from the Senate backing the President as well.\n  I think it is a momentous matter. It is one which we need to \nconsider. We need to consider all of the alternatives short of the use \nof force. We need to consider whether our objectives can be attained \nwithout sending American men and women into battle; without exposing \nIraqi civilians to casualties; without undertaking the problems of \nwar--the attendant body bags, collateral damage, and the death of \ncivilians, which is inevitable. We need to find a way to rid Iraq and \nthe world of Saddam Hussein, and have the appropriate\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\nassurances that there are not going to be weapons of mass destruction \nwhich threaten the United States or our neighbors.\n  There is a very serious concern as to what will happen with \nneighboring Israel. General Scowcroft, former National Security \nCouncil, wrote an article which appeared in the Wall Street Journal in \nAugust, raising a concern about an Armageddon, with the possibility of \na nuclear conflict if Iraq and Saddam Hussein unleash weapons of mass \ndestruction on Israel, and as to what the retaliation may be.\n  The consequences are very difficult to figure out. If we can find a \nway to get rid of Saddam Hussein; have the assurances that the world \nwill not be subjected to his maniacal impulses and his irrational \ntendencies, which includes his use already of chemical weapons in the \nIran war and on his own people, the Kurds; if we can find a way to do \nthat short of war, that certainly ought to be our objective. I raise \nthis constitutional issue so that my colleagues may consider it, as \nwell.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent I may proceed for an additional \n5 minutes on an unrelated subject, the confirmation of Judge James \nGardner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Confirmation of Judge James Gardner\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, yesterday in what is called wrap-up in \nthe Senate, by unanimous consent a Pennsylvania judge was confirmed. I \nhad not known that his confirmation was imminent, however, I am very \nglad it was and I am very glad it was accomplished. I thank the \nmanagers, including the Senator from Nevada.\n  I make a comment or two about Judge Gardner who was endorsed by \nSenator Santorum and me and passed our bipartisan nonpolitical \nnominating panel. Senator Santorum and I have maintained the practice \nwhich Senator Heinz and I had many years ago on submitting applicants \nto a commission which studies them, in addition to review by the \nAmerican Bar Association and by the FBI.\n  Judge Gardner graduated magna cum laude from Yale University, \nreceived his JD degree from Harvard University Law School, which is \nobviously an excellent educational background. He then joined a big \nfirm in Philadelphia, Duane, Morris & Heckscher, and later went to \nAllentown where he became a member of the law firm of Gardner, Gardner, \n& Racines.\n  He began his career in public service as Solicitor to the Lehigh \nCounty Treasury and later served as assistant district attorney in \nLehigh County. I must say that being assistant D.A. is very good \ntraining for anything. People ask me what is the best job I ever had, \nbeing a Senator or district attorney, and I say the best job I ever had \nwas assistant district attorney, getting to the courtroom and trying \ncases.\n  He has been on the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County for some 21 \nyears, presided over 265 jury trials, and written nearly 1,000 legal \nopinions, 138 of which have been published.\n  He is very active in community affairs. He is on the Board of \nDirectors of the Boys and Girls Club of Allentown and the Allentown \nPolice Athletic League. He has been awarded the Meritorious Service \nMedal from the President of the United States, and the Pennsylvania Bar \nAssociation's Special Achievement Award.\n  We have a practice of trying to accommodate litigants by having \nvarious stations in Pennsylvania: one in Johnstown, one in Bethlehem \nand in Lancaster, and of course we have the district court sitting in \nHarrisburg, in Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, and also Williamsport. Judge \nGardner will be handling the station in Allentown to accommodate \nlitigants so that they do not have to travel long distances to have \ntheir cases heard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from Kansas how long he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I would like to speak \nfor 15 minutes. I think there are other people who would like to speak, \nas well,\n  Mr. REID. We have spoken to the minority side. Senator Byrd wishes to \nuse his hour postcloture. I ask unanimous consent he be allowed to do \nthat beginning at 1:10, following the statement of the Senator from \nKansas. Postcloture, he is entitled to that. I ask he be allowed to \nspeak during that postcloture on any matter he wishes to talk about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we are on the judicial reauthorization \nbill that just received cloture. I was happy to see that taking place. \nI draw attention to the body to one particular provision that is \nimportant. It is J-1 visas. These visas are granted to people who were \nborn in another country, other than the United States, but trained \naccording to medical standards in the United States, in passing medical \nboards in the United States, and then able to serve throughout the \nUnited States. I know the Presiding Officer's State and my State are \ndependent on people born in foreign countries being able to provide \nmedical services in Kansas.\n  We have 105 counties and 20 that would be medically underserved if \nnot for this feature called J-1 visas for medically underserved \ncounties to have medical personnel, as I previously described.\n  Within the provision of the judicial reauthorization bill, it allows \nfor 30 J-1 visas on a per State, per year basis to work with \nrecruitment of medical personnel. My State of Kansas is dependent on \nthis feature. Twenty of our 105 counties would be medically underserved \nif not for J-1 visas. There was a problem within the old program that \nthe oversight was not sufficient.\n  After September 11, a number of people were concerned about who was \ngetting into the United States under these J-1 visas: Are they properly \nsupervised and properly observed, or is there potential for untoward \nelements that would come in this way that might seek to do harm to the \nUnited States? That was an area of concern. We were concerned about \neveryone coming to the United States at that point. This was another \narea where people had deep concerns.\n  This program, as we have revised it, has supervision in place to \nwatch this program and to meet the needs of States like Kansas where we \nhave significant areas of medically underserved populations and at the \nsame time meet the security needs of the United States so we do not \nallow in an individual who seeks to do harm to the rest of the United \nStates.\n\n  I worked in the Judiciary Committee. We worked on the Immigration \nSubcommittee. This bill got through the House of Representatives. \nCongressman Jerry Moran from my State worked over there. We have met \neveryone's concerns to get this passed through the needs of States such \nas my own, particularly for rural States because this is a chronic \nissue, with significantly underserved areas, aging population in some \ncounties that need more and more services and have more and more \ndifficulty getting medical personnel into the areas. This is working \nunder the J-1 category for medical doctors. We are using it for medical \ntechnologists. In the future we will need it for broader categories \nwithin health care as well, potentially for physical therapists and \nnurses, to get adequate personnel in places that are needed. It will be \na valuable feature, looking into the future.\n  Overall, the judicial reauthorization is a good bill, one that we \nshould pass. It is significant. We have not had one of these \nreauthorizations for some period of time. It is certainly the time to \nbe doing this, to bring this issue forward. I commend the chairman and \nranking member and those who have worked very hard in the conference \ncommittee to move this issue forward.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. As we look and move forward on the issue of Iraq and \nwar with Iraq and the potential of providing the President military \nauthorization, I hope the body and the Members and people across the \ncountry and across the world look at the potential of a post-Saddam \nIraq. Former Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and I worked, when he was in \nthe Senate, with a group called the Iraqi National Congress, an \numbrella group of opposition leaders, to try to bring to the forefront \nopposition groups, bring them together, and move forward with the track \nthat once Saddam is out, moving forward with a democracy, with human \nrights, civil liberties for the people of Iraq.\n  I think a lot of times we get caught too much in the downside \npotential. It\n\n[[Page S9873]]\n\nis not only whether we can get Saddam out. It is not only what are \ngoing to be the problems of doing this. Sometimes we do not see the \nupside potential.\n  There is clear downside potential in taking on Saddam Hussein, there \nis no question about that--potential loss of lives of our troops, our \npeople, terrorist threats, potential loss of life in the region, loss \nof life in Iraq. It is undeniable.\n  It is also unquestionable and undeniable that Saddam Hussein has \nkilled a number of people already, gassed his own people, attacked \nIran, gassed the Iranian people. He has continued to rule by fear. He \nhas killed people within his own Cabinet and his own family. This is a \nman who is familiar with evil and has exercised it.\n  What about after Saddam Hussein? What then? You have a country in \nthat region that has a history of rudimentary democracy. From 1921 \nuntil 1958, they had a constitutional monarchy, where you had a monarch \nbut you also had a parliament that was elected by the people. They had \ncontrol over budgets and ministers in the various areas of the Cabinet. \nIt is not the level of our democracy today, but probably the level of \nthe English democracy in the mid-1800s. They had a functioning \ndemocracy where they elected people and they had real legitimate \nauthority within that. There is that basis.\n  This is one of the oldest civilizations in the world where Iraq is. \nThey would say this is the cradle of civilization, it has been there \nfor thousands of years--and it has. It is an urban society. Eighty \npercent of the population are in urban areas. It is a well educated \npopulace that is there. It is also sitting on 10 percent of the world's \noil supply. So it has the ability to generate enough income to rebuild \nand grow itself.\n  My point in saying all of that is that post-Saddam, when you get this \nman, who has brought so much evil to that region of the world and to \nthe rest of the world, out of there, you have the basis of a real, \ngrowing, healthy, vibrant, democratic, free-market society. People are \ngoing to be free, and they are going to have liberty, and there is \ngoing to be great joy there for that possibility, and to be able to \nmove forward in a region of the world that has not known much in the \nway of democracy.\n  Outside of Israel and Turkey, you don't have democracies in that \nregion of the world. You don't have any freedoms. You have a lot of \nresources, but you have a lot of poverty. That is because systems \nmatter, and they have had systems that have been totalitarian in \nnature.\n  Iraq has a history that is different. Until 1958, when there was a \nmilitary coup, this was an operating country with many democratic \nfeatures within it. They can build on that. Once that is established in \nIraq, you move forward and press for democracy, and that is going to \ninfect the entire region for democracy, human rights, religious \nfreedom, pluralism, tolerance, free markets. Then it is going to be \nable to spread throughout.\n  As former Secretary Henry Kissinger said at a hearing we had last \nweek, he views that if we go in and deal with Iraq, it is going to have \na very positive, salutary effect on the war on terrorism. It is going \nto say to a number of countries that we are serious about dealing with \nterrorists, we are serious that countries that house and support \nterrorists are our enemies; you are either with us or against us in the \nwar on terrorism.\n  If we do not go at Iraq, our effort in the war on terrorism dwindles \ninto an intelligence operation. If we go at Iraq it says to countries \nthat support terrorists--and there remain six in the world that fit our \ndefinition of state-sponsored terrorists--you say to those countries \nthat we are serious about terrorism and we are serious about you not \nsupporting terrorism on your own soil. This is going to be a big \nstatement we will make.\n  It is with a great deal of difficulty and it is with a great deal of \ncost. But the option of doing nothing is far worse than the option of \ndoing something and acting now. The upside potential of our acting and \nhelping allow the Iraqi people their freedom to be able to move forward \nwith a democracy is significant upside potential, within that region, \nfor liberty and freedom to expand throughout that area.\n  We will have this debate on granting military authority to the \nPresident, which is going to be a significant debate in this body. \nHopefully, we will look at all the issues, and I think we will. \nParticularly, we should look at things such as: Is Saddam Hussein going \nto be able to get weapons of mass destruction to terrorists and out of \nthe country to attack other people during this period of time?\n  I hope we will also look at the downside of not doing something and \nthe upside of helping people pursue freedom and liberty, such as what \nhas the potential of taking place in Iraq and pursuing a democracy \nthere.\n  I point out to people who are not familiar with this, Saddam Hussein \ndoes not control the whole country. He doesn't control the north of \nIraq, the Kurdish region. It was reported that a number of Kurdish \ntroops who are there are outside of his control. He has sporadic \ncontrol in the south of the country. He controls it during the day; at \nother times, he doesn't. His main control is in the center, in the \nBaghdad region of the country. This is not a homogeneous population, \nnor is it completely under his authoritarian rule. We will be able to \nwork with populations in both the north and south to build pressure on \nhim in the center of this country when we move forward, addressing and \ndealing with Saddam Hussein.\n  It is a big issue. It is a big issue for the country. It is a big \nissue for the world. It is a big issue for liberty. It is a big issue, \ndealing with a very militant, politicized strain of Islam in that \nregion, and particularly in Iraq, that Saddam Hussein seeks to exploit. \nYou know, he would not view himself associated with it, but he is \ncertainly working to exploit that at this point in time. This is an \nimportant argument and discussion for this country and for the world.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Rush to Iraq Resolution Ignores Unanswered Questions\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Titus Livius, one of the greatest of Roman \nhistorians, said:\n\n       All things will be clear and distinct to the man who does \n     not hurry; haste is blind and improvident.\n\n  ``Blind and improvident''--``Blind and improvident.''\n  Congress would be wise to heed those words today, for as sure as the \nSun rises in the East, this country is embarking on a course of action \nwith regard to Iraq that is both blind and improvident. We are rushing \ninto war without fully discussing why, without thoroughly considering \nthe consequences, or without making any attempt to explore what steps \nwe might take to avert the conflict.\n  The newly bellicose mood that permeates this White House is \nunfortunate--unfortunate--all the more so because it is clearly \nmotivated by campaign politics. Republicans are already running attack \nads against Democrats on Iraq. Democrats favor fast approval of a \nresolution so they can change the subject to domestic economic \nproblems.\n  Before risking the lives--I say to you, the people out there who are \nwatching through those electronic lenses--before risking the lives of \nyour sons and daughters, American fighting men and women, all Members \nof Congress--Democrats and Republicans alike--must overcome the siren \nsong of political polls and focus strictly on the merits and not the \npolitics of this most grave, this most serious undertaking--this most \ngrave, this most serious issue that is before us.\n  The resolution--S.J. Res. 46--which will be before this Senate is not \nonly a product of haste, it is also a product of Presidential hubris. \nThis resolution is breathtaking--breathtaking--in its scope. It \nredefines the nature of defense. It reinterprets the Constitution to \nsuit the will of the executive branch. This Constitution, which I hold \nin my hand, is amended without going through the constitutional process \nof amending this Constitution.\n\n[[Page S9874]]\n\n  S.J. Res. 46 would give the President blanket authority to launch a \nunilateral preemptive attack on a sovereign nation that is perceived to \nbe a threat to the United States--a unilateral preemptive attack on a \nsovereign nation that is perceived to be a threat to the United States.\n  This is an unprecedented and unfounded interpretation of the \nPresident's authority under the Constitution of the United States, not \nto mention the fact that it stands the charter of the United Nations on \nits head.\n  Representative Abraham Lincoln, in a letter to William H. Herndon, \nstated:\n\n       Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever \n     he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you \n     allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it \n     necessary for such purpose--and you allow him to make war at \n     pleasure. Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power \n     in this respect, after you have given him so much as you \n     propose. If, to-day, he should choose to say he thinks it \n     necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British from \n     invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, ``I \n     see no probability of the British invading us'' but he will \n     say to you ``be silent; I see it, if you don't.''\n       The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making \n     power to Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the \n     following reasons. Kings had always been involving and \n     impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if \n     not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, \n     our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all \n     Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the \n     Constitution that no one man should hold the power of \n     bringing this oppression upon us. But your view destroys the \n     whole matter, and places our President where kings have \n     always stood.\n\n  If he could speak to us today, what would Lincoln say of the Bush \ndoctrine concerning preemptive strikes?\n  In a September 18 report, the Congressional Research Service had this \nto say about the preemptive use of military force:\n\n       The historical record indicates that the United States has \n     never, to date, engaged in a ``preemptive'' military attack \n     against another nation. Nor has the United States ever \n     attacked another nation militarily prior to its first having \n     been attacked or prior to U.S. citizens or interests first \n     having been attacked, with the singular exception of the \n     Spanish-American War. The Spanish-American War is unique in \n     that the principal goal of the United States military action \n     was to compel Spain to grant Cuba its political independence.\n\n  The Congressional Research Service also noted the Cuban Missile \nCrisis of 1962:\n\n       . . . represents a threat situation which some may argue \n     had elements more parallel to those presented by Iraq today--\n     but it was resolved without a ``preemptive'' military attack \n     by the United States.\n\n  Article I, section 8, of the Constitution grants Congress the power \nto declare war and to call forth the militia ``to execute the Laws of \nthe Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.'' Nowhere--\nnowhere--in this Constitution, which I hold in my hand--nowhere in the \nConstitution is it written the President has the authority to call \nforth the militia to preempt a perceived threat. And yet the resolution \nwhich will be before the Senate avers that the President ``has \nauthority under the Constitution to take action in order to deter and \nprevent acts of international terrorism against the United States, as \nCongress recognized in the joint resolution on Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force'' following the September 11 terrorist attack.\n  What a cynical twisting of words. What a cynical twisting of words. \nThe reality is Congress, exercising the authority granted to it under \nthe Constitution, granted the President specific and limited authority \nto use force against the perpetrators of the September 11 attack. \nNowhere--nowhere--was there an implied recognition of inherent \nauthority under the Constitution to ``deter and prevent'' future acts \nof terrorism. It is not in there. It is not in that Constitution. There \nis no inference of it. There is no implication of it for that purpose.\n  Think, for a moment, of the precedent that this resolution will set, \nnot just for this President--hear me now, you on the other side of the \naisle--not just for this President but for future Presidents. From this \nday forward, American Presidents will be able to invoke Senate Joint \nResolution 45 as justification for launching preemptive military \nstrikes against any sovereign nations they perceive to be a threat.\n  You better pay attention. You are not always going to have a \nPresident of your party in the White House. How will you feel about it \nthen?\n  Other nations will be able to hold up the United States--hold up the \nUSA--as the model to justify their military adventures. Do you not \nthink, Mr. President, that India and Pakistan, China and Taiwan, Russia \nand Georgia, are closely watching the outcome of this debate? Do you \nnot think future adversaries will look to this moment to rationalize \nthe use of military force to achieve who knows what ends?\n  Perhaps a case can be made Iraq poses such a clear and immediate \ndanger to the United States that preemptive military action is the only \nway to deal with that threat. To be sure, weapons of mass destruction \nare a 20th century and 21st century horror the Framers of the \nConstitution had no way of foreseeing. But they did foresee the frailty \nof human nature. And they saw the inherent danger of concentrating too \nmuch power in one individual. They saw that. That is why the Framers \nbestowed on Congress--not the President--the power to declare war.\n\n  As James Madison wrote, in 1793:\n\n       In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found, \n     than in the clause which confides the question of war or \n     peace to the legislature, and not to the executive \n     department. Beside the objection to such a mixture of \n     heterogeneous powers, the trust and the temptation would be \n     too great for any one man. . . .\n\n  That was James Madison: ``the trust and the temptation would be too \ngreat for any one man.''\n  Mr. President, Congress has a responsibility to exercise with extreme \ncare the power to declare war. A war against Iraq will affect \nthousands--if not tens of thousands, and even hundreds of thousands--of \nlives and perhaps alter the course of history. It will surely affect \nthe balance of power in the Middle East. It is not a decision to be \ntaken in haste, as we are being pushed today, as we are being stampeded \ntoday to act in haste. Put it behind us, they say, before the election.\n  It will surely affect the balance of power in the Middle East. It is \nnot a decision to be taken in haste under the glare of election-year \npolitics and the pressure of artificial deadlines. And yet any observer \ncan see that is exactly, that is precisely what the Senate is proposing \nto do--the Senate and the House.\n  What a shame. Fie upon the Congress. Fie upon some of the so-called \nleaders of the Congress for falling into this pit.\n  The Senate is rushing to vote on whether to declare war on Iraq \nwithout pausing to ask why. We don't have time to ask why. We don't \nhave time to get the answers to that question: Why? Why is war being \ndealt with not as a last resort but as a first resort?\n  Why is Congress being pressured to act now, as of today, I believe 33 \ndays before a general election, when a third of the Senate and the \nentire House of Representatives are in the final, highly politicized \nweeks of election campaigns? Why?\n  As recently as Tuesday, October 1--this past Tuesday--the President \nsaid he had not yet made up his mind. As late as this past Tuesday, he \nhad not yet made up his mind about whether to go to war with Iraq. And \nyet Congress is being exhorted, is being importuned, is being adjured \nto give the Presi-\ndent open-ended--open-ended--authority now--give it to him now--\nto exercise whenever he pleases in the event that he decides to invade \nIraq.\n\n  Where are we? Where are our senses? Why is Congress elbowing past the \nPresident to authorize a military campaign that the President may or \nmay not even decide to pursue? Aren't we getting a little ahead of \nourselves?\n  The last U.N. weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are \nconfident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and \nbiological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to \nbuild up his chemical and biological warfare capability. Intelligence \nreports also indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons but has not \nyet achieved nuclear capability.\n  It is now October in this year of Our Lord 2002. Four years have gone \nby in which neither this administration nor the previous one felt \ncompelled to invade Iraq to protect against the imminent threat of \nweapons of mass destruction, until today, until now, until\n\n[[Page S9875]]\n\n33 days before election day. Now we are being told that we must act \nimmediately. We must put this issue behind us. We must put this \nquestion behind us. We must act immediately, we are told, before \nadjournment and before the elections.\n  Why the rush? Is it our precious blood which will spew forth from our \nfeeble veins? No. Those of you who have children, those of you who have \ngrandchildren, those of you who have great-grandchildren should be \nthinking: It is the precious blood of the men and women who wear the \nuniform of these United States; that blood may flow in the streets of \nIraq.\n  Yes, we had September 11. But we must not make the mistake of looking \nat the resolution before us as just another offshoot of the war on \nterror.\n  We know who is behind the September 11 attacks on the United States. \nWe know it was Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida terrorist network. We \nhave dealt with al-Qaida and with the Taliban government that sheltered \nit. We have routed them from Afghanistan. We are continuing to pursue \nthem in hiding. So where does Iraq enter into the equation? Where?\n  No one in the administration has been able to produce any solid \nevidence linking Iraq to the September 11 attack. Iraq had biological \nand chemical weapons long before September 11. We knew it then. We \nhelped to give Iraq the building blocks for biological weapons. We know \nit now.\n  Iraq has been an enemy of the United States for more than a decade. \nIf Saddam Hussein is such an imminent threat to the United States, why \nhasn't he attacked us already? The fact that Osama bin Laden attacked \nthe United States does not de facto mean that Saddam Hussein is now in \na lock-and-load position and is readying an attack on these United \nStates. Slow down. Think. Ask questions. Debate.\n  In truth, there is nothing in the deluge of administration rhetoric \nover Iraq that is of such moment that it would preclude the Senate from \nsetting its own timetable and taking the time for a thorough and \ninformed discussion of this crucial issue. What is the matter with us? \nWe are the elected representatives. We are the most immediate elected \nrepresentatives of the American people across this land. What is wrong \nwith our taking the time to ask questions?\n  The American people want questions asked. It is not unpatriotic to \nask questions. Why shouldn't we ask questions? Why do we have to be \nrushed into voting on S.J. Res. 46? We should have an informed \ndiscussion of this crucial issue.\n  The President is using the Oval Office as a bully pulpit to sound the \ncall to arms, but it is from Capitol Hill that such orders must flow. \nRead the Constitution of the United States. The orders must flow from \nCapitol Hill, not from the Oval Office.\n  The people, through their elected representatives in Congress, must \nmake that decision. Why don't we have time? Why don't we take time? We \nmake a huge mistake in deciding this issue in an effort to ``get it \nbehind us.'' We are not going to get this issue behind us. It is not \ngoing to be put behind us.\n  It is here that debate must take place and where the full spectrum of \nthe public's desires, concerns, and misgivings must be heard. If \nSenators will have the backbone to speak out, to ask questions, to \ndemand the answers to questions, the American people are waiting. They \nare listening. They want answers to their questions.\n  I hear no clamor to go to war from my people. I hear only the \ntelephones incessantly ringing, saying: Keep asking questions. We want \nto know why. Stand up for us, Senator.\n  It is here that debate must take place. We should not allow ourselves \nto be pushed into one course or another in the face of a full-court \npublicity press from the White House. We have, rather, a duty to the \nNation and to the sons and daughters of this Nation to carefully \nexamine all possible courses of action and to consider the long-term \nconsequences of any decision to act.\n  As to the separation of powers, Justice Louis Brandeis observed:\n\n       The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the \n     Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency but to preclude \n     the exercise of arbitrary power.\n\n  No one supports Saddam Hussein. If he were to disappear tomorrow, no \none would shed a tear around the world, other than possibly tears of \nthanksgiving. I would not. My handkerchief would remain dry. But the \nprinciple of one government deciding to eliminate another government, \nusing force to do so, and taking that action in spite of world \ndisapproval is a very disquieting thing.\n  Where does it end? What nation will be next? I am concerned that it \nhas the effect of destabilizing the world community of nations. I am \nconcerned that it fosters a climate of suspicion and mistrust in U.S. \nrelations with other nations. The United States is not a rogue nation \ngiven to unilateral action in the face of worldwide opprobrium.\n  We are about to change the face of the United States, a nation which \nbelieves in liberty, justice, and human rights. What are we about to \nchange? What is it going to be? What is the new image of the United \nStates going to be? That of a bully, ready to draw both guns and start \nshooting immediately? This is preemptive action, isn't it?\n  I am concerned about the consequences of a United States invasion of \nIraq. It is difficult to imagine that Saddam Hussein, who has been \nruthless in gaining power, ruthless in staying in power, would give up \nwithout a fight. He is a man who has not shirked from using chemical \nweapons against his own people. I fear he would use everything in his \narsenal against an invasion force, or against an occupation force, up \nto and including whatever chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons he \nmight still have.\n  Iraq is not Afghanistan, impoverished by decades of war, internal \nstrife, tribal conflict, and stifling religious oppression. Though its \nmilitary forces are much diminished--and ours are somewhat diminished--\nIraq has a strong central command and much greater governmental control \nover its forces and its people. It is a large country that has spent \nyears on a wartime footing, and it still has some wealth.\n  Nor do I think the Iraqi people would necessarily rise up against \nSaddam Hussein in the event of a United States invasion, even if there \nis an undercurrent of support for his overthrow. The Iraqi people have \nspent decades living in fear of Saddam Hussein and his network of \ninformers and security forces. There has been no positive showing, that \nI know of, in the form of riots or large and active internal opposition \ngroups, that popular sentiment in Iraq supports a governmental \noverthrow or the installation of a democratic or republican form of \ngovernment. There is no tradition of democracy in Iraq's long history. \nThere is, however, a natural instinct to favor the known over the \nunknown, and in this instance the United States is an unknown factor.\n  The President and his Cabinet have suggested that this would be a war \nof relatively short duration. If that is true--which I doubt--why would \nthe Iraqi populace rush to welcome the United States forces? In a few \nweeks, they might have to answer to the remnants of Saddam Hussein's \nsecurity forces. A prudent Iraqi would just put his or her head under \nthe bed covers and not come out until the future became clear. Who \nknows, we might be lucky. We have been pretty lucky thus far in some of \nour adventures. We might be. But we might not be lucky. A United States \ninvasion of Iraq that proved successful, and that resulted in the \noverthrow of the government, would not be a simple effort. The \naftermath of that effort would require a long-term occupation.\n  The President has said he would overthrow Saddam Hussein and \nestablish a new government that would recognize all interest groups in \nIraq. This would presumably include the Kurds to the north and the \nShiite Muslims to the south because the entire military and security \napparatus of Iraq would have to be replaced. The United States would \nhave to provide interim security throughout the countryside.\n  This kind of nation building cannot be accomplished with the wave of \na wand by some fairy godmother--even one with the full might and power \nof the world's last remaining superpower behind her.\n  To follow through on the proposal outlined by the President would \nrequire the commitment of a large number of U.S. forces--forces that \ncannot be used for other missions, such as homeland defense--for an \nextended period of time. It will take time to confirm that Iraq's \nprograms to develop\n\n[[Page S9876]]\n\nweapons of mass destruction are well and truly destroyed. It will take \ntime to root out all of the elements of Saddam Hussein's government, \nmilitary and security forces, and to build a new government and \nsecurity elements. It will take time to establish a new and legitimate \ngovernment and to conduct free and fair elections. It will cost \nbillions of dollars--your dollars, the taxpayers of America--to do this \nas well. And the forces to carry out this mission and pay for this \nmission will come from the United States. There can be little question \nof that.\n  If the rest of the world doesn't want to come with us at the outset, \nit seems highly unlikely that they would line up for the follow-\nthrough, even though their own security might be improved by the \nelimination of a rogue nation's weapons of destruction.\n  So if the Congress authorizes such a mission, we must be prepared for \nwhat will follow. The Congressional Budget Office has already made some \nestimations regarding the cost of a possible war with Iraq. In a \nSeptember 30 report, CBO estimates that the incremental costs--the \ncosts that would be incurred above those budgeted for routine \noperations--would be between $9 billion and $13 billion a month, \ndepending on the actual force size deployed. Prosecuting a war would \ncost between $6 billion and $9 billion a month. Since the length of the \nwar cannot be predicted, CBO could give no total battle estimate. After \nhostilities end, the cost to return U.S. forces to their home bases \nwould range between $5 billion and $7 billion, according to the CBO. \nAnd the incremental costs of an occupation following combat operations \nvaries from $1 billion to $4 billion a month. This estimate does not \ninclude any cost of rebuilding or humanitarian assistance.\n  That is a steep price to pay in dollars. But dollars are only a part \nof the equation. There are many formulas to calculate costs in the form \nof dollars, but it is much more difficult to calculate costs in the \nform of human lives--in the form of deaths on the battlefield and death \nfrom the wounds and diseases that flow from the den of battle.\n  Iraq may be a weaker nation militarily than it was during the Persian \nGulf war, but its leader is no less determined and its weapons are no \nless lethal. During the Persian Gulf war, the United States was able to \nconvince Saddam Hussein that the use of weapons of mass destruction \nwould result in his being toppled from power. This time around, the \nobject of an invasion of Iraq is to topple Saddam Hussein, so he has no \nreason to exercise restraint.\n  Now, we are being told by the White House, let him be assassinated: \nThe cost of one bullet would be much less than the cost of a war. Now \nthis Nation is embarking, isn't it, on a doctrine of assassination of \nother leaders of the world? Is the ban on assassinations being lifted? \nWhat do we hear from the White House? Are we going to revert to the age \nof the Neanderthals, the cavemen?\n  The questions surrounding the wisdom of declaring war on Iraq are \nmany, and they are serious. The answers are too few and too glib. This \nis no way to embark on war. The Senate must address these questions \nbefore acting on this kind of sweeping use-of-force resolution. We do \nnot need more rhetoric from the White House War Room. We do not need \nmore campaign slogans or fundraising letters. We, the American people \nneed information and informed debate, because it is their sons, it is \ntheir daughters, it is their blood, it is their treasure, it is their \nchildren, men and women who are killed in the heat of battle.\n  Before rushing to war, we should focus on those things that pose the \nmost direct threat to us--those facilities and those weapons that form \nthe body of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. The United \nNations is the proper forum to deal with the inspection of these \nfacilities and the destruction of any weapons discovered.\n  If United Nations inspectors can enter the country, inspect those \nfacilities, and mark for destruction the ones that truly belong to a \nweapons program, then Iraq can be declawed without unnecessary risk or \nloss of life. That would be the best answer for Iraq. That would be the \nbest answer for the United States. That would be the best answer for \nthe world. But if Iraq again chooses to interfere with such an ongoing \nand admittedly intrusive inspection regime, then, and only then, should \nthe United States, with the support of the world, take stronger \nmeasures.\n  This is what Congress did in 1991 before the Persian Gulf war. The \nUnited States at that time gave the United Nations the lead in \ndemanding that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait. The U.S. took the time to \nbuild a coalition of partners. When Iraq failed to heed the U.N., then \nand only then did Congress authorize the use of force. That is the \norder in which the steps to war should be taken.\n  Everyone wants to protect our Nation. Everyone wants to protect our \npeople. To do that in the most effective way possible, we should avail \nourselves of every opportunity to minimize the number of American \ntroops we put at risk. Seeking, once again, to allow the United Nations \ninspecting regime to peacefully seek and destroy the facilities and \nequipment employed in the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction program \nwould be the least costly and the most effective way of reducing the \nrisk to our Nation, provided that it is backed up by a credible threat \nof force if Iraq, once again, attempts to thwart the inspections.\n  We can take a measured, stepped-up approach that would still leave \nopen the possibility of a ground invasion if that, indeed, should \nbecome the last resort and become necessary. But there is no way to \ntake that step now.\n  Mr. President, I urge restraint. Let us draw back from haste. \nPresident Bush gave the United States the opening to deal effectively \nwith the threat posed by Iraq. The United Nations embraced his \nexhortation and is working to develop a new and tougher inspection \nregime with firm deadlines and swift and sure accountability. Let us be \nconvinced that a reinvigorated inspection regime cannot work before we \nmove to any next step. Let us, if we must employ force, employ the most \nprecise and limited use of force necessary to get the job done.\n  Let us guard against the perils of haste, lest the Senate fall prey \nto the dangers of taking action that is both blind and improvident.\n  Mr. President, a paraphrase of Jefferson would be that the dogs of \nwar are too vicious to be unleashed by any one man alone; that the \nFramers of the Constitution thought the representatives of the people \nin the legislative branch ought to make these determinations.\n  Let us sober up. Let us sober ourselves. Let us take hold of \nourselves. Let us move back from this engine of haste and destruction, \nthis desire to get it over, this desire to get it behind us before the \nelections.\n  Here we have a resolution, S.J. Res. 46, nine pages of beautifully \nflowered ``whereases,'' nine pages. Here we have a resolution by which \nthe Senate of the United States and the House of Representatives would \nbe abdicating, pushing aside our responsibility to make decisions about \ngoing to war.\n  This is an abdication of our responsibilities. Here it is; what a \nshame; what a rag; it is enough to make those eagles up there scream, \nthe eagles beside the clock--for a period that is unlimited in time. \nHear me, hear me now, listen to this resolution on which we are going \nto vote. For a period of time that is unlimited, the President of the \nUnited States is authorized to make war anywhere he determines is in \nsome way linked to the threat posed by Iraq--anytime, anywhere, and in \nany way.\n  Get that. That is what this amounts to. This is a blank check, nine \npages. A blank check. A blank check with whereas clauses serving as \nfigleaves. That is what it is, a blank check with beautifully flowered \nwhereas clauses serving as figleaves. This is a blank check. There it \nis.\n  Look at it, nine pages, a blank check that does not simply remove us \nas representatives of the people from decisionmaking about the use of \nforce now or the use of force in Iraq. It removes us as representatives \nof the people from making decisions about the use of war so far in the \nfuture as we can see. It removes us. You cannot make anything outside \nof it. It is plain.\n  I know it is obfuscated and it is all sugar-coated with these \nfigleaves of ``whereases.'' That means, let's say in the year 2014, the \nCongress will have no role in determining whether military\n\n[[Page S9877]]\n\nforce should be used in some country linked with Iraq or some purpose \nrelated to Iraq. The President can send military forces into war \nwherever he determines, and it may not be the President we now have. It \nundoubtedly will be another President because this goes on into the \nfuture, as far as the human eye can see.\n\n  Under the Constitution, we are abdicating the congressional power to \nthe President of the United States. He can send military forces into \nwar wherever he determines it is in some way related to the \n``continuing threat'' posed by Iraq. This resolution, this power, this \nblank check, does not terminate if the regime is changed in Iraq. This \nresolution, this power, does not terminate if inspectors are allowed \nthroughout Iraq. This resolution does not terminate if Iraq is disarmed \nand all of its weapons and weapons facilities are removed. No. The \npower goes on. You better read it--read it and weep.\n  This resolution says that we, the Congress of the United States, are \nturning over our constitutional responsibility to the President for as \nlong as there is some threat as the President determines; use whatever \nmilitary forces he wants; wherever he wants to use them; as long as he \ndetermines it is necessary to react to the threat posed by Iraq and \nthose working, no doubt, with Iraq, others that he can see as their \nallies.\n  Do we want to do that? Do we want to abdicate congressional \nresponsibility under the Constitution of the United States to this \nPresident or any President of any political party? Is that what we \nwant? Do we want to be able to just wash our hands of it and say it is \nall up to the President; we turned it all over to the President?\n  This resolution--it is nine pages--changes the constitutional \npresumption that the Congress makes the determination about whether to \ngo to war and for the foreseeable future gives it to a single person \nelected by a minority of the people.\n  Ronald Reagan, for example, was elected by one-fourth of the eligible \nvoters of this country. So we turn this momentous power, this \nunimaginable power, over to one person, the President of the United \nStates, elected by a minority of the people. The whereas clauses are \npretty. Oh, they are pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, \npretty whereas clauses, but they are just window dressing. That is all. \nThey are just figleaves.\n  All that is necessary is the President's own determination. Why do we \ntake up all this space? Why do we take up nine pages? Why waste all \nthis paper? It is nine pages of beautifully phrased ``whereases.'' If \nwe want to pass this resolution, we can pass it by cutting it down to \none sentence. That is all we need, one sentence. We do not have to have \nall of this window dressing, all this sugar coating, on this bitter \npill. One sentence is all we need. One page is all we need.\n  That sentence could simply say, and it would be legally the same as \nthis document--hear me--we could say the President is authorized to use \nthe Armed Forces of the United States for as long as he wants, wherever \nhe wants, and in any manner he wants, without any approval by Congress, \nas long as he determines it is necessary to defend against a threat \nposed by Iraq, in his own determination.\n  Let me read that again. Let's dispose of the 9 pages. All we need is \none sentence in order to do exactly what the 9 pages would do. All that \nis necessary is the President's own determination. We can save a lot of \nspace. We can save a lot of paper if we want to pass this resolution by \ncutting it down to one sentence, and that sentence could simply say--\nand it would be legally the same as this 9-page document--the President \nis authorized to use the Armed Services of the United States for as \nlong as he wants, wherever he wants, in any manner he wants, without \nany approval by Congress, as long as he determines it is necessary to \ndefend against a threat posed by Iraq, in his own determination. \nNothing else is needed but that sentence.\n  The rest of it is of no legal consequence, just window dressing. That \nis the blank check part of this resolution.\n  Let us guard against the perils of haste, lest the Senate fall prey \nto the dangers of taking action that is both blind and improvident.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that under the \nconference report rules I be allowed to speak for up to an hour and do \nit on the subject of Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I say to my friend from West Virginia, \nthe distinguished Senator, a great leader in the Senate, that he has \nbeen a voice of sanity and reason. He has been a voice that the \nAmericans have wanted to hear.\n  This is one of the most solemn duties we have, and the fact that it \nwas going to be rushed and the fact that it came right before an \nelection and the fact that we have so many unanswered questions, those \nthings are weighing on this Senator's shoulders. I am so pleased the \nSenator from West Virginia, from his perspective, as someone who has \nserved so well and for so long, was able to speak out as he has.\n  I do not know where we will wind up on this, but I do know we are \ngoing to have alternatives. I think the fact that we will have \nalternatives, in many ways, is because the Senator from West Virginia \nfrom day 1--remember the day 1--when our President did not even want to \ncome to Congress, when his staff was saying to the President it was not \nnecessary, that the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, said, just a \nmoment, read the Constitution.\n  So before I begin, I thank my friend for his remarks.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from the \ngreat State of California for her gracious remarks. I thank her, too, \nfor what she stands for, for standing up for the Constitution and for \nrepresenting the people of her great State so well, so consistently, \nand so effectively.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it means a great deal to me that the \nSenator has said these words.\n  One of the most sacred, one of the most humbling, one of the most \nimportant--let me say the most important--roles Congress has to play is \ndetermining whether our country should send its sons and daughters to \nwar.\n\n  The role of Congress in war and peace must not be ignored. We can \nread it right out of the Constitution. Article I, section 8, says the \nfollowing: The Congress shall have power to declare war.\n  What has made me proud is that the American people understand this. I \nbelieve they understand it better than some in the administration who \nstarted off in August saying the President did not have to come to \nCongress in order to go to war with Iraq. To be specific, on August 26, \nthe Washington Post quoted a senior administration official who said:\n\n       We don't want to be in the legal position of asking \n     Congress to authorize the use of force when the President \n     already has the full authority. We don't want, in getting a \n     resolution, to have conceded that one was constitutionally \n     necessary.\n\n  It is clear the American people will not support a war against Iraq \nwithout the agreement of Congress. According to a USA Today-CNN poll, \n69 percent of the American people favored military action with the \nsupport of Congress; only 37 percent favored military action if \nCongress opposed the move. It is also important to point out that 79 \npercent of the American people support the use of force if it were \nsupported by the United Nations; only 37 percent favored action without \nUnited Nations support.\n  This is not a minor point. This administration did not want to come \nto Congress; and then, when it decided to do so because--frankly, they \nunderstood the views of the American people--they sent over a \nresolution which was the most incredible blank check I have ever seen. \nIts provisions basically said that even if Iraq complied with \ninspection and dismantlement, the administration could still go to war \nif Iraq failed to provide documentation, for example, on Kuwaiti POWs \nor because of its illicit trade outside the Oil-for-Food Program. Those \nissues certainly need to be addressed. There are very few people--I \ndon't know of any--who believe those reasons should be enough to send \nour men and women and our bombs to Iraq.\n  In addition, the original resolution gave the President the authority \nto use force not only in Iraq but in the entire\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\nregion. When those in Congress--mostly Democrats but some Republicans, \ntoo--said we needed to deliberate on this important issue, take time to \ndebate it and discuss it and ask questions, we were hit by a barrage of \ncriticism from the Republican leadership and immediately the issue was \nmade political.\n  Representative Tom Davis, Chairman of the National Republican \nCongressional Committee, said:\n\n       People are going to want to know before the election where \n     their representatives stand.\n\n  Now, despite this pressure, I am proud to say my colleagues are not \nsitting back. We are going to fulfill our obligations under the \nConstitution. We are fulfilling our obligations to debate war and \npeace. We are not allowing this administration to ignore our views, our \nopinions, and our heartfelt concerns about America's sons and daughters \nand the innocent victims of war.\n  While there are some in the administration who believe taking up the \nIraq issue now will hurt Democrats, I am not so sure. I am not so sure \nthe American people want us to roll over and be silent on this. I am \nnot so sure the American people don't want us to see it as our duty to \ncheck and balance this administration. Already, because of our voices, \nthe resolution offered by the President has been changed. In my view, \nit is still a very blank check for war with Iraq. I certainly cannot \nsupport a blank check. I think it is an affront to the people of this \ncountry to do that. Originally, it was an even blanker check, allowing \nthe President to go to war anyplace in the region.\n\n  The role of checks and balances that we play is already evident. I \nknow that. I also know in the greatest country on the face of this \nEarth, in the country that is great because of its middle class and its \nproductivity, in that country, in our country, it is necessary to not \nonly deal with the issue of Iraq, to deal with the issue of terrorism, \nto protect our people when they fly in an airplane or walk past a \nnuclear plant or a chemical plant or cross a bridge, it is also \nimportant to deal with the impact of this administration's economic \nrecord: The worse stock market decline in 70 years, the worst economic \ngrowth in 50 years, the greatest loss of jobs in the private sector in \n50 years, and the threat that people feel from retirement insecurity \nand job insecurity, runaway health care costs, and a falling median \nincome.\n  Now, there are those who say the administration is bringing up Iraq \nnow to avoid scrutiny from this volatile and miserable economy. There \nhave been memos that show this to be their strategy. There have been \nanonymous statements to this effect. And whether that is true or not, I \nleave to the American people. I trust the American people to look at \nthis.\n  We must take care of the security of the American people. Economic \nsecurity is part of that. I believe this administration is AWOL in this \nregard. As we deal with foreign policy challenges, we Democrats will \ninsist we deal with domestic challenges, too. And again, let the people \ndecide if they agree with us or not.\n  This I will also say clearly: We are told constantly that the \nPresident has not decided yet whether he wants to go to war with Iraq. \nWe hear it over and over. I sit on the Foreign Relations Committee. I \nam proud to sit on that committee. I chair the terrorism subcommittee. \nRecently, Colin Powell said to us in an open hearing:\n\n       Of course the President has not made any decision with \n     regard to military action. He's still hopeful for a political \n     solution, a diplomatic solution.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld said:\n\n       The President's not made a decision with respect to Iraq.\n\n  National Security Adviser Rice said:\n\n       The President has not made a decision that the use of \n     military force is the best option.\n\n  Ari Fleischer, the press spokesman, makes that same statement day \nafter day after day.\n  I ask, if the President hasn't decided to go to war yet, if the \nadministration has not decided to go to war yet, if the military has \nnot been told there is going to be a war, then why is the President \ncoming to Congress now, before he has made a somber decision, and \nbefore he has answered many key questions?\n  If our questions could be answered, the many questions we have, it \nwould be one thing. However, I want to say unequivocally that the \nmyriad of questions I have asked have not been answered.\n  In good conscience, how can I vote to take our country to war alone, \nwhich is what the President wants from us, without allies and without \nthe facts that I need to fulfill my responsibilities to the people of \nCalifornia.\n  Madam President, you know my State very well. We have more than 30 \nmillion people. Out of the 880,000 reservists in the military, 61,000 \nare from California. I owe them the best decision I can make. Those \nreservists, as Senator Inouye has pointed out, many of them have \nfamilies. At times you will have a wife and a husband called up to go \ninto the danger zone. I need my questions answered before I could vote \nto send this country, alone--alone--into battle.\n  Here are the questions I have asked in one forum or another. Here are \nthe questions that I either do not have answers to or the answers I \nhave are incomplete. If we give the President the blank check he is \nasking for, which I will not vote for, if we give him the go-it-alone \npreemptive strike authority, which I will not vote for, then I think \nthose who are considering voting for that ought to ask these questions. \nI will lay them out.\n  How many U.S. troops would be involved?\n  What are the projected casualties?\n  Would the United States have to foot the entire cost of using force \nagainst Iraq?\n  If not, which nations will provide financial support?\n  Which nations will provide military support?\n  What will the cost be to rebuild Iraq?\n  How long would our troops need to stay there?\n  Would they be a target for terrorists?\n  What will the impact be on our fight against terrorism?\n  Will Iraq use chemical or biological weapons against our troops?\n  Will Iraq launch chemical or biological weapons against Israel?\n  How will Israel respond?\n  What impact will that have?\n  How will we secure Iraqi chemical and biological weapons once the \nfighting starts?\n  How do we make sure such weapons do not get into the hands of \nterrorists or terrorist nations?\n  How do we make sure that Iraqi weapons experts, from Iraq, do not \nmigrate to terrorist organizations or terrorist states?\n  Have we given enough thought to alternatives to avoid war?\n  Why haven't we worked with the United Nations to try Saddam Hussein \nas a war criminal? He is a war criminal.\n  During the Foreign Relations Committee hearing with Secretary \nAlbright, I raised the idea put forward by the Carnegie Endowment on \ncoerced inspections. Has this or a similar idea been pursued?\n  If we are concerned about Saddam Hussein acquiring weapons of mass \ndestruction, why are we not fully supporting the Nunn-Lugar weapons \ndismantlement program?\n  I do not doubt that Iraq is up to no good. I know they are. That is \nwhy I voted for the Iraq Liberation Act. We know that Iraq has \nbiological and chemical weapons and that they used them against Iran \nand against its own Kurdish minority. We know that following the \nPersian Gulf war, Iraq promised to abide by the demands of the U.N. but \nfailed to live up to its commitment. They have not allowed unfettered \ninspections. They have lied about chemical and biological weapons \nprograms. And they continue to seek the capability to produce nuclear \nweapons.\n  I do not doubt that there are some members of al-Qaida in Iraq. But \nthere is al-Qaida in Syria. There is al-Qaida in Africa. There is al-\nQaida in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. There are cells in 60 nations, \nincluding the United States of America.\n  The fight against bin Laden and his organization must not be \nweakened. I want to quote what the head of our Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, Senator Bob Graham, has to say about this. You and I know he \nis not a man of overstatement. He said:\n\n       At this point I think Iraq is a primary distraction from \n     achieving our goals of reducing the threat of international \n     terrorism.\n\n\n[[Page S9879]]\n\n\n  Listen to what Wesley Clark has said. He headed our NATO troops.\n\n       Unilateral U.S. action today would disrupt the war against \n     al-Qaida.\n\n  Despite statements by staff to the contrary, the President appears to \nwant to go it alone in war when we are already in a war. According to \nthe President, we are in a war, one that will require all of our wits \nand lots of our treasure, both in human capital and in tax dollars.\n  I do not think it is enough to be critical of this blank check \nresolution the President is supporting. I want to say how I would \napproach this question. Iraq must be held to its word, as expressed in \nU.N. resolutions, that it will submit to thorough inspections and \ndismantlement of weapons of mass destruction, period.\n  Let's repeat that. Iraq must be held to its word that it will submit \nto thorough inspections, unfettered inspections, and dismantlement of \nweapons of mass destruction, period. That is what they agreed to. They \nsigned on the dotted line to do it. And that is what must happen. Those \nwere United Nations resolutions, and we must work for an updated \nresolution ensuring that such unfettered inspections do take place or \nthere will be consequences. These weapons are a threat to the world, \nand the world must respond. I believe if we handle this right, the \nworld will respond.\n  But if our allies believe we have not made the case, if they believe \nthis is a political issue here, or if they believe it is a grudge match \nhere, or if they believe that the whole thing is being manipulated for \ndomestic political reasons, I believe that will hurt our Nation. I \nbelieve that will isolate us. I do not think that is a good path for \nour country.\n  Can we rule the world with our weapons and our guns and our might? I \nam sure we can. I know we can.\n  Can we win every military confrontation that anyone could ever \nimagine? Yes. We can.\n  But I believe the greatness of our Nation has been built on other \nthings: The power of our persuasion, not the power of our arsenal; the \npower of our ideals, not the power of our threats; the power and \ngreatness of our people, not the power and the greatness of our \nmachines.\n  America at her best has been seen as a beacon of hope, not fear; an \nexample not of ``Might makes right,'' but ``Might backing right.'' What \nis right at a time like this? I believe it is laying out a path for \npeace, not just a path for war; trying everything we can to avoid chaos \nand devastation to our own and to innocent civilians who may well be \nused as pawns in urban warfare.\n  I believed that Madeleine Albright, the former Secretary of State \nunder President Clinton, and Dr. Henry Kissinger laid out a path for \npeace when they spoke before the Foreign Relations Committee. They \ntalked about unfettered inspections and dismantlement of weapons of \nmass destruction. As they said, and I agree, it will not be easy. Maybe \nit will be impossible. But there is no doubt in my mind that we should \nlay out that path and try for complete, unfettered inspections, with \nnothing off limits, to be followed by dismantlement of those weapons.\n  For those who say it will never work, maybe they are right. But we \nhave never pulled the massive trigger of our weapons on a nation that \nhas not attacked us first. At the least--at the least--we should see if \nwe can exhaust all other options.\n  That is why I support the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Carl Levin, and his resolution that will be introduced. This is \nwhat it does:\n  No. 1, it urges the United Nations Security Council to quickly adopt \na resolution that demands immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted \naccess for U.N. inspectors so that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \nand prohibited missiles will be destroyed.\n  No. 2, it urges this new U.N. Security Council resolution to \nauthorize the use of necessary and appropriate force by U.N. member \nstates to enforce the resolution if Iraq refuses to comply.\n  No. 3, it reaffirms that, under international law and the U.N. \nCharter, the United States has the inherent right to self-defense.\n  No. 4, it authorizes the use U.S. Armed Forces pursuant to the new \nU.N. Security Council resolution that deals with weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  In closing, let me say very clearly that I will not vote for a blank \ncheck for unilateral action. I also will not vote for a resolution that \nis dressed up to look like Congress has powers when, in fact, all the \nwords really call for are consultations and determinations.\n  That is when Senator Byrd said ``pretty'' words. He said, ``Pretty, \npretty, pretty words.'' Sounds good--consultations and determinations. \nWhat does it really mean? Nothing. It means the administration tells us \nwhat they think. We already know what they think.\n  To me, consultations and determinations without a vote by Congress \nare like a computer that is not plugged in. It looks good, it looks \npowerful, it looks impressive, but it does nothing.\n  I didn't come to the Senate for the title. I didn't come to the \nSenate to debate meaninglessly on the Senate floor. I didn't come to \nthe Senate to do nothing. I didn't come to the Senate to run away from \na hard vote. I came to uphold the duties of my office. I came to \nrepresent the people of California.\n  In the past 4 years, I have voted to use force twice--once against \nMilosevic to stop a genocide and once after September 11 when we \nsuffered a barbarous attack. But, in this case, if any President wants \nto go to war alone or outside the type of coalitions we have built for \nthe war on terror, or the last Persian Gulf war, then let him come to \nthe American people, through the Congress for another debate and a \nvote.\n  It is one thing to go with a coalition. It is one thing to determine \nthat we will be part of a multinational force. It is another thing to \ndo it alone, without a specific vote of the Congress before the \nPresident has decided to do so. As I have said, his aides keep telling \nus he has not made the decision. So why do we have to give him a blank \ncheck today? If he wants to go it alone, if he wants to send my people \nto a place where we don't even know if chemical or biological weapons \nwill be used, we don't even know what the estimates of casualties are, \nwe don't even know what it is going to cost, we don't even know how \nlong we are going to have to stay there, we don't know what will happen \nif Israel responds--we don't know so many things--I don't think it is \nasking too much to ask my colleagues to support a resolution by Senator \nLevin. He said that if he wants to go it alone, then the President has \nto come back.\n  In the Carl Levin resolution, it is implicit that he must come back \nif he wants to go it alone. Carl Levin's resolution authorizes force as \npart of the U.N. enforcement action to dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction. But again, if the President wants to go it alone, he must \ncome back to us.\n  I believe the people of my State expect me, on their behalf, to get \nmy questions and their questions answered, not to engage in guesswork, \nand, above all, not to abdicate my responsibility as a Senator to \nanyone else. If our Founders wanted the President--or any President--to \nhave the power to go to war without our consent, they would have said \nso. But, again, this is what our Founders said in article I, section 8: \nCongress shall have power to declare war.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        West Coast Port Closure\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, we have talked some about our fragile \neconomy and the problems we are facing. Growth, which began slowing in \n1999, coupled with the tragic impact of September 11, has resulted in \nhardship for many. We have seen unemployment, reduced value of market \nsecurities, more problems with health care, and other difficulties.\n  There are measures pending in this body I believe would do a great \ndeal to help the economy. They are such things as passing a terrorism \nrisk reinsurance bill, which could get our building trades back to \nwork; passing an energy bill, which has the potential of employing more \nthan three-quarters of\n\n[[Page S9880]]\n\na million people, and securing our energy independence. We have not \nbeen able to work on those.\n  But now we face a further challenge, which is a self-inflicted attack \non our economy by our own people; and that is the contract dispute \nwhich has closed the West Coast docks, providing a terrible bottleneck \nfor crucial exports and imports.\n  This is the line of commerce: Trade going out, agricultural products \nbeing sold; inputs, goods coming into the United States; and it is shut \ndown by this dispute.\n  Many Missouri constituents are asking us what can be done. Retailers \nare asking where their goods are for them to be able to make sales and \ncontinue to employ their people. Agricultural producers, who have meat \nfor export rotting on their docks, are saying something must be done.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, goods valued at more than $300 \nbillion move annually through these ports. According to the New York \nTimes, these ports handle half the Nation's imports and exports. \nFurther estimates are that this shutdown could cost our economy $1 \nbillion per day and grow further as the shutdown continues to $2 \nbillion per day. The longer it goes, the worse it gets. Regrettably, \nthe State of Missouri has the highest unemployment growth rate in the \nNation, and we cannot afford economic homicide of this nature.\n  This affects jobs upstream and downstream throughout the entire \neconomy. It affects truckers and railroad workers and farm workers and \nretail clerks and consumers and others. These are real workers who are \nreal people and have real families. They are hurting.\n  I am not an expert on the specific grievances of these several \nhundred workers and their unions and the employers at the docks, but \nthis major facility is nothing to toy with. I don't care if the \ngrievances are moderate or petty, it is not worth the harm that could \nbe done to thousands of other working people and our economy. The \nparties have to be brought together. One would think that workers \nreportedly earning $106,000 per year for less than 40 hours a week \ncould resolve the grievances on the job without hurting other workers \nin my State who earn far less. While they sit on their chairs at the \ndocks, people around the country are the ones suffering. This power \nplay will have too much collateral damage to be allowed to continue.\n  One company, National Cart Company, in St. Charles, MO is a \nmanufacturer that employs 140 people. They manufacture material \nhandling equipment and rely on some components from Asia. This is the \nbusiest time of their year because their customers need their products \nto stock shelves for Christmas. Unless this is resolved, they will be \nlaying off workers in 2 weeks or slightly more.\n  Another company, TRG, located in St. Louis, with 80 employees, can't \nstock their shelves with recreation and travel accessories that they \nsell. When they shut down, their employees are out of work.\n  Another St. Louis company, Donelly and Associates, manufactures \ntelecommunications products. They only have seven employees, but if \nthey do not get supplies in a week to 10 days, they will shut down, and \nthose workers will be laid off. The president of that firm told my \noffice that for every day the supply is disrupted it takes as many as 5 \ndays to get it back on line. He told us that the airlines have already \nstopped taking bookings out of Asia.\n  Another plant manager from Magnet LLC in Washington, MO said they are \nunable to get supply, and he predicts that if this is not resolved, \nthey may be forced to lay off workers in 2 to 3 weeks. They have 375 \nemployees and are urgently trying to make product to satisfy Christmas \ndemand.\n  There is a story in the Washington Post this morning about how people \nin Hawaii are stockpiling goods, and perishable food products are at \nrisk of rotting on the docks. The retailers are trying to get winter \nand Christmas goods inventoried. Over 60 percent of beef exports and 50 \npercent of pork exports and one quarter of our chicken exports travel \nthrough these ports. Meat is rotting on the docks. Many freezers in the \ncountry are at capacity and inventories will become further backed up \nand prices will be depressed below levels that are already low.\n  Yesterday, according to the Los Angeles Times, ``picketers tried to \nprevent a banana-carrying ship from leaving the dock, provoking a \nconfrontation that brought out police in riot gear.''\n  The Los Angeles Times has another story about how ``the labor dispute \nis putting a strain on independent truckers who move port-related \ncargo.'' They quote a truck driver named Jose Louis Martinez who \n``doesn't care whether labor or management is to blame in the dispute * \n* * he cared only that the wallet he would bring home to his wife and \ntwo daughters would be empty for the third time in four days.''\n  There are over 10,000 truckers--the majority of them independent--who \nnormally make as many as three visits a day to the ports, according to \nthe California Trucking Association. Burlington Northern-Santa Fe said \nit has suspended shipments of marine containers to all West Coast ports \nand grain to ports to Washington and Oregon.\n  I can't speak to the fairness of the labor negotiations, but I can \nspeak to the unfairness of a few people being willing to injure many \npeople to get their own way and to destroy a vital sector of our \neconomy. I can't see how a dispute about bar code readers--they are \nobjecting to bringing in bar code readers, things that they use in \nevery supermarket I have been in, and most retail stores--should cost \nthe economy billions of dollars and intentionally throw people out of \nwork. Frankly, my constituents don't understand the approach being \ntaken, which seems to be: We will tear down everyone we can until we \nget our own way. I think it is outrageous. I think these matters should \nbe resolved immediately. They should be resolved with the docks open \nfor business.\n  This is extortion, where the hostages are ordinary working families, \nmany of whom will never earn in any year as much as the dock workers \nearn in three-quarters of a year. If they were only hurting themselves, \nI would advise that we stay out of it and have at it. But they are \ndragging everyone else with them. Since when is the economic leader of \nthe world closed for business? This is an outrage.\n  Here our President and his team are working vigorously to open \nforeign markets. We gave them the power. But why? So labor disputes can \nhave export products rot on the docks? We can all have disagreements \nabout whether raising taxes or lowering taxes will help our economy. I \nhave some strong views on that. People in this body disagree with me. \nBut one thing we certainly ought to be able to agree on is that a \ntactic of this nature is bad for the economy, bad for working families, \nand should be resolved yesterday.\n  I have asked the President--and sent a letter to him--to use his \nauthority to intervene. I hope he will do that. I have read that some \nin this body object to his intervening. I know the President has agreed \nthese people should get back to work. He expressed that view in strong \nterms and made mediation services available.\n  Working families in my State cannot wait. It is a terrible shame it \nwould come to this. It is a shame that people haven't worked this out \non their own, as they should. But our economy is too fragile for self-\ninterested, shortsighted, and self-inflicted wounds of this nature.\n  I urge the President to take further steps to stop this dispute, to \nget commerce flowing, and to get people back to work. Whether it be \ntruckers and railroad workers in California or retail clerks throughout \nthe Nation or agricultural producers in our heartland or other \nindustrial workers who are making products for export to the Southeast \nAsian market, they are being denied a livelihood because of a dispute \nover bar code readers, something that is not really that advanced a \ntechnology but is in use every day in stores we visit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Missouri\n\n[[Page S9881]]\n\nfor his words today because they echo mine.\n  Today I sent a letter to the White House and the President asking him \nto intervene in this slowdown and lockout, however you want to \ninterpret it, of west coast ports. Today, 29 west coast ports, \nrepresenting about half of our Nation's seaborne commerce, remain \nclosed. Furthermore, we have another situation that complicates it. \nWeather conditions have temporarily limited the seaborne and other \nmodes of commerce on the gulf coast due to Hurricane Lili. Our ability \nto export our goods or import our goods is quickly becoming paralyzed.\n  The latest attempt at renegotiation between the Pacific Maritime \nAssociation and the International Longshore and Warehouse Unions has \nstalled, and they have stalled based on protocol and the presence of \nsecurity personnel.\n  Isn't that something? While they are arguing that in those \nnegotiations, we are just coming through a crop year in my State of \nMontana, and already that is having an effect on us. I am also a little \nbit disturbed about the negotiations on salaries of $110,000 to \n$140,000 a year; they are on the table also. I want to give you a \nlittle comparison on why we are a little out of kilter here.\n  According to the USDA, the average farm operator household income is \n$65,000 a year. I don't like averages. That is on-farm and off-farm \nincome. I don't like to deal in averages because I know there are \nexceptions to the rule. Averages are like: If you have one foot in a \nbucket of ice and the other foot in the oven, on average, you ought to \nfeel pretty good. That doesn't always work. The average farmer in my \nState makes around $30,000 to $40,000 a year. That is net. And they are \nforced--after we make the investment, put in our labors--they are \nforced to watch their yearly harvest sit while the longshoremen and \nmanagement squabble about salaries that are sometimes two to three \ntimes the amount of their gross.\n  So I think it is about time that President Bush intervene. If the \nparties are unable to negotiate a compromise by the end of this week, \nit is time to take action before they do too much damage to our \nnational economy, and particularly those people who are impacted by a \nstalemate at our ports. The President can invoke the Taft-Hartley Act \nto resolve this matter. According to law, a Taft-Hartley injunction can \nbe invoked if ``a threatened or actual strike or lockout affecting an \nentire industry, or a substantial part thereof, engaged in trade, \ncommerce, transportation, transmission, or communications among the \nseveral States, or with foreign nations, or engaged in the production \nof goods for commerce will, if permitted to occur or to continue, \nimperil the Nation's health and safety.''\n  What it does, basically, is allow for a cooling-off period while \nworkers go back to the ports and commerce is allowed to continue. It \ngives the negotiators this time to work out a compromise. An agreement \nis necessary, and the President does have the power to impose that \nagreement. Economic consequences have the potential to injure workers, \nemployers, and consumers alike.\n  The crisis is costing the U.S. economy up to $1 billion a day and \nwill affect the economy that is struggling to grow. If you can imagine, \nfruits and vegetables and other perishables rotting at the ports--those \ncoming in, and those to be exported. My good independent trucker \nfriends are sitting around just letting their trucks idle, waiting for \nwork. The alternative, such as air freight, is limited due to capacity \nand also security issues. Auto manufacturers are waiting on parts and \ncomponents. One manufacturer has announced closure of its California \nplant.\n  Of course, the retail impact is immeasurable, considering that right \nnow all the goods and services are moving for the upcoming holiday \nseason. The west coast labor crisis is no longer about ``the rights of \nworkers'' or ``management negotiating philosophy.'' It is about \nAmerican prosperity and protecting the principles of commerce for this \nNation.\n  If this shutdown is allowed to go on at the west coast ports, there \nis no doubt about the impact it will have on my State of Montana. It \ncould not come at a worse time. Because of drought, and droughts in \nother countries, and a little bit of a shortage, wheat prices have gone \nup approximately $2 higher than we have had in the last 5 years. In 5 \nyears, this is the first time we have had a market--any kind of a \nmarket. And 90 percent of what we produce in my State is marketed in \nhuge volumes, and it goes for export. The timing of this price advance \nis particularly fortuitous in light of the economic effects of a 4-year \ndrought along with it. However, the labor crisis has already led to an \n8-cent to 12-cent drop in that market just since Sunday.\n\n  We are feeling the effects in another way. What about my railroaders? \nEarlier this week, Burlington Northern and Union Pacific Railroads \nannounced an embargo on all grain movements to the west coast of the \nUnited States, citing overcapacity and lack of storage.\n  The net effect of those embargoes, again, will lead to overcapacity \nin grain storage facilities in my State of Montana. It is harvest time, \nfolks, and this is the first time we have had a market, whenever the \ngrain is ready. In other words, it is harvested and ready to roll, and \nit is ready to be shipped. Furthermore, right behind it, we are less \nthan 30 days away from the corn harvest season; that will be in its \npeak.\n  Grain car shortages will force farmers to find alternative storage \ncapacity or leave their wheat on the ground exposed to the elements. We \nhave seen that before. Even if the lockout concludes this week, the \nresidual impact will lead to several weeks, possibly months, of delay \nin the movement of those products to our major ports. Even those who \nhave sold their grain will not be able to deliver against their \ncontracts and, more importantly, the income from that delivery is \nneeded at this time of the year. This is the time we make our land \npayments. This is the time we pay our taxes.\n  There is another aspect involved. We have spent hundreds of thousands \nof dollars in developing the Asian and other Pacific markets, on which \nwe have to compete with our friends in Canada and Australia. We can do \nthat for the simple reason that we have always been a reliable source. \nThey can count on us not only for volume but also quality. We are \njeopardizing that market development.\n  So this is our opportunity, in normal times, to recapture some of \nthose major exports that we lost over the last 2 or 3 years. We can do \nit. The only thing that is holding us back is this squabbling over \nsalaries of $90,000 to $140,000, which are triple that of my average \nfarmer in Montana. We are able to take advantage and recoup from years \nof drought, and it all could be lost with our inability to export.\n  An extended work stoppage or slowdown by the west coast port workers, \nwho enjoy some of the highest pay rates in the country, is already \nhaving its effect. Our shoes are getting a little tight. Grain millers \nof the world are coming to the United States for their supply, and they \nare denied delivery.\n  In my letter to the President, I laid out that this is no longer a \nstandard labor-management negotiation. It has become the groundwork for \na potentially grave economic slowdown that will jeopardize consumer \nconfidence and our national commercial infrastructure.\n  Who says one little group cannot impact an economy that is suffering \nand trying to dig itself out of a 5-year hole?\n  I hope the President takes note of the letter. I know Senator Bond \nhas sent a letter to the White House asking the President to intervene \nand use the Taft-Hartley law with which to do it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper) The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on a \nmatter other than the Department of Justice authorization bill but the \ntime continue to run under the cloture rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Members' Pay Raise\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to speak last \nThursday night with regard to the issue of the possibility of war with \nIraq. I am, of course, listening carefully to my colleagues as they \ndiscuss the prospect of war. Nothing could be more serious, and I am \npleased this body will be engaged in this matter in earnest.\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\n  The public nature of that debate stands, though, in great contrast to \nanother matter. While the country is focused on whether or not to go to \nwar, Members of Congress will once again be quietly sidestepping the \nissue of their own pay raise, an evasion that is made all the more \ninappropriate by the very fact that we may be on the brink of war.\n  The cloakrooms have advised their offices that we are likely to \nconsider another continuing resolution this week, and there is \nspeculation that we are not likely to consider the individual \nappropriations bills that remain before we adjourn for this year.\n  I raise this because there is increasing reason to believe that this \nbody may not be able to consider the scheduled Member pay raise. \nCurrent law provides Members with an automatic pay raise without a \ndebate or a vote, a stealth pay raise. The pay raise scheduled for \nJanuary 2003 will be about $5,000. It follows automatic pay raises in \nJanuary 2002, January 2001, and January 2000. Altogether these pay \nraises for Members of Congress, four pay raises in the last 4 years, \ntotal $18,000.\n  The current system of stealth pay raises is already inaccessible, and \nthe current legislative position of the body makes it even more so. We \nare unlikely to consider the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, which \nis the traditional vehicle for amendments to stop the Member pay raise, \nand we may not consider other amendable vehicles.\n  Members who favor the scheduled pay raise should not be comforted by \nthis. Congress is not going to sneak this by without anyone noticing, \nnor will it be lost on the average citizen that Congress is allowing \nthis to happen on what may be the eve of war.\n  In his more recent volume on the life of Lyndon Johnson, Robert Caro \nrecounts similar events early in World War II.\n  He writes:\n\n       During the war's very first months, while an unprepared \n     America--an America unprepared largely because of Congress--\n     was reeling from defeat after defeat, a bill arrived on \n     Capitol Hill providing for pensions for civil service \n     employees. House and Senate amended the bill so that their \n     members would be included in it, and rushed it to passage--\n     before, it was hoped, the public would notice. But the public \n     did notice: the National Junior Chamber of Commerce announced \n     a nationwide Bundles for Congress program to collect old \n     clothes and discarded shoes for destitute legislators. Strict \n     gasoline rationing was being imposed on the country; \n     congressmen and senators passed a bill allowing themselves \n     unlimited gas. The outrage over the pension and gasoline \n     ``grabs'' was hardly blunted by a hasty congressional \n     reversal on both issues. Quips about Congress became a \n     cottage industry among comedians: ``I never lack material for \n     my humor column when Congress is in session,'' Will Rogers \n     said. The House and the Senate--the Senate of Webster, Clay, \n     and Calhoun, the Senate that had once been the ``Senate \n     Supreme,'' the preeminent entity of American government--had \n     sunk in public estimation to a point at which it was little \n     more than a joke.\n\n  Mr. President, let's not let history repeat itself. I call upon the \nleadership to ensure we have a debate and a vote on the scheduled pay \nraise. I am willing to accept a very short time limit, understanding \nthe very important business we have, 20 minutes equally divided, even 5 \nminutes equally divided. This will not take long. But the public is \nentitled to a debate and a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Members, we expect to \nhave a vote in the next hour, hour and 15 minutes on the motion to \ninvoke cloture. We hope to have a voice vote on the conference report \nthat is before the Senate. I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, be recognized to speak postcloture for \nup to 1 hour and he can speak on any subject he desires; following \nthat, the two leaders will be recognized, Senator Lott and then Senator \nDaschle, and then we will proceed to a vote on a cloture motion.\n  I ask unanimous consent for Senator Kyl, but I am alerting Members, \nfollowing that, Senators Lott and Daschle will speak, and then we will \nvote on the cloture motion.\n  I ask the Chair to approve my unanimous consent request regarding \nSenator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Kyl is in the building and will come to speak \nshortly. After that, the two leaders will appear, and we will vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader for his \ncourtesy. I wish to address a matter that is not directly related to \nthe conference report before us, though there is some indirect \nrelationship to it. I assume I do not have to ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unanimous consent has already been granted.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       Use of Force Against Iraq\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we have really already begun the debate on a \nresolution to authorize the use of force against Iraq if the President \ndeems it necessary. Several Members have come to the Chamber and spoken \nabout the issue. We are going to begin that debate formally sometime \nthis evening, I believe, and it will continue on through Friday, \nMonday, and then shortly thereafter we will be voting on this important \nresolution.\n  As with the debate 11 years ago when force was authorized and we \nrepelled Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, Members of both bodies \ndiscussed the issue at a level, frankly, that we are unaccustomed to \ndoing. When we are making a decision to send our young men and women \ninto harm's way, when we are literally authorizing war, I think a \ndegree of seriousness begins to pervade all of our thinking. We address \nthese issues with the utmost of seriousness because we are aware of the \nconsequences, and they deserve no less, and our constituents and our \nmilitary deserve no less than that degree of consideration.\n  When we debate this issue, we will find there are good arguments on \nboth sides of the issue, and I realize there will be different nuances, \nso it is not as if there are just two sides to the debate. But at the \nend of the day, we are going to have the question before us: Are we \ngoing to authorize the use of force?\n  There will be some alternatives before us. That debate needs to be \nbased upon the very best information, the very best intelligence, the \nvery best analysis we can bring to bear, and it also has to be based \nupon a good relationship between the legislative and the executive \nbranches because in war we are all in it together. We have to \ncooperate. We have to support the Commander in Chief.\n  The last thing we would ever do is to authorize the Commander in \nChief to take action and then not support that action. Our foes abroad, \nas well as our allies abroad, need to know we will be united once a \ndecision is made, and we will execute the operation to succeed, if it \nis called for.\n  I am very disturbed at the way that part of this debate is beginning, \nand that is what I wanted to speak to today. There has been an effort \nby some to broadly paint the administration as uncooperative in sharing \nintelligence information with the Senate, and more specifically the \nSenate Intelligence Committee.\n  I have been a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee now for \nalmost 8 years, and I have been involved in the middle of a lot of \ndisputes about information sharing. When we are sharing information \nabout intelligence, those issues are inevitable, just as they are \nsometimes with law enforcement. In our democracy, these become very \ndifficult decisions because we are a wide open country. We tend to want \nto share everything, but we also recognize there have to be a few \nthings we cannot share with the enemy, and the lines are not always \nbrightly drawn. Sometimes the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch get into tiffs about what information should be shared, what \ninformation cannot be shared. Again, reasonable minds can differ about \nthe specifics of those issues, but what has arisen is a very unhealthy \nwar of words about motives and intentions, and we need to nip that in \nthe bud today.\n  I read a story in the New York Times reporting on a meeting of the \nIntelligence Committee, which I attended yesterday in the secure area \nwhere the Intelligence Committee meets, under strict rules of \nclassification. We were briefed by two of the top officials of the \nintelligence community about matters of the utmost in terms of \nimportance and secrecy, and yet there is a three-page story in the New \nYork Times which discusses much of what was discussed in that meeting, \nwithout ever\n\n[[Page S9883]]\n\nattributing a single assertion or quotation. There is no name used of \nanybody who was in that room, and so we do not know exactly who it was \nwho went to the New York Times and talked about what went on in our \nmeeting.\n  I am not suggesting classified information was leaked. I would have \nto have an analysis done to determine whether anything in the article \nwas actually classified information. What was discussed was a purported \ndispute between our committee and the executive branch about the \nrelease of certain information and the preparation of certain reports. \nI will get into more detail about this in a minute.\n  Obviously, somebody from the committee, a Member or staff, went \ncomplaining to the New York Times and spread, therefore, on the pages \nof this paper a whole series of allegations about motives and \nintentions of the Bush administration relating to the basis for seeking \nauthority to use force against Iraq, if necessary. This is exactly what \nwill undercut the authority of the President in trying to build a \ncoalition abroad as well as in the United States, and it is the very \npeople who demand the President achieve that international coalition \nbefore we take action who are the most exercised about what they \nperceive to be a slight from the administration and who, therefore, are \nbeing quoted in this story.\n  I do not know the names, but there is a limited universe of people \ninvolved. I am going to go over this article in fine detail just to \nillustrate my point.\n  One of the sources cited in the story is a congressional official. I \nwill quote the entire sentence.\n\n       One congressional official said that the incident has badly \n     damaged Mr. Tenet's relations with Congress, something that \n     Mr. Tenet has always worked hard to cultivate.\n\n  Mr. Tenet is George Tenet, the director of the CIA. Sometimes I agree \nwith Mr. Tenet and sometimes I do not agree with Mr. Tenet, but I \nbelieve Mr. Tenet has the best interests of the United States of \nAmerica at heart when he is working with the President and Congress to \npresent information and develop the appropriate approach to the use of \nforce, if that is necessary.\n  My point was this, though: The article quotes one congressional \nofficial. What is a congressional official? It is either a Member of \nthe Senate or the House of Representatives--though no Representatives \nwere in this meeting; it was just a meeting of Senators--or it is a \nstaff person hired by the Senate.\n  I find it interesting the article quotes a congressional official.\n  Most of the article quotes congressional leaders, Government \nofficials, or lawmakers. Either a Member of the Senate or a member of \nour staff talked to the press about what went on in the meeting and did \nso in order to damage, or to call into question, I should say, the \nrelationship between the Senate and the executive branch, and to \nquestion whether the administration was being cooperative with the \nSenate in providing information.\n  Let me discuss this in detail now. The central theme is identified in \nthe first line of the story:\n\n       The Central Intelligence Agency has refused to provide \n     Congress a comprehensive report on its role in a possible \n     American campaign against Iraq, setting off a bitter dispute \n     between the agency and leaders of the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee, congressional leaders said today.\n\n  Those are Senators--not staff but congressional leaders. Only \nSenators were in the meeting. So some Senators said the CIA had refused \nto provide us with a comprehensive report on the agency's role in a \npossible American campaign, and this set off a bitter dispute between \nthe CIA and leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee would be probably two \npeople, the chairman and ranking member. Mr. Shelby, the ranking \nmember, the Senator from Alabama, will have to speak for himself. The \nchairman is Senator Graham from Florida. I suggest they need to clarify \nwhat their view is with respect to this story.\n  In the first place, it is not true the Central Intelligence Agency \nhas refused to provide us with the report described in the story. There \nwere two reports requested. As the article discloses, the first report \nhas been provided. It was done at breakneck speed. It has to do with \nIraq's capabilities; what kind of chemical and biological weapons does \nIraq really possess; how far along is it in developing its nuclear \ncapability; what means of delivery does it have; and a host of other \nquestions that were put to the intelligence community. It is obviously \nimportant for us to have the answers to those questions before we take \naction.\n  The reality is the information was all there. It had simply not been \nput together in one report, as the committee requested. What we \nrequested was something called a national intelligence estimate. A \nnational intelligence estimate is not requested by the Congress. A \nnational intelligence estimate is ordinarily requested by the President \nor the National Security Council, and it is essentially a document \nwhich is supposed to analyze a particular country's or region's threat, \nor threat from weapons of mass destruction. It frequently takes a long \ntime, up to a year, perhaps, to prepare. The purpose for it is to \ninform both the administration and others such as the Congress that \nwould be dealing with the issues, but it is not intended to be an \noperational document; that is to say, to be integrated in operational \nmilitary plans. Nevertheless, even though this is not the normal way \nthe document would be prepared, the agency people worked overtime to \nproduce, in a matter of several days, a very thorough report. About 100 \npages in length was produced in about 3 weeks, according to the story, \nunder very tight deadlines.\n\n  It was presented yesterday. Most of the information had been \npresented before in a different way. But it was put together in one \npackage.\n  Leaders of the committee expressed their outrage that Director Tenet \nwas not there in person to testify. He was with the President at the \ntime. The two people who briefed us were very top officials of the \nintelligence community who probably knew more on a firsthand basis what \nwas in the report even than Director Tenet. Some Members did not want \nto ask them questions but wanted to wait for Director Tenet to arrive, \na pretty petulant attitude when we are trying to seriously address \nquestions of war and peace.\n  The information was before us. No one questioned the veracity of the \ninformation. We had a good hearing in discussing the various elements. \nThat was one of the reports. There was complaining it should have been \nearlier, it should have been done more quickly. As pointed out, \nordinarily these are the kind of reports that usually take a year to \nput together; it was done in a matter of 3 weeks. Under the \ncircumstances, the community is to be complimented.\n  The other report requested had to do with the role of the \nintelligence community in military operations, potential military \noperations against Iraq. In effect what was being asked, if we take \nforcible action against Iraq, and any aspect of the intelligence \ncommunity is used in those operations, what is it likely to be? What is \nthe likely response going to be? How effective do you think it will be? \nThat is what the article means, in the first sentence, when it talks \nabout a comprehensive report on its role in a possible American \ncampaign against Iraq.\n  The intelligence community, wisely, has a standard policy against \ndoing analyses of U.S. action that is not overt and tied to military \noperations. We do not know our military plans for military action \nagainst Iraq if it were to come. Only the President and a handful of \npeople involved in those plans know what they are. Thank goodness for \nthat. There is so much leaking in this Government--both at the \nexecutive branch level and the legislative branch level--it would be \nfolly in the extreme for operational plans to be discussed broadly \nbefore an operation begins or during the operation, for that matter. \nThat is why we do not present that kind of analysis to anyone. Members \nof the Intelligence Committee ought to know that and ought not to feel \nslighted because it was not presented to us and because it will not be \npresented to us. That kind of information would be directly related to \nthe plan of attack that the President may eventually approve.\n  We know our leaders get called just before an operation begins and \nonce it is begun, we begin to get information about how we will conduct \nthe operation. But can anyone reasonably believe the plans of our \nmilitary and intelligence community, in cooperating\n\n[[Page S9884]]\n\nwith some kind of action, should be put in a document and released to \nthe Congress, even in classified form? If this article is any \nindication, it would be 1 day before it would be in the newspaper. We \ncannot do that, putting at risk the lives of the men and women we may \nsend in harm's way.\n  One success in the Afghanistan operation was the fact that we were \nable to combine good intelligence with military capability. Without \ngoing into a lot of detail, everyone appreciates the fact we were able \nto get assets on the ground from whatever source, providing information \nto our aircraft, for example, about very specifically where certain \ntargets were. As a result of having that good intelligence, we were \nable to strike at the heart of the enemy, avoid for the most part \ncivilian casualties, or collateral damage, and very quickly overthrow \nthe Taliban government, and rout or capture a lot of the al-Qaida.\n  We do not know much publicly about the interrelationship between the \nintelligence community and the military, but we know they combined \nefforts to make this a successful operation. That is all most Members \nneed to know.\n  We do not need to know in advance of a military operation how the \nintelligence community is going to be integrated with the military in \nconducting this campaign, what they are each going to do, and what the \nenemy might do in response and so on.\n  The article itself alludes to this when it talks about the ordinary \npurpose of a national intelligence estimate. But intelligence officials \nsay a national intelligence estimate is designed to assess the policies \nof foreign countries, not those of the United States. I quote:\n\n       ``They were asking for an assessment of U.S. policy, and \n     that falls outside the realm of the NIE and gets into the \n     purview of the Commander and Chief,'' an intelligence \n     official said.\n\n  That is correct. So there was a misunderstanding of what a national \nintelligence estimate was, on the first part; second, the request for \nthe information went far beyond what the administration should have \nbeen asked to provide and what it could provide. Yet Members of the \ncommittee were indignant that the administration had stiffed the \ncommittee, had stonewalled, had refused to provide this information.\n  We have to engage in a serious debate about a very serious subject in \na relatively objective way. We all bring our biases and prejudices to \nthe debate. But one thing that should be clear to all of us is that the \nthing that is paramount is the security of American military forces in \nthe conduct of an operation. And that cannot be jeopardized by either \nthe inadvertent or advertent leak of material that pertains directly to \nthose military operations.\n  What was being requested here was wrong. And the administration was \nright to say: I'm sorry, we cannot give that to you. The debate should \nnot be adversely influenced by this unfortunate set of circumstances. \nWe should decide whether we want to authorize force and what kind of \nforce is authorized based upon the merits of the argument as we assess \nthem.\n  No one here should be led down this path that says one of the reasons \nwe should not act yet, or that we should deny the administration the \nauthority is because they have stonewalled us. They have not given us \ninformation we need before we can make a judgment.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, that is simply not true. \nThere are briefings being conducted now--both in an informal way, very \nclassified but informally, as well as formally--to Members of this body \nand the House of Representatives, to answer Members' questions about \nIraqi's capabilities and intentions as we see them and our assessment \nof circumstances. I encourage all Members to get those briefings and to \nask any question they can think of asking and to try to keep it up \nuntil the questions have been answered. Some perhaps may not be \nanswered.\n  For the most part, they will learn of the primary reasons the \nPresident has decided it may be necessary to take military action \nagainst Iraq. What they will not learn, should not learn, and for \nnational security purposes cannot learn, is how the intelligence \ncommunity is going to be working with the military in the campaign \nshould one be authorized. Those are operational plans that only the \nPresident and his military and small group of advisers can be aware of \nbefore there is military action begun.\n  There is other information in this news story that is inaccurate, in \nsuggesting that there has been this huge tug of war between the \ncommittee and the CIA about getting information. In my own personal \nview, a lot of it has to do with lack of communication, lack of clear \nspecificity about what was requested. I remember when the original \nrequest was made, it was a rather routine kind of request, certainly \nnot the big deal that some members of the committee are trying to turn \nit into. Information was given orally about when it would be provided \nto us, and information was given orally about the fact that the \nmilitary operations could not be discussed. Yet members of the \ncommittee seemed to be pretty upset about the fact that we had not \ngotten a formal letter from George Tenet laying this all out.\n  The members of the Intelligence Committee who were there apologized \nand said: If we had thought a formal letter was necessary or we could \nhave gotten it to you sooner and didn't do that, we are sorry about \nthat. But here are the facts. You wanted to know what the facts are, \nand here are the facts.\n  So I do not think we should be dissuaded from basing a decision on \nthe merits of the case, one way or the other, however we decide to \nvote, on the phony issue of whether or not somebody is providing us \ninformation or whether they got it to us soon enough or whether the \nhead guy came down to testify as opposed to people directly below him.\n  As I said, he will be there to testify tomorrow in any event. This is \nall a smokescreen. It may be useful to some people who want to find \nsome reason not to support the President other than simply outright \nopposition to taking military action. I understand that. There seems to \nbe a popular view that most Americans want to take military action and \npolitically people had better get on that bandwagon, so maybe people \nwho do not really want to take that action have to find some reason, \nsome rationalization, for not doing it.\n  But I really don't think that is right. I think a lot of American \npeople are where most of us are. We would prefer not to have to take \nmilitary action. We would hope to have a coalition of allies. We hope \nthere will be some way to avoid this. But at the end of the day, if the \nPresident decides it is necessary, we are probably willing to go along \nand authorize the use of force.\n  There is nothing wrong with taking the position that at the end of \nthe day we are not yet ready to make that decision and therefore not \nvote to authorize the use of force. If that is where Members come down \nand that is what they in their hearts believe, that is what they should \nsay and that is how they should vote. But what they should not do is \ntry to latch onto an artificial reason for saying no, predicated upon \nsome perceived slight by the Director of the CIA or failure to provide \ninformation quickly enough or in exactly the form they wanted it or \nmost certainly on the grounds that the intelligence community has not \nprovided the kind of information about operations of the intelligence \ncommunity that they would like to get. That information should not be \nprovided, and nobody should base a decision here on the failure to \nobtain that information.\n  Let me just speak a little bit more broadly. I will ask unanimous \nconsent that at the conclusion of my remarks this particular article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n  Mr. KYL. A lot of people are approaching this issue on the basis that \nthere has to be some demonstration that, in the relatively near future, \nSaddam Hussein is going to use a weapon of mass destruction against us \nor else this is not the time that we should take military action \nagainst him. That is a rational position to take, in a way. If you do \nnot think that there is a real threat or that it is imminent, you could \nreach the conclusion that we should not engage in war, or at least \nought to be continuing to try to engage in diplomacy or whatever.\n  But there is another side to the coin. It is the way the President \nhas chosen\n\n[[Page S9885]]\n\nto look at it. I think, because he has chosen to look at it this way, \nhe will go down in history as a very prescient leader.\n  Noemie Emery, who is a fine writer, in an article in a periodical a \nweek ago, observed that most Presidents have had to fight a war but \nonly two Presidents have had to perceive a war. Harry Truman perceived \nthe cold war. He instinctively knew at the end of World War II, when \nthe Soviet Union was beginning to assert its power in regions of \nsouthern Europe, for example, and elsewhere, that it was important for \nthe United States and other Western allies to stand and say no to the \nfurther expansion of the Soviet Union and communism, even though that \nwas going to mean a longtime confrontation with the Soviet Union which \nmight even escalate into a hot war.\n  The Marshall plan to assist countries in southern Europe was a part \nof that perception, and we are well aware of all the other events that \nfollowed that. He perceived the need to stand and thwart the continued \naggression of an evil power, and we are grateful to him for that.\n  Emery said the other President to perceive a war is George W. Bush. \nOf course, September 11, you can say, made that easy. But I submit it \nis not necessarily that easy. Over time, people will begin to wonder \nwhether our commitment to a war on terror is really all that important \nif there are not further attacks. If we go another several months, \nhopefully even a year or two, without a major terrorist attack on the \nUnited States, will the American people continue to believe that this \nis a war worth fighting? Or was it a one-time-only proposition?\n  George W. Bush perceived the need to conduct a war on terror because \nhe understood that from a historical point of view, over the course of \nthe last dozen or 15 years, there had been a whole series of attacks \nagainst the United States or our interests, and when we in Congress \nMonday morning quarterback the FBI and CIA and say, ``You failed to \nconnect the dots,'' I wonder what those same people say about President \nBush's understanding of the history leading up to September 11. He is \nconnecting the dots between the Khobar Towers and the Cole bombing and \nthe embassy bombings in Africa. You can even go back further than that, \nbringing it on forward all the way up to September 11. Does an event \nhave to occur every 6 months for us to believe this is really a war \nworth stopping or worth winning and bringing to conclusion? I do not \nthink so.\n  I think the President, when he said to the American people, we are \ngoing to have to be patient in this war, understood that we would have \nto be patient, that it could take a long time. I have been very \ngratified at the response of the American people in not being as \nimpatient as we usually are as a people.\n  Americans love to get in, get the job done, and move on. That is a \ngreat trait of Americans. But the President here is saying be patient. \nSo far, I have been very impressed that the American people have been \nvery patient. What the President has perceived, that not everybody has \nperceived, is that this is a struggle that has been going on for some \ntime and it is going to continue in that same vein for as far out as we \ncan see, unless we defeat terrorism.\n\n  So the wrong question to be asking at this time is: Can you prove \nthat there is an imminent threat to the United States as a result of \nwhich we have to take military action against Iraq? That is the wrong \nquestion.\n  There are many fronts in this war on terror, from Lackawanna in New \nYork where we get the six people who we think were connected to \nterrorism, to Tora Bora, Afghanistan, where we had to rout out members \nof al-Qaida; to Pakistan, where we are fighting remnants of al-Qaida; \nto places such as Yemen and Sudan and Somalia and the Philippines and \nMalaysia; Hamburg, Germany, where we have had to roll up al-Qaida \noperatives; and then other places in the Middle East where there is \nterrorism going on every day and when there are people such as Saddam \nHussein building weapons of mass terror who would not be doing that, \nwould not be spending the resources and trying to hide them, simply to \nplay some kind of game. They are obviously serious people with evil \nintentions. I think everybody concedes that.\n  Then the question becomes: Why should you put the burden on the \nPresident to prove that at a particular time Saddam Hussein is going to \nstrike the United States in order to conclude that we have to do \nsomething about him? It is the same kind of thinking as in the late \n1930s, that, in retrospect, we look back on and say: Anybody could have \nrealized that Hitler was somebody who had to be stopped. Why did \nNeville Chamberlain act so foolishly when he came back from Munich and \nsaid, ``Peace in our time''?\n  I submit there are people today who are hoping against hope that \nSaddam Hussein will never use these weapons, weapons that are far \ngreater than anything Adolph Hitler ever had in terms of their \npotential for destruction and death. I just wonder whether there are \npeople who really believe we should wait until something specific and \nobjective happens before we have a right to act, or whether \npreventative action is called for. Some call it preemption; some call \nit prevention. But the idea is that with war on terrorism you shouldn't \nhave to wait until you are attacked to respond. That creates too many \ndeaths, too much misery, and is unthinkable after September 11.\n\n  The President, based upon good intelligence, has concluded that \nSaddam Hussein has a very large stock of very lethal weapons of mass \ndestruction. By that, we mean chemical agents and biological agents \nwhich have been or can be ``weaponized''; that is to say, there are \nmeans of delivering those agents that can cause massive amounts of \ncasualties; that he has been working to acquire a nuclear weapon.\n  All of this is in open, public debate. And there is no doubt about \nany of it. The only doubt with respect to nuclear weapons is exactly \nwhere he is in the process. Of course, we don't know because he hasn't \nallowed us to inspect the places in his country where we believe he is \ntrying to produce these nuclear weapons or, more specifically, the \nenriched uranium that would be a part of the weapons.\n  For 4 years now, we have had no inspectors in the country, and before \nthat most of the information that we got was based upon information \nfrom defectors--people who came out of Iraq and told us: You guys are \nmissing what Saddam Hussein is doing. This is where you need to look. \nThis is what you need to look for.\n  When our inspectors then demanded to go to those places, one of three \nthings happened. Either they said, no, you can't go there; that is a \nPresidential palace or whatever it is, or they went there and as they \nwere walking in the front door satellite photos showed people running \nout of the backdoors with the stuff, or in the couple of cases we \nactually did find evidence of these weapons of mass destruction. Of \ncourse, at that point, Saddam Hussein said: Oh, that's right. I forgot \nabout that. But whatever the defector said, that is all there is.\n  So he was confirming exactly what we already knew and gave us nothing \nmore than that. Yet there are those who believe through some kind of \nnew inspection process that we are going to learn more than we did \nbefore; that this will be an adequate substitute for going in and \nfinding these weapons of mass destruction in an unrestricted way.\n  Saddam Hussein first said, You can have total access with no \nconditions, and he immediately began tying on conditions, the basis of \nwhich are laughable. You can't go into the Presidential palaces. They \nare grounds or areas with 1,000 buildings the size of the District of \nColumbia. We are going to send three inspectors in there? OK. There is \nthe District of Columbia with all the buildings, and so on. Have at it.\n  We are not going to find anything. We are going to be running around \nfor years. So inspections are merely a means to an end. They are not \nthe end. The goal here is not to have inspections. The goal is \ndisarmament. And we know from intelligence that he has certain things \nhe has not disarmed; that he hasn't done what he promised to do--both \nto the United States and the United Nations; that he hasn't complied \nwith the United Nations resolutions. In fact, we see his violation of \nthose resolutions almost every day. We don't have inspectors in there \nanymore who he was harassing and precluding from doing their job.\n  But we do have aircraft flying in the no-fly zones and having \nAmerican pilots and British pilots shot at every\n\n[[Page S9886]]\n\nmonth, necessitating our taking those SAM sites and radar sites out \nof action by military force. So, in a sense, this is unfinished \nbusiness from the gulf war which has never stopped. At a low level we \nhave been trying to enforce the resolutions ever since the end of the \ngulf war. Our effort to rid many of these weapons of mass destruction \nis but the latest chapter.\n\n  We made the decision in 1998 that Saddam Hussein had to go. We voted \non a resolution here, and everybody was for it in 1998. If it was the \nright thing to do then, why is it no longer necessarily the right thing \nto do? He has had 4 more years to develop these weapons and to get \ncloser to a nuclear capability.\n  We now have a group of terrorists in the world who we know talk to \neach other, help each other, and give each other safe passage and \naccess and places for training, and so on. We are developing \ninformation on connections with these terrorists and the State of Iraq. \nAll of this has happened in the meantime. But now, suddenly, it is not \nthe time.\n  If we establish too high a burden of proof here we are going to be \nfiddling until we become absolutely sure it is time, and then it will \nbe too late. That is why I believe the President is on the right track \nto say we don't know exactly when, where, or how but we know that this \nis a man who has very evil intentions and is working very hard to be \nable to strike at us. We can't let it happen. We can't wait until he \nhas hit us to get him.\n  For those reasons, and a variety of others that I will be talking \nabout, I believe it is important for us to go into this debate with a \nview towards supporting the President, and the action that he has \ncalled for publicly and in the resolution that he has negotiated with \ncongressional leaders and which has been placed on the floor.\n  I believe at the end of the day we will conclude that the President \nshould be supported and that we should authorize the use of force, and \nthat we will have intelligence satisfactory for all of us to back up \nthis resolution. And the final point--going back to the original point \nof my conversation today--that it is a phony issue to somehow demand \nthat the intelligence community provide us with information to which we \nhaven't been given access. We have gotten all that we need to have \naccess to. Our Members have asked for that information, and they can \nget it. The only information that they can't get is information that \nshould not be provided anybody, including you, Mr. President, myself, \nand the distinguished minority leader who now joins us on the floor.\n  I will have more to say later. I know the minority leader has some \nthings he would like to say. At this point, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 3, 2002]\n\n   C.I.A. Rejects Request for Report on Preparations for War in Iraq\n\n                            (By James Risen)\n\n       Washington, October 2.--The Central Intelligence Agency has \n     refused to provide Congress a comprehensive report on its \n     role in a possible American campaign against Iraq, setting \n     off a bitter dispute between the agency and leaders of the \n     Senate Intelligence Committee, Congressional leaders said \n     today.\n       In a contentious, closed-door Senate hearing today, agency \n     officials refused to comply with a request from the committee \n     for a broad review of how the intelligence community's \n     clandestine role against the government of Saddam Hussein \n     would be coordinated with the diplomatic and military actions \n     that the Bush administration is planning.\n       Lawmakers said they were further incensed because the \n     director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, who had \n     been expected to testify about the Iraq report, did not \n     appear at the classified hearing. A senior intelligence \n     official said Mr. Tenet was meeting with President Bush. \n     Instead, the agency was represented by the deputy director, \n     John McLaughlin, and Robert Walpole, the national \n     intelligence officer for strategic and nuclear programs.\n       The agency rejected the committee's request for a report. \n     After the rejection, Congressional leaders accused the \n     administration of not providing the information out of fear \n     of revealing divisions among the State Department, C.I.A., \n     Pentagon and other agencies over the Bush administration's \n     Iraq strategy.\n       Government officials said that the agency's response also \n     strongly suggested that Mr. Bush had already made important \n     decisions on how to use the C.I.A. in a potential war with \n     Iraq. One senior government official said it appeared that \n     the C.I.A. did not want to issue an assessment of the Bush \n     strategy that might appear to be ``second-guessing'' of the \n     president's plans.\n       The dispute was the latest of several confrontations \n     between the C.I.A. and Congress over access to information \n     about a range of domestic and foreign policy matters. Just \n     last week, lawyers for the General Accounting Office and Vice \n     President Dick Cheney argued in federal court over whether \n     the White House must turn over confidential information on \n     the energy policy task force that Mr. Cheney headed last \n     year.\n       The C.I.A.'s rejection of the Congressional request, which \n     some lawmakers contend was heavily influenced by the White \n     House, comes as relations between the agency and Congress \n     have badly deteriorated. The relations have soured over the \n     ongoing investigation by a joint House-Senate inquiry--\n     composed of members of the Senate and House intelligence \n     committees--into the missed signals before the Sept. 11 \n     attacks.\n       Mr. Tenet in particular has been a target of lawmakers. \n     Last Friday, Mr. Tenet, a former Senate staffer himself, \n     wrote a scathing letter to the leaders of the joint \n     Congressional inquiry, denouncing the panel for writing a \n     briefing paper that questioned the honesty of a senior C.I.A. \n     official before he even testified.\n       A senior intelligence official said Mr. Tenet's absence at \n     the hearing today was unavoidable, and that no slight was \n     intended. The official said that he missed the hearing \n     because he was at the White House with Mr. Bush, helping to \n     brief other Congressional leaders Iraq. The official said Mr. \n     Tenet had advised the committee staff several days ago that \n     he would not be able to attend. Mr. Tenet has promised to \n     testify about the matter in another classified hearing on \n     Friday, officials said.\n       One Congressional official said that the incident has badly \n     damaged Mr. Tenet's relations with Congress, something that \n     Mr. Tenet had always worked hard to cultivate.\n       ``I hope we aren't seeing some schoolyard level of \n     petulance,'' by the C.I.A., the official said.\n       While the House and Senate intelligence oversight committee \n     have received classified information about planned covert \n     operations against Iraq, the C.I.A. has not told lawmakers \n     how the agency and the Bush administration see those \n     operations fitting into the larger war on Iraq, or the global \n     war on terrorism, Congressional officials said.\n       ``What they haven't told us is how does the intelligence \n     piece fit into the larger offensive against Iraq, or how do \n     these extra demands on our intelligence capabilities affect \n     our commitment to the war on terrorism in Afghanistan,'' said \n     one official.\n       Congressional leaders complained that they have been left \n     in the dark on how the intelligence community will be used \n     just as they are about to debate a resolution to support war \n     with Iraq.\n       Congressional leaders said the decision to fight the \n     Congressional request may stem from a fear of exposing \n     divisions within the intelligence community over the \n     administration's Iraq strategy, perhaps including a debate \n     between the agency and the Pentagon over the military's role \n     in intelligence operations in Iraq.\n       Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has been moving to \n     strengthen his control over the military's intelligence \n     apparatus, potentially setting up a turf war for dominance \n     among American intelligence officials. Mr. Rumsfeld has also \n     been pushing to expand the role of American Special \n     Operations Forces into covert operations, including \n     activities that have traditionally been the preserve of the \n     C.I.A.\n       Congressional leaders asked for the report in July, and \n     expressed particular discontent that the C.I.A. did not \n     respond for two months. Lawmakers had asked that the report \n     be provided in the form of a national intelligence estimate, \n     a formal document that is supposed to provide a consensus \n     judgment by the several intelligence agencies.\n       The committee wanted to see whether analysts at different \n     agencies, including the C.I.A., the Defense Intelligence \n     Agency, the National Security Agency and the State \n     Department, have sharply differing views about the proper \n     role of the intelligence community in Iraq.\n       But intelligence officials say that a national intelligence \n     estimate is designed to assess the policies of foreign \n     countries--not those of the United States. ``They were asking \n     for an assessment of U.S. policy, and that falls outside the \n     realm of the N.I.E., and it gets into the purview of the \n     commander in chief,'' an intelligence official said.\n       Committee members have also expressed anger that the C.I.A. \n     refused to fully comply with a separate request for another \n     national intelligence estimate, one that would have provided \n     an overview of the intelligence community's latest assessment \n     on Iraq. Instead, the C.I.A. provided a narrower report, \n     dealing specifically with Iraq's program to develop weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       Lawmakers said that Mr. Tenet had assured the committee in \n     early September that intelligence officials were in the midst \n     of producing an updated national intelligence estimate on \n     Iraq, and that the committee would receive it as soon as it \n     was completed.\n       Instead, the Senate panel received the national \n     intelligence estimate on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \n     program after 10\n\n[[Page S9887]]\n\n     p.m. on Tuesday night, too late for members to read it before \n     Wednesday's hearing.\n       The committee had ``set out an explicit set of requests'' \n     for what was to be included in the Iraq national intelligence \n     estimate, said one official. Those requirements were not met. \n     ``We wanted to know what the intelligence community's \n     assessment of the effect on a war in Iraq on neighboring \n     states, and they did not answer that question,'' the official \n     said.\n       A senior intelligence official said the 100-page report on \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program was completed in \n     three weeks under very tight Congressional deadlines, and the \n     writing had to be coordinated with several agencies.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe in just a moment the Senate will \nbe ready to move to completion on the Department of Justice \nauthorization conference report.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Kyl from Arizona, who has been \nspeaking for the last several minutes, that I appreciate his speech and \nhis very effective and diligent work. He cares an awful lot about \nnational security, about our defense capability, and about our \nintelligence communities, and his position on what we need to do in \nIraq. It is not easy being a member of the Intelligence Committee \nsometimes. It takes a lot of extra meetings, a lot of briefings, and an \nawful lot that you can't talk about. For a Member of the Senate, that \nis tough. But Senator Kyl certainly does a good job in that effort.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this unanimous consent has been cleared by \nboth leaders. I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be \nvitiated and that the conference report be adopted, without intervening \naction, motion, or debate; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; that following adoption of the conference report, there be a \nperiod of morning business until 4:20 p.m.; that the time until 4:20 be \ndivided between the majority and minority leaders, and that Senator \nDaschle have the last period of time to speak; that without any \nintervening action or debate, at 4:20, the Senate proceed to vote on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for filing \ncloture on the bipartisan 21st Century Department of Justice \nAuthorization Act conference report. I regret that consideration and a \nvote on final passage on this important measure has been delayed. I had \nhoped this measure would have been considered and passed by the Senate \nlast week, following House passage by a vote of 400 to 4 last Thursday.\n  Unfortunately, Members from the other side of the aisle threatened \nopposition to the motion to proceed to the conference report and they \nhave refused to proceed to vote on final passage of the conference \nreport. All Democrats were prepared to pass the conference report last \nThursday and then agreed to vote immediately, after limited debate \nearlier this week. Given the objection by the other side, however, to \nproceed to a vote or agree to a time agreement, the majority leader was \nrequired to file cloture on this conference report.\n  I do not understand why anyone would filibuster this conference \nreport. This legislation is truly bipartisan. It passed the House 400 \nto 4.\n  The conference report was signed by every conferee, Republican or \nDemocrat, including Senator Hatch and Representatives Sensenbrenner, \nHyde, and Lamar Smith.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison for coming to the floor on Tuesday to \nsupport this conference report. Senator Hutchison has spoken to me many \ntimes about the need for more judgeships along the Texas border with \nMexico to handle immigration and criminal cases.\n  The conference report includes three new judgeships in the conference \nreport for Texas, one more than was included in the bill reported to \nthe Senate by the Senate Judiciary Committee and passed by the Senate \nlast December.\n  I thank Senator Sessions for his statement on Tuesday in support of \nthis bipartisan conference report.\n  Although he opposes Senator Hatch's legislation regarding automobile \ndealer arbitration, which enjoys more than 60 Senate cosponsors and 200 \nHouse cosponsors and was included in the conference report, Senator \nSessions is supporting this conference report because it will improve \nthe Department of Justice and support local law enforcement agencies \nacross the nation. I appreciate Senator Sessions' work on the \nprovisions in the conference report on the Paul Coverdell Forensic \nSciences Improvement Grants and the Centers for Domestic Preparedness \nin Alabama and other States.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for her excellent speech earlier this week \nin support of this conference report. Senator Feinstein has been a \ntireless advocate for the needs of California, including the needs of \nthe federal judiciary along the southern border. She has led the effort \nto increase judicial and law enforcement resources along our southern \nborder. I am proud to have served as the chair of the House-Senate \nconference committee that unanimously reported a bill that includes \nfive judgeships for the Southern District of California. Long overdue \nrelief for the Southern District of California could be on the way once \nthis conference report is adopted.\n  Of course, our bipartisanship is evidenced by our included \nauthorization for additional judgeships not only in California but in \nTexas, Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois and Florida, \nas well. In essence, in the six and one-half years that they controlled \nthe Senate the Republican majority was willing to add only eight \njudgeships to be appointed by a Democratic President, and most of them \nwere in Texas and Arizona, states with two Republican Senators.\n  We have, on the other hand, proceeded at our earliest opportunity to \nincrease federal judgeships where most needed by 20 to be appointed by \na Republican President who has shown little interest in working with \nDemocrats in the Senate, and we have included a number of jurisdictions \nwith Democrats Senators.\n  I also commend the senior senator from California for her leadership \non the ``James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act,'' the State \nCriminal Alien Assistant Program reauthorization, and the many anti-\ndrug abuse provisions included in this conference report.\n  She spoke eloquently on the floor of the Senate regarding many of the \nimportant provisions she has championed in this process.\n  This conference report will strengthen our Justice Department and the \nFBI, increase our preparedness against terrorist attacks, prevent crime \nand drug abuse, improve our intellectual property and antitrust laws, \nstrengthen and protect our judiciary, and offer our children a safe \nplace to go after school.\n  This conference report is the product of years of bipartisan work. \nThe conference report was unanimous. By my count, the conference report \nincludes significant portions of at least 25 legislative initiatives.\n  I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this conference \nreport so that all of this bipartisan work and all the good that this \nlegislation might is not flushed down the drain.\n  Over the past 2 days of debate, I have heard only a few Members raise \nobjections to passage of the Department of Justice Authorization \nConference Report. I thank these Members for coming to the floor to \ndiscuss their views and concerns so that they may be addressed. I \nshould note that even in posing an objection to and delaying passage of \nthe conference report--as is their rights as Senators--these Members \nacknowledged that there were parts of this bill they liked or may like \nupon review.\n  I appreciate that not all Members were or could be conferees and \nparticipate in the conference, but I do hope that after they have had a \nfull opportunity to study the conference report passed last week in the \nHouse by a vote of 400 to 4, that they will find that on the whole this \nis a good, solid piece of legislation. Senator Hatch worked very hard \nto help construct a good, fair and balanced conference report as did \nall of the conferees. We all owe him thanks for his attention to this \nmatter and his work.\n  This legislation is neither complicated nor controversial. It passed \nthe House 400 to 4 in short order. It was\n\n[[Page S9888]]\n\nsigned by every conferee, Republican or Democrat, including Senator \nHatch and Representatives Sensenbrenner, Hyde, and Lamar Smith. \nSenators Sessions and Hutchison came to the floor to support it. I did \nnot think there was a need for extensive debate in the Senate on this \nmeasure and had hoped that Members would be willing to allow an up or \ndown vote of the conference report.\n  Contrary to those who may argue that this legislation is not a \npriority, it is. Congress has not authorized the Department of Justice \nin more than two decades. While the Justice Department would certainly \ncontinue to exist if we were to fail to reauthorize it, that is not an \nexcuse for shirking our responsibility now. I know that Senator Hatch \nand Representatives Sensenbrenner and Conyers share my view. It is long \npast time for the Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate--and the \nCongress as a whole--to restore their proper oversight role over the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Through Republican and Democratic administrations, we have allowed \nthe Department of Justice to escape its accountability to the Senate \nand House of Representatives and through them to the American people. \nCongress, the people's representative, has a strong institutional \ninterest in restoring that accountability. The House has recognized \nthis, and has done its job. We need to do ours.\n  I agree with those Members who say that we need to give anti-\nterrorism priority, but not lose sight of the other important missions \nof the Department of Justice.\n  The conference report takes such a balanced approach. Those critics \nwho say that there is nothing new in this legislation to fight \nterrorism, have missed some important provisions in the legislation as \nwell as my floor statements over the past week outlining what the \nconference report contains to help in the anti-terrorism effort.\n  Let me repeat the highlight of what the conference report does on \nthis important problem.\n  The conference report fortifies our border security by authorizing \nover $20 billion for the administration and enforcement of the laws \nrelating to immigration, naturalization, and alien registration. It \nalso authorizes funding for Centers for Domestic Preparedness in \nAlabama, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Nevada, Vermont and \nPennsylvania, and adds additional uses for grants from the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness to support State and local law enforcement \nagencies. These provisions have strong bipartisan support, including \nthat of Senator Sessions.\n  Another measure in the bill would correct a glitch in a law that \nhelps prosecutors combat the international financing of terrorism. I \nworked closely with the White House to pass the original provision to \nbring the United States into compliance with a treaty that bans \nterrorist financing, but without this technical, noncontroversial \nchange, the provision may not be usable. This law is vital in stopping \nthe flow of money to terrorists. Worse yet, at a time when the \nPresident is going before the U.N. emphasizing that our enemies are not \ncomplying with international law, by blocking this minor fix, we leave \nourselves open to a charge that we are not complying with an anti-\nterrorism treaty.\n  I agree with other Members that we should do more to help the FBI \nDirector in transforming the FBI from a crime fighting to a terrorism \nprevention agency and to help the FBI overcome its information \ntechnology, management and other problems to be the best that it can \nbe. The Judiciary Committee reported unanimously the Leahy-Grassley FBI \nReform Act, S. 1974, over 6 months ago to reach those goals, but this \nlegislation has been blocked by an anonymous hold from moving forward. \nThis conference report contains parts of that bipartisan legislation, \nbut not the whole bill, which continues to this day to be blocked to \nthis day.\n  Since the attacks of September 11 and the anthrax attacks last fall, \nwe have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of catastrophic \nterrorism that endanger the lives of the American people and the \ninstitutions of our country. Reform and improvement at the FBI was \nalready important, but the terrorist attacks suffered by this country \nlast year have imposed even greater urgency on improving the FBI. The \nBureau is our front line of domestic defense against terrorists. It \nneeds to be as great as it can.\n  Even before those attacks, the Judiciary Committee's oversight \nhearings revealed serious problems at the FBI that needed strong \ncongressional action to fix. We heard about a double standard in \nevaluations and discipline. We heard about record and information \nmanagement problems and communications breakdown between field offices \nand Headquarters that led to the belated production of documents in the \nOklahoma City bombing case. Despite the fact that we have poured money \ninto the FBI over the last five years, we heard that the FBI's computer \nsystem were in dire need of modernization.\n  We heard about how an FBI supervisor, Robert Hanssen, was able to \nsell critical secrets to the Russians undetected for years without ever \ngetting a polygraph. We heard that there were no fewer than 15 \ndifferent areas of security at the FBI that needed fixing.\n  The FBI Reform Act tackles these problems with improved \naccountability, improved security both inside and outside the FBI, and \nrequired planning to ensure the FBI is prepared to deal with the \nmultitude of challenges we are facing.\n  We are all indebted to Senator Grassley for his leadership in the \narea. Working with Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee we unanimously reported the FBI Reform Act more than six \nmonths ago only to stymied on our bipartisan efforts by an anonymous \nRepublican hold.\n  The conference report does not contain all of the important \nprovisions in the FBI Reform Act that Senator Grassley and I, and the \nother members of the Judiciary Committee, agreed were needed, but it \ndoes contain parts of that other bill.\n  Among the items that are, unfortunately, not in the conference report \nand are being blocked from passing in the stand-alone FBI Reform bill \nby an anonymous Republican hold are the following: Title III of the FBI \nReform bill that would institute a career security officer program, \nwhich senior FBI officials have testified before our Committee would be \nvery helpful; title IV of the FBI Reform bill outlining the \nrequirements for a polygraph program along the lines of what the \nWebster Commission recommended; title VII of the FBI Reform bill that \ntakes important steps to fix some of the double standard problems and \nsupport the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, which FBI \nEthics and OPR agents say is very important; and title VIII to push \nalong implementation of secure communications networks to help \nfacilitate FISA processing between Main Justice and the FBI. These \nhard-working agents and prosecutors have to hand-carry top secret FISA \ndocuments between their offices because they still lack send secure e-\nmail systems.\n  The FBI Reform bill would help fix may of these problems and I would \nhope we would be able to pass all of the FBI Reform Act before the end \nof this Congress. These should not be controversial provisions and are \ndesigned to help the FBI. Yet passage of these provisions are being \nblocked both in a stand-alone FBI Reform bill, S. 1974, and the \nprovisions we were able to include in this conference report. I urge my \ncolleagues to support final passage of the conference report so that we \ncan start making progress on the important reforms in the bill.\n  Some Members have complained that we included provisions in this \nconference report that were not contained in either the Senate or House \nbills. Now, each of the proposals we have included are directly related \nto improving the administration of justice in the United States. We \nwere asked to include many of them by Republican members of the House \nand Senate.\n  Let me give you some examples. The conference report reauthorizes the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program, which President Bush has \nsought to eliminate. On March 4 of this year, Senator Kyl and Senator \nFeinstein sent me a letter asking me to include an authorization for \nSCAAP--which was not authorized in either the House- or Senate-passed \nbill--in the conference report. That proposal had been\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\nconsidered and reported by the Judiciary Committee but a Republican \nhold has stopped Senate consideration and passage. I agreed with \nSenator Kyl that we should authorize SCAAP. I still believe that it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  In addition to including the reauthorization of SCAAP, the conferees \nalso authorized an additional judge for Arizona. Members have been \narguing for years that their States need more judges. We took those \narguments seriously, and added another new judge for Arizona on top of \nthe two that were added in 1998 and the third that was added in 2000. \nAs I said before, we have added twenty new judge positions in this \nconference report.\n  Some have been critical of the conference report's authorization of \nfunding for DEA police training in South and Central Asia, and for the \nUnited States-Thailand drug prosecutor exchange program. I believe that \nboth of these are worthy programs that deserve the Senate's support.\n  I have listened to President Bush and other in his Administration and \nin Congress argue that terrorist organizations in Asia, including al \nQaeda, have repeatedly used drug proceeds to fund their operations.\n  The conferees wanted to do whatever we could to break the link \nbetween drug trafficking and terror, and we would all greatly \nappreciate the Senate's assistance in that effort.\n  Beyond the relationship between drug trafficking and terrorism, the \nproduction of drugs in Asia has a tremendous impact on America.\n  For example, more than a quarter of the heroin that is plaguing the \nnortheastern United States, including my State of Vermont, comes from \nSoutheast Asia. Many of the governments in that region want to work \nwith the United States to reduce the production of drugs, and these \nprograms will help. It is beyond me why any Senator would oppose them.\n  Some have complained that the conference report demands too many \nreports from the Department of Justice and that this would interfere \nwith the Department's ongoing counterterrorism efforts. It is true that \nour legislation requires a number of reports, as part of our oversight \nobligations over the Department of Justice. I assure the Senate, \nhowever, that if the Department of Justice comes to the House and \nSenate Judiciary Committees and makes a convincing case that any \nreporting requirement in this legislation will hinder our national \nsecurity, we will work out a reasonable accommodation.\n  I think, however, that such a turn of events is exceedingly unlikely, \nas no one at the Department has mentioned any such concerns.\n  Some Members have complained that the conference report includes \npieces of legislation that had not received Committee consideration. \nLet me deal with some of the specific proposals that have been cited.\n  The Law Enforcement Tribute Act was mentioned as a provision not \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee, but this is incorrect. In \nreality, the Committee reported that bill favorably on May 16. Its \npassage has been blocked by an anonymous Republican hold.\n  Complaints have been made about inclusion of the motor vehicle \nfranchise dispute resolution provision in the conference report for \nbypassing the Committee. But, again, that is incorrect. The Judiciary \nCommittee fully considered this proposal and reported Senator Hatch's \nMotor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act last October \n31. It has been stalled from the Senate floor by anonymous Republican \nholds.\n  A section allowing FBI danger pay was cited as a proposal that \nbypassed Committee consideration, but, again, the Judiciary Committee \ndid consider this proposal as part of the original DOJ Authorization \nbill, S. 1319.\n  Some have complained that the Federal Judiciary Protection Act, which \nis included in the conference report, had not come before the \nCommittee, but on the contrary, this legislation, S. 1099, was passed \nthe Judiciary Committee and the Senate by unanimous consent last year \nand in the 106th Congress, as well.\n  There has been a complaint on the floor about the provisions on the \nU.S. Parole Commission being included in the conference report. That \nwas included because the Bush Administration included it in its budget \nrequest.\n  Some have complained on the floor about the conference report's \nprovision establishing the FBI police to provide protection for the FBI \nbuildings and personnel in this time of heightened concerns about \nterrorist attacks. Contrary to the critics, this proposal was \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee as part of the FBI Reform Act, S. \n1974, which was reported unanimously on a bipartisan basis but has been \nblocked by an anonymous hold.\n  Similarly, a complaint was made on the floor about bypassing the \nCommittee with the provision in the conference report for the FBI to \ntell the Congress about how the FBI is updating its obsolete computer \nsystems. Again, this is incorrect. This provision was included in the \nFBI Reform Act, S. 1974, which was considered by the Judiciary \ncommittee and unanimously reported without objection.\n  Some critics have complained that the conference report includes \nintellectual property provisions that have passed neither the House or \nthe Senate. It is not for lack of trying to pass these provisions \nthrough the Senate, but anonymous Republican holds have held up for \nmonths passage of the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, S. 407. This \nlegislation has passed the House on three separate times in three \nconsecutive Congresses. Let us get it passed now in the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report also contains another intellectual property \nmatter, the Hatch-Leahy TEACH Act, to help distance learning. Contrary \nto the critics' statements, this passed the Senate in June, 2001.\n  The intellectual Property and High Technology Technical Amendments \nAct, S. 320, contained in this conference report, was passed by the \nSenate at the beginning of this Congress, in February, 2001. It is time \nto get this done.\n  The criticism made on the floor that the juvenile justice provisions \nin the conference report never passed the House or Senate is simply \nwrong. The conference report contains juvenile justice provisions \npassed by the House in September and October of last year, in H.R. 863 \nand H.R. 1900.\n  The criticism that the conference report contains criminal justice \nimprovements that were passed by neither the House or the Senate \nglosses over two important points: First, that many of the provisions \nwere indeed passed by the House, and, second, that others have been \nblocked from Senate consideration and passage by anonymous Republican \nholds. Let me give you some examples.\n  The conference report contains the Judicial Improvements Act, S. 2713 \nand H.R. 3892, that passed the House in July, 2002, but consideration \nby the Senate was blocked after the Senate bill was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The Antitrust Technical Corrections bills, H.R. 809, had the same \nfate. After being passed by the House in March, 2001, and reported by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, consideration was blocked in the \nSenate.\n  This conference report is a comprehensive attempt to ensure the \nadministration of justice in our nation. It is not everything I would \nlike or that any individual Member of Congress might have authored.\n  It is a conference report, a consensus document, a product of the \ngive and take with the House that is our legislative process. It will \nstrengthen our Justice Department and the FBI, increase our \npreparedness against terrorist attacks, prevent crime and drug abuse, \nimprove our intellectual property and antitrust laws, strengthen and \nprotect our judiciary, and offer our children a safe place to go after \nschool.\n  I hope that it will merit the support of every Member of the United \nStates Senate. At the very least, it deserves an up-or-down vote. I was \npleased to see some Republicans come to the floor to support this \nconference report. For the sake of the Justice Department, the United \nStates Congress, and the American people, we should pass this \nlegislation today.\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the 21st \nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. The \nConference Report is now before the Senate. The title of the Conference \nReport--``The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act''--is appropriately named--the bill is a forward-\n\n[[Page S9890]]\n\nlooking measure which will strengthen the Justice Department and our \njudicial system as we face the new challenges of the 21st century. More \nspecifically, the bill provides the Justice Department with the \nnecessary tools and resources: to detect and prevent future terrorist \nattacks; to reduce drug abuse and prevent drug-related crimes; to \nenhance our country's ability to compete in international markets by \nimproving our intellectual property and antitrust laws; and to address \nthe growing needs of our at-risk youth by offering meaningful \nalternatives to the temptations of crime. The House last week passed \nthe Conference Report by a vote of 400-4. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important piece of legislation.\n  Before I address the substance of the Conference Report, I want to \ntake a moment to thank my distinguished colleagues, Chairman Leahy, and \nHouse Judiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner, and Ranking Member Conyers, for \nall of their hard work, commitment and determination on this important \nmatter. Senator Leahy and I have been working together for years to \nenact a Department of Justice reauthorization bill, and I am pleased \nthat we are finally able to bring the matter to the Senate for its \nconsideration.\n  The Department of Justice's main duty is to provide justice to all \nAmericans, certainly of central importance to our national life. It has \nthe primary responsibility for the enforcement of our Nation's laws. \nThrough its divisions and agencies including the FBI and DEA, it \ninvestigates and prosecutes violations of federal criminal laws, \nprotects the civil rights of our citizens, enforces the antitrust laws, \nand represents every department and agency of the United States \ngovernment in litigation. Increasingly, its mission is international as \nwell, protecting the interests of the United States and its people from \ngrowing threats of trans-national crime and international terrorism. \nAdditionally, among the Department's key duties is providing much \nneeded assistance and advice to state and local law enforcement \nagencies.\n  It has been over two decades since Congress reauthorized the Justice \nDepartment. If enacted, H.R. 2215 will be a significant step in \nCongress's efforts to reassert its rightful role in overseeing the \noperation of the Justice Department. By instituting a regular \nreauthorization procedure for the Justice Department, Congress will be \nable to ensure that the Justice Department has all the necessary tools \nto carry out its critical functions.\n  Let me be clear that I am not advocating that we micro-manage the \nDepartment of Justice. I have full confidence in Attorney General \nAshcroft and the thousands of employees who competently manage the \nDepartment daily. However, we cannot continue to neglect our \nresponsibility to exercise responsible oversight of the Justice \nDepartment which so profoundly affects the lives of all Americans.\n\n  The tragic events of September 11th have underscored the need for \nCongress to work closely with the Justice Department. Last year, we \nworked with the Justice Department to ensure swift passage of the \nPATRIOT Act, which has strengthened America's security by providing law \nenforcement with the necessary tools to fight the war against \nterrorism. We will continue to provide the Justice Department with the \nlegislative tools and resources needed to win this war against \nterrorism.\n  The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nincludes a number of important provisions which I will briefly \nhighlight. Most significantly, the bill fully authorizes the Justice \nDepartment and its major components for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. \nAmong these authorizations are funding for the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation to protect against terrorism and cyber-crime, the Drug \nEnforcement Administration to combat the trafficking of illegal drugs, \nand the Immigration and Nationalization Service to enforce our \ncountry's immigration laws. The bill also adds 94 new Assistant United \nStates Attorneys to implement the President's Project Safe \nNeighborhoods initiative which is aimed at reducing gun violence in our \ncommunities.\n  With respect to congressional oversight, the conference report \nstrengthens the authority of the Department's Inspector General in \norder to address internal issues within the Justice Department. It \nspecifically expands the Inspector General's authority to include \nresponsibility for investigating the FBI. In order to establish a \nbaseline from which to focus future oversight of the Justice \nDepartment, the bill requires the Department to submit to Congress \nreports detailing the operation of the Office of Justice Programs and \nall of the Justice Department's litigation activities.\n  The conference report enacts many of the provisions of the Drug Abuse \nEducation, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001, S. 304, which I \nintroduced in the Senate with Senators Leahy and Biden more than 18 \nmonths ago, and which has received wide bipartisan support. This \nlegislation marks a watershed event in the national effort to combat \ndrug addiction, and makes a significant, sustained commitment to \nproviding federal resources for reducing the demand for illicit drugs. \nInvesting in proven prevention and treatment programs can help reduce \nthe wreckage and the unwarranted burden of drug abuse on society.\n  Specifically, the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and Treatment \nprovisions: No. 1, increase drug treatment grants for prisoners and \nresidential aftercare programs; No. 2, require a study and review of \ndrug-testing technologies and all federal drug and substance abuse \ntreatment and prevention programs in order to recommend necessary \nreforms to these programs; No. 3, expand drug abuse and addiction \nresearch; No. 4, expand the Drug Courts program; No. 5, provide post-\nincarceration vocational and remedial educational opportunities for \nfederal inmates; and No. 6, provide grants to states to establish \ndemonstration projects to promote successful reentry of criminal \noffenders.\n\n  While ensuring effective drug treatment and prevention programs, the \nconference report includes a broad set of measures designed to protect \nour youth. Specifically, the bill supports the creation and expansion \nof Boys and Girls Clubs in our communities, enhances juvenile criminal \naccountability, and provides states with block grants to address \njuvenile crime. In addition to our nation's youth, the bill strengthens \nour criminal justice system by increasing penalties for those who \ntamper or threaten federal witnesses, or those criminals who harm \nFederal judges and law enforcement personnel.\n  In addition to our Nation's youth, the bill provides increased \nattention to crimes against women by establishing a Violence Against \nWomen Office within the Justice Department, which will be headed by a \npresidentially appointed and Senate confirmed Director. The Director, \nin part, will serve as a special counsel to the Attorney General on \nissues related to violence against women, provide information to the \nPresident, the Congress, State and local governments, and the general \npublic, and maintain a liaison with the judicial branches of federal \nand State governments.\n  The conference report addresses the operation of our federal \njudiciary by enacting long-needed judicial improvements and reforms to \njudicial disciplinary procedures. It also creates judgeships in various \ndistricts where there is a chronic shortage of federal judges to handle \nexisting caseloads, particularly in our border States such as Texas, \nNew Mexico, California, Nevada, Florida and Alabama. We need to do more \nhere, and add judges in other districts where caseloads are high, and I \nam hopeful we will be able to do that next Congress.\n  The bill also promotes America's economic security by enhancing our \ncompetitiveness in the world economy. Specifically, the bill makes some \nneeded changes to our antitrust laws, and creates a commission to \nreview our antitrust laws to determine what reforms, if any, are needed \nto ensure the effective operation of our free markets in our ``new'' \nhigh-tech economy.\n  The conference report enacts critical amendments to the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act of 2000, S. 898, which I introduced in order \nto clarify the eligibility standards and to ensure appropriate \ncompensation under the program. In addition, the bill enacts ``The \nMotor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Act,'' S. 1140, which I \nintroduced, was passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and which \nreceived\n\n[[Page S9891]]\n\nbipartisan support. This bill restricts the use of mandatory \narbitration provisions in motor vehicle franchise contracts.\n  Further, the bill includes several important provisions to reform \nintellectual property law. First, the bill directs the Justice \nDepartment to increase its enforcement of intellectual property laws. \nSecond, aside from enforcement, the bill enacts the Technology, \nEducation and Copyright Harmonization Act (TEACH Act, S. 487, which I \nintroduced and has received bipartisan support. This Act enhances our \ncountry's education system by revising federal copyright law to extend \nthe exemption from infringement liability for instructional \nbroadcasting to digital distance learning. Third, the Conference Report \nenacts several important reforms of our patent and trademark system \nwhich I supported, including: authorization of the Patent and Trademark \nOffice for fiscal years 2003 to 2008; revision of the filing and \nprocessing procedures for patent and trademark applications; and \nenactment of the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, S. 407, which \nensures international protection of United States trademarks.\n\n  Finally, the conference report refines INS administrative procedures \nin two specific areas in order to reduce INS processing delays. First, \nthe bill extends H-1B status for alien workers who wish to continue \nworking beyond the authorized 6-year period. Second, the bill includes \nprovisions for removal of conditional basis of permanent resident \nstatus applicable to certain alien entrepreneurs.\n  The conference report is a long-awaited and much-needed measure which \nwill ensure that Congress provides the required oversight--and support \nof--the Justice Department as it continues its critical role of \nenforcing our country's laws, protecting our country from terrorist \nattacks, enhancing our competitiveness in the world economy, and making \nour communities safer. Working together in a spirit of bipartisanship, \nthe bill provides the necessary framework to ensure that Congress and \nthe Administration will be able to identify solutions to the challenges \nfaced by federal law enforcement, and to ensure the efficient operation \nof the Justice Department and each of its components.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the tireless \nwork of the dedicated Staff members on both sides of the aisle whose \nwork around the clock made this legislation possible. First, on my \nstaff, I want to specifically commend my former staff member Leah \nBelaire, who recently joined the United States Attorney's Office for \nthe District of Columbia as an Assistant United States Attorney. She \nalong with my counsels, Mike Volkov, Wan Kim, Shawn Bentley, Patti \nDeLoatche, Rebecca Seidel, Bruce Artim, Dustin Pead, and my Chief \nCounsel and Staff Director, Makan Delrahim, all poured their hearts \ninto this legislation. On Chairman Leahy's staff, I want to thank Tim \nLynch and Ed Pagano, as well as Chairman Leahy's able General Counsel, \nBeryl Howell, and Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Bruce Cohan. On \nChairman Sensenbrenner's staff, I want to commend Will Moschella, Steve \nPinkos and Phil Kiko, for their hard work and dedication. On \nCongressman Conyer's staff, I want to thank Perry Apelbaum, Sam Garg, \nand Ted Kalo for their commitment to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this is an important piece of legislation that \ndeserves our full support. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the \nconference report.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I regret to point out one very important \nprovision that is missing from H.R. 2215: a district judgeship for \nIdaho. This is a matter of great urgency to the citizens of my State.\n  Idaho has two Federal district judgeships, created in 1890 and 1954. \nWe are one of only three States in the union with two Federal district \njudgeships.\n  There are three distinct and widely-distant geographical areas in my \nState: the Southeast, the Southwest and the North. A district judge \nmust travel up to 450 miles between division offices. This distance is \ngreater than that traveled in other rural district courts, including \nthose of Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota or Eastern \nWashington. In fact, only a district judge in Alaska has a greater \ndistance to travel, when comparing these rural district courts. Because \nof the State's sheer size, its extraordinary increase in population, \nand tremendous growth in caseload over nearly five decades, the current \nsituation is becoming increasingly unworkable, and we are seeking one \nadditional judgeship.\n  Unlike other States, we have no senior judges to fill in the gaps. We \nare depending on judges borrowed from other districts to help us, but \nobviously that can only be a temporary fix for the problem.\n  To remedy this crisis, the State of Idaho has requested a third \nFederal district judge. All members of the Federal bench in Idaho agree \nwith this request, and the Idaho State Legislature even passed a \nresolution petitioning Congress for this change.\n  I have been working on this issue throughout the 107th Congress, \nintroducing legislation along with my Idaho colleague Senator Crapo, \nconsulting with the Senate Judiciary Committee and lobbying its \nmembers, writing to the Judicial Conference. Our senior district judge \nin Idaho personally visited Capitol Hill and talked with staff and \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee.\n  When it became apparent that H.R. 2215 was the only legislative \nvehicle in this Congress for the creation of new judgeships, the entire \nIdaho Congressional Delegation, Senator Crapo and I, as well as our \nHouse colleagues Representative Mike Simpson and Representative Butch \nOtter, wrote to each member of the conference committee on this bill, \nreiterating our request.\n  To date, not a single member of the Senate or House has opposed our \nrequest. Yet at the end of the day, H.R. 2215 fails to include an \nadditional judge for Idaho.\n  It is my understanding that our request was not given priority \nbecause the Judicial Conference of the United States refused to endorse \nit. While Idaho did not originally meet the narrow requirements imposed \nby the Conference before it recommends an additional judgeship, I have \nbeen informed in the last few weeks that we now meet those \nrequirements, and Idaho hopes to obtain that critical endorsement in \nthe future.\n  With that, let me put the Senate on notice that my State will return \nin the next Congress with this request and will work for a better \nresult. There should not be waiting list for people to obtain justice \nin our courts, but there is in Idaho until relief arrives in the form \nof a third Federal district judge.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to address one aspect of the ``21st \nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act,'' H.R. \n2215. Section 312 creates a number of Federal judgeships, including a \ntemporary judgeship for the District of Arizona. Under the bill, the \ntemporary addition of an extra seat to the 12-member Federal district \ncourt will commence in July 2003 and will end with the first judicial \nretirement that occurs after that ten-year period expires, returning \nthe court to twelve seats.\n  The District of Arizona sorely needs this judgeship. According to the \nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts, the District of \nArizona ranks 10th in total weighted filings among all 94 districts. \nThe general standard for weighted filings established by the U.S. \nJudicial Conference as an indicator of a need for additional judgeships \nis 430. With 604 weighted filings per judgeship, the District of \nArizona exceeds this criteria by 29 percent, despite the recent and \nmuch appreciated addition of four new judges. The high level of filings \nin the District of Arizona is not temporary. The weighted filings in \nthis district have been substantially higher than the national average \nsince 1985.\n  The District of Arizona reported 6,300 civil and criminal case \nfilings in 2001, a 26 percent increase in filings over a five-year \nperiod. The District's criminal felony caseload has increased 104 \npercent over the past 5 years. The District ranks third among the \nNation's 94 districts in weighted criminal felony filings per \nauthorized judgeship, 231 percent above the national average. In \naddition to the burgeoning criminal caseload, the District's civil \ncaseload is on the rise. This District is an unenviable 71st nationally \nin median disposition time for civil cases and 85th nationally in \nmedian time from filing to trial in civil cases. Seven percent of\n\n[[Page S9892]]\n\nthe civil cases have been pending over three years.\n  According to the latest population statistics as reported by the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, Arizona's population increased by 40 percent from 1990 \nto 2000, while the national rate of population growth is only 13.1 \npercent. Arizona is ranked second only to Nevada for percentage of \ngrowth. The Arizona Department of Economic Security projects the \nState's population will grow another 25 percent by 2010.\n  This new judgeship will provide emergency aid to Arizona's District \nCourt, whose judges are extremely overburdened by crushing federal \ncaseloads. Arizona's Federal court, like those in other border states, \nsuffers special burdens as a result of sharp increases in drug \ntrafficking and immigration prosecutions. This backlog delays justice \nfor Arizonans and disrupts the proper administration of the courts.\n  I would like to commend Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, and \nRepresentative Sensenbrenner for including this much-needed judgeship. \nThis temporary judgeship is at least one reason to support the ``21st \nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9892-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9892-S9893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to a period of morning business.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there is no more solemn and important duty \nfor the Senate, in my opinion, than to debate the momentous issues of \nwar and peace. I remember in 1991 when we debated the gulf war \nresolution that it took on a very serious aura. Every Senator spoke. \nSenators actually came to the floor and listened to the debate. It was \na challenge. Not a one of us didn't feel some amount of concern and \ntrepidation and respect for the importance of that vote. I think we are \nfixing to embark on a debate of that magnitude again today.\n  The issue of Iraq is one that we are concerned about and which we \nhave been wrestling with for 11 years. But I think that today on the \nissue of Iraq we have reached what Winston Churchill called ``not the \nbeginning of the end but the end of the beginning.''\n  After weeks of careful preparation and bipartisan negotiation--it has \nbeen truly bipartisan on both sides of the aisle in the Senate, and in \nthe House it has been a bicameral effort--I believe the Senate will, \nonce again, show why it is called ``the greatest deliberative body.'' I \nthink we will have some very interesting and very thoughtful speeches \nthat will be given next week. Obviously, we will not all agree. \nObviously, we will have respect for each other--no matter what the \nposition may be.\n  But I think, in the end, we are going to see we are going to have a \nvery broad, bipartisan vote expressing our concern about what this \nsituation is in Iraq, about the fact the United Nations resolutions--\nall 16 of them--have been ignored, for the most part, for 11 years, and \nit is time we take action to avoid some horrendous events that could \noccur if we do not.\n  I believe we will give the President the authority he needs to deal \nwith this problem. I want to emphasize this President has listened, and \nhe has also challenged us. He has shown commitment and leadership. Some \nof us in Congress were saying: We want to hear from the President. Come \nto us. Tell us what you know. Tell us what you want. Let us have a \ndebate. Let us have a vote. He did so, and he continues to work with us \nto this very moment.\n  Some people said: Oh, well, you have to take your case to the United \nNations. Let the United Nations be a part of this. Encourage the United \nNations--in fact, demand the United Nations--live up to its \nresponsibility and its own resolutions.\n  The President did that. He went to the United Nations and gave one of \nthe most impressive speeches I believe he has ever given. He gave the \nbill of particulars to the world community about what the problems are \nand why we had to deal with this menace. I think it changed the United \nNations. And while we still do not have a resolution from the United \nNations, I know Secretary Powell is working on that.\n  I know the President and others are talking to the world community. I \nhave had the occasion, as the Republican leader of the Senate, to talk \nto representatives from seven countries over the past 2 weeks and get a \nfeel for what they are thinking and what their concerns are, what \ntheir suggestions are.\n\n  So this President is working with us, with the United Nations, and \nwith the world community.\n  As the Republican leader, I have entertained views from all sides of \nour own caucus. When we got the first draft of the Iraq resolution, \nevery word was not accepted as being perfect or brilliant. There were \nsome suggestions made, and I listened to them. In fact, I remember \nthere was one phrase in the resolution, when I read it the first time, \nI said: What does that really mean? I don't think I really like that.\n  So we did have input. We did have the first draft sent by the \nPresident, but the President invited our input and our participation in \nthe development of this resolution, and changes were made. We had the \nfirst resolution, the second resolution, the third resolution, and now \nthe bipartisan resolution that was introduced in the Senate by Senator \nLieberman, Senator Warner, Senator McCain, and Senator Bayh. It is the \nresolution we should consider. Will there be another alternative? \nPerhaps. I have no problem with that. Will there perhaps be an \namendment that is agreed to in advance? Perhaps. I have no problem with \nthat. I do think we are going to have a problem if we just allow this \nto be endlessly amended. It would be a filibuster by amendment.\n  I think we need to have a full debate but be prepared to go to votes \non these important issues by the middle of next week. Senator Daschle, \nperhaps, will give his own thinking about the specifics of when we \nmight begin to get to some votes.\n  I have listened to opinions on the other side of the aisle, too. I \ndid not just talk to Senator Shelby or Senator Lugar or Senator McCain \nor Senator Warner or Senator Hutchinson. I talked to Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, and so did the administration. Because of this, I \nthink we have been able, with the help of the White House and the \ncombined House leadership, to emerge with a strong resolution we now \npresent to the Congress and to the world.\n  For those who brought us to this moment--the President, the Speaker, \nCongressman Gephardt, Senators Lieberman, Warner, McCain, Bayh, \nDaschle, and others--who are involved in this process, I think the \nNation should be grateful. I believe the result of this debate, and the \nresolution we will vote on next week, will lead to a safer world.\n  Let me make it clear from the outset, no one--not the President, not \nany Member of Congress--desires to see our men and women engaged in a \nfight in Iraq or anywhere unless it is absolutely necessary.\n  Our history shows that Americans do not seek war; we always are slow \nto anger. But we got plenty mad last year because of the horror we saw \nhere at home. We now realize the danger is not just over there, as they \nsaid in World War I and World War II. Oh, no, it is here. One suicide \nbomber, with a weapon of mass destruction, is a threat to thousands, \nperhaps millions.\n  We are the only Nation in history, though, after having been involved \nin a war, a conflict, that has turned around and offered a helping hand \nto all the peoples of the world, including our enemies. We helped in \nJapan. We helped in Germany. We have done it over and over again.\n  There is no greater force for good than the United States of America. \nWhen our security and our people are threatened, we act swiftly and \ndecisively. But what we want for everybody is opportunity and freedom \nand democracy--or to choose what they want if they don't want \ndemocracy; make that choice.\n\n  We want to be safe and secure here at home. That is what this is all \nabout. We are good people, with attributes from our forefathers I am \nvery proud of. But we are very serious about protecting our people at \nthis critical time.\n  I will save the catalog of Saddam Hussein's crimes for another time, \nprobably about the middle of next week. But today we begin the process \nof ensuring this violent and cruel man can no longer menace us, his \nneighbors,\n\n[[Page S9893]]\n\nand his own people. It is up to us today to send a message to the \nworld, and to America's friends--particularly the Prime Minister of \nGreat Britain, who has shown great strength--that we do appreciate what \nthey have done, and we thank them for their support and courage, and we \nare committed to stand with them to eliminate the threat this rogue \nregime poses to peace in the world.\n  Let there be no mistake either; the elimination of the Iraqi threat \nis essential if we are to win the war on terror. We know Saddam \nHussein's ongoing relationship with the dark forces of international \nterrorism. Some people say: Show us a smoking gun. Well, there is a lot \nof smoke out there. We do know of a lot of things that are ongoing, and \nwe will get into some greater discussion of that next week.\n  We know other evil regimes are looking to see if he, Saddam Hussein, \ncan once again bluff his way out of trouble, thereby emboldening others \nto seek more deadly means to threaten the United States and the \ncivilized world.\n  This has huge meaning. If we now go through the process of huffing \nand puffing and saying we are going to take action, and there are going \nto be inspections, and there is going to be the destruction of these \nweapons, and if not, we are prepared to do whatever is necessary, \nincluding using force, and we do not do it, the ramifications will be \nendlessly negative.\n  The President, answering his critics who decry so-called American \nunilateralism, has put the case before the world. For 11 years, Saddam \nHussein has flaunted the will of the United Nations. He has amassed \nstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. He has gassed his own \npeople. He has shown blatant contempt for the rule of law and the \nUnited Nations.\n  If the United Nations is to be a force for peace, it must show it \nstands ready to meet this ongoing threat in the international \ncommunity. If it does not, it will be consigned to the ash heap of \nhistory, as the League of Nations was before it--a grand idea unable to \ncope or confront evil dictators bent on the destruction of world peace.\n  I said at the outset this vote is the ``end of the beginning.'' The \nSenate will rise to the occasion, as it has throughout its eventful \nhistory. As we engage in this momentous debate, let us ensure by its \nconclusion we will have set in motion ``the beginning of the end'' of \nSaddam Hussein and all for which he stands.\n  Now, I see Senator Daschle is in the Chamber. I thank him for his \neffort in this regard. We do not always agree. We have a lot of \nconversations people don't even know about to try to come to a fair \nagreement on how to proceed. We talk about process, and we still have a \nway to go. But here, in a few minutes, we will officially begin this \ndebate, an important debate. Every Senator will have his or her chance \nto have their say.\n  I believe Senator Daschle has in mind a process most Senators will \nfeel is fair--I hope all Senators. At the end of the day, in a \nreasonable period of time, we will get to a vote. But as we started, I \nthought it was important we express our appreciation for what has been \ndone, and our reassurance to the American people and our colleagues we \nare going to ensure it be done in a respectful way, regardless of \npositions, but that it produces a result which is going to be good for \nAmerica.\n  Madam President, may I inquire, is it anticipated this would be the \nlast vote of the day but that we would continue in session as long as \nany Senator wishes to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Responding to the distinguished Republican leader, the \nanswer to that is, yes, this will be the final vote of the day. There \nwill be no votes tomorrow, but we will be in session.\n  It is my hope and expectation that Senators will avail themselves of \nthe opportunity to come to the floor to not necessarily debate the \nresolution but to express themselves on the resolutions. The Senate \nwill be available for that purpose today, tomorrow, Monday, and we will \nhave more to say with regard to the specific schedule, perhaps as early \nas tomorrow. This will be the final vote today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I did not have the opportunity to hear \nall of the distinguished Republican leader's remarks, but I have a \npretty good understanding of the tone of his statement and agree very \nmuch with what I did hear of his remarks.\n  Let me say I would pick up where he left off. I want very much for \nthis debate to be respectful, to recognize our solemn obligation as \nSenators to debate, and our role in providing advice and consent on \nissues of this import. That will be what we set out to do over the \ncourse of the next several days.\n  In consultation with the Republican leader, I also had hoped we could \nhave a prompt debate. That is also part of our motivation in bringing \nthe resolution to the floor in the form of a cloture motion this \nafternoon.\n  There will be differences of opinion expressed, but there is no \ndifference of opinion with regard to our ultimate goal. Our goal is to \naddress the very understandable and serious concern shared not only by \nthe administration but the American people that we have to address the \nthreat that exists today in Iraq, the threat that it poses to us in a \nnumber of ways but especially with regard to weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  It is my hope that debate can begin in earnest today, that people can \ncome to the floor to express themselves, to indicate their support and \ntheir proposals for ways in which we might address this issue through \nresolutions that will be offered over the course of the next several \ndays.\n  I am confident that as we begin this debate, we will debate with \nevery expectation that in spite of what differences exist, the \nsimilarities will be far greater than the differences; that ultimately \nwe can come to some resolution that will bring about perhaps a broad \nbipartisan coalition in support of a resolution that authorizes this \nadministration and our country to move forward.\n\n  There is a growing appreciation of the role of the United Nations. \nThere is a growing appreciation of the role of the international \ncommunity. There is a recognition that the extent to which we work in \nand through the international community, as we did in 1991, we will do \nit again successfully today.\n  I come to the floor with an expectation that there will be an \nopportunity at some point for Senator Levin to introduce his \nresolution. We will have a debate and a vote on that resolution \nsometime next week. We would then lay down--perhaps simultaneously--the \nresolution that has been the subject of negotiations and discussions \nnow with the administration over the course of the last couple of \nweeks. Agreement was reached with some members of leadership over the \ncourse of the last day or so. That certainly will be one of the primary \nvehicles we will address as we consider debate on this issue in the \ncoming days.\n  I might suggest that it be used as the primary vehicle, although we \nhave not entertained a unanimous consent request in that regard.\n  It is also my expectation that Senators Biden and Lugar may have an \namendment that they wish to offer that would go to some of the concerns \nthey have with regard to the need for further clarity of that \nresolution. That may be the amendment that would be offered to the \nadministration resolution at some point next week.\n  In the meantime, Senators are encouraged to come to the floor to \nexpress themselves in general or to express themselves with regard to \nany one of those specific resolutions or amendments to the resolution.\n  I would hope that at some point we could reach an agreement that we \nwould have those three votes--a vote on the Levin resolution, a vote on \nthe Biden-Lugar amendment to the administration resolution, and then \nultimately a vote on the administration resolution itself.\n  As I said today, I am not prepared to propound it because we have not \nhad enough opportunity to consult with colleagues on either side of the \naisle. I have had many consultations with the distinguished Republican \nleader. It will be our intent to suggest that to our caucuses with the \nhope that we can put that framework in place as we debate this very \nimportant matter in the days ahead.\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\n  I encourage Senators to come to the floor today, tomorrow, Monday, \nand all next week as we hope to complete our work. My expectation is \nthat we would complete our work on this resolution, on this set of \nissues relating to this resolution, sometime by midweek next week.\n  I know we are scheduled to have a vote at 4:15. That time has \narrived.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9894-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AGAINST IRAQ--\n                           MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

To clarify, this \nwould set aside the homeland security bill? This would set aside the \nIraqi resolution?\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. The appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education passed the subcommittee unanimously, and passed \nthe committee unanimously. We are now in a new fiscal year. Our schools \nout there need this help. Every day that we don't pass it means they \nare getting less money for special education, less money for teacher \ntraining, less money for title I to help, as a result of the bill we \npassed just a year ago, to leave no child behind. So I have asked \nunanimous consent that the leader turn to the consideration of S. 2766, \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I, again, say I am sorry that we hear an \nobjection from the other side. We are not doing much around here. Every \nday we sort of hang around and have a couple of cloture votes and that \nis about it. We could bring up this education bill.\n  As I said, it passed unanimously. That means both Republicans and \nDemocrats supported this bill. It has money in it for Pell grants. We \nhave a lot of middle-class kids going to college who are counting on \nthese Pell grants. This bill had a $100 increase to help these middle-\nclass kids go to college. Yet we are being denied the opportunity to \nget that $100 increase per year for the Pell grant.\n  We just passed a leave-no-child-behind bill last year. I ask Senators \nto go and talk to the principals in the schools. Where are the \nresources to back them up? Without the resources, a lot of children are \ngoing to be left behind.\n  So this bill has resources in it for title I--as I said, about $700 \nmillion. That is going to be denied to our public schools because the \nother side objected.\n  Special education--almost $1 billion is tied up because the other \nside objects to going to our appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S9895]]\n\n  I am sorry that the Republican whip has objected to bringing up this \nbill. But every day that we are here, I intend to ask unanimous consent \nto bring up the education funding bill.\n  This is our ticket out of the recession. It is our ticket to a better \nfuture. It is a ticket to a stronger America. We can't back off of our \nsupport for education.\n  I am sorry that we have gotten this objection on the Republican side. \nBut, as I said, every day that we are here I will try to bring it up to \nget our education funding bill through.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate is not working. The Senator \nfrom Iowa is correct. The Senate is almost being dysfunctional when it \ncomes to appropriations bills and the budget process. We haven't passed \na budget. I could ask unanimous consent to bring up the budget.\n  This is the first time since 1974 that the Senate has not passed a \nbudget. The Senate has not passed any appropriations bills and sent \nthem to the President. I can't remember any time that at the beginning \nof the fiscal year we haven't sent one appropriations bill to the \nPresident. I fault the Senate because we haven't passed a budget. \nTherefore, we haven't worked out an agreement with the House on the \ntotal amount of money we are going to spend. The House has passed some \nappropriations bills because they have a budget, and we don't have a \nbudget. So the Senate passes bills that are much higher than the House. \nThey don't want to go to conference when the two numbers are not the \nsame. Usually, if you have a budget, both the House and the Senate will \nat least be working with the same figures and it is much easier to \nreconcile and actually have a bill that would pass.\n  Also, I might mention that the President has already said he would \nveto a bill that would be in excess of what the House passed. We would \nbe wasting our time in that respect.\n  I would love to take up more appropriations bills, but we haven't \nfinished the appropriations bill that is pending before the Senate. \nSince we came back on, I believe, September 3, the day after Labor Day, \nthe majority leader said we would do a dual track. We would take up the \nInterior appropriations bill in the morning and then we would take up \nthe Department of Homeland Security in the afternoon. We would double \ntrack those. We didn't object. It took unanimous consent to do that. \nOne would have thought we would have rapidly finished both bills. \nUnfortunately, we haven't finished one in the entire month of September \nwhen we usually do a lot of appropriations bills. We have not done one \nappropriations bill.\n  The Department of the Interior appropriations bill is still pending \nbefore the Senate. It is not up to the individual chairman of the \nsubcommittee to advance this bill on the floor. It is up to the \nmajority leader to move to consideration of the appropriations bill, \nand the majority leader did not do so--I would guess because we still \nhad other items on the floor. The Department of the Interior \nappropriations bill should have taken 2 days. We have been on it for 4 \nweeks.\n  We have been stuck on an issue dealing with fire management. The \nState of South Dakota has an exemption. They have fire management that \nthe majority leader was able to pass earlier to deal with cleaning up \ntheir forests so they do not have such a volatile fire situation in \ntheir forests. Many Senators wanted to do the same thing for their \nStates. They have offered amendments to do so, and they have yet to get \na vote on their amendments. I have stated repeatedly that they are \nentitled to a vote. That is on the Department of the Interior \nappropriations bill. Hopefully, we can vote on those amendments and \nfinish the bill. We should be able to do that in no time. It should not \ntake too long.\n  People should be able to offer amendments. If people don't like the \namendment, they can object. It doesn't take too long to finish \nappropriations bills if the managers and the leaders are willing to \nvote to table the amendments and find out where the votes are. If you \nwin, you win. If you lose, you lose. We are willing to do that.\n\n  We haven't finished the Department of the Interior appropriations \nbill, nor the homeland defense bill.\n  People say, let us add another bill to the equation. I disagree. We \njust voted on a cloture motion. We have had several cloture votes. I \nhappen to disagree. Every time we turn around we are voting on cloture. \nI disagree with that.\n  I think we are trivializing the rules of the Senate. Cloture should \nbe used to break a filibuster. There was no filibuster on the \nDepartment of Justice authorization bill. We had a cloture vote.\n  Some of us were hoping we could get some agreement on when we would \nhave more votes on judges. We are disappointed in the fact that we have \na lot of judges who were nominated a long time ago and who have yet to \nget a vote, and in many cases even a hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I spoke to that yesterday. I don't need to repeat it. But \nseveral outstanding nominees have not been voted on and in some cases \nhave not even had a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. That \nbothers me because we are going to finish this Congress and these \npeople have been waiting in some cases 1\\1/2\\ years and they are not \ngoing to get a vote.\n  John Roberts comes to mind. He was nominated on May 9. He has argued \n35 cases before the Supreme Court and he didn't even get a hearing this \nyear. He is eminently qualified. He is a former assistant solicitor \ngeneral and he didn't even get a hearing this year.\n  I have been pushing and I hope maybe we will be successful in getting \na vote on Michael McConnell this year. At least the committee has had a \nhearing on him. He is from Utah. He is from Senator Hatch's State. He \nwas nominated by President Bush and is supported by Senator Hatch. The \ntradition of the Senate is that surely the ranking minority member of \nthe Judiciary Committee is entitled to get a vote on his judge.\n  I have asked for the Judiciary Committee--and I hope it is not too \nlate--to put Michael McConnell on the docket to be voted on next week. \nI hope they will. I understand he is not on it yet. I am going to \nencourage our colleagues to include him, as well as Dennis Shedd and \nothers.\n  There is a lot of work to be done. Now we have a whole succession of \npeople coming in asking to take up their bills. The majority leader has \nthe right to move to whatever item is on the floor of the Senate. That \nis his prerogative. That is the prerogative of the majority leader, and \nI support maintaining that tradition. Obviously, we have others who are \nsaying: Wait a minute. I want to take up my bill.\n  Labor-HHS has not passed because we haven't passed a budget. Other \nbills haven't passed because the Senate didn't pass a budget. \nUnfortunately, the majority leader never called the budget up to put it \non the floor for a vote. It may well have been because he didn't have \nthe votes.\n  But I know when Senator Domenici was chairman of the Budget Committee \nhe had a difficult time. And every once in a while we went to the floor \nand fought lots of battles. We won some and we lost some. But we ended \nup with a budget resolution that we were able to work out with the \nHouse. We would pass a budget resolution, and it would be identical \nfigures, total spending figures, between the House and the Senate. That \nenabled us to move forward on the appropriations bills. We did not get \nit done this year, so we have not passed appropriations bills.\n\n  I would also like to say I heard: Well, all these education accounts, \nthey are being cut, cut, cut. That is not actually correct. I believe \nthe correct statement would be: We are continuing appropriations. We \njust passed a continuing resolution for funding until next week, and \nthat continues at last year's level--not an increase, not a decrease.\n  So I just mention that. I think people should understand we may be on \na continuing resolution, unfortunately--because we have not done our \nwork, because we have not passed a budget, because we have not passed \nappropriations bills--we may be on a continuing resolution for months, \nbut that will not be a cut for anybody. It is basically going to be a \ncontinuation of funding levels at last month's, last year's level. I \nsay that just for people's information,\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\nso they will not be saying: Well, this group is being cut or this group \nis being hurt, and so on. There may be some groups for which there \nwould be pluses or minuses as to what they would have received compared \nto last year, but basically a continuing resolution says: Continue at \nlast year's level. So I want to make sure that is noted as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9896-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I think we can have a good \ndebate.\n  We can pass a positive resolution that will reaffirm the United \nStates in saying we believe the resolutions we supported and passed in \nthe United Nations should be enforced. This body and the United Nations \nhave passed several resolutions telling Iraq they must comply, and then \nnot enforcing them, and we have done it year after year.\n  In 1998, we passed a resolution unanimously saying we should enforce \nthe existing resolutions requiring Iraq to disarm. Unfortunately, that \nresolution was good on paper, but it was not enforced.\n  Now we have an administration that says they are willing to enforce \nit. I believe this Congress will stand behind President Bush in saying: \nYes, we will give you the authorization to enforce it.\n  These resolutions mean something. We don't think it is acceptable to \nhave a person with Saddam Hussein's known history of using weapons of \nmass destruction against his own people, and also invading his \nneighbors, and lobbing missiles against Israel and Saudi Arabia--it is \nnot acceptable for him to be developing further these weapons of mass \ndestruction. That is against the United Nations resolutions.\n  We are saying these resolutions mean something. Let's enforce them. \nWe said that unanimously in 1998. It is going to be interesting to see \nif people want to weaken what we passed in 1998.\n  I hope our colleagues read President Clinton's statement he made in \n1998 to the Pentagon that talked about the need for strong enforcement. \nThat is not the same speech President Clinton made yesterday in London, \nunfortunately. And I am very disappointed in President Clinton's \nspeech.\n  Former Presidents usually have a tradition to not undermine current \nadministrations in foreign policy, certainly in foreign lands, and that \nis not what President Clinton did. President Clinton, in London, I \nthink, made a speech that very much undermines the current \nadministration, including the administration in London, in trying to \ndevelop an international coalition to stand up to Iraq and Saddam \nHussein.\n  I mention that. I don't really like being critical of anyone or any \nadministration, but for the former administration, which did not \nenforce the existing U.N. resolutions during their tenure, during their \n8 years in office, did not pursue terrorists, including terrorists that \nwere al-Qaida, who were directly responsible for blowing up two U.S. \nEmbassies in Africa in 1998, and the USS Cole in the year 2000--when \nthey did not go after the terrorists aggressively after those two \nterrorist attacks, did not enforce the U.N. resolutions, then to have \nPresident Clinton being critical of President Bush in Great Britain I \nthink is very demeaning to the office, and I am very regretful a former \nPresident would make such a statement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night, the Senate confirmed its 79th \nand 80th judicial nominees, and its 65th and 66th nominees to the \nFederal district courts since the change in Senate majority and \nreorganization of the Judiciary Committee less than 15 months ago. In \nso doing, we have confirmed more judicial nominees than were confirmed \nin the first 15 months of any of the past three Presidents, and more \nnominees than were confirmed in the last 30 months that a Republican \nmajority controlled the Senate. We have done more in half the time. We \nhave achieved what we said we would by treating President Bush's \nnominees more fairly and more expeditiously than President Clinton's \nnominees were treated.\n  Since the summer of 2001, we have held more hearings for more \njudicial nominees and more hearings for circuit court nominees than in \nany 15-month period of the six and one-half years in which Republicans \nlast controlled the Committee. With our hearing last week, the \nDemocratic-led Judiciary Committee has not held 25 hearings for 96 \ndistrict and circuit court nominees. This is approximately double the \npace at which the Republican majority considered President Clinton's \nnominees. The Judiciary Committee has likewise voted on more judicial \nnominees, 83, and on more circuit court nominees, 17, than in any \ncomparable 15-month period of prior Republican control. In fact, \nDemocrats have given votes to more judicial nominees and, in \nparticular, to nominees to the Courts of Appeals, than in 1996 and 1997 \ncombined, and than in 1999 and 2000 combined.\n  Last night, the Senate voted on the nomination of Ronald Clark to the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. I was \ntroubled by a number of aspects of Mr. Clark's background. Since 1997, \nMr. Clark has been a Representative in the Texas State Legislature. His \nrecord as a State legislator is controversial, as he has taken \npositions that would, among other things, limit civil rights, consumer \nrights and women's reproductive rights. But he has never served as a \njudge, and he assured us that, as a judge, he would follow precedent \nand apply the law as written, without partisanship. I am hopeful that \nMr. Clark will be a person of his word: that he will follow the law and \nnot seek out opportunities to decide cases in accord with his private \nbeliefs rather than his obligations as a judge.\n  The confirmation of Mr. Clark last night made the 28th nominee that \nwe have confirmed to fill a judicial emergency vacancy since the change \nin Senate majority last year, and the 21st judicial emergency vacancy \nthat we have filled this year. Despite Republican claims about a crisis \nin the courts, this Administration has failed to nominate people to ten \nseats that have been declared judicial emergencies, seven vacancies on \nthe Courts of Appeals and three vacancies on the District Courts.\n  I would note that President Bush has nominated nine people to fill \ndistrict court vacancies in Texas, and with yesterday's vote, we have \nalready considered seven of them and confirmed six of them. Mr. Clark's \nconfirmation made the 13th Texas nominee that we have confirmed and the \nsecond nominee that we confirmed to the District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict. With his confirmation, there are no longer any vacancies on \nthe district Court for the Eastern District of Texas. With our \nconfirmations earlier this year of Randy Crane and Andrew Hanen to the \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas, we filled the \nremaining vacancies in that court as well. We have provided much needed \nhelp to the courts in Texas, which are facing large caseloads and some \nof the highest number of filings of criminal cases in the country.\n\n  Under Republican control of the Senate, three Texas judicial nominees \nnever received hearings or votes. The Republican-led Senate failed to \nprovide any hearings on nominees to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit, which includes Texas, in the six years of their majority \nduring the Clinton Administration. Moreover, they delayed action\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\nor gave no hearings to a number of district court nominees.\n  It was not long ago when the Senate was under Republican control that \nit took 943 days to confirm Judge Hilda Tagle to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas. She as first \nnominated in August 1995, but not confirmed until march 1998. When the \nfinal vote came, she was confirmed by unanimous consent and without a \nsingle negative vote, after having been stalled for almost three years. \nI recall the nomination of Michael Schattman to a vacancy on the \nNorthern District of Texas. He never got a hearing and was never acted \nupon, while his nomination languished for over two years. These are \ndistrict court nominations that could have helped respond to increased \nfilings in the trial courts if acted upon by the Senate over the last \nseveral years.\n  Yesterday's confirmation of Mr. Clark serves as another example of \nthe Democrats' proven record of action and fairness on this President's \njudicial nominees. Even though Mr. Clark is a conservative Republican, \nas the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I voted to report him out \nof Committee and I voted to confirm him yesterday, based on his \ntestimony before the Committee and his written word. Far from payback \nfor Republican actions in the recent past, the Democratic-led Senate \ncontinues to take action notwithstanding those wrongs and to help solve \na vacancy crisis created solely by the Republican obstruction and \ndefeat of more than 50 of President Clinton's nominees.\n  Despite the right-wing and partisan din about blockades and \nobstructionism, Democrats are actually achieving almost twice as much \nas our Republican counterparts did to staff the Federal courts. But let \nme be clear. We would be even farther along if so many circuit court \nand district court nominees of the prior administration had not been \npurposely blocked and defeated, and if we received more timely reviews \nfrom the ABA, even a little cooperation from this unilateralist \nAdministration and received the nominations of more moderate, \nmainstream judicial nominees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9897-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9897-S9898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE JAMES GARDNER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with last night's votes on two district \ncourt nominees, including Judge James Gardner to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Senate has \nconfirmed its 79th and 80th new judges since the change in majority \nlast summer. In less than 15 months, we have confirmed more judges than \nthe Republican majority confirmed in its final 30 months in the \nmajority. We have been more than twice as productive as they were and \nRepublicans are nonetheless complaining that we have not worked three \nor four times as fast as they did to fill vacancies that their inaction \nperpetuated. Similarly, in less than 15 months of Democratic control of \nthe Judiciary Committee, we have confirmed more judicial nominees than \nRepublicans did in the first 2 full years they controlled the Senate in \n1995 and 1996, combined, and we have confirmed more judges than \nRepublicans allowed to be confirmed in 1999 and 2000 combined. We have \nbeen more fair and more expeditious regarding judicial nominations than \nRepublicans were during their prior 6\\1/2\\ years of control of the \nSenate.\n  Last night's vote is another example. The Senate has acted quickly on \nthis nomination to the District Court in Pennsylvania. Judge Gardner \nwas nominated at the end of April, received an ABA peer review in July, \nparticipated in a hearing in August, was reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in September, and was confirmed last night. The \nJudiciary Committee has held hearings for 11 district court nominees \nfrom Pennsylvania and the Senate has now confirmed all 11 of them in \njust 6 months.\n  In addition, a Third Circuit nominee, Judge Brooks Smith of \nPennsylvania, was also confirmed, although not without controversy \nbased on his record. With the confirmation of 12 judges from \nPennsylvania, there is no State that has had more Federal judicial \nnominees confirmed by this Senate than Pennsylvania. The Senate \nJudiciary committee and the Senate as a whole have done well by \nPennsylvania. This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in \nPennsylvania were left unfilled during Republican control of the \nSenate, particularly regarding nominees in the western half of the \nState.\n  Despite the best efforts and diligence of the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure confirmation of all of the \njudicial nominees from every part of his home State, there were seven \nnominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies were never \ngiven a hearing or a vote.\n  A good example of the contrast between the way the Democrats and \nRepublicans have treated judicial nominees is the case of Judge Legrome \nDavis, a well qualified and uncontroversial judicial nominee. He was \nfirst nominated to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President \nClinton on July 30, 1998. The Republican-controlled Senate took no \naction on his nomination and it was returned to the President at the \nend of 1998. On January 26, 1999, President Clinton renominated Judge \nDavis for the same vacancy. The Senate again failed to hold a hearing \nfor Judge Davis and his nomination was returned after 2 more years.\n  Under Republican leadership, Judge Davis' nomination languished \nbefore the Committee for 868 days without a hearing. Unfortunately, \nJudge Davis was subjected to the kind of inappropriate partisan rancor \nthat befell so many other nominees to the district courts in \nPennsylvania during the Republican control of the Senate. This year, \nthe Democratic-led Senate moved expeditiously to consider Judge Davis, \nand he was confirmed in just 84 days. The saga of Judge Davis recalls \nfor us so many nominees from the period of January 1995 through July \n10, 2001, who never received a hearing or a vote and who were the \nsubject of secret, anonymous holds by Republicans for reasons that were \nnever explained.\n  In contrast, the hearing we had earlier this year for Judge Conti was \nthe very first hearing on a nominee to the Western District of \nPennsylvania since 1994, despite President Clinton's qualified \nnominees. It is shocking to me that this was the first hearing on a \nnominee to that court in 8 full years. No nominee to the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania received a hearing during the entire period \nthat Republicans controlled the Senate in the Clinton administration. \nIn fact, one of the many nominees to the Western District, Lynette \nNorton, waited for almost 1,000 days, and she was never given the \ncourtesy of a hearing or a vote. Unfortunately, Ms. Norton died earlier \nthis year, having never fulfilled her dream of serving on the Federal \nbench. With the confirmation of Judge Conti earlier this year, we \nconfirmed the first nominee to the Western District of Pennsylvania \nsince October 1994.\n  Despite this history of poor treatment of President Clinton's \nnominees, the Democratic-led Senate continues to move forward fairly \nand expeditiously. Democrats have reformed the process for considering \njudicial nominees. For example, we have ended the practice of \nsecretive, anonymous holds that plagued the period of Republican \ncontrol, when any Republican Senator could hold any nominee from his or \nher home State, his or her own circuit or any part of the country for \nany reason, or no reason, without any accountability. We have returned \nto the Democratic tradition of regularly holding hearings, every few \nweeks, rather than going for months without a single hearing. In fact, \nwe have held 25 judicial nominations hearings in the past 15 months, \nand we plan to hold our 26th judicial nomination hearing this coming \nMonday. We have held a confirmation hearing for judicial nominees every \nmonth since the Judiciary Committee was reorganized in July 2001, \nincluding two hearings during the August recess in 2001. In contrast, \nduring the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control, there were 30 months in \nwhich Republicans held no hearings on judicial nominees.\n  By already holding 25 hearings for 96 of this President's judicial \nnominees in just 15 months, we have held hearings for more circuit and \ndistrict court nominees than in 20 of the last 22 years during the \nReagan, first Bush, and Clinton administrations.\n  While some complain that a handful of circuit court nominees have not \nyet\n\n[[Page S9898]]\n\nhad hearings, they fail to acknowledge that Democrats have held \nhearings for more of President Bush's circuit court nominees, 20, than \nin any of the 6\\1/2\\ years in which the Republicans controlled the \nCommittee before the change in majority last summer. This is more \nnominees than received hearings in either of the first 2 years of the \nClinton administration when the White House and the Senate were \ncontrolled by the same party. The fact that Democrats have treated \nthis Republican President just as fairly as Democrats treated a \nPresident of their own party with regard to hearings for circuit court \nnominees is remarkable. Republicans have utterly failed to acknowledge \nthis fairness. The myth of Democratic obstruction of judicial nominees \nfits the partisan Republican political strategy better than the truth.\n\n  The years of Republican inaction on a number of circuit court \nvacancies has made it possible for Democrats to have several ``firsts'' \nin addressing judicial vacancies. For example, we held the first \nhearing for a nominee to the Sixth Circuit in almost 5 years, that is \nmore than one full presidential term, and confirmed her, even though \nthree of President Clinton's nominees to the Sixth Circuit never \nreceived a hearing or a vote. One of those Clinton nominees waited more \nthan 1,500 days and never received a hearing or a vote, up or down, by \nthe Committee.\n  We held the first hearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years, \nincluding the entire period of Republican control of the Senate, and \nconfirmed her last year, while three of President Clinton's Fifth \nCircuit nominees never received hearings or votes on their nominations. \nWe also held the first hearing on a Tenth Circuit nominee in 6 years, \nand we have confirmed two of President Bush's nominees to the Tenth \nCircuit, while two of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit \nnever received hearings or votes.\n  With last night's confirmation of Judge Gardner, the 12th judicial \nnominee from Pennsylvania to be confirmed in just 15 months, in \naddition to the other 79 judicial nominees confirmed in this short \nperiod, the Democratic-led Senate has had a record-breaking year of \nprogress and fairness in the judicial confirmation process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9898-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 10, \n2000 in Jacksonville, FL. Three white men, all 20 years old, assaulted \na black man. The victim was walking down the street when the three \nallegedly said, ``There's one, let's get him'' before running toward \nhim. The assailants, who sources say met at a white supremacist rally, \nknocked the victim to the ground, then punched and kicked him.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nactions taken by the administration to create a viable international \nregime that stops trade in conflict diamonds, and I encourage the \nadministration to increase their efforts to further expand this regime \nso it attains an effective and comprehensive level of coordination, \ncertification, monitoring, and enforcement.\n  The Kimberley process has its origins in a decision by African \ncountries to end trade in diamonds that fuel regional conflict but \nsustain trade in diamonds that create economic stability. This effort \nhas been supported by a number of countries, non-governmental \norganizations, and the diamond industry. In March 2002, the principals \nconcluded their last full session, and it is now the responsibility of \nthe countries involved in this process to enact implementing \nlegislation.\n  A number of Senators and I are currently engaged in discussions with \nthe administration as to what this legislation would look like and what \nan appropriate vehicle for the legislation would be. I would like the \nlegislation to be more expansive than the administration wants at this \ntime, and I would like the legislation to directly address the problems \nrelated to certification and accountability mentioned in a recent GAO \nreport. But that said, I believe the administration is negotiating in \ngood faith, and that they want the same outcome in the end that I do. \nThus I fully expect that we will find common ground for action in the \nnext few days. I also fully expect that discussions will continue so we \ncan find appropriate remedies on all the outstanding issues.\n  I traveled to Africa in August, and I know from my briefings there \nthat trade in conflict diamonds is a despicable practice that must end. \nIt is incredibly disturbing and sad that one of the most promising \nmeans to attain real economic growth and political stability in certain \nareas of Africa--the natural wealth represented by diamonds and the \ndiamond industry--has instead become a deadly tool by which rebel \nmovements can purchase weapons, maim and massacre civilians, destroy \ncommunities, overthrow governments, and perpetuate uncertainty. Of \nequal significance, there is increasing and incontrovertible evidence \nthat funds from the illicit trade in conflict diamonds are being used \nby Al-Qaeda to finance terrorism. The problem of conflict diamonds must \nbe confronted, it must be confronted now, and it must be confronted in \na way that ends both the brutal violence that is pervasive in Africa \nand the possibility that conflict diamonds may fund terrorist \nactivities in countries around the world.\n  In my view, it is incumbent on the United States to play an active \nand prominent role in creating a framework that ends trade in conflict \ndiamonds. In my view, it is incumbent upon Congress to work with the \nadministration to ensure that this effort occurs. I believe the \nKimberley process should move more rapidly toward its stated goals and \nthe more robust goals outlined by the United Nations. But I also \nunderstand that multilateral action will be essential for this regime \nto work, and that multilateral agreements take time to arrange. I am \nwilling to be patient, but only with the understanding that people are \ndying in Africa at this time and we must help them soon. More delay \nmeans more suffering, and we all have to be cognizant of that as we \ncontemplate solutions.\n  Thus I think it is essential to state on the floor of the Senate \ntoday that I stand solidly behind the ongoing effort to end trade in \nconflict diamonds, and I encourage the administration to continue its \neffort to create a strong international regime that will engender \npolitical stability and economic growth in Africa. I am ready to work \nintensively with my colleagues and the administration to this end.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9898-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9898-S9899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF 4-H\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of 4-H in America. For 100 years in our great Nation, and \nsince 1911 in New Mexico, 4-H has molded generations of involved \ncitizens and leaders, providing an enduring contribution to the \ndevelopment of America's youth.\n  This organization, rooted in hands on learning, grew from the \ninterest of seven boys from Don a Ana County in each planting a pound \nof seed corn they acquired from the New Mexico College of Agriculture \nand Mechanic Arts, now New Mexico State University. This 1911 \nexperiment was the first of a growing number of activities of this kind \nin rural communities around the territory that led to the establishment \nof precursor 4-H clubs in schools, led by teachers. Local merchants, \nbankers and farmers began the organization's long history of community \nsupport by donating prize money, goods and expertise to the young \npeoples' activities. The 1912 State fair saw the first ever competition \nbetween 4-H club members, who earned premiums for prize-winning corn, \nkafir corn, milo, peanuts, bread and sewing.\n  Today, New Mexico 4-H boasts more than 50,000 members, part of the \n6.4\n\n[[Page S9899]]\n\nmillion youth involved globally in what is the world's largest youth \norganization. Though 4-H maintains its rural and agricultural roots, \nits leadership development activities have shown even broader influence \nas the organization has adapted to changing times. I am proud of the \nunique and remarkable way New Mexico's 4-H clubs teach responsibility, \ndecision-making, communication skills and citizenship, all key \ningredients to purposeful lives and strong communities. Through hands-\non experience, 4-Hers learn what it takes to follow a project through \nto completion, keep records, and make presentations to others about \ntheir work. Whether it is baking, showing or judging livestock at the \nfair, sewing or public speaking, club members are challenged to set and \nachieve goals, find creative solutions to problems, overcome obstacles \nalong the way, and demonstrate their progress to others.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the parents and \ncommunity leaders of 4-H. Those who donate time, expertise and \nassistance to 4-H are often alumni who appreciate the lessons they \nlearned in their clubs, and this has created the legacy of involvement \nthat makes the organization so strong after 100 years. The mentorship \nand wealth of experience these leaders provide produce the tangible \nresults we see in exhibits at the fair and community projects. However, \nthey also sow the seeds of confident leadership and citizenship that \nmay not reach full bloom until later in a member's life. I am also \nextremely proud to continue supporting 4-H's Share/Care afterschool \nprogram and the Rio Arriba County Clover Club, which have proven \ninvaluable in giving young people the chance to get involved in fun, \neducational activities instead of drugs.\n  The long, proud record of 4-H in New Mexico, the United States, and \naround the world is testimony to the enduring viability of this \norganization and its central values, firmly rooted in our hard-working \nrural and agricultural communities. I would like to take this \nopportunity to reaffirm the valuable contribution of 4-H's ``head, \nheart, health and hands,'' to New Mexico's youth and the very fabric of \nour society. It is a great pleasure to celebrate the national \ncentennial of 4-H, and I congratulate this organization on beginning \nanother century of ``making the best better.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9899-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE ELDER JUSTICE ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, earlier this week I was proud to \nrepresent the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus in a press conference to \nannounce the results of the 2001 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, \nand Wildlife Associated Recreation. This report confirms something that \nmany of us have believed for some time, that hunting and fishing are an \nintegral part of the fabric of this Nation and an essential part of our \neconomy.\n  I was joined in this announcement by Secretary of the Interior Gale \nNorton; Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Steve Williams; \nMelinda Gable with the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation; Brent \nManning with the International Association of Fish and Wildlife \nAgencies; Mike Nussman with the American Sportfishing Association; and \nDoug Painter with National Shooting Sports Foundation.\n  Hunting and fishing are an important part of people's lives in my \nhome State of Arkansas and all around the country. It is an activity \nthat brings friends and families together and the impressive statistics \nthat the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is releasing today are hard for \nthose of us in Congress to ignore. As an avid sportswoman myself, I \nunderstand first-hand the importance that should be placed on promoting \nand preserving our ability to hunt, fish, and pursue outdoor \nactivities. In fact, one of my fondest memories is of sitting with my \nfather, brother, and sisters in a duck blind as the sun rose over the \nArkansas Delta. And now, I get the joy of taking my boys outdoors to go \nfishing and hunting.\n  I first joined the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus because of my \nlifelong love of the outdoors and my commitment that as sportsmen, we \nhave a duty to protect and provide for sustainable uses of America's \nrenewable wildlife resources. And now as the cochair of the \nCongressional Sportsmen's Caucus, I, along with my colleagues, am \nworking to enact legislation to provide ample resources to conserve \nwildlife and America's rich tradition of outdoor recreation.\n  Wildlife and our Nation's lands and waters are the foundation for our \noutdoor recreation as well as the ecosystems in which we survive. A \nperfect example of this is Arkansas' RICE, Rice Industry Caring for the \nEnvironment, project, where farmers voluntarily set aside 171,000 acres \nof farmland to provide for waterfowl habitat which in turn provides \nenormous environmental benefits.\n  The survey shows that last year over 1.4 million Arkansans and 38 \nmillion Americans went hunting, fishing, or wildlife watching. And that \ntranslated into over $1 billion to Arkansas' economy and a whopping \n$108 billion impact on this Nation's economy. It also shows that over \n20,000 Arkansans and well over 1 million nationally are employed \ndirectly in hunting and fishing related businesses.\n  Those numbers show that hunting and fishing are not just worthwhile \npastimes, they're big business, too.\n  On top of that, in 2001 Arkansas' sportsmen paid over $112 million in \nState and federal taxes. And nationwide, sportsmen paid in over $11.4 \nbillion. That's $11.4 billion going to fund many of our most pressing \nnational priorities such as our national defense, education, highway \nconstruction, and conservation programs.\n  We must continue to recognize the American sportsman's impact on this \nnation's economy and protect our outdoor legacy for future generations. \nAnd I look forward to continued work with\n\n[[Page S9900]]\n\nmy colleagues in the Senate to promote and preserve our ability to \nhunt, fish, and pursue outdoor activities.\n  I encourage each of my colleagues to take note of this survey's \nresults and the direct impact of sportsmen and sportswomen on his or \nher State's economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9900-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATIONS TO HUNT DOWNER\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Hunt \nDowner of Houma, LA, for his Senate confirmation to the rank of \nBrigadier General in the Army National Guard. I have known General \nDowner for years, and I know he will make an excellent member of the \ngeneral officer corps. Moreover, he will serve with great competence, \nskill, and leadership in the Louisiana Army National Guard.\n  General Hunt Downer epitomizes the Citizen Soldier and has dedicated \nhis life to public service. Not only has Hunt had a long and successful \ncareer in the Louisiana National Guard, but Hunt has served in the \nLouisiana House of Representatives since 1975. During that time, he has \nalways been an advocate for his constituents and the entire State of \nLouisiana. I served with Hunt in the House of Representatives, where I \ngained great respect for him. Moreover, he was respected by his peers \nbecause they chose him to serve as the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives. Despite the pressures on his time stemming from his \ncommitments to the Louisiana National Guard and his duties as an \nelected official, Hunt also runs a successful legal practice in Houma, \nLA.\n  Most importantly, Hunt Downer has a wonderful family. I know they \nmust be proud of Hunt. So today, I also want to congratulate Hunt's \nwife, Linda Lee, and his children, Mary and Blair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9900-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DEBBIE FOWLER\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

On Tuesday, \nSeptember 24, Debbie made a call to a VA clinic in Arizona trying to \nlocate some hospital records of a gentleman who had just checked into \nDebbie's place of work. Her phone call confirmed that the man who had \njust entered the clinic was wanted for at least 14 sexual assaults in \nArizona, California, Oklahoma, and Nevada.\n  Knowing the type of criminal that was in her midst, Debbie was told \nby U.S. Marshals over the telephone to keep him in the clinic. With \nremarkable poise, Ms. Fowler was able to persuade the man to stay. \nLocal police soon arrived at the clinic and apprehended the man, and \ncommended Debbie for a job well done. Families of the victims have \ncalled Debbie a hero for what she did, and I concur. Although this \nwomen humbly declined that title, I would like to thank Ms. Fowler for \nher efforts and her bravery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9900-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN CELEBRATION OF THE CITY OF MOUNTAIN VIEW'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 100th Anniversary of the city of Mountain View in my home \nState of California.\n  The city of Mountain View began as a stagecoach stop and agricultural \ncenter for the Santa Clara Valley. Like other areas in the Santa Clara \nValley, Mountain View was once filled with bountiful orchards and \nvineyards. When Mountain View was incorporated as a city in 1902, there \nwere fewer than one thousand residents living there; today there are \n72,200. The population grew after World War II alongside the electronic \nand aerospace industries. Today, Mountain View is located in the heart \nof California's Silicon Valley, the technology capital of the world. \nFrom orchard and vineyard country to high tech mecca, Mountain View has \nbeen part of the rich history of California.\n  Mountain View combines innovative development efforts with a \ncommitment to strong and diverse neighborhoods and resident \ninvolvement. In recent years, Mountain View has received three awards \nfor outstanding city planning, including two at the national level. The \nAmerican Planning Association, APA, gave Mountain View the \n``Outstanding Planning Award for Implementation'' in honor of the \ncity's Integrated Transit Oriented Development. Mountain View received \na wonderful honor when these transit projects were selected to be part \nof a special exhibit at the Winter Olympics. The exhibit highlighted \nstate-of-the-art architecture, urban design and transportation projects \nfrom cities throughout the world. And California's Local Government \nCommission awarded Mountain View the 2001-2002 Ahwahnee Award \nCertificate of Merit for Integrated Transit Oriented Development that \n``reflects the continued evolution toward more livable and sustainable \ncommunities.''\n  I am delighted that Mountain View has been recognized around the \nnation as an outstanding place to live. While the city receives \nnational attention, it also has been recognized around the San \nFrancisco Bay Area for a wide array of neighborhood parks, the \nShoreline at Mountain View regional park created from reclaimed \nlandfill, a civic center that includes the Mountain View Center for the \nPerforming Arts, a state-of-the-art library and the Shoreline \nAmphitheatre. Mountain View's community pride is also evident by the \nlocally organized neighborhood associations that exist to address \nresident needs. This local pride is one of the things that makes this \ncity such a California treasure.\n  I am thrilled that the city of Mountain View, its local government \nand its residents maintain such a strong community spirit while its \nhigh-tech companies provide new products to change the way we live. The \ncity's mission statement, to ``provide quality services and facilities \nthat meet the needs of a caring and diverse community in a financially \nresponsible manner,'' could not be more appropriate. I hope the people \nof Mountain View enjoy this community-wide centennial celebration, and \nI wish them another 100 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9900-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9900-S9901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to establish a commission to assess the performance \nof the civil works functions of the Secretary of the Army; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing, with my \ncolleagues Senator Johnson, legislation to investigate and hopefully \nchange the culture of disregard for environmental values that infects \nthe Corps of Engineers' management of America's great rivers. My own \nexperiences in South Dakota and my discussions with many of my\n\n[[Page S9903]]\n\nconstituents and others around the Nation have led me to conclude that \nprotecting the future health of our Nation's waterways demands that \nCongress consider relieving the Corps of its current river management \nresponsibilities.\n  For the last decade, I have watched as the Corps has steadfastly \nrefused to change its management of the Missouri River to reflect the \nenvironmental and economic needs of the 21st century. The agency's \nrefusal to change the management of the river will further jeopardize \nendangered species, drive river-dependent businesses into bankruptcy, \nand lead to further erosion of Native American burial and cultural \nsites along its banks. As a Senator from South Dakota and as a citizen \nof that State who enjoys hunting and fishing along the Missouri, I \nshare the sense of betrayal that so many upstream residents feel \nwatching the Corps' management slowly degrade this once thriving river.\n  Last spring, just when sport fish were spawning and the State was \nfacing its worst drought in decades, the Corps began to drain the \nreservoirs to provide water for navigation downstream. This prompted \nlawsuits by South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana to force the Corps \nto bring common-sense management to the river. Since then, boat ramps \nhave become unusable, while some river-based businesses have lost tens \nof thousands of dollars.\n  There is no legitimate reason for further delay in reforming \nmanagement of the Missouri River. For more than a decade, the Corps has \nspent millions of dollars revising its operating plan for water flows \non the Missouri River, the Master Manual. An overwhelming amount of \nscientific and technical data all point to the same conclusions: the \nmanagement of the river should more closely mimic the natural flow \nregime. Flows should be higher in the spring, and lower in the summer, \njust as they nature. Yet in June, the Corps indefinitely delayed the \nrelease of the new Master Manual due to pressure from the White House.\n  The mismanagement of the Missouri River is illustrative of a larger \nproblem. For example, a study of proposed upper-Mississippi lock \nexpansion has to be retooled after the Corps whistle blower showed that \nthe study was rigged to provide an economic justification for that \nbillion-dollar project. A broad pattern of disregard by the Corps for \nenvironmental priorities throughout the nation's waterways is now \nevident. In addition, the corps has been shown time and again its \nunwillingness to work effectively with members of the public, States, \ntribes, or stakeholders to resolve ongoing challenges.\n  Indeed, more than ever, the Corps appears mired in the past, \nincapable of assimilating new scienfic and economic information into \nits management scheme, and, consequently, failing the people and \nwildlife that depend on the sound stewardship of Ameria's rivers. The \ntime has come to ask tough questions about the institutional barriers \nwithin the Corps, and the influence of special interests, that prevent \nit from effectively meeting the Nation's river management needs. The \ntime has come to ask whether those responsibilities are better left to \nothers. This ongoing situation presents a compelling case for a \nthorough, independent review of the agency's operations and management, \nand for serious reform. Indeed, many of my Senate colleagues have \nintroduced legislation to accomplish certain reforms, and I, along with \nothers have made it clear that we will fight any effort to pass \nadditional authorizations unless they are accompanied by serious, \nmeaningful Corps reform.\n\n  Our Nation needs a river management program that is environmentally \nand economically sound. History does not offer much room for confidence \nthat the Army Corps of Engineers can meet this standard under its \ncurrent management structure. The management of the Missouri River, the \nMississippi River, and other major waterways presents a compelling case \nfor a thorough, independent review of the agency's operations and \nmanagement, and for serious reform.\n  I am introducing legislation today to establish an independent Corps \nof Engineers River Stewardship Investigation and Review Commission. The \ncommission will take a hard and systematic look at the agency's \nstewardship of our Nation's rivers and make recommendations to Congress \non needed reforms. It will examine a number of issues, including Corps \ncompliance with environmental and Indian cultural resource protection \nlaws; the quality and objectivity of the agency's scientific and \neconomic analysis, the Corps' cooperation with Federal agencies, \nStates, and tribes; whether congress needs to amend river planning laws \nand regulations; and, ultimately, whether the Corps' river management \nresponsibilities should be transferred to a federal civilian agency.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this legislation.\n  It is my hope that all those who care about the mission of preserving \nour Nation's waterways will support this effort to identify and \nimplement whatever reforms are necessary to fulfill that mission. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3036\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nimprove protection of treatment works from terrorists and other harmful \nintentional acts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Wastewater \nTreatment Works Security Safety Act. This legislation provides for the \nsafety and security of our Nation's wastewater treatment works by \nproviding needed funds to conduct vulnerability assessments and \nimplement security improvements. In addition, this bill will ensure \nlong-term safety and security by providing funds for researching \ninnovative technologies and enhancing proven vulnerability assessment \ntools already in use.\n  Since the terrible events of September 11, we have taken several \ncomprehensive steps to protect our water supplies and infrastructure. \nAlmost a year ago, I spoke on the many initiatives taking place in the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works and at the Environmental \nProtection Agency. I am pleased to say that we have made some progress.\n  EPA worked with State and local governments to expeditiously provide \nguidance on the protection of drinking water facilities from terrorist \nattacks. Based on the recommendations of Presidential Decision \nDirective 63, issued by President Clinton in 1998, the Environmental \nProtection Agency and its industry partner, the Association of \nMetropolitan Water Agencies, established a communications system, a \nwater infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, designed \nto provide real-time threat assessment data to water utilities \nthroughout the nation.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Smith and I worked to include the \nauthorization of $160 million for vulnerability assessments at drinking \nwater facilities as part of the Bioterrorism bill. Despite our advocacy \nduring the conference, we were unable to include a provision in that \nbill for wastewater facilities due to jurisdictional issues in the \nHouse.\n  While these initial efforts are essential, our task is by no means \nfinished. We cannot forget the vital importance of protecting our \nNation's wastewater facilities. Everyday we take for granted the \nhundreds of thousands of miles of pipes buried under ground and the \nthousands of wastewater treatment works that keep our water clean and \nsafe. But, like all our Nation's critical infrastructure, the \ndisruption or destruction of these structures could have a devastating \nimpact on public safety and health.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will take us one step further \nby authorizing support of ongoing efforts to develop and implement \nvulnerability assessments and emergency response plans at wastewater \nfacilities.\n  Using existing tools such as the Sandi Laboratory's vulnerability \nassessment tool or the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage \nAssociation's Vulnerability Self-Assessment Tool, treatment works will \nbe able to securely identify critical areas of need. With the funds \nprovided by this bill, EPA will also ensure that treatment\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\nworks remedy areas of concerns. Using the results of the vulnerability \nassessment, treatment works will develop or revise emergency response \nplans to minimize damage if an attack were to occur.\n  This bill authorizes $185 million for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 \nfor grants to conduct the vulnerability assessments and implement basic \nsecurity enhancements. The bill also recognizes the need to address \nimmediate and urgent security needs with a special $20 million \nauthorization over 2003 and 2004.\n  In my home State of Vermont, we have only three towns of over 25,000 \npeople. The small water facilities serving these communities have been \nparticularly challenged to meet today's new homeland security \nchallenges. Many times, water managers operate the town's water \nfacilities as a part-time job or even as a free service. We must ensure \nthat they are afforded the same consideration under this act as the \nmedium and large facilities. This bill authorizes $15 million for \ngrants to help small communities conduct vulnerability assessments, \ndevelop emergency response plans, and address potential threats to the \ntreatment works. It also instructs the Administrator of the EPA to \nprovide guidance to these communities on how to effectively use these \nsecurity tools.\n  To ensure the continued development of wastewater security \ntechnologies, the Wastewater Treatment Works Security and Safety Act \nauthorizes $15 million for research for 2003 and 2007. It also provides \n$500,000 to refine vulnerability self-assessment tools already in \nexistence.\n  I am proud to say that the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage \nAgencies has endorsed the Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act. AMSA \nrepresents our nation's wastewater treatment works serving large \ncities. They have been an invaluable partner in the drafting of this \nbill, and I thank them sincerely for their support. I ask unanimous \nconsent that their letter of support be entered into the Record.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation and \nother efforts to enhance the security of our Nation's water \ninfrastructure in the weeks, months, and years to come. We truly have \nsomething to protect--clean, safe, fresh water is worth our investment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Association of Metropolitan\n\n\n                                            Sewerage Agencies,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2002.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: The Association of Metropolitan \n     Sewerage Agencies (AMSA) thanks you for the timely \n     introduction of the Wastewater Treatment Works Security and \n     Safety Act. This legislation marks a critical step toward \n     ensuring the safe, uninterrupted operation of the nation's \n     vital wastewater infrastructure. AMSA will be working \n     throughout the closing days of the 107th Congress to secure \n     the passage of this important legislation.\n       Of critical importance to AMSA member utilities is the $200 \n     million this bill provides to assess vulnerabilities and \n     enhance security at the nation's more than 16,000 public \n     wastewater treatment works. AMSA also believes that the \n     bill's $2.5 million to develop and distribute vulnerability \n     assessment software upgrades will play a key role in ongoing \n     security improvements. AMSA, in coordination with EPA, has \n     developed a vulnerability self assessment tool \n     (VSATTM) for wastewater utilities in the wake of \n     the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. To this end, the \n     $2.5 million provides much-needed support to continue and \n     improve this important initiative.\n       The Wastewater Treatment Works Security and Safety Act \n     comes at a pivotal juncture for communities struggling to \n     secure their critical wastewater infrastructure while \n     tackling shrinking municipal budgets. AMSA applauds your \n     commitment to addressing municipal security needs for making \n     your staff accessible throughout the drafting of this \n     important legislation. AMSA looks forward to working with \n     you, your staff and other members of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives to ensure the passage of this legislation \n     before Congress adjourns this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Ken Kirk,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire):\n  S. 3038. A bill to amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to further \nthe conservation of certain wildlife species; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President I rise today with Senator Smith of New \nHampshire to introduce the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, a firm \ncommitment to protect public safety and the welfare of wild cats that \nare increasingly being kept as pets.\n  Current figures estimate that there are more than 5,000 tigers in \ncaptivity in the United States. In fact, there are more tigers in \ncaptivity in the United States than there are in native habitats \nthroughout the range in Asia. While some tigers are kept in zoos, most \nof these animals are kept as pets, living in cages behind someone's \nhouse, in a State that does not restrict private ownership of dangerous \nanimals. Tigers are not the only animals sought as exotic pets. Today \nthere are more than 1,000 web sites that specialize in the trade of \nlions, cougars, and leopards to promote them as domestic pets.\n  Untrained owners are simply not capable of meeting the needs of these \nanimals. Local veterinarians, animal shelters, and local governments \nare ill equipped to meet the challenge of providing for their proper \ncare. If they are to be kept in captivity, these animals must be cared \nfor by trained professionals who can meet their behavioral, \nnutritional, and physical needs.\n  People who live near these animals are also in real danger. These \ncats are large and powerful animals, capable of injuring or killing \ninnocent people. There are countless stories of many unfortunate and \nunnecessary incidents where dangerous exotic cats have endangered \npublic safety. last year in Lexington, TX, a three-year-old boy was \nkilled by his stepfather's pet tiger. In Loxahatchee, FL, this past \nFebruary, a 58 year-old woman was bitten on the head by a 750 pound \nSiberian-Bengal Tiger being kept as a pet. Just last month in Quitman, \nAR, four 600 to 800 pound tigers escaped from a ``private safari.'' \nParents living nearby sat in their own front yards with high-powered \nrifles scared that the wild lions might hurt their children playing the \nfront yard.\n  The bill I introduce today would amend the Lacey Act Amendments of \n1981 and bar the interstate and foreign commerce of carnivorous wild \ncats, including lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, and cougars. The \nlegislation would not ban all private ownership of these prohibited \nspecies. It would outlaw the commerce of these animals for use as pets.\n  This is a balanced approach that preserves the rights of those \nentities already regulated by the Department of Agriculture under the \nAnimal Welfare Act such as circuses, zoos, and research facilities. \nThis Act specifically targets unregulated and untrained individuals who \nare maintaining these wild cats as exotic pets.\n  This bill also preserves the importance of local regulations already \nin existence. I sincerely hope that grass roots level organizing \ncontinues to direct State and local governments to increase the number \nof States and counties that ban private ownership of exotic cats. Full \nbans are already in place in 12 States and partial bans have been \nenacted in 7 States.\n  No one should be endangered by those who cannot properly keep these \nanimals. Those exotic cats who are in captivity should be able to live \nhumanely and healthfully.\n  The Captive Wildlife Safety Act represents an emerging consensus on \nthe need for comprehensive federal legislation to regulate what animals \ncan be kept as pets. The United States Department of agriculture \nstates, ``Large wild and exotic cats such as lions, tigers, cougars, \nand leopards are dangerous animals . . . Because of these animals' \npotential to kill or severely injure both people and other animals, an \nuntrained person should not keep them as pets. Doing so poses serious \nrisks to family, friends, neighbors, and the general public. Even an \nanimal that can be friendly and lovable can be very dangerous.''\n  The American Veterinary Medical Association also ``strongly opposes \nthe keeping of wild carnivore species of animals as pets and believes \nthat all commercial traffic of these animals for such purpose should be \nprohibited.''\n  The Captive Wildlife Safety Act is supported by the Association of \nZoos\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\nand Aquariums, the Humane Society of the United States, the Fund for \nAnimals, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare.\n  I ask my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and look forward to \nworking with our partners in the House who have expressed interest in \npassing this bill into law by the end of this session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 3039. A bill to designate certain conduct by sports agents \nrelating to the signing of contracts with student athletes as unfair \nand deceptive acts or practices to be regulated by the Federal Trade \nCommission; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about a \nbill I am introducing today, the Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust \nAct. The purpose of the bill is simple: to set some basic, uniform \nnationwide rules to prevent unscrupulous behavior by sports agents who \ncourt student athletes.\n  Too often, unscrupulous sports agents prey upon young student \nathletes who are inexperienced, naive, or simply don't know all of the \ncollegiate athletic eligibility rules. The agent sees the student \nathlete as a potentially lucrative future client, and wants to get the \nbiggest headstart possible on other agents. So the agent tries to \ncontact and sign up the student athlete as early as possible, and does \nwhatever it takes to get the inside track.\n  In some cases, the agent may attempt to lure the student athlete with \ngrand promises. In some cases, the agent may offer flashy gifts. To \nmake the offer more enticing, the agent may withhold crucial \ninformation about the impact on the student's eligibility to compete in \ncollege sports.\n  A majority of States have enacted statutes to address unprincipled \nbehavior by sports agents, but the standards vary from State to State \nand some States don't have any at all. The University of Oregon tells \nme that this creates a significant loophole. Specifically, Oregon has a \nState law, but it doesn't apply when a University of Oregon athlete \ngoes home to another State for the summer and is contacted by an agent \nthere. Every time that athlete crosses into another State, a different \nset of rules apply. And if one State's laws on the subject are \nparticularly weak, that is where shady sports agents will try to \ncontact their targets.\n  That is why there ought to be a single, nationwide standard. The bill \nI am introducing today would establish a uniform baseline, enforceable \nby the Federal Trade Commission, that would supplement but not replace \nexisting State laws. Specifically, the bill would make it an unfair and \ndeceptive trade practice for a sports agent to entice a student athlete \nwith false or misleading information or promises or with gifts to the \nstudent athlete or the athlete's friends or family. It would require a \nsports agent to provide the student athlete with a clear, standardized \nwarning, in writing, that signing an agency contract could jeopardize \nthe athlete's eligibility to participate in college sports. It would \nmake it unlawful to pre-date or post-date agency contracts, and require \nboth the agent and student athlete to promptly inform the athlete's \nuniversity if they do enter into a contract.\n  Representative Bart Gordon of Tennessee has spearheaded this \nlegislation in the House, where the House Commerce Committee has held \nhearings and, most recently, unanimously approved the bill on September \n25. I applaud Congressman Gordon for his leadership on this issue, and \nI urge my Senate colleagues to join me in addressing this matter in the \nSenate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3039\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sports Agent Responsibility \n     and Trust Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act, the following definitions apply:\n       (1) Agency contract.--The term ``agency contract'' means an \n     oral or written agreement in which a student athlete \n     authorizes a person to negotiate or solicit on behalf of the \n     student athlete a professional sports contract or an \n     endorsement contract.\n       (2) Athlete agent.--The term ``athlete agent'' means an \n     individual who enters into an agency contract with a student \n     athlete, or directly or indirectly recruits or solicits a \n     student athlete to enter into an agency contract, and does \n     not include a spouse, parent, sibling, grandparent, or \n     guardian of such student athlete, or an individual acting \n     solely on behalf of a professional sports team or \n     professional sports organization.\n       (3) Athletic director.--The term ``athletic director'' \n     means an individual responsible for administering the \n     athletic program of an educational institution or, in the \n     case that such program is administered separately, the \n     athletic program for male students or the athletic program \n     for female students, as appropriate.\n       (4) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal \n     Trade Commission.\n       (5) Endorsement contract.--The term ``endorsement \n     contract'' means an agreement under which a student athlete \n     is employed or receives consideration for the use by the \n     other party of that individual's person, name, image, or \n     likeness in the promotion of any product, service, or event.\n       (6) Intercollegiate sport.--The term ``intercollegiate \n     sport'' means a sport played at the collegiate level for \n     which eligibility requirements for participation by a student \n     athlete are established by a national association for the \n     promotion or regulation of college athletics.\n       (7) Professional sports contract.--The term ``professional \n     sports contract'' means an agreement under which an \n     individual is employed, or agrees to render services, as a \n     player on a professional sports team, with a professional \n     sports organization, or as a professional athlete.\n       (8) State.--The term ``State'' includes a State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the \n     United States Virgin Islands, or any territory or insular \n     possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\n       (9) Student athlete.--The term ``student athlete'' means an \n     individual who engages in, is eligible to engage in, or may \n     be eligible in the future to engage in, any intercollegiate \n     sport.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that States should enact the \n     Uniform Athlete Agents Act of 2000 drafted by the National \n     Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, to protect \n     student athletes and the integrity of amateur sports from \n     unscrupulous sports agents. In particular, it is the sense of \n     the Congress that States should enact the provisions relating \n     to the registration of sports agents, the required form of \n     contract, the right of the student athletic to cancel an \n     agency contract, the disclosure requirements relating to \n     record maintenance, reporting, renewal, notice, warning, and \n     security, and the provisions for reciprocity among the \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 3041. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto conduct a study and submit a report to Congress on new technology \npayments under the Medicare prospective payment system for hospital \noutpatient department services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, since Utah is the home of many medical \ndevice and pharmaceutical companies, I have taken a special interest in \nlegislation affecting the development of cutting-edge technologies and \nthe ability of patients to have access to these innovative products. \nThree years ago, I authored legislation to ensure that Medicare \npatients have prompt and appropriate access to the abundant benefits of \nmedical breakthrough products. Prior to the enactment of that law, \nthese innovative technologies were not being properly reimbursed by the \nMedicare program or, in some cases, were not even being reimbursed by \nMedicare at all. As a result, patient care suffered.\n  And, while the 1999 law was a giant step in the right direction, many \nproblems continue to exist regarding the methodology that Medicare has \nused in developing its hospital outpatient reimbursement payments for \nthese new devices and medicines.\n  I have been working throughout the year with all parties who have a \nstake in improving the hospital outpatient prospective payment system \nmethodology for new medical devices, drugs, biologicals, and other \ntechnologies. I have listened to the arguments from both the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, and the industry and recognize \nthat there are problems with this methodology from all perspectives.\n  And while, in my opinion, a legislative solution would be ideal, so \nfar, we have been unable to draft legislation that would be acceptable \nto both CMS and industry representatives. Therefore, I now believe that \nauthorizing a comprehensive study through the Department of Health and \nHuman Services is the appropriate next step toward defining the flaws \nwithin the current system and developing consensus on how to address \nthem. For this reason, I now advocate that CMS undertake such a study, \nand also provide recommendations to Congress on how to improve Medicare \nreimbursement for these products.\n  This matter is a serious one which needs to be reviewed and analyzed \nby HHS so that a more equitable reimbursement system may be created. We \nall agree that Medicare beneficiaries deserve access to most innovative \nmedical technologies. In my opinion, this HHS study will help us \naccomplish two very important goals, fair and equitable Medicare \nreimbursement for innovative technology and therapies and, most \nimportant, beneficiary access to these cutting-edge products.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 3043. A bill to provide for an extension of the social health \nmaintenance organization (SHMO) demonstration project; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Social Health Maintenance Organization \nDemonstration Project is due to expire in the next year. I have been a \nstrong supporter of extending the SHMO demonstration project, because \nthese plans help keep seniors independent and out of nursing homes. \nSHMOs provide beneficiaries with expanded Medicare benefits, including \nprescription drugs, care coordination and community-based services. \nWhile many of us are working toward making this a permanent program, it \nhas now become clear that we will not be able to accomplish this goal \nthis year because of budget constraints. Therefore, I offer as the next \nbest solution extending the SHMO demonstration project for five more \nyears. This way, SHMOs will continue to operate, and, those \nbeneficiaries who receive their Medicare coverage through SHMOs will \ncontinue to receive important services and benefits.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n\n[[Page S9908]]\n\n  S. 3044. A bill to authorize the Court Services and Offender \nSupervision Agency of the District of Columbia to provide for the \ninterstate supervision of offenders on parole, probation, and \nsupervised release; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleague from \nOhio, Senator George Voinovich, to introduce the Court Services and \nOffender Supervision Agency Interstate Supervision Act of 2002, to \nenhance the authority of the Court Services and Offender Supervision \nAgency for the District of Columbia.\n  The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, CSOSA, was \nestablished by Congress as part of the District of Columbia \nRevitalization Act of 1997. CSOSA combines under one helm the \npreviously disparate local functions of pretrial services, parole, \nadult probation, and post-conviction offender supervision. Following \nthree years of operation as a trusteeship, CSOSA was certified as an \nindependent Federal agency within the executive branch on August 4, \n2000.\n  CSOSA, with 950 employees, an annual budget of $132 million, and \nresponsibility for monitoring 21,000 pretrial release defendants \nannually, 8,000 at any one time, and 15,338 post-conviction offenders \non probation or parole, is directed by Paul A. Quander, Jr., who was \nconfirmed by the Senate on July 25, 2002.\n  The legislation we introduce today aims to clarify CSOSA's authority \nto provide for supervision of offenders from other jurisdictions who \nchose to live in the District of Columbia and to arrange with other \nStates for supervision of District of Columbia probationers who seek \nresidence in other jurisdictions, including authority to enter into a \nnew Interstate Compact.\n  Among the functions CSOSA absorbed after it was established were the \nsupervision of probationers and parolees from other jurisdictions once \ntheir transfer to the District of Columbia was approved. Although not \nexplicitly stated in the law, CSOSA also performs the related function \nof arranging for the supervision of District of Columbia Code offenders \non probation and parole who seek to move from the District of Columbia \nto reside in other States. Our legislation would add that specific duty \nto CSOSA's statutory responsibilities.\n  The movement of adult parolees and probationers across State lines is \ncurrently controlled by an interstate compact dating back to 1937, \nwhich has all 50 States and territories as signatories. A new \nagreement, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, has \nbeen drafted to improve accountability, coordination, and enforcement \nmechanisms among the participating states. As of June 19, 35 States had \nsigned on to the new compact. The District has not done so, primarily \nbecause the City itself no longer performs the functions since Congress \ncreated CSOSA to do so.\n  Our legislation would provide CSOSA with clear authority to enter \ninto this new compact or any other agreements for interstate \nsupervision with any States which may not become signatories to the new \ncompact. Because a new Compact Commission is now being formed and \nscheduled to meet in November to begin developing the procedural rules \nfor the new Compact, our legislation will enable CSOSA to actively \nparticipate in that process.\n  For this reason, we urge our colleagues to support this bill and vote \nfor enactment this year. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3044\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Court Services and Offender \n     Supervision Agency Interstate Supervision Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INTERSTATE SUPERVISION.\n\n       Section 11233(b)(2) of the National Capital Revitalization \n     and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 (sec. 24-\n     133(b)(2), D.C. Official Code) is amended--\n       (1) by amending subparagraph (G) to read as follows:\n       ``(G) arrange for the supervision of District of Columbia \n     offenders on parole, probation, and supervised release who \n     seek to reside in jurisdictions outside the District of \n     Columbia;'';\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (H) \n     and inserting a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:\n       ``(I) arrange for the supervision of offenders on parole, \n     probation, and supervised release from jurisdictions outside \n     the District of Columbia who seek to reside in the District \n     of Columbia; and\n       ``(J) have the authority to enter into agreements, \n     including the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender \n     Supervision, with any State or group of States in accordance \n     with the Agency's responsibilities under subparagraphs (G) \n     and (I).''.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Richard Durbin, as a co-sponsor of the Court Services \nand Offender Supervision Agency Interstate Supervision Act of 2002. I \nthank my colleague from Illinois for his initiative in advancing this \nlegislation.\n  As my colleague noted, Congress created the Court Services and \nOffender Supervision Agency, CSOSA, as part of the 1997 National \nCapital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act to absorb \nthe responsibilities of three local D.C. agencies. In accordance with \nthat law the Federal Government assumed responsibility for many of the \ncity's judicial functions, including all pre-trial services and the \npost-conviction supervision of parolees and probationers.\n  With the support of the District and CSOSA, our bipartisan \nlegislation seeks to clarify that CSOSA is the entity responsible for \nall offenders, whether on parole, probation, or supervised release, who \nreside in the District of Columbia or those convicted in District Court \nand choose to relocate outside of the District of Columbia.\n  When CSOSA was established, it was expressly charged with the \nresponsibility to arrange for the supervision of District of Columbia \nparoled offenders who wish to move outside the boundaries of \nWashington, D.C. Today, however, a growing number of offenders are \nplaced on probation or supervised release, not parole. Our legislation \nclarifies that CSOSA is the agency responsible for arranging for their \nsupervision.\n  The original legislation also did not address directly the issue of \nsupervision of offenders who relocate to the District of Columbia. \nSince CSOSA absorbed the local agency that previously held this \nresponsibility, it has been acting in that capacity. Again, our \nlegislation clarifies that CSOSA is the entity with this \nresponsibility.\n  Finally, our legislation clearly grants CSOSA the authority to enter \ninto agreements with other states and territories to establish \nguidelines for offender relocation. An interstate compact, signed by \nall the states and territories, has established guidelines for the \nmovement of adult offenders. The compact was created originally in 1937 \nand the states are in the process of revising it to enhance \naccountability for all offenders on parole, probation, or supervised \nrelease. More than half of the states already have signed this revised \nInterstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision. The District of \nColumbia has not signed it, however, primarily because they do not have \nresponsibility for offenders. Our legislation expressly grants CSOSA \nthe authority to do so in their capacity of providing offender \nsupervision.\n  This legislation clarifies CSOSA's mission, a mission critical to the \npublic safety of our nation's capital. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 3046. A bill to provide for the conveyance of Federal land in \nSandpoint, Idaho, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Sandpoint \nLand and Facilities Act of 2002.'' This bill is a unique opportunity to \nmeet the facility needs of the Forest Service in Sandpoint, ID and to \nprovide facilities for the local county government. This bill will \ntransfer ownership of the local General Service Administration building \ncurrently housing the Forest Service to that agency. The bill also \nprovides authority for the Forest Service to work with Bonner County, \nIdaho to exchange the existing building to Bonner County in exchange \nfor a new and more functional building to the Forest Service. This \ntransfer of ownership will not only provide the opportunity for the \nlocal Forest Service office to obtain a facility that best meets\n\n[[Page S9909]]\n\ntheir needs but also will meet the facility needs of Bonner County.\n  The transfer of this facility will allow the Forest Service to \nimprove service to the public, improve public and employee safety, make \nthe Idaho Panhandle National Forest more financially competitive, and \nallow increased spending on resource programs that contribute to \nhealthier ecosystems. In turn, Bonner County will benefit by providing \nto them a building that consolidates county offices so that better \nservices can be provided to the local public, including ADA compliant \naccess to the county courtrooms.\n  Additionally, the GSA will dispose of a building that is only \npartially occupied and is remotely located from other GSA facilities.\n  This is a win-win situation for the Forest Service, Bonner County, \nGSA, and the taxpayers and an outstanding example of the federal \ngovernment at the local level working with the county government to \ncreate common sense solutions that result in more efficient operations \nand better service to the public.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 3047. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to sell or \nexchange all or part of certain parcels of National Forest System land \nin the State of Idaho and use the proceeds derived from the sale or \nexchange for National Forest System purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Idaho \nPanhandle National Forest Improvement Act of 2002. This bill is an \nopportunity to provide lands for local benefits and to meet the \nfacility needs of the Forest Service in the Silver Valley of Idaho. \nThis bill will offer for sale or exchange administrative parcels of \nland in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest that the Forest Service has \nidentified as no longer in the interest of public ownership and that \ndisposing of them will serve the public better. The proceeds from these \nsales will be used to improve or replace the Forest Service's Ranger \nStation in Idaho's Silver Valley.\n  The Forest Service administrative parcels identified for disposal \ninclude the land permitted by the Granite/Reeder Sewer District on \nPriest Lake, Shoshone Camp in Shoshone County, and the North-South Ski \nBowl, south of St. Maries.\n  The bill also directs the Forest Service to improve or construct a \nnew ranger station in the Silver Valley. The current ranger station is \nin dire need of repair or replacement, and this will ensure my \ncommitment to a continued and increased presence of the Forest Service \nin the Silver Valley.\n  This is a win-win situation for the taxpayers, the Forest Service, \nthe residents of the Silver Valley, and the permittees on the parcels \nof land to be disposed of.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Roberts).\n  S. 3048. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to add \nrequirements regarding trauma care, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each year, nearly 1 out of 4 Americans \nsustain an injury requiring medical attention. In 1995, injuries were \nresponsible for 148,000 deaths, 2.6 million hospitalizations, and over \n36 million emergency room visits.\n  The direct and indirect cost of injury is estimated to be about $260 \nbillion a year, and the death rate from unintentional injury is more \nthan 50 percent higher in rural areas than in urban areas. It is \nessential that every American have access to a trauma system that \nprovides definitive care as quickly as possible.\n  In recent years, Congress has worked to address this issue through \nthe Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act, which authorizes \nFederal grants to States for the purpose of planning, implementing, and \ndeveloping statewide trauma care systems. However, this important \nprogram expires this year. Therefore, I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation today, along with Senators Kennedy and Enzi to reauthorize \nthis important program.\n  Among Americans younger than age 44, trauma is the killer. While \ninjury prevention programs have greatly reduced death and disability, \nsevere injuries will continue to occur. Given the events of September \n11, 2001 and our Nation's renewed focus on enhancing disaster \npreparedness, it is critical that the Federal Government increase its \ncommitment to strengthening programs governing trauma care system \nplanning and development.\n  Despite our past investments, one-half of the States in the country \nare still without a statewide trauma care system. Clearly we can do \nbetter. We must respond to the goals put forth by the Institute of \nMedicine in 1999, that Congress ``support a greater national commitment \nto, and support of, trauma care systems at the Federal, State, and \nlocal levels.''\n  Today's bill, the ``Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act \nof 2002'' reauthorizes this program and includes several key \nimprovements: first, it improves the collection and analysis of trauma \npatient data; second, the bill responds to State budget difficulties by \ndecreasing the requirement for State matching funds to the Federal \ngrants; third, the legislation provides a self-evaluation mechanism to \nassist States in assessing and improving their trauma care systems; \nfourth, it authorizes an Institute of Medicine study on the state of \ntrauma care and trauma research; and finally, it doubles the funding \navailable for this program to allow additional States to participate.\n  I appreciate the assistance of Senators Kennedy and Enzi on this \nimportant legislation, and look forward to working to see this bill \npassed this year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to join Senator Frist, \nSenator Johnson, and Senator Murray in introducing the Trauma Care \nSystems Planning and Development Act. Our goal in this bipartisan \nlegislation is to enable all States to develop effective trauma care \nsystems.\n  Trauma is the number one killer of Americans under the age of 44. \nTraumatic injury robs our Nation's youth, devastates families, and \ncosts the Nation more than $260 billion every year. In 1995 alone, \ninjuries were responsible for 148,000 deaths, 2.6 million \nhospitalizations, and over 26 million emergency room visits.\n  Despite trauma's toll, we have done little in recent years to prevent \ntrauma or improve the chance of recovery following traumatic injury. \nPart of the problem is the misunderstanding that trauma is an accident, \nan unfortunate, but sometimes unavoidable chance event. But the facts \nreveal that this is not the case.\n  Trauma is very similar to a disease. It has definable causes with \nestablished methods of treatment and prevention. Frequent forms of \ntrauma include motor vehicle accidents, firearm accidents, and natural \nor man-made disasters. Proven preventative measures could save up to \n25,000 lives every year. Putting effective trauma care systems in place \nwould provide victims with the best chance of recovery, by delivering \nquality care as quickly as possible.\n  A trauma system is an organized, coordinated effort to provide the \nfull range of care to all injured patients. Intervention begins in the \nfield, at the site of injury, and proceeds along the continuum of care \nfrom prehospital to hospital to rehabilitative services. An effective \nsystem ensures that resources, supporting equipment, and personnel are \nready and trained to go into action.\n  The skills and knowledge of health care experts alone are not enough. \nOptimal care is the result of advance planning, preparation, and \ncoordination to produce smooth transitions and the proper sequence of \ninterventions. A comprehensive trauma system accomplishes all this and \nhas been proven to save lives and decrease costs.\n  Much of the progress in developing trauma systems has occurred as a \nresult of Federal funding and involvement. In 1973, Congress passed the \nEmergency Medical Services Act, providing $300 million to States and \ncommunities over an eight year period. Without that funding, patients \nin 304 emergency medical service regions in the United States might not \nhave had ready access to emergency care. Even today, there are areas of \nthe United States without 9-1-1 access and prompt emergency \ntransportation.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the original Trauma Care Systems Planning \nand\n\n[[Page S9910]]\n\nDevelopment Act, authorizing Federal grants to States to develop \nintegrated statewide trauma care systems. Funding for this program has \nbeen inadequate. From 1995 to 2000, States received no funding under \nthe Act. Last year, only $3.5 million was appropriated for the entire \ncountry. As a result, only half of all States have fully functional \nstatewide trauma systems. Clearly, we must do better in providing \nneeded trauma care.\n  This legislation reauthorizes and enhances the trauma care program to \nestablish comprehensive trauma systems in all States. The bill also \naddresses the urgent need for improved trauma data and research. \nSurprisingly, given the burden of trauma on society, only 1 percent of \nresources at the NIH are devoted to trauma research. The legislation \nasks the Institute of Medicine to investigate the quality of trauma \ncare and identify areas for improvement.\n  This legislation is supported by the Coalition for American Trauma \nCare, the American College of Surgeons, and the American Trauma \nSociety. Its enactment is vitally important to public safety, and I \nurge the Senate to approve it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3054. A bill to provide for full voting representation in Congress \nfor the citizens of the District of Columbia, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues \nSenators Russ Feingold, Dick Durbin, Edward Kennedy, Jim Jeffords, and \nCharles Schumer in introducing legislation that would end a terrible \ninjustice suffered by 600,000 American citizens--that is, the denial of \nfull Congressional representation to the citizens of the District of \nColumbia. This injustice is nothing less than a stain on the fabric of \nour democracy. To right this wrong, we are introducing the No Taxation \nWithout Representation Act of 2002 today in order to extend full \nCongressional representation to the citizens of our Capital City.\n  This is the second bill I have introduced to this Congress in order \nto achieve this important goal. It is embarrassing that ours is the \nonly democracy in the world in which citizens of the Capital are not \nrepresented in the national legislature. I can only wonder what \nvisitors from around the world must think when they come to see our \nbeautiful landmarks, our monuments, and our Capitol dome, proud symbols \nof the world's greatest democracy, and then learn that the people who \nlive in this great city have no voice in Congress. What would we do if, \nfor some reason, the residents of Boston, Nashville, Denver, Seattle, \nor El Paso had no voting rights? All those cities are roughly the same \nsize as Washington, D.C., and I know we as a Nation wouldn't let their \ncitizens go voiceless in Congress.\n  Citizens of Washington, D.C. pay income taxes, and yet they have no \nsay in how high those taxes will be or how their tax dollars will be \nspent. Citizens of Washington, D.C. serve their fellow Americans both \nhere at home and in wars abroad, and yet inhabitants of the District of \nColumbia cannot choose representatives to the legislature that governs \nthem. This city's people and institutions have been the direct target \nof terrorists, and yet citizens of the District have no one who can \ncast a vote in Congress on policies to protect their homeland security.\n  The vote is a civic entitlement of every tax-paying citizen of the \nUnited States. It is democracy's most elemental and essential right, \nits most useful tool. The citizens who live in our Nation's capital \ndeserve more than a non-voting delegate in the House. Notwithstanding \nthe strong service of the Honorable Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton \nand her ability to vote in committee, a representative without the \npower to vote on the floor of the House simply isn't good enough.\n  The name of this bill is intended as a reminder of the inextricable \nlink in this Nation's history between the power to tax and the right to \nvote. Our forebearers went to war rather than pay taxes without \nrepresentation. The principles for which our Nation's revolutionary \nheroes fought so hard more than 200 years ago apply just as forcefully \nto the citizens of the District of Columbia today as they did for the \nmen and women who founded this great Nation.\n  Despite its title, ``No Taxation Without Representation,'' this bill \ndoes not relieve the District residents of their tax obligations, given \ntheir non-voting status. The people of D.C. are not looking to avoid \npaying their fair share of taxes. Instead, the bill grants the citizens \nof the District of the Columbia their much-belated birthright: the \nright to vote for and be represented by two Senators and a full Member \nof the House of Representatives. Further the bill increases the \npermanent membership of the House of Representatives by one, a symbolic \nacknowledgment that all along a member was missing: the Representative \ncasting her vote for the people of Washington, D.C.\n  This legislation is no less than our broadly-held American values \ndemand for our fellow citizens. In fact, a recent national poll shows \nthat a majority of Americans believe D.C. residents already have \nCongressional voting rights. When informed that they do not, 80 percent \nsay that D.C. residents should have full representation.\n  In righting this wrong, we won't just be following the will of the \nAmerican people. We will be following the will of history. When the \nframers of the Constitution placed our Capital, which had not yet been \nestablished, under the jurisdiction of the Congress, they placed with \nCongress the responsibility of ensuring that D.C. citizens' rights \nwould be protected in the future, just as Congress protects the rights \nof all citizens throughout the land. For more than 200 years, Congress \nhas failed to meet this obligation. And I, for one, am not prepared to \nmake D.C. citizens wait another 200 years.\n  In the words of this city's namesake, our first President, George \nWashington, ``Precedents are dangerous things; let the reins of \ngovernment then be braced and held with a steady hand, and every \nviolation of the Constitution be reprehended: If defective, let it \namended, but not suffered to be trampled upon whilst it has an \nexistence.''\n  The people of the District of Columbia have suffered this \nConstitutional defect far too long. Let's reprehend it and amend it \ntogether.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the No Taxation Without \nRepresentation Act of 2002 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3054\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``No Taxation Without \n     Representation Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The residents of the District of Columbia are the only \n     Americans who pay Federal income taxes but are denied voting \n     representation in the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate.\n       (2) The residents of the District of Columbia suffer the \n     very injustice against which our Founding Fathers fought, \n     because they do not have voting representation as other \n     taxpaying Americans do and are nevertheless required to pay \n     Federal income taxes unlike the Americans who live in the \n     territories.\n       (3) The principle of one person, one vote requires that \n     residents of the District of Columbia are afforded full \n     voting representation in the House and the Senate.\n       (4) Despite the denial of voting representation, Americans \n     in the Nation's Capital are second among residents of all \n     States in per capita income taxes paid to the Federal \n     Government.\n       (5) Unequal voting representation in our representative \n     democracy is inconsistent with the founding principles of the \n     Nation and the strongly held principles of the American \n     people today.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\n\n       For the purposes of congressional representation, the \n     District of Columbia, constituting the seat of government of \n     the United States, shall be treated as a State, such that its \n     residents shall be entitled to elect and be represented by 2 \n     Senators in the United States Senate, and as many \n     Representatives in the House of Representatives as a \n     similarly populous State would be entitled to under the law.\n\n     SEC. 4. ELECTIONS.\n\n       (a) First Elections.--\n       (1) Proclamation.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Mayor of the District of Columbia \n     shall issue a proclamation for elections to be held to fill \n     the 2 Senate seats and the seat in the House\n\n[[Page S9911]]\n\n     of Representatives to represent the District of Columbia in \n     Congress.\n       (2) Manner of elections.--The proclamation of the Mayor of \n     the District of Columbia required by paragraph (1) shall \n     provide for the holding of a primary election and a general \n     election and at such elections the officers to be elected \n     shall be chosen by a popular vote of the residents of the \n     District of Columbia. The manner in which such elections \n     shall be held and the qualification of voters shall be the \n     same as those for local elections, as prescribed by the \n     District of Columbia.\n       (3) Classification of senators.--In the first election of \n     Senators from the District of Columbia, the 2 senatorial \n     offices shall be separately identified and designated, and no \n     person may be a candidate for both offices. No such \n     identification or designation of either of the 2 senatorial \n     offices shall refer to or be taken to refer to the terms of \n     such offices, or in any way impair the privilege of the \n     Senate to determine the class to which each of the Senators \n     elected shall be assigned.\n       (b) Certification of Election.--The results of an election \n     for the Senators and Representative from the District of \n     Columbia shall be certified by the Mayor of the District of \n     Columbia in the manner required by law and the Senators and \n     Representative shall be entitled to be admitted to seats in \n     Congress and to all the rights and privileges of Senators and \n     Representatives of the States in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 5. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MEMBERSHIP.\n\n       (a) In General.--Upon the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the District of Columbia shall be entitled to 1 \n     Representative until the taking effect of the next \n     reapportionment. Such Representative shall be in addition to \n     the membership of the House of Representatives as now \n     prescribed by law.\n       (b) Increase in Membership of House of Representatives.--\n     Upon the date of enactment of this Act, the permanent \n     membership of the House of Representatives shall increase by \n     1 seat for the purpose of future reapportionment of \n     Representatives.\n       (c) Reapportionment.--Upon reapportionment, the District of \n     Columbia shall be entitled to as many seats in the House of \n     Representatives as a similarly populous State would be \n     entitled to under the law.\n       (d) District of Columbia Delegate.--Until the first \n     Representative from the District of Columbia is seated in the \n     House of Representatives, the Delegate in Congress from the \n     District of Columbia shall continue to discharge the duties \n     of his or her office.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 3056. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to increase \npenalties for individuals who operate motor vehicles while intoxicated \nor under the influence of alcohol; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President today, along with Senator DeWine, I am \nintroducing legislation that addresses the serious national problem of \ndrunk driving. This bill, ``The Higher-Risk Impaired Driver Act,'' \nwould help protect the public from those intoxicated drivers who pose \nthe greatest threat to our safety.\n  This bill would target a specific population of drivers who pose a \nspecial danger on our roads. These are drivers who are convicted of \ndriving while intoxicated within 5 years of a prior conviction; drivers \nwho are convicted of driving while intoxicated with a blood alcohol \ncontent of .15 or greater; drivers who are convicted of driving while \ntheir license is suspended, when the suspension happened due to a \ndriving while intoxicated offense; and drivers who refuse a blood \nalcohol concentration test while under arrest or investigation for \ninvolvement in a fatal or serious injury crash.\n  The statistics documenting the threat posed by these drivers are \nstartling. Nationally in 2001, about 1,461 fatalities that occurred in \ncrashes involving alcohol-impaired or intoxicated drivers who had at \nleast one previous driving while intoxicated conviction, according to \nthe National Institute of Highway Safety, NHTSA. Further, the AAA \nFoundation for Traffic Safety, in an analysis of NHTSA data from 1982 \nto 1999, found that over half the drivers who were arrested or \nconvicted of driving while intoxicated during that period and 64 \npercent of drunken drivers who were fatally injured had a blood alcohol \nlevel of .15 or greater.\n  There are tragic stories behind these statistics: In my own State of \nNew Jersey, for example, Navy Ensign John Elliott was killed by a \ndriver who had a blood alcohol level that exceeded twice the legal \nlimit. In that case, the driver had been arrested and charged with \ndriving while intoxicated just three hours before the crash. After \nbeing processed for that offense, he had been released into the custody \nof a friend who drove him back to his car and allowed him to get behind \nthe wheel.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would require states to enact \na law that penalizes these higher risk offenders, reduces the threat \nthat they pose, and gets offenders into appropriate substance abuse \nprograms. The penalty provisions in such a law would include the \nsuspension of an offender's drivers license for no less than one year \nand the requirement that the offender pay both a $1000 minimum fine as \nwell as restitution to any victims of the offense. The reduction of the \nthreat occurs through the requirement that the offender's motor vehicle \nbe impounded for no less than 90 days and the requirement that the \noffender be imprisoned for a period of time and then shall either wear \nan electronic bracelet or be assigned to a DWI specialty facility. The \ntreatment provision requires the assessment of the offender for \nplacement into a substance abuse program.\n  This legislation follows the recommendations of Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving, MADD, in their Higher-Risk Driver Program. I look forward to \nworking with the members of MADD nationwide to see this legislation \nenacted into law. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3056\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a \nresolution recognizing the teams and players of the Negro Baseball \nLeagues for their contributions to baseball and the Nation.\n  This important resolution also calls on Major League Baseball to \ncompensate the Negro League players who were left out of the League's \n1997 pension plan.\n  For half a century, most of the Negro League players were excluded \nfrom the Majors.\n  Even though Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947, it took \nanother decade for Major League Baseball to really become integrated, \nwhen in July of 1959, the last Major League team fielded an African \nAmerican player.\n  During the intervening years, Baseball systemically discriminated \nagainst most Negro Leaguers.\n  Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig sought to correct some of the \nfailings of the past when he awarded an annual $10,000 pension benefit \nto some of the Negro Leaguers, but he left out those\n\n[[Page S9913]]\n\nwho played solely in the Negro Leagues from 1948 to 1960.\n  Major League Baseball contends they were left out because the sport \nwas integrated during that time. But history shows it took the big \nleagues many years to fully integrate following Jackie Robinson's \nhistoric entry into the Majors.\n  The players, who were excluded, still seeking a small retirement, \nhave been reaching out to Commissioner Selig for five long years now, \nwithout resolution.\n  Meantime, these ex-players are getting old. Many have passed away. \nTime is running out to provide them with a small measure of \ncompensation for their time in the Negro Leagues.\n  I joined them last year in trying to find some resolution to this \ndispute. I hope this concurrent resolution will act as a catalyst to \nspur action by Major League Baseball to correct this injustice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/03/senate-section/article/S9913-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4852.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Armed \nForces Tax Fairness Act of 2002. On September 12, 2002, the Finance \nCommittee favorably reported the bill by unanimous voice vote.\n  This bill will not only correct inequities in the current tax code \nthat our military men and women are subject to, but it will also \nprovide incentives for our dedicated forces to continue their service \nto America.\n  On July 9, 2002, the House passed a bill, HR 5063, that provided \nlimited relief to military personnel. The bill would provide a special \nrule for members of the armed forces in determining the exclusion of \ngain from the sale of a principal residence and would restore the tax-\nexempt status of death gratuity payments to members of the armed \nforces.\n  I support the efforts of the House, but I believe we should go \nfarther.\n  These are the men and women that put their lives on the line for our \nfreedom on a daily basis. We need to ensure that laws that we here in \nCongress pass do not negatively impact them.\n  We should also develop sound policy that serves as an incentive for \nour youth to follow in the steps of the men and women that went before \nthem to defend our country.\n  It is with these principles in mind that I have moved forward with \nthis military tax package and incorporate additional provisions already \nintroduced by my colleagues.\n  I would now like to describe the provisions that we have chosen to \ninclude in this critical piece of legislation:\n  Death Gratuity Payments: On July 24, 2002, Senator Carnahan \nintroduced S. 2783, which would restore the tax exempt status of all \ndeath gratuity payments. This proposal is similar to the provision \nincluded in house version of HR 5063.\n  Why is this provision so important? Under current law, death gratuity \nbenefits are excludable from income only to the extent that they were \nas of September 9, 1986. In 1986, the death gratuity benefit was \n$3,000.\n  In 1991, the benefit was increased to $6,000, but the Tax Code was \nnever adjusted to exclude the additional $3,000 from income. Because of \nthis oversight, the U.S. Government has been taxing families for the \ndeath of a family member who died in combat.\n  This is just wrong.\n  We support the provisions of the House version of H.R. 5063 and S. \n2783, therefore we have included them in this piece of legislation.\n  Exclusion of Gain on The Sale of a Principal Residence: In 1997, \nCongress passed legislation revising the taxation of capital gains on \nthe sale of a person's principal residence.\n  The new rule states that up to $250,000, or $500,000 per couple is \nexcluded on that sale of a principal residence if the individual has \nlived in the house for at least two of the previous 5 years.\n  However, when enacted, Congress failed to provide a special rule for \nmilitary and Foreign Service personnel who are required to move either \nwithin the U.S. or abroad. Senators McCain and Graham both have \nintroduced legislation to address this oversight.\n  I agree that we should adjust the rule for our service men and women. \nWe shouldn't penalize them for choosing to serve our country. Our \nproposal would permit service personnel and members of the Foreign \nService to suspend the 5-year period while away on assignment, meaning \nthose years would count toward neither the 2 years nor the 5 year \nperiods.\n  This is also similar to provisions in the House-version of H.R. 5063.\n  Exclusion of Amounts Received Under Military Housing Assistance \nProgram: The Department of Defense provides payments to members of the \nArmed Services to offset diminution in housing values due to military \nbase realignment or closure.\n  For example, if a house near a base was worth $140,000 prior to the \nbase closure and $100,000 after the base closure, DOD may provide the \nowner with a payment to offset some, but not all, of the $40,000 \ndiminution in value. Under current law, those amounts are taxable as \ncompensation.\n  There will be another round of base closures in the near future. That \nfate was decided in the fiscal year 2002 Defense Authorization bill.\n  We should ensure that those men and women losing value in their homes \ndue to a Federal Government decision are not adversely affected \nfinancially.\n  The proposal would provide that payments for lost value are not \nincludible into income.\n  Recently, Senator Cleland introduced a package that included this \nprovision. I thank him for his unending pursuit to provide military \npersonnel with the best quality of life available. And I am happy we \nhave included this provision in our legislation.\n  Expand Combat Zone Filing Rules To Include Contingency Operations: \nUnder current law, military personnel in a combat zone are afforded an \nextended period for filing tax returns.\n  However, this does not apply to contingency operations. This proposal \nwould extend the same benefits to military personnel assigned to \ncontingency operations.\n  It can't be easy trying to figure out our complicated tax system \nwhile you are overseas and protecting our nation's freedom. Those men \nand women that have been sent to uphold freedom in other countries are \nconfronted with similar circumstances, such as in Operation Just Cause \nin Panama, 1989, or in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia in 1992 and \n1993, or in Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, 1994.\n  Contingency operations are just as demanding as combat zone \ndeployment, although not always in the same manner. For example, in our \ncurrent war on terrorism, this proposal would help members of our \nSpecial Forces in the Philippines supporting Operation Enduring Freedom \nwho are just as focused on accomplishing their critical mission as our \ntroops in the Afghanistan combat zone.\n  I would like to thank Senator Johnson for introducing S. 2785. It is \nimportant that we support all our troops when they are deployed \noverseas.\n  Above-The Line-Deduction For Overnight Travel Expenses of National \nGuard and Reserve Members: Some reservists who travel one weekend per \nmonth and two weeks in the summer for reserve duty incur significant \ntravel and lodging expenses.\n  For the most part, these expenses are not reimbursed. Under current \nlaw, these are deductible as itemized deductions but must exceed 2 \npercent of adjusted gross income.\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\n  For lower income reservists, this deduction does not provide a \nbenefit, because they do not itemize. For higher income reservists, the \n2 percent floor limits the amount of the benefit of the deductions.\n  In my home State of Montana, we have approximately 3500 reservists, \n800 of which travel each month across the State for their training. \nThese 800 reservists pay out of their own pocket the expense for travel \nand hotel rooms.\n  In Montana we rank 48th in the Nation for per capita personal income. \nI know it can't be easy for Montanans to incur approximately $200 in \nexpenses each and every month. Yet, they continue selflessly to provide \ntheir services to our country at their own expense. For those \nreservists that travel out of State for their training, this expense is \nhigher on average.\n  This proposal would provide an above the line deduction for overnight \ntravel costs and would be available for all reservists and members of \nthe National Guard.\n  This issue is currently addressed in S. 540, which Senator DeWine \nintroduced back in March of 2001. I can't tell you just how many people \nhave contacted our office in support of this bill. I support what this \nbill does and I am glad that we can include this provision in our \nmilitary tax package.\n  Expansion of Membership For Veterans' Organizations: Recently, \nSenator Harkin introduced S. 2789, which would expand the membership \nfor Veteran's organizations. Currently, qualified veterans' \norganizations under section 501(c)(19) of the Tax Code are both tax-\nexempt and contributions to the organization are tax-deductible.\n  In order to qualify under 501(c)(19), the organization must meet \nseveral tests, including 75 percent of the members must be current or \nformer military, and substantially all of the other members must be \neither spouses, widows, or widowers of current or former military.\n  The proposal would permit lineal descendants and ancestors to qualify \nfor the ``substantially all'' test.\n  It is important that our veterans' organizations continue the good \nwork that they do. But, as the organizations age, they are in danger of \nlosing their tax-exempt status.\n  I support Senator Harkin's bill, as does the American Legion. We have \nincluded it in our tax package.\n  Clarification of Treatment of Child Care Subsidies: Finally, I want \nto ensure that parents in the military can continue their dedicated \nservice even once they have entered parenthood knowing that their \nchildren are being well taken care of.\n  The military provides extensive childcare benefits to its employees. \nDoD employees at DoD-owned facilities provide childcare services while \nother areas contract out their childcare.\n  When Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, we included a \nprovision stating that qualified military benefits are excluded from \nincome. It is not absolutely clear whether child care provisions are \ncovered under this provision.\n  The proposal would clarify that any childcare benefit provided to \nmilitary personnel would be excludible from income. Senator Landrieu \nhas introduced S.2807, a similar measure. I support this measure and am \nproud we have included it in this piece of legislation.\n  In addition, this bill includes three provisions that raise revenue, \nto offset the revenue loss. First, we improve the collection of unpaid \ntaxes from people who have renounced their American citizenship in \norder to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  Second, we extend certain IRS user fees.\n  Third, we restore the ability of IRS to permit partial-pay \ninstallment agreements with taxpayers. These are modest, sensible \nchanges. In fact, in the case of expatriates, the offset seems \nespecially fitting.\n  All told, this bill does a small part to improve our Tax Code and, \nmore importantly, pay respect to the men and women who are making \nsacrifices and risking their lives to defend us all.\n  I thank all of the Members who have contributed to the development of \nthe bill, including the support by Senators Levin, Warner and Cleland \nof the Armed Services Committee. I especially thank the ranking member \nof the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, who has once again been a \npartner in the development of important bipartisan tax legislation.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we continue to show members of \nthe armed forces our support and solidarity during this time of \nconflict. The War on Terrorism has brought to light the essential role \nthe armed services play in upholding freedom throughout the world.\n  I am happy to see this military tax equity bill passed by the Senate \ntoday, and signed into law by the President before Congress adjourns.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are here today to consider the Armed \nForces Tax Fairness Act which was voted out of the Finance Committee on \nSeptember 12. A similar tax relief package was passed unanimously by \nthe House in July. No one would dispute that many national defense \nchallenges lie ahead for our country. We have spent and will continue \nto spend a good deal of time discussing homeland security and the war \non terrorism as we continue our efforts to secure our borders. Now, we \nmust consider seriously the possibility of military operations in Iraq.\n  For those reasons, it is a particularly appropriate time to focus our \nattention on the important contributions of the men and women of our \nArmed Forces and national guard. These folks are the lifeblood of any \ninitiative against terrorism or movement in Iraq and the first lien of \ndefense in homeland security efforts. We need to make sure that these \nmen and women are treated fairly in all respects and that the Tax Code \ndoes not provide any disincentives to continued service.\n  Our military tax bill would remedy several tax problems and \ninequities faced by members of our uniformed services, National Guard, \nand foreign service. As a starting point, the legislation would make \nsure that military personnel subject to relocation are not \ndisadvantaged in the Tax Code on the sales of their homes. In 1997, we \nenacted a capital gains tax exclusion on the sale of personal \nresidences for individuals who live in the home for at least 2 of the 5 \nyears before the sale. This works well for most people, but the \nprovision offers little help for military personnel who are frequently \ntransferred. We should not punish members of our Armed Forces and \nforeign service who are asked to relocate in the name of service to \ntheir country. Like many of the provisions in this bill, the issue is \none of fairness, and we should provide our military with home ownership \ntax incentives at least as favorable as those available to most \nAmericans.\n  Our military tax relief package also makes some important additions \nto the military tax package sent over by the House. One of those, \nSenator DeWine's proposal for the benefit of Reservists and National \nGuard, is both timely and important. Timely because Reservists continue \nto play an increasingly prominent role in our country's military \noperations. Historically, Reservists were used as manpower replacements \nonly in national emergencies and wars. In fact, between 1945 and 1990, \n85 percent of involuntarily activated Reservists assisted in the Korean \nwar. In the last decade, however, we have involuntarily activated \nReservists six times for a broad array of operations, including (i) \nnation-building operations in Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo, (ii) armed \nconflicts such as those in Iraq, and (iii) current military operations \nfighting terrorism. Iowa alone currently has about 800 Guard and \nReservists on active duty.\n  Important because many Guard and Reservists who travel for weekend \ndrills are required to spend their own money for travel expenses. If \nour military is unable to reimburse these folks for travel expenses \nrelated to training assignments, we should at a minimum allow these men \nand women to fully deduct those expenses on their Federal tax returns. \nAlthough we currently allow miscellaneous itemized deductions for such \nexpenses, a limited number of Reservists itemize on their tax returns. \nOur bill includes a provision offered by Senator DeWine that such \nexpenses be deductible by all reservists in above-the-line form. This \nwould ensure (i) that Reservists are at least partly compensated for \ntraining-related travel expenses paid out of their own pockets, (ii) \nthat all Reservists are treated equally, and (iii) would eliminate a \npotential disincentive to service. Many Iowans have contacted me\n\n[[Page S9922]]\n\nwith respect to this issue, and I ask unanimous consent to print their \ncomments in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Snapshot Report: Incoming Constituent Messages\n\n       Senator Grassley: Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of \n     the Senate Finance Committee, has introduced the ``The \n     Foreign and Armed Services Tax Fairness Act of 2002'' (S \n     2616). The bill is intended to remedy a number of tax \n     inequities that have long plagued military service members. \n     Among the several provisions of the bill is one that is close \n     to the hearts of members of the Guard and Reserve--\n     restoration of the tax deductibility of Reserve component \n     members' non-reimbursable training expenses. The \n     deductibility issue stems from a change to the Internal \n     Revenue Code made in 1986 that required that such \n     unreimbursed business expenses must be treated as itemized \n     deductions and must exceed two percent of adjusted gross \n     income. Since only about 25 percent of all taxpayers itemize \n     their deductions, this change has been the bane of many \n     citizens' existence. This includes citizen-soldiers, sailors, \n     airmen, and Marines who must now, in effect, subsidize their \n     own military training.

I regard the bill as a significant \n     first step in the process of redefining the government's \n     longstanding contract with its Reserve forces. The world and \n     Reservists' terms of service have changed markedly in the \n     half-century since Reserve retirement was passed into law.

Mr. President, finally, our tax fairness bill ensures \nthat military families receive comparable tax treatment for child care \nexpenses. Most American workers are permitted to exclude from income \n$5,000 of employer-provided child care expenses. A separate blanket \nexclusion is provided to the military for all benefits. The provision, \nhowever, does not specify the treatment of military-provided child care \nexpenses and some confusion has resulted. Our bill confirms this \nexclusion from military personnel. This ensures that military-provided \nchild care is not treated less favorably than employer-provided child \ncare or other military-provided benefits.\n  Increased focus on national defense no doubt renews our deep \nappreciation for the members of our military. These men and women make \ntremendous sacrifices, and in some cases, risk their lives to protect \nand defend our freedom. It is a perfect time to ensure that men and \nwomen in service are treated fairly under our country's tax laws. In \nclosing, I would like to thank those who continue to serve in the \nUnited States military and protect the freedoms that we so frequently \ntake for granted. I thank my colleagues and urge them to vote for this \nimportant tax fairness measure.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5063, \nthe Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act. As a cosponsor of the Senate \ncompanion, S. 2816, I believe that this legislation will provide well-\ndeserved tax benefits for those in service to our nation. With the \nongoing war on terrorism, it is critical\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\nthat we do everything in our power to support members of our military, \nand their families.\n  This legislation ensures that the entire benefit of $6,000 paid to \nthe family of those individuals killed on active duty is made tax-free. \nPreviously, only half of this benefit was exempt from taxes. H.R. 5063 \nalso ensures that members of our military can receive the tax treatment \nthey deserve from the sale of their home. Because those in our armed \nforces are required to move frequently, many are unable to take \nadvantage of the aspect of the tax code that allows the exclusion of \ngains from the sale of a person's home from the capital gains tax. This \nlegislation ensures that they will qualify for this benefit.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Personnel Subcommittee on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, my top priority has been to improve the \nquality of life for members of our military and their families. H.R. \n5063 is an important step toward that effort.\n  Mr. REID.

A critical shortage of pharmacists is \n     threatening the ability of pharmacies to continue to provide \n     important prescription related services.\n       [(2) In the landmark report entitled ``To Err is Human: \n     Building a Safer Health System'', the Institute of Medicine \n     reported that medication errors can be partially attributed \n     to factors that are indicative of a shortage of pharmacists \n     (such as too many customers, numerous distractions, and staff \n     shortages).\n       [(3) Congress acknowledged in the Healthcare Research and \n     Quality Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-129) a growing demand for \n     pharmacists by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to conduct a study to determine whether there is a \n     shortage of pharmacists in the United States and, if so, to \n     what extent.\n       [(4) As a result of Congress' concern about how a shortage \n     of pharmacists would impact the public health, the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services published a report entitled \n     ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and Demand for \n     Pharmacists'' in December of 2000.\n       [(5) ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and \n     Demand for Pharmacists'' found that ``While the overall \n     supply of pharmacists has increased in the past decade, there \n     has been an unprecedented demand for pharmacists and for \n     pharmaceutical care services, which has not been met by the \n     currently available supply'' and that the ``evidence clearly \n     indicates the emergence of a shortage of pharmacists over the \n     past two years''.\n       [(6) The same study also found that ``The factors causing \n     the current shortage are of a nature not likely to abate in \n     the near future without fundamental changes in pharmacy \n     practice and education.'' The study projects that the number \n     of prescriptions filled by community pharmacists will \n     increase by 20 percent by 2004. In contrast, the number of \n     community pharmacists is expected to increase by only 6 \n     percent by 2005.\n       [(7) The demand for pharmacists will increase as \n     prescription drug use continues to grow.\n\n     [SEC. 3.
