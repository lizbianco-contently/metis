Mr. President, I want to visit with my colleagues and \nour constituents about the issues of the tax relief that was recently \npassed\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\nby the Congress of the United States and signed by the President on \nJune 7 and will be the reason that tax rebate checks will go out, \ndistributing $65 billion of overtaxation to the American people--back \nto the American people so they can spend it, so it will do more \neconomic good than if it is politically distributed here in Washington, \nDC.\n  That bill not only has the $65 billion of tax refunds that will start \ngoing out next week and be out by September 30, but it already has \nreductions for other rates. The tax rebates come from the new 10-\npercent rate that is going into effect retroactive to January 1. It is \nmy understanding there will be about 90 million Americans who will be \ngetting rebates of up to $300 if they are single, $500 if they are a \nsingle parent, and also then up to $600 if they are married.\n  Also, remember that this is not a one-shot rate reduction, or tax \nrebate; that these rebates, even though they will never be received in \na check again, will continue on into the future as permanent reductions \nin taxation for people in the 10-percent bracket. And also remember \nthat everybody who pays taxes would pay some of that 10-percent bracket \nso that it does affect all taxpayers. But checks are going out for \nthose up to the amount of $12,000 of taxable income.\n  I think this tax bill is going to make real changes in the lives of \nfolks across our country. The changes I am going to discuss today \nresult in the greatest tax relief provided in a generation--tax relief, \nI might add, powerfully brought about in a bipartisan consensus.\n  Some might ask, Why talk about something we have already done? The \nanswer is that the legislation is quite comprehensive and to do it \njustice we really need to take a thorough and methodical look at it--\nnot look at it just from the standpoint of the rebate checks that are \ngoing out, which are getting all the attention, but all the other \naspects of the bill as well.\n  It is true there have been a lot of press reports on this \nlegislation. Again, most of those have been related to the rebate \nchecks going out starting next week. None of these reports, however, I \nbelieve, in the press has really tied the specific benefits of the bill \nback to its bipartisan purpose.\n  Also, the press reports have tended to analyze the bill in terms of \nits impact on certain types of taxpayers. At the same time, many press \nreports have focused exclusively on the budget angle of the tax \nlegislation; in other words, people nervous, tearing out their hair \nbecause there is going to be less money coming into the Federal \nTreasury as a result of our letting the people keep their tax \noverpayment.\n  These reports that tend to be very pessimistic often echo the \nsentiments of the harshest congressional critics of the legislation. \nThese reports, like the congressional critics of this bill--and \nprobably for the most part those who voted against it--tend to ignore \nthe benefits of the bill. Tax relief legislation is just not more money \nin the taxpayers' pockets in some selfish way that you let the \ntaxpayers keep more of their money. There is great economic good that \ncomes from the distribution of goods and services in this economy based \nupon an individual making that decision as opposed to a political \nleader in Washington, DC, making that decision through the Federal \nbudget.\n  Now, of course, all of this criticism is fair play in the arena of \npolitics. However, in recent weeks it seems to me these arguments have \nnot been answered with the same vigor by the strong bipartisan majority \nof us who supported the legislation. So today I take the floor to set \nthe record straight. Tax relief is absolutely necessary. Tax relief \nlegislation is an important vehicle in response to our short-term and \nlong-term economic situations. And that is basically a flat economy--1 \nto 1.5-percent growth instead of the 2-percent growth we projected a \nyear ago, 1 to 1.5-percent economic growth under the last two quarters \nof the Clinton administration, and carrying through to the first two \nquarters of President Bush's administration.\n\n  That is a situation where we have these checks going out, a short-\nterm stimulus, which, if we had not done it, would have had 100 \nSenators sitting around this body scratching their heads and deploring \nthe fact that we had a flat economy. So what can we do about it?\n  Congress has passed tax reduction in the past to stimulate the \neconomy but often taking effect after the economy turned around. It \ntended not to be as beneficial as it would have been if it had been \ndone at the right time.\n  I do not want to take credit for having been a leader in the tax \nrebates, knowing that they were going to be needed now as a stimulus. I \nconfess not to have thought that way last March and April when we \nstarted working on tax relief. But we ended up with tax rebates--$65 \nbillion--and most economists are saying they could not have come at a \nmore opportune time for an economy that is flat and in need of some \nstimulus.\n  There are three reasons for this bipartisan tax relief package. One \nis that it is necessary, when the Federal Government overtaxes people, \nto reduce taxes so that there is not overtaxation.\n  No. 2, it is necessary to respond to the current and long-term \neconomic problems. I talked about the short-term stimulus, but there \nare long-term economic benefits from this bill that are going to \nenhance the economy.\n  Third, there is sufficient surplus outside Social Security and \nMedicare that is still available to accomplish a tax cut that addresses \ncertain inequities in the Tax Code, such as the marriage penalty.\n  I will start with reason No. 1, that the tax cut corrected \novertaxation. Before the tax cut, the Federal Government was collecting \ntoo much tax. The Federal Government was on a path to accumulate over \n$3.1 trillion in excess tax collections over the next 10 years. Federal \ntax receipts were at their highest level in our Nation's history.\n  The bulk of these excess collections came from the individual income-\ntax payer. Individual income tax collections were near an all-time \nhigh, even higher than some levels imposed by World War II.\n  The chart I have in the Chamber demonstrates this better than I can, \nhow, since 1960, we have seen very high income taxation. In this \nparticular case, we are seeing taxes, as a whole, collected by the \nFederal Government, not just the income taxes but everything at the \nhighest level by the year 2000 at 20.6 percent of gross national \nproduct.\n  This chart shows total tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct over 40 years. Tax receipts have naturally fluctuated \nfrequently since 1960, but most shockingly they spike up since the tax \nbill of 1993.\n  The January 2001 Congressional Budget Office report to Congress shows \nthat in 1992, total tax receipts were around 17 percent of gross \ndomestic product. As I said, by the year 2000, they were at 20.6 \npercent. The significance of this percentage can only be appreciated in \nthe historical comparisons to which I have already referred. But I want \nto be more specific.\n  In 1944, at the height of World War II, taxes, as a percentage of \ngross domestic product, were 20.9 percent--only .5 percent higher than \nthey are today. By 1945, those taxes had dropped to 20.4 percent of \nGDP, which is actually lower than the collection level today.\n\n  It is unbelievable that in a time of unprecedented peace and \nprosperity, which defines the last decade, the Federal Government would \nrake in taxes at a wartime level. The sorriest part of this whole story \nis that this huge increase in taxes has been borne almost exclusively \nby the American people who pay the individual Federal income tax.\n  I have another chart which shows tax collection levels for payroll \ntaxes, corporate taxes, and all other taxes over the past decade. It \nshows they have been relatively stable. Corporate taxes, during the \npast 10 years, have increased from 1.6 percent of GDP to 2.1 percent of \nGDP. Estate taxes have remained relatively stable over that period of \ntime.\n  However, collection of individual income taxes by the Federal \nGovernment has soared. There was a 50-percent increase during that \nperiod of time: 7.7 percent of gross domestic product in 1992 to 10.2 \npercent of gross domestic product as of the year 2000.\n  Individual income taxes now take up the largest share of GDP in the \nhistory of the individual income tax. And that dates back to 1916, \nexcept for the Civil War when there was one that the courts declared \nunconstitutional.\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\n  Even during World War II collections from individuals were 9.4 \npercent. So you see it was a full percentage point below what they are \ntoday in peacetime. As you can see, the source of current and future \nsurpluses is from a huge runup in individual income tax collections, \nand not in runups in any other form of taxes and levies that the \nFederal Government makes on the taxpayers of this country or the \nbusinesses of this country.\n  Part of this is because the 1993 Clinton tax increase overshot its \nmark. These excess collections are attributable to that enactment, in \nAugust 1993, of the largest tax increase in the history of the world.\n  Since 1992, total personal income has grown an average of 5.6 \npercent. Federal income tax collections, however, have grown an average \nof 9.1 percent a year, outstripping the rate of personal income growth \nby 64 percent.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation, at the request of the Joint Economic \nCommittee of the Congress, estimated that just repealing the revenue-\nraising provisions of President Clinton's 1993 biggest-in-the-world tax \nhike would yield tax relief of more than $1 trillion over 10 years.\n  We ought to take a closer look at that 1993 world's biggest tax \nincrease. The 39.6-percent top bracket reflected a 10-percent surcharge \non the basic 36-percent rate. The itemized deductions you can subtract \nfrom your taxable income, known as the Pease Rule, and the phaseout of \npersonal exemptions, which we refer to as PEP, the personal exemption \nphaseout, were temporary bipartisan deficit reduction provisions that \nwere made permanent under the 1993 tax hike.\n  So remember, you had a top marginal tax rate of 36. That was meant to \nbe permanent. But you had a temporary 10 percent put on top of that, \nbringing that to 36.9 percent. Yet for higher brackets they wanted to \ncamouflage it. We had a phaseout of exemptions so that higher income \npeople did not get the full advantage of the personal exemption, as an \nexample, which ought to tell you that in a time of budget surpluses, \nwhich we are in right now, anybody who was intellectually honest about \nputting a 10-percent surtax on the basic 36-percent rate just to get \nrid of the annual budget deficit ought to take that 10-percent rate \noff. But, no, it was never done by those who proposed it and those who \ndid it. We did it through the gradual reduction of the rates that were \nin the bill signed by the President June 7.\n\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee at the time of the 1993 Clinton \ntax increase actually called this what I have already referred to as--\n``a world record tax hike.'' Obviously, with income tax collections as \nhigh as they have ever been in the history of the country, we know that \nto be a fact.\n  The rationale for the tax increases was deficit reduction. It is \nreasonable to think that if deficit reduction was a reason for raising \ntaxes to record levels, then in the era of surpluses we are in now, \nthose tax overcharges, those tax overpayments, should be left with the \ntaxpayers of America, not run through the Federal budget anymore, for \ntwo reasons: No. 1, because they are not needed, once you balance the \nbudget; and, No. 2, if I distribute that income of the hard-working men \nand women in America, it doesn't turn over in the economy as much as if \nthey keep it and spend it or invest it.\n  That is what creates jobs; they create wealth. We in the Federal \nGovernment don't create wealth; we only expend the wealth created by \nothers.\n  This year, on a bipartisan basis, Congress did just that through the \ntax bill signed by President Bush on June 7. We are going to let you \nkeep your money because we believe it does more economic good, it \ncreates more wealth if you have it than if we have it.\n  Congress then agreed to return a portion of the record level of taxes \nback to the taxpayers and, in a sense, Congress, on party-line vote in \n1993--and it was a party-line vote--raised taxes too much. And this \nyear, on a bipartisan basis--not a party-line vote but on a bipartisan \nbasis--we corrected that overtaxation and that temporary taxation that \nwas put in place in 1993.\n  Democrats and Republicans, led by President Bush, started with the \nfact that the 1993 tax hike took too much from the American taxpayers \nand the American economy. President Bush offered to reduce individual \ntax rates across all rate brackets and to reduce the number of \nbrackets.\n  Congress changed aspects of the President's plan and, from my point \nof view, improved the President's plan as it made its way through \nCongress. The bill the President signed did contain relief for \ntaxpayers in all tax brackets. This benefits all taxpayers across \nAmerica.\n  There is much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth over the fiscal \nimpact of that tax relief package. We hear it daily from the leadership \non the other side and from many in the media. What you don't hear about \nis how close everyone in the Senate was on the size of the tax cut. In \nother words, for those who voted against the tax cut, there was just a \nlittle bit of difference between what Republicans and a bipartisan \ngroup of Members of this body thought ought to be cut at a higher level \nversus what everybody else, on mostly a partisan basis, thought we \nought to cut taxes--just a little bit of difference.\n  For the record, everyone on the other side of the aisle who opposed \nthe bipartisan tax relief package had already voted for over $1.25 \ntrillion of tax relief. Some of those people who voted that way are the \nvery same ones who are saying we cut taxes too much. I hope you \nremember that on the debate on the tax bill, everyone on the other \nside, including every Member of the Democratic leadership, including \nthe present chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from North \nDakota, voted for $1.25 trillion in tax relief. Yet they are now saying \nwe shouldn't have this tax cut.\n\n  For instance, we had a vote on what was called the Carnahan-Daschle \nDemocratic substitute. That amendment, if it had passed, would have \nrepresented tax cuts of that $1.25 trillion I cited.\n  I raise this point for two reasons: One, to make the record clear on \nthe votes on the tax cut bill; and two, to make an even more \nfundamental point. That fundamental point is, despite all the rhetoric, \nthere was widespread support for significant across-the-board relief \neven among the most critical of the final tax package.\n  Let me repeat reason No. 1 for this tax cut before I go on to reason \nNo. 2. The American people are overtaxed. The American people have paid \na tax surplus into the Federal Treasury. The goal is to let the \ntaxpayers distribute those goods and services as opposed to having 100 \nSenators distribute that money.\n  Now reason No. 2: The tax cut is needed to reverse slow growth in the \neconomy, not only slow growth long term but I have already referred to \nthe slow growth that has happened right now over the last four \nquarters, 1- to 1.5-percent growth instead of 2.5-percent as we had \nprojected.\n  I provided you with the first reason, to correct overtaxation. Now \nfor the second one.\n  It is our responsibility to help the folks back home who are facing a \nslower economy to create jobs, to expand the economy. There has been a \nslowdown since the latter half of the year 2000. I will expand on the \npoint that the economic slowdown did start in the latter part of 2000.\n  We have two charts. The first chart shows that economic growth has \nslowed considerably since the middle of last year. In the last two \nquarters of the Clinton administration, it started to slow. Compared to \nthe average 4-percent growth rate since 1998, the economy grew only a \nlittle over 1 percent.\n  Several factors have contributed to the economic slowdown. For the \ntwo previous years, we had a tighter monetary policy by the Federal \nReserve. We had Chairman Greenspan throw out of the window his very \ncomprehensive program of liquidity from 1988 until 1995, and then he \nstarted worrying about inflation. Worrying about inflation so much, he \ntightened up money so that we didn't have enough liquidity. When he \ngets back on the kick of worrying about liquidity, not worrying about \ninflation, the monetary policy will turn it around. But a tighter \nmonetary policy has brought about this slowdown. We have also had the \nrising energy rates, a decline in the stock market, and we have had \nrising tax burdens.\n\n  The economic slowdown has real impact on working Americans, as \nevidenced by this second chart we have\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\nhere, as you have seen the unemployment rate go up. It shows that the \nunemployment rate had fallen steadily, but since the slowdown began \nlast year, the unemployment rate has risen. It is now at 4\\1/2\\ \npercent, the same level it was in October 1998.\n  Although there is still considerable uncertainty about the economy, a \nnumber of factors seem to point in the right direction, and one is \nthere is some reversal of the Federal Reserve on its monetary policy. \nWe have had energy prices stabilize. For instance, a week ago last \nweekend, I bought gas in Cedar Falls, IA, at $1.19 a gallon.\n  Given the continued pessimism on Wall Street, however, the economy \nremains vulnerable to potential shocks. So we should continue to \nmonitor signs of potential trouble ahead and be prepared to take \nadditional steps should they become necessary. Republicans and \nDemocrats have a responsibility to address this problem.\n  There is some speculation by some on my side of the aisle that those \non the other side are hoping the recession comes about for political \nreasons. I disagree with that speculation. I believe everyone here \nwants to get the economy on a steady path. Everyone knows that the \nworst thing you can do in an economic downturn is to raise taxes. On \nthe other hand, a tax cut is a stimulus to economic activity. So if \nyour goal were to further slow down the economy, one sure way to do it \nwould be to raise taxes. On the other hand, if you see a slowdown \ncoming, a tax cut would be a wise response to get the economy growing \nagain.\n  In other words, if we had not cut taxes, not had these rebate checks \ngoing out, we would be nervously trying to cut taxes to stimulate the \neconomy. A tax cut stimulates economic growth in two ways. First is to \nthe extent the tax cut currently provides more money for consumers to \nspend, it creates more demands for goods and services. Secondly, and \nmost importantly, the tax cut stimulates the economy through changes in \nexpectations for workers, investors, and businesses. In other words, a \nlower tax bite means that workers, investors, and businesses can expect \nto retain more of the income generated by their activities. That \nexpectation will change what workers and investors and businesses do \nright now. That does more economic good than if we have a political \ndecision to distribute the goods and services.\n  Chairman Alan Greenspan and others have alluded to a new form of \n``bracket creep'' brought about by high tax rates. In a sense, through \nthis new form of bracket creep, the Federal Government was getting a \nwindfall from workers, investors, and businesses.\n  With the lower marginal tax rates, some of the damaging bracket creep \nhas been eliminated over the long term. That change should free up more \nincome to flow through the marketplace and stimulate the economy.\n  So it was pretty clear some action needed to be taken to stimulate \nthe economy. Action was taken and now, hopefully, for the folks back \nhome, the economy will start to grow significantly.\n  Now if I can go to the third and last reason why the tax bill needed \nto be passed--the issue of fairness. We heard during the debate, and \neven recently, a hue and cry from some on the other side of the aisle \nthat not all taxpayers should receive a rate reduction. They said the \nbipartisan tax relief bill that was signed by the President \ndisproportionately benefits upper income taxpayers and does not provide \nenough relief at the lower income scale.\n\n  Well, we have news for that group of people. None of those \nallegations is true, and the charts that I have will show that. But we \nfirst need to understand the current distribution of tax burdens in \nAmerica. We already have a highly progressive income tax system. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 20 percent of \nincome taxpayers pay over 75 percent of all the income taxes coming \ninto the Federal Government. By contrast, households in the bottom \nthree-fifths of the income distribution pay 7 percent of all individual \ntaxes.\n  Sometimes I get the feeling around here that when it comes to \nprogressivity, the only way it is going to satisfy anybody here is if \nthe richest man in America is supporting the Federal Government \ntotally. But for those who are worried about this tax bill not being \nprogressive enough, it not only preserves an already progressive \nsystem; it actually makes it more progressive. Those who don't like \nprogressive income tax systems don't like to hear me say that. But for \nthose who say our tax bill has made it less progressive, I hope it \ncauses them to keep their mouths shut.\n  So to all who are critical of the bipartisan tax relief package as a \ntax cut for the rich, I invite them to pay special attention to data \nprepared by a neutral source, the Joint Committee on Taxation. These \nprofessionals work for both sides of the aisle, Republicans and \nDemocrats, and for both the House and the Senate. As the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation says, the marginal tax rate reductions in our \nbill, as signed by the President, combined with the increase in the \nchild credit, and its added refundability, the marriage penalty, the \neducation provisions, and the individual retirement accounts and \npension provisions--all these aspects of this bill provide the greatest \nreduction in tax burden for the lower income taxpayer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the tables prepared by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF THE CONFERENCE AGREEMENT FOR H.R. 1836 \\1\\\n                                     [Prepared

Detail may not add to total due to rounding.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will go to a couple of the charts I \nreferred to prepared by Joint Tax. Look at the levels of reduction in \ntax burden shown on this chart. You can see that the lowest income \nbrackets receive the highest reduction.\n  Now, for the year 2006--and I say for the year 2006 because that is \nwhen the individual tax provisions or rates are implemented--taxpayers \nwith over $100,000 of income receive a tax cut of between 5 and 6 \npercent. Taxpayers earning between $10,000 and $50,000 get a tax cut of \nbetween 6.5 percent and 13.6 percent, with those at the lower income \nlevels getting the biggest percentage of reduction. Even those with \nincomes below $10,000, who, by and large, don't pay income and payroll \ntaxes, receive a tax cut under the bipartisan tax relief package.\n  Under the tax relief, 6 million Americans will be taken off the \nincome tax rolls. Those are lower bracket people. Just tell 6 million \npeople who are never going to be paying income tax in the future that \nthey aren't getting a benefit from this greater than higher income \npeople who are going to be paying income taxes the rest of their lives. \nA four-person family earning $35,000 a year will no longer have any \nincome tax burden.\n  As the Joint Tax data also shows, a large reduction of the tax burden \nis targeted toward taxpayers between the $30,000 and $75,000 income \nbrackets. These taxpayers will enjoy significant effective tax relief.\n  I also said that the bipartisan tax relief actually makes our tax \nsystem more progressive. The Joint Tax Committee again provides the \nproof. As the Joint Tax tables demonstrate, under the bipartisan tax \nrelief package, the overall burden goes down for taxpayers earning \nbelow $100,000. For taxpayers making $100,000 or more, however, their \nshare of the Federal tax burden will actually increase under the \nbipartisan tax relief legislation. For example, for taxpayers earning \nbetween $100,000 and $200,000 a year, their share of the burden will \nincrease by three-tenths of a percent. This is not the case for \ntaxpayers earning between $10,000 and $30,000. Their share of the \noverall burden will decrease by three-tenths of a percentage point.\n  So the bipartisan tax relief legislation not only retains the \nprogressivity of the tax system, but that progressivity is enhanced.\n  Now, it is clear that distribution tables aren't the only way to \ndefine tax fairness. There were other categories of tax relief that \ncarried bipartisan priority in terms of fairness. First, on a \nbipartisan basis, there is concern about the added burden for couples \nwho decide to marry. This important social objective was impaired by \nthe marriage penalty. The bipartisan tax relief legislation provided \nmarriage tax relief.\n  Second, on a bipartisan basis, there was concern about the Tax Code's \nfailure to recognize the cost of raising children. The bipartisan tax \nrelief legislation provides tax relief for millions of families with \nchildren, including those who pay no income tax at all. In addition, \nthe dependent care tax credit was enhanced for families with children \nin day care.\n  Third, on a bipartisan basis, there was concern about helping \nfamilies with the rising cost of education. As a\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\nresponse, the bipartisan tax relief legislation includes a package of \neducational tax relief measures.\n  Fourth, on a bipartisan basis, there was concern about declining \nsavings rates and the need for more secure retirement plan benefits for \nmore workers to help baby boomers who are saving less. As a response, \nthe bipartisan tax relief legislation included significant enhancements \nto individual retirement accounts and retirement plans. This package \nwas then perhaps the greatest improvement in our individual IRAs and \nretirement plans in a generation.\n  Finally, there was a bipartisan concern about the confiscatory impact \nof the death tax, especially for family farmers and small businesses. \nAs a response, the bipartisan tax relief legislation includes death tax \nrelief, including repeal.\n  Today I have talked about the three most important reasons from my \nperspective why we were able to pass the largest bipartisan tax relief \nmeasure in a generation.\n  The first reason is to correct the policy of overtaxation that \nstemmed from the heavy tax hike of 1993.\n  The second is to respond with an economic stimulus against the \ncurrent economic slowdown.\n  The third is there are sufficient budgetary resources to address tax \nfairness problems.\n  It is important to realize that the major tax legislation just \nenacted rests on a very sound foundation. It should not be dismissed, \nit should not be obfuscated, and it should not otherwise be distorted \nby budgetary demagoguery. Let us not forget that revenue is not an \nabstract notion. Revenue reflects the sum total payments to Washington \nby hard-working men and women. It is not abstract when paid and should \nnot be treated as an entitlement by those of us fortunate enough to be \nsent here to make policy decisions to represent the folks back home.\n  We have a very good tax bill. Our challenge is to make sure that \nthose in Congress who want to spend more money and do not like giving \nthe people back their money--we are intent upon keeping this reduction \nof revenue coming into the Federal Treasury, not because we are \nconcerned about the taxpayers, but because if those taxpayers spend \nthat money, it is going to do more economic good and turn over the \neconomy, create more jobs and more wealth than if I spend it as a \nMember of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nproliferation of small arms around the world and, specifically, the \nremarks made by John Bolton, the Under Secretary of State for Arms \nControl and International Security Affairs before the United Nations \nthis past July 9 at the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade \nin Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects.\n  I begin by saying what I sincerely believe: I think it is right and \nnecessary to limit the illicit sale of small arms and light weapons on \na worldwide basis. In order to do that, however, one also has to \naddress transparency and legal transfers of small arms and light \nweapons because so much of the illicit proliferation problem has its \nroots in legal sales. I was therefore very surprised that Under \nSecretary Bolton said the United States may well be opposed to measures \nbeing considered by the conference that are aimed at curbing the \ninternational proliferation of small arms and light weapons.\n  Before I address Mr. Bolton's speech, and the question it raises \nabout the direction of the administration's policy in this area, I \nwould like to briefly sketch out the scope and scale of this problem:\n  The worldwide proliferation of small arms--this includes shoulder-\nmounted missiles, assault weapons, grenade launchers, and high-powered \nsniper rifles--is a staggering problem today. Right now there are an \nestimated 500 million illicit small arms and light weapons in \ncirculation around the globe.\n  In the past decade alone, an estimated 4 million people have been \nkilled in civil war and bloody fighting, many of them with these same \nsmall arms.\n  As a matter of fact, 9 out of 10 of these deaths are attributed to \nsmall arms and light weapons. According to the International Committee \nof the Red Cross, more than 50 percent of the 4 million people killed--\nthat is 2 million people--are believed to be civilians. The sheer \nvolume of available weaponry has been a major factor in the devastation \nwitnessed in recent conflicts in Angola, Cambodia, Liberia, Mozambique, \nRwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, as well as \nthe sort of violence endemic to narcotrafficking in Colombia and \nMexico. These conflicts undermine the regional stability, and they \nendanger the spread of democracy and free markets around the world.\n  The United Nations and the Red Cross estimate that more than 10 \nmillion small arms and light weapons, ranging from pistols to AK-47's \nto hand grenades to shoulder-launched missiles, are today in \ncirculation in Afghanistan where the terrorist organization of Osama \nbin Laden is based.\n  The United Nations estimates that over 650,000 weapons disappeared \nfrom government depots in Albania in the 3 years leading up to the \noutbreak of violence in the Balkans, including 20,000 tons of \nexplosives.\n  NATO peacekeepers and U.S. soldiers in the region are under threat \nand in danger from these weapons. In fact, the increased access by \nterrorists, guerrilla groups, criminals, and others to small arms and \nlight weapons poses a real threat to all U.S. participants in \npeacekeeping operations and U.S. forces based overseas.\n  Clearly, this is a substantial problem, and it has profound \nimplications for U.S. security interests. It is because of the scope \nand scale of the problem that the United Nations conference on the \nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons, I believe, is so \nimportant.\n  Unfortunately, as the Washington Post editorial on July 10 put it, \nMr. Bolton's opening address ``appeared designed to cater to the most \nextreme domestic opponents of gun control''. Although I do not disagree \nwith all that Mr. Bolton said, I want to ask that we examine more \nclosely the implications of some of his statements, and how they \nconflict with both settled Supreme Court precedent and the goals of \nstemming the tide of illicit arms into the hands of terrorists, drug \ncartels, and violent rebellions.\n  First, Mr. Bolton stated that ``The United States will not join \nconsensus on a final document that contains measures contrary to our \nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms.''\n  As the Post's editorial points out, ``No such measures appear in the \ndraft documents before the conference.'' Why, exactly, did he do that?\n  I believe not only is Mr. Bolton wrong in his assertion about the \nconnection between the Second Amendment and the work of conference, but \nin any case Mr. Bolton's position on the Second Amendment is in direct \ncontradiction to decades of Supreme Court precedent.\n  Not one single gun control law has ever been overturned by the Court \non Second Amendment grounds.\n  Contrary to the constant claims of the NRA, the meaning of the Second \nAmendment has been well-settled for more than 60 years--ever since the \n1939 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Miller. In that \ncase, the defendant was charged with transporting an unregistered \nsawed-off shotgun across state lines.\n  In rejecting a motion to dismiss the case on Second Amendment \ngrounds, the Court held that the ``obvious purpose'' of the Second \nAmendment was ``to assure the continuation and render possible the \neffectiveness'' of the ``state Militia.'' Because a sawed-off shotgun \nwas not a weapon that would be used by a ``state Militia'', like the \nNational Guard, the Second Amendment was in no way applicable to that \ncase, said the Court.\n  If a sawed-off shotgun is not protected by the Second Amendment, why\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\ndoes the Administration seem to be taking the position that the Second \nAmendment protects the international trafficking of shoulder-launched \nmissiles?\n  If an American citizen cannot freely transport a sawed-off shotgun \nacross state lines, why can't we work to stop the international \ntransportation of grenade launchers and high powered, military sniper \nrifles?\n  This second amendment argument simply makes no sense, and has no \nplace in this debate.\n  Second, Mr. Bolton's opening statement attacked language that calls \non governments to ``seriously consider'' curtailing ``unrestricted \nsales and ownership'' of arms specifically designed for military \npurposes.\n  So Mr. Bolton essentially objected to even considering merely \ncurtailing the ``unrestricted sales and ownership'' of military \nweapons.\n  In point of fact the United States already curtails the sale and \nownership of many of these guns.\n  The National Firearms Act, for instance, places severe restrictions \non the manufacture and possession of machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, \ngrenades, bombs, rockets, missiles, and mines.\n  We also passed the 1994 assault weapons ban, which stopped the \nproduction of semi-automatic, military-style assault weapons.\n  These firearms have no sporting purpose, and our laws recognize that \nfact. Yet these guns contribute enormously to terrorist threats, drug \ncartel violence, and civil strife throughout the world.\n  Congress has already recognized that curtailing the use of military-\nstyle weapons is reasonable, appropriate, and even life-saving. To now \nobject to a clause that would call upon other governments around the \nworld to do the same is nonsensical at best, and undermines U.S. \nsecurity interests--and the lives of U.S. military personnel--at worst.\n  Next, Mr. Bolton stated that the United States would ``not support \nmeasures that would constrain legal trade and legal manufacturing of \nsmall arms and light weapons.'' That may be legitimate read on its \nface. People can understand that.\n  Although it is my belief that the United States is not the biggest \ncontributor to the problem of the global proliferation of small arms \nand light weapons--the United Nations has found that almost 300 \ncompanies in 50 countries now manufacture small arms and related \nequipment--in 1999 the U.S. licensed for export more than $470 million \nin light military weapons.\n  With the average price of $100-$300 per weapon, this represents a \nhuge volume of weapons.\n  The problem is that in addressing the issue of the international \nproliferation of small arms and light weapons one cannot simply address \nthe illicit side of the equation without also looking at the \ninteractions between the legal trade and the illegal trade.\n  In fact, there is good evidence of an increased incidence of U.S. \nmanufactured weapons--legally manufactured and legally traded or \ntransferred--flowing into the international black market.\n  In April, 1998, for example, The New York Times reported that the \nUnited States had to rescind pending licenses for sale of U.S. firearms \nto the United Kingdom based on the European Union practice allowing \nretransfer of guns between EU members without review or oversight.\n  In 1999 the State Department stopped issuing licenses from the U.S. \nto dealers in Venezuela because of concern that many of the guns--\nlegally exported and sold--were in fact ending up in the hands of \nnarco-traffickers and guerrillas in Colombia.\n  In 2000 and to date in 2001, the ATF has processed more than 19,000 \ntrace requests from foreign countries for firearms used in crimes: \n8,000 of these guns were sold legally in the United States. So they are \nsold legally and they get into the black market and they become part of \na crime.\n  In 1994, Mexico reported 3,376 illegally acquired U.S.-origin \nfirearms. Many of these weapons were originally sold legally to \nlegitimate buyers but then transferred illegally, to many Mexican drug \ncartels. Between 1989 and 1993, the State Department approved 108 \nlicenses for the export of $34 million in small arms to Mexico, but it \nperformed only three follow-up inspections to ensure that the weapons \nwere delivered to and stayed in the hands of the intended users.\n  According to the South African Institute for Security Studies, an \nestimated 30,000 stolen firearms--again, firearms originally \nmanufactured and traded, sold or transferred in a legal manner--enter \nthe illegal marketplace annually in South Africa.\n\n  Given this undeniable connection between legal sales and illicit \ntrade, the approach suggested by Mr. Bolton to the Conference--that it \nshould only address one part of the equation while ignoring the other, \nappears to me to be untenable.\n  I would also suggest that certain measures which may be seen by some \nas constraints on legal manufacture and trade--such as international \nagreements for the marking and tracing small arms and light weapons, or \nseeing that there are international regulations governing the \nactivities of arms brokers--are in fact wise policy.\n  Mr. Bolton also stated:\n\n       Neither will we, at this time, commit to begin negotiations \n     and reach agreements on legally binding instruments, the \n     feasibility and necessity of which may be in question and in \n     need of review over time.\n\n  Yet, as Mr. Bolton himself points out in his statement, the United \nStates has some of the best laws and regulations on the books regarding \nthe sale and transfers of light weapons.\n  In my view it is clearly in the U.S. interest to see that those \nstandards are replicated by the world community.\n  Mr. Bolton's statement is fulsome in its praise of U.S. brokering \nregulations. Why do we not want to see others rise to the same \nstandards?\n  Mr. Bolton's statement cites U.S. regulations governing the transfer \nof military articles of U.S. origin and U.S. exports of small arms and \nlight weapons.\n  Instead of going it alone--with limited success even when it comes to \nsome of our closest allies, like the United Kingdom, as the example I \ncited above indicates--shouldn't we be working to see to it that the \nrest of the international community adopts similar standards? I think \nso.\n  In approaching the United Nations Conference, the U.S. government \nshould negotiate and support making the trafficking of small arms \ntraceable, strengthen international regulations of transfers, bolster \nrules governing arms brokers, and eliminate the secrecy that permits \nthousands of weapons to fuel crime and war without anyone's knowledge \nof their source.\n  We should be taking the lead on this issue based on our foreign \npolicy and national security interests, not taking the NRA line based \non domestic political considerations.\n  And U.S. leadership should ensure that the Conference is the first \nstep, not the last, in the international community's efforts to control \nthe spread of small arms and light weapons.\n  The problem is you cannot look at the illicit trade of small arms and \nlight weapons, which is killing millions upon millions of people, 50 \npercent of them innocent civilians, without increasing the transparency \nof the legal market because so many of these weapons go from the legal \nmarket into the black market--the illicit market.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman).

We started this session of Congress, I think, on a fairly \nhigh note of bipartisanship. While there have been some recent events \nthat may have detracted from that, I think most of us would like to \nproceed with as much bipartisanship as possible. Part of this,\n\n[[Page S7664]]\n\nof course, concerns relationships between the Congress and the \nPresident.\n  Since the majority in the Senate and the President are of different \nparties, that may be a little more difficult, but I have a suggestion \ntoday which I hope will enable us to move in that direction.\n  The President has a number of nominees, executive branch nominees, \nthere are a few legislative branch nominees that require our actions, \nand then there are some judicial nominees. I hope in a real spirit of \nbipartisanship we can get those nominees cleared; that is to say, the \nSenate can confirm the President's nominations and the personnel that \nhe needs in the executive branch to get his work done, and that we can \nconfirm the judges the courts need. These are people who need to be put \ninto place so our country can move forward for all of the American \npeople.\n  Up until last week, unfortunately, the Senate had been acting at a \nrelatively slow pace. I might also add the change from the majority to \nthe minority, and vice verse, undoubtedly complicated this, but we were \nnot making very good progress.\n  Last week, I note that 54 nominees were confirmed by the Senate. In \nfact, 36 were confirmed just last Thursday. So we are finally beginning \nto make some progress. I urge my colleagues to continue this progress \nbecause, by my count, there are 93 executive branch nominees pending as \nof today. Only 26 have had hearings. But as we know, it does not take \ntoo much for the committee work to follow shortly after a hearing so \nthe nominees can actually come to the Senate for full debate and \nconfirmation by the full Senate.\n  As of today, according to the administration's figures, approximately \n347 nominees have come to the Senate, and only 187 have been confirmed. \nSo we still have a fair amount of work to do.\n  In terms of judicial nominees, my understanding is that there are 29 \nnominations pending, 3 of which have had hearings. Of those, 20 are \ncircuit court nominees, 9 are district court nominees. The bottom line \nwith regard to the courts is that as of today, no circuit or district \ncourt judges have been confirmed this year. We are, of course, now past \nthe midway point of this year.\n  We are going to have to get going. Again, I do not want to point any \nfingers in the spirit of bipartisanship which I am invoking here today. \nI am hoping Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and the \nadministration can work very closely together.\n  What I would like to do, and I will do at the end of my remarks, is \nsubmit for the Record the names of the nominees who are pending. I was \ngoing to read the names of the people who are currently pending, but I \ndo not need to do that. I will submit those for the Record. But I would \nnote some of these have been pending going back to the month of April. \nClearly the Senate can act on those nominees who have been before us \nfor a long period of time, and we should expedite those who have come \nbefore us, even fairly recently. It should be our goal that by the time \nwe conclude our work in July and return to our States for the August \nrecess, that all of the nominees who have come to the Senate, except \nmaybe in the last couple of days before that period of time, will have \nbeen cleared; that is to say, they will have had their hearings, come \nout of committee, and been acted upon by the full Senate. Very few of \nthem are controversial, as I go down the list.\n\n  I do note in a couple of cases nominees are being held up by \nSenators--actually in four or five cases. A couple of those are being \nheld up by Republicans, and a few more are being held up by Democrats. \nI am going to urge my Republican colleagues to cooperate so the \nconcerns they have expressed can be dealt with and the nominees can \nmove forward. I hope my Democratic colleagues will do the same on their \nside of the aisle. I think it is important that while a Member of the \nSenate may put a technical hold on a nomination, we all appreciate all \nthat means is that they have requested to be notified if the majority \nleader is going to call that nominee up for a full Senate consideration \nso that Senator will then have an opportunity to object. Obviously, we \ndo not want to put Members in that position, but I do think it is \nimportant for the full Senate to be able to work its will on these \nnominees. That is why I am going to ask both Republicans and Democrats, \nwhere they have a problem with somebody, to try to work that out with \nthe administration so we can proceed.\n  Finally, last week I worked with the distinguished majority leader \nand the assistant majority leader in ensuring we could both bring the \nappropriations bills that we have to deal with to the Senate floor and \nto get these nominees done at the same time. There is nothing to \nprevent us from bringing an appropriations bill to the floor and then \ntoward the end of the day, for those nominees that do not require \ndebate and rollcall vote, having them considered in the wrap-up.\n  I will continue to do that because it is my expectation that we will \nnot have to use the rules of parliamentary procedure that we all have \navailable to us to hold up business of the Senate in order to get these \nnominees done since they are the top priority; that we can actually do \nboth at the same time.\n  That is my request of the majority leader and of the assistant \nmajority leader--to continue to work in that spirit moving forward both \nwith the appropriations bill and with the nominees. I will have more to \nsay about this later.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of the nominees who are \ncurrently pending be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Bush Administration Nominees Pending Senate Action\n\n\n                              Agriculture\n\n       Thomas C.

Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of \nextraordinary importance to the State of Washington, the Pacific \nNorthwest, and the entire west coast. That is the role of the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission in regulating our Nation's energy markets \nand righting the wrongs that have been visited upon ratepayers in the \nWest by runaway energy prices over the last year.\n  We are now 22 days into an expedited review process by the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, designed to determine refunds for the \nunjust and unreasonable rates paid by Western consumers.\n  At the urging of my colleagues from the Northwest, Senators Murray, \nWyden, Smith, and myself, FERC finally recognized the realities of the \nenergy markets in the West when they allowed Pacific Northwest \nutilities to participate in these proceedings and the expedited review \nprocess. But my main concern is that in the haste of putting the \nCalifornia debacle behind it, FERC will again overlook the Northwest \nand consumers who have been impacted by as much as 50-percent rate \nincreases.\n  I am afraid my suspicions were borne out last week when the \nadministrative law judge charged with overseeing this refund matter \nissued his recommendations to FERC, again paying little attention to \nthe Northwest problem. It is now up to FERC to determine what to do \nwith the judge's recommendation.\n  I believe the Commission should not--and cannot--in the interest of \nfairness ignore the Northwest in its refund calculation. While many of \nmy colleagues are well aware of the toll this crisis has taken on \nCalifornia, we--and FERC--cannot disregard the impact that it has had \non Northwest citizens, businesses, and communities of Washington State.\n  Equitable treatment in this refund proceeding requires that the \nCommission recognize a certain fundamental truth: That Northwest \nconsumers have been harmed, and they have been harmed by unjust and \nunreasonable prices that have prevailed in all energy markets \nthroughout the West--inside\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\nand outside California, and in spot, forward, and long-term power \nmarkets.\n  There are differences between how California and Northwest utilities \nmanage their obligations to serve consumers. Thus, FERC should not come \nup with a one-size-fits-all solution for a refund methodology. The \nbasic litmus test should be this: Did power rates meet the commonsense \ntest of reasonableness? If the answer is no, then the Commission must \norder refunds. This determination should not depend on whether the \nutilities bought energy on the spot market or made their purchases \nunder long-term contracts.\n  The Northwest has been hurt by California's dysfunctional \nmarketplace, and yet we now also risk being hurt because we in the \nPacific Northwest do not operate the same way as the California ISO, \nwhen it comes to the issue of refunds. We run the risk of being \npenalized twice.\n  Western consumers have been impacted by the havoc unleashed by \nCalifornia's unstable energy markets and the apparent gamesmanship of a \nfew who have taken advantage of this broken power market.\n  This topic is of particular concern to the Northwest because, as the \ncrisis has evolved, FERC has been slow to respond to the situation in \nCalifornia, and slower to respond in the Northwest. In the refund \nproceeding, focusing solely on California's spot markets would \nsignificantly harm the utilities of my State and ignore the residual \ndamage that California has caused in all of the energy markets \nthroughout the West.\n  What are some of those impacts? Make no mistake. The pain inflicted \nby this crisis has been real on the people of Washington State. Over \nthe last year skyrocketing energy prices have caused retail electricity \nrates to rise in all corners of my State: 20 percent in Clark County, \n30 percent in Cowlitz, Skamania, and Okanogan counties, 35 percent in \nSnohomish County, and 50 percent in the cities of Tacoma and Seattle. \nEven as these utilities have passed on rate increases to consumers, \nsome have been forced to issue hundreds of millions of dollars' worth \nof bonds to cover the cost. Seattle, for example, normally spends $100 \nmillion per year on purchasing power. This year the city spent over \n$450 million to keep the lights on--and that is just in the first 6 \nmonths of the year.\n  While the utility in its first 98 years of history issued a total of \nonly about $1 billion in bonds, it is having to issue $700 million in \ndebt this year alone to pay for its purchased power bills. A number of \nNorthwest utilities have even had their bond ratings downgraded as a \nresult of this crisis.\n  Indeed, the economic impacts on Washington have already begun to take \nroot. Energy-intensive industries such as aluminum smelting and pulp \nand paper industries have been driven to the brink of collapse, and \nlayoffs already number in the tens of thousands. There are innumerable \nother businesses that are on the brink as well.\n  For example, Georgia-Pacific has shut down its pulp and paper mill in \nBellingham, WA, laying off 420 workers. Another pulp and paper mill in \nSteilacom, WA, has had to idle its workforce due to escalating power \nprices.\n  Washington's aluminum industry, which provides my State with between \n7,000 to 8,000 family-wage jobs, has curtailed a large part of its \nproduction anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. And it is unclear whether \nthose companies will ever resume production at their current levels \ngiven this agreement to shut down.\n  These companies, which produce a large portion of the Nation's \naluminum, have given up more than 75 percent of their power in order to \nminimize the rate increase for the entire region.\n  Due to drought conditions and the cost of purchasing power for \nirrigation, many farmers in the State of Washington have also been \nhurt. They have chosen to forego the planting this summer.\n  Because agriculture is already one of the most stressed industries in \nWashington, the impacts of the current energy situation are \nparticularly devastating. Many of our irrigators have been paid not to \nfarm based on energy savings compared to the their previous year's \nusage. When irrigators can't farm, that has ramifications for entire \ncommunities and related businesses such as cold storage, food \nprocessing, and transportation. So the agricultural impact is being \nfelt broadly in our State.\n  The effect on small businesses have been equally harrowing. At a \nSmall Business Committee field hearing that was held in Seattle by the \nchairman, Senator Kerry, I heard from the president of a steel foundry \nbased in Tacoma, which has been in operation since 1899--a company that \nemploys over 350 people. In the face of this crisis, this plant, with a \nvery aggressive approach, reduced its power consumption by over 20 \npercent. At the same time, the foundry has increased its efficiency and \nwill actually produce more steel this year. But despite this \nextraordinary effort to reducing energy consumption, the company's \npower bills are 60 percent over what it was the year before, virtually \neliminating any profits and already forcing a handful of layoffs. In \nthe words of the company's president, any further rate increase will \nmean that the foundry will have to close its doors.\n  This crisis has a very human face. The LIHEAP caseload in the State \nof Washington is expected to grow 50 percent this year. I have heard \nfrom many senior citizens who can't afford to light their homes at \nnight and will be making hard choices later this fall and winter about \nheating their homes and buying food. I have visited children who are \nworried that their parents, in some of those industries I mentioned, \nwill lose their jobs. And those children are concerned they will then \nlose their homes when their mothers and fathers do not have the work to \npay their bills.\n\n  Our schools have also had to cut corners. The Central Valley School \nDistrict near Spokane, for example, has had to divert over $200,000, \nthat would otherwise be used to purchase textbooks, to pay its energy \nbills.\n  What is more startling is the gravity of these impacts, and the \nnumber of Washington residents suffering from this crisis, is going to \ncontinue to grow. I say that because the Bonneville Power \nAdministration, which provides Washington with 70 percent of its power, \nwill be forced to raise its rates another 46 percent this October.\n  It is clear that FERC has an obligation to help these people I have \njust mentioned, and to help the State of Washington overcome the \neconomic impacts caused by the California market and by a serious \ndrought. FERC must not only stabilize our market and ensure fair rates \nin the future, but must also address past wrongs and the harm that has \nimpacted consumers.\n  FERC took its first serious step in its June 19 price mitigation \norder. Given the economic casualties in my State, I believe this action \nwas long overdue. But it was a positive first step.\n  The effectiveness of FERC's price mitigation plan will remain of \nvital concern to all of us from the West. We need to remain mindful of \nwhat the effects of this California-focused mechanism on supply in the \nNorthwest, as our region's peak winter heating season approaches.\n  But let me address specifically the issue of refunds and where we are \ntoday in the process. Of particular concern to me is the fact that, as \npart of the June 19 order, FERC established a 15-day settlement \nconference for participants in California energy markets, and others in \nthe West, to reach agreement on potential refunds for overcharges and \nsettlement of California's unpaid accounts.\n  As has been the case throughout this crisis, the order was initially \nsilent on the issue of relief for the Pacific Northwest. It was only \nafter the intervention of a bipartisan group of Northwest Senators that \nFERC amended its order clarifying that Northwest parties would also \nparticipate in those discussions.\n  But the 15-day settlement window has now closed and no agreement has \nbeen reached--for consumers in either Washington State or California. \nAs I have mentioned, the administrative law judge made his \nrecommendation last week on how to proceed. He was mostly silent on the \nissue of relief for the Pacific Northwest. It should also be noted \nthat, to the extent the recommendations did comment on our concerns, it \nwas not factually correct.\n  While the recommendations said Pacific Northwest parties ``did not \nhave data on what they were owed, nor an\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\namount of refunds due them,'' it is a matter of public record that a \ngroup of Northwest utilities--net purchasers in the West's \ndysfunctional power markets--submitted a claim for $680 million, as \nwell as documentation and a proposed methodology for calculating those \nrefunds.\n  That notwithstanding, this is a silence the Commission itself cannot, \nin the interest of fairness, sustain. FERC must seek an equitable \nsolution for the Northwest. In order to do that I believe it is \ncritical that FERC recognize some fundamental differences between the \nNorthwest and California energy markets--and that fundamental fairness \nrequires that refunds go to customers in California and the Northwest.\n  First, FERC needs to recognize that most Northwest participants in \nthe California markets are load-serving utilities. These load-serving \nutilities are responsible for a very small percentage of the power sold \ninto the California market--certainly no more than 4 percent--and they \nare clearly not the parties that broke the market. Further, many in the \nNorthwest, especially the Bonneville Power Administration, have been \npartners in helping solve the California problem by keeping the lights \non during emergencies, at costs to the Northwest that cannot \nnecessarily easily be quantified--particularly when one takes into \naccount the Northwest's endangered species and salmon issues, and the \ndelicate balance we work hard to achieve. Every time we generate power, \nit is quite a delicate balance.\n  Unlike power marketers or merchant generators, Northwest utilities \noperate under a statutory obligation to meet all their customers' \nelectricity needs. Further, our region's power supply is essentially \nbased on hydropower. A full 78 percent of Washington state's generation \ncomes from hydropower. As has been made painfully clear by this year's \ndrought--which has amounted to the second worst year of drought on \nrecord in the history of our State--the vagaries of hydroelectric \nproduction require that our utilities make other wholesale power \npurchases to meed load. In keeping with reasonable utility planning \npractices, these companies buy a portfolio of products of varying \nduration.\n  This points to a second, fundamental difference between the Northwest \nand California markets: Whereas California utilities were forced, under \nthe State's restructuring law, to make all of their purchases in a \ncentralized hour-ahead or day-ahead market, we have no such centralized \nmarket in the Northwest. While we do have very short-term bilateral \nmarkets, our utilities have traditionally only used these to balance \nthe difference between forecasted and actual loads, streamflows, \nweather conditions, and other similar factors.\n  Unlike the California ISO market, the Northwest utilities rely \nheavily on ``forward'' or long-term contracts that last for periods \nvarying from a month ahead to a quarter or two or even longer.\n  But these contracts have been closely affected by the skyrocketing \nspot market prices in California. It is thus absolutely crucial, for \nthe purposes of its refund proceeding, that the FERC recognize that \npower prices throughout the West--and not just in spot markets, but in \nthese forward contracts as well--are unjust and unreasonable. \nWashington State's prices have moved in lockstep with the spot market \nprices.\n  In its June 19 order, the Commission itself commented on this, \nstating that there is a ``critical interdependence among prices in the \nISO's organized spot markets, the prices in the bilateral spot markets \nin California and the rest of the West, and the prices in forward \nmarkets.''\n  So the Commission itself has recognized the relationship between \nthese prices. Indeed, when one compares forward contract prices in the \nNorthwest with spot market rates both within the region and in \nCalifornia over the last year, they show a correlation of more than 80 \npercent on a monthly average basis; that is, forward prices in the \nNorthwest have moved in tandem with California's prices, which the \nCommission has deemed unjust and unreasonable. It is these forward \nprices that have largely driven the rate increases in the Northwest.\n  It is clear, then, that any FERC refund order that seeks to treat all \nWestern participants fairly, as the Power Act says it must, must \nrecognize the relationship between spot markets and forward markets.\n  Simply put, any refund policy must not disadvantage the utilities in \nthe Northwest because of the contractual mechanism they have used to \nacquire power.\n  Let me just touch on the case of BPA because I mentioned it earlier. \nThroughout this crisis, BPA has responded to the California ISO's \nurgent calls for power supply when the State was teetering on the edge \nof rolling blackouts. In fact, on three separate occasions, the \nDepartment of Energy issued emergency orders directing Bonneville to \nsell power into the State of California. It should also be noted, \nhowever, that California entities have yet to repay BPA for about $100 \nmillion of these transactions.\n  As one of these entities has entered into bankruptcy, it remains \nquestionable how the Northwest will ever receive this $100 million \nrepayment. Meanwhile, BPA has at times drawn down its reservoirs, \narguably compromising the reliability of Northwest power system to aid \nCalifornia. So while BPA has sold into the California spot market, it \nhas actually been a net purchaser during the crisis, when one takes \ninto account its forward contracts. And when faced with the volatile \nenergy prices throughout the West, Bonneville earlier this year made \nthe difficult decision to pay consumers to curtail their loads rather \nthan to venture into the market.\n  I mentioned various of those efforts earlier in my remarks about the \naluminum industry. Bonneville and the Northwest customers it serves \nhave been victims of the power crisis touched off by this \nexperimentation in partial deregulation, which has created this \ndysfunctional market.\n  In conclusion, it is important that the Commission act fairly and \nthat my State's utilities not be penalized for sales into California \nwhen they have been forced to purchase power at a similar unjust and \nunreasonable rate.\n  It is very important that the Commission work toward a solution that \ngives the Northwest refunds, just as it is promising to do in \nCalifornia. FERC must work towards a comprehensive settlement that \naddresses the claims of both California and the Northwest. In order to \nreach an equitable solution, it must acknowledge the fundamental \ndifferences in the two markets. I believe a fair outcome requires FERC \nto take a few simple steps.\n  First, FERC must recognize an inescapable commonsense conclusion: \nthat all Western power markets have been dysfunctional for quite some \ntime. The Commission's duty under the Federal Power Act is to ensure \njust and reasonable rates in all markets at all times. I urge the \nCommission to act in accordance with section 309 of the Power Act in \ndoing this.\n  Second, power prices have been unjust regardless of the type of \nmarket which the Northwest operates in. The fact is, we in the \nNorthwest have a different market than California, and FERC simply \ncannot use the same formula when calculating refunds for our consumers. \nIt must take into account both forward and long-term contracts. Those \nutilities that can, using this methodology, demonstrate a legitimate \ncomplaint should receive refunds.\n  Third, FERC must not leave the Northwest behind. Northwest utilities \nmust be allowed to plead their case during the upcoming evidentiary \nhearing.\n  Finally, repayments of amounts due to the Northwest for sales into \nCalifornia must be an integral part of any refund calculation.\n  I call on the FERC Commissioners to incorporate these principles into \na refund policy for the Northwest. It is indisputable that the \nNorthwest has been harmed. Now it is up to FERC to take the action to \nmitigate those damages and to repay the consumers in Washington State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 214 years ago today, on July 16, 1787, the \nmembers of the Constitutional Convention agreed to what is known as the \nGreat Compromise. Edmund Randolph, on May 29, 1787, had introduced the \n``Virginia Plan'', drafted by James Madison,\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\nwhich provided for a Senate and a House of Representatives and would \nreplace the unicameral legislature under the Articles of Confederation. \nRandolph had described the plan as designed to promote ``peace, \nharmony, happiness, and liberty.'' Under the Virginia plan, both Houses \nof Congress would be apportioned by population, an arrangement that \nwould favor larger states like Virginia, the State of Pennsylvania, the \nState of Massachusetts.\n  On June 15, William Patterson had countered with the ``New Jersey'' \nplan, which was really a series of amendments designed to strengthen \nrather than replace the Articles of Confederation. Its supporters, \nrepresenting the smaller States, worried that the Virginia Plan went \ntoo far in creating a central government and that it would diminish the \npower of the individual States. However, the Delegates rejected the New \nJersey Plan and committed themselves to the creation of a new form of \ngovernment.\n  The smaller States had lost the first battle, but they had enough \nvotes to keep the Convention from succeeding, unless it was agreed that \nthe new government would firmly protect their rights, the rights of the \nsmaller States. They demanded the same equality of the States that had \nexisted under the Articles of Confederation. On July 1, the Convention \nsplit 5 to 5 on the issue. The Georgia Delegates were split and did not \nvote. This tie represented a deadlock between the conflicting demands \nof the larger and smaller States.\n  When the Convention recessed to celebrate the Fourth of July, the \nDelegates appointed a special Committee to solve the dispute. Elbridge \nGerry of Massachusetts chaired the Committee which devised a compromise \nthat apportioned the House by population and gave the states equality \nin the Senate. Inasmuch as the idea for the special Committee had been \nproposed by Roger Sherman, a Connecticut Delegate, the ``Great \nCompromise'' is also known as the ``Connecticut Compromise.'' In \npromoting the plan, William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut explained \nthat under this arrangement the two Houses of Congress would be \n``halves of a unique whole.''\n  The Great Compromise is one of the more momentous events in our \ncountry's history. Most people are probably unaware of it or have \nforgotten their high school days during which they should have learned \nabout it. But for the Great Compromise, the course of our country's \nhistory might have been forever altered.\n  Fortunately for us, the men who attended the Philadelphia Convention \nwere some of the ablest and brightest leaders of the time, in fact, of \nany time. What a gathering that was. Never before, since the Last \nSupper at which our Lord sat and broke bread with those about the \ntable, was there a gathering like ths one in Philadelphia, 214 years \nago today.\n  What a gathering that was! Never before had there been such an \nabundance of wisdom and learning, grace and dignity--not since the \nRoman Senate had gathered and been observed by Cineas, the Ambassador \nof Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, who visited the Roman Senate at the behest \nof Pyrrhus.\n  Cineas, the philosopher, was charged by Pyrrhus to present a peace \nproposal to the Roman Senate. Cineas had brought with him bribes for \nRoman Senators. He had brought with him rich robes for the wives of \nSenators. But he had found no takers--none. Cineas was impressed. The \nsight of this great city, the city of Rome of the seven hills, its \naustere manner, and its patriotic zeal, struck Cineas with admiration. \nWhen he had heard the deliberations of the Roman Senate and he had \nobserved its men, he reported to Pyrrhus that here was no mere \ngathering of venal politicians, here was no haphazard council of \nmediocre minds, but, in dignity and statesmanship, veritably ``an \nassemblage of kings.''\n  How fortunate to have been one of the members of the Constitutional \nConvention. Never before or after, since conclaves on Mount Olympus, \nattended by the ``gods of Greece'' in Rome, has there been a gathering \nlike it. From Virginia alone, there were George Washington, James \nMadison, George Mason, Edmund Randolph. From Massachusetts, there were \nElbridge Gerry and Rufus King. From Pennsylvania, there were James \nWilson, Benjamin Franklin, and the man with the peg leg, Gouverneur \nMorris. And from New York, there was the great Alexander Hamilton--\nsmall in stature but large in wisdom. Here was a constitutional ``dream \nteam'' for the ages. Fifty-five men, in all, presented their \ncredentials at the Convention, representing every State, save one--\nRhode Island. And with passion and gusto, they had set about devising a \nplan that would create a new nation.\n  In our own time, in these sometimes disgustingly partisan days, many \nof us are prone to overlook the tremendous physical and mental effort \nexpended in drafting the Constitution. In reading this short document--\nhere it is, the Constitution of the United States. I hold it in my \nhand. In reading this short document with its precise and careful \nphrases, it is easy to forget the toil, the sweat, the prayers, the \nconcerns, the frustrations, the shouting, and the argumentation and the \nthinking and the pleading and the speeches that went into its creation \nduring that hot Philadelphia summer.\n  Progress was so slow that upon one occasion, we will remember that \nBenjamin Franklin, the oldest man in the gathering, stood to his feet \nand addressed the chair in which sat Gen. George Washington. He said:\n\n       Sir, I have lived a long time, and the longer I live the \n     more convincing proof I see that God still governs in the \n     affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground \n     without our Father's notice, is it possible that we can build \n     an empire without our Father's aid?\n\n  The greatest sticking point, and the most threatening that was \nencountered in framing the Constitution, according to Madison, was the \nquestion of whether States should be represented in Congress equally or \non the basis of population. The question was far from academic. The \nsmall States feared that they would be swallowed up in a more \ncentralized union; The Constitution must be acceptable to the small \nStates, as well as to the large States. The large States of Virginia, \nMassachusetts, and Pennsylvania were looked upon by the smaller States \nwith fear and distress. The small States feared that a Congress based \non population would be dominated by the large States. Virginia would \nhave 16 times as many votes as would Delaware. And this fact led New \nJersey's Delegates to declare that they would not be safe to allow \nVirginia to have such power. They rejected the Virginia Plan, which had \nbeen presented by Gov. Edmund Randolph, and they proposed a \nCongress with a single legislative chamber in which the States had an \nequal vote, as had been the case with the Congress under the Articles \nof Confederation.\n\n  The Continental Congress had been a single chamber. It was followed \nby the Congress under the Articles of Confederation in 1781, again a \nunilateral legislative branch. It was the legislative, it was the \nexecutive, and to a degree it was the judicial--all in one. There was \nno chief executive, no president, no king, in the form of an \nindividual. Congress was the executive under the Confederation.\n  There had been days and weeks of prolonged and acrimonious debate, \nbut the issue had not been resolved. There were suggestions that the \nState boundaries should be redrawn so that the States would all be of \nroughly the same size. Connecticut advanced a proposal, initially made \nby Roger Sherman, calling for equal representation of States in the \nSenate. This had failed to win support, with James Madison, \nsurprisingly, labeling it as unjust.\n  Can you hear the rafters ring? The doors were closed. Sentries were \nat the door. Nobody outside knew what was going on. Rufus King of \nMassachusetts had angrily announced that he would not listen to any \ntalk of equal representation in the Senate. James Wilson of \nPennsylvania maintained that the small States had nothing to fear from \nthe larger States. Whereupon, Gunning Bedford of Delaware retorted, ``I \ndo not, gentlemen, trust you.'' And he warned his colleagues that the \nsmall States might form a confederation among themselves, or even find \n``some foreign ally of more honor and good faith who will take them by \nthe hand and do them justice.''\n  Can't you sense the tense feeling of the moment? Of course, Bedford \nwas roundly rebuked for his words, but the threat of foreign alliances \nhovered above the Convention in the stale and sticky summer air. There \nwas no air-conditioning, much like it was in this Chamber until \n1929. That was the year of the great stock market crash--1929.\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\n That same year, though, air-conditioning came to the Senate Chamber. \nAh, how great it is--air-conditioning. Efforts to resolve this \nquestion, this nettlesome question ``nearly terminated in a dissolution \nof the Convention''--it came just that close. Washington, who kept his \nthoughts mostly to himself, confided to Alexander Hamilton in July that \nhe ``almost despaired'' of success. Roger Sherman of Connecticut \nlamented that ``it seems we have got to a point that we cannot move one \nway or another.''\n\n  But the Delegates finally did settle the question on Monday, July 16, \n1787--there it was--Monday, just as today--on Monday, July 16, some 2 \nmonths after the Convention began. The matter was finally resolved.\n  It may have been a fear of failure that led the delegates to settle \nthe matter, because they knew that the country's future was in their \nhands. Exhaustion may have played a part, for the members had already \nspent many long days and nights in heated debate in this vert heated, \nsmall Chamber. It may have been because of the heat that had tormented \nthem for so long. Or perhaps the open exchange of opinions in that \nwrenching but vital process of debating and questioning and \nargumentation. Franklin had described the Convention as ``groping . . . \nin the dark to find political truth''; perhaps they had at last \nstumbled upon it. In any event, on that great day, 214 years ago, the \nDelegates agreed that Congress would be composed of a Senate with equal \nrepresentation for each state and a House based on proportional \nrepresentation. This was the Great Compromise. That is what it was \ncalled then, and that is what it has been called ever since--the Great \nCompromise.\n  Thank God for the Great Compromise. The Senator from New Mexico, who \nis now presiding over this Senate, would not be here were it not for \nthe Great Compromise. The people who sit at the bar, the officers of \nthe Senate, the pages of the Senate, the galleries of the Senate, the \nDemocratic whip, Senator Reid of Nevada, would not be here were it not \nfor the Great Compromise. I would not be here. None of us would be \nhere. Think of that.\n  The outcome of the Convention had for so many days held by a single \nthread. At the very first session of the Convention, when the Delegates \npresented their credentials, it had been noted that the members from \nDelaware were prohibited from changing the Article in the Confederation \nwhich declared that ``in determining questions in the United States in \nCongress assembled, each state shall have one vote.'' Delegates from \nthe small states had declared that ``no modification whatever could \nreconcile the smaller States to the least diminution of their equal \nsovereignty.'' They would have left Philadelphia without accomplishing \ntheir goal.\n  After weeks of anxious debate, it had been voted that the ``rule of \nsuffrage in the first branch ought not to be according to that \nestablished in the Articles of Confederation''. In other words, the \nDelegates from the large states succeeded in defeating equal \nrepresentation in the lower branch--Ellsworth moved that ``the rule of \nsuffrage in the second branch be the same with that established by the \nArticles of Confederation.'' In supporting this motion he declared that \nhe was ``not sorry on the whole that the vote just passed, had \ndetermined against this rule in the first branch. He hoped it would \nbecome a ground of compromise with regard to the second branch.''\n  Ellsworth later said: ``We were partly national; partly federal. The \nproportional representation in the first branch was conformable to the \nnational principle and would secure the large states against the small. \nAn equality of votes was conformable to the federal principle and was \nnecessary to secure the small States against the large.''\n  This conciliatory proposal formed the basis of the most important \ncompromise in the history of this Republic--the Great Compromise, \nprobably the greatest single compromise ever reached in the history of \nthe human race. The Great Compromise.\n  Its acceptance was not easily attained. Wilson feared minority rule \nwhen one-third of the population in seven States might dominate two-\nthirds in six States. Ellsworth insisted that this fear of minority \nrule was groundless--groundless. Madison had considered suggesting that \nrepresentation in one branch should be computed according to the number \nof free inhabitants only and in the other branch according to the whole \nnumber, counting the slaves as if free.\n  When Ellsworth's motion for allowing each State an equal vote in the \nsecond branch was brought to a vote, it was lost by a tie. This \ndeadlock gave rise to tense debate. Can you imagine the tension in that \nChamber? We have seen tensions in this Chamber during the great debate, \nthe great civil rights debate, the Civil Rights Act of 1964--tension--\nthe North and the South pitted against each other, and the great \ntensions during the Panama Canal debates.\n  The result was the adoption of a proposal that a special committee \nconsisting of one member from each State should be appointed to devise \nand report some compromise. Three days later, on July 5, the committee \npresented two recommendations ``on the condition that both shall be \ngenerally adopted.''\n  The first recommendation, in effect, provided that in the first \nbranch of the legislature each state would have one Representative for \nevery 40,000 inhabitants, counting three-fifths of the slaves; and that \nall bills for raising or appropriating money should originate in the \nlower branch and not be altered or amended by the second branch; and \nthat no money should be drawn from the public treasury but in pursuance \nof appropriations to be originated in the first branch. According to \nthe second recommendation, each State was to have an equal vote in the \nsecond branch.\n  This compromise proposal was under debate for 10 days. And you know \nwhat? Madison hoped for its rejection. But on the morning of July 16, \ntoday, 214 years ago, God be thanked for the rising of the sun that \nmorning 214 years ago--the whole compromise was adopted.\n  But the vote was close. Five states--Connecticut, New Jersey, \nDelaware, Maryland, and North Carolina--had voted ``aye''; four \nstates--Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia--had voted \n``no''; while Massachusetts' four votes were equally divided. Thus, \nthis momentous question had been decided by one vote!\n  Without the Great Compromise, it is hard to see how the Federal \nConvention could have proceeded; since the beginning it had been cause \nfor battle. The effort to resolve it, Luther Martin had written later, \n``nearly terminated in a dissolution of the Convention.'' Swords \nstacked upon swords and shields upon shields.\n  The small states were jubilant over the compromise; the large states, \nalarmed, tried to reorganize, recover their position. The rules of the \nConvention would have let them reconsider the subject, but it was \nhopeless. The large states knew that they were beaten, and, after July \n17, they let the question die. From then on, matters moved more easily, \nthe little states were more ready to meet the big states and were \nwilling to yield on many questions. They felt safe, and they were no \nlonger threatened by Virginia, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, to them, \nthe towering bullies. Caleb Strong told his colleagues in Boston that \nthe federal Convention had been ``nigh breaking up,'' but for the \ncompromise. Luther Martin declared in Annapolis that even Dr. Franklin \nhad only conceded to equality in the Senate when he found that no other \nterms would be accepted.\n  Catherine Drinker Bowen, in her book, ``Miracle at Philadelphia,'' \nstates that Madison ``in his old age sat down a clear testimony in \nletters to his friends. The threatened contest in the federal \nConvention, he said, had not turned, as most men supposed, on the \ndegree of power to be granted to the central government but rather on \n`the rule by which the states should be represented and vote in the \ngovernment'. They questioned `the most threatening that was encountered \nin framing the Constitution.' '' Those were Madison's words.\n  Mr. President, we should thank Providence for this miraculous \ndocument. Let me hold it again in my hand. There it is, the \nConstitution of the United States. We should thank Providence because \nProvidence had to smile upon this gathering of illustrious men. Never \nhad such a gathering of men, a\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\ngathering of superior minds, taken place anywhere in the world. We \nshould thank Providence for this document.\n  One thing is clear: Without the Great Compromise, the Senate of the \nUnited States would not exist, for this body was conceived on that day \n214 years ago. In Philadelphia, when the Framers agreed to an upper \nhouse of Congress in which each State--small, like West Virginia, which \ndid not exist then but very surely exists now--would have an equal \nnumber of votes, each State would have equal representation.\n  The Senate is the forum that was born on that day. But for the Great \nCompromise, this beloved institution--the Senate--to which so many of \nus have dedicated our lives and our hopes and our reputations, our \nstrength and our talents and our visions--might never have seen the \nlight of day, let alone played an often pivotal and dramatic role in \nour national history over the course of more than two centuries.\n  The Chamber in which we sit today owes its existence to that \nremarkable instance of compromise and conciliation.\n  But for that Compromise, no Senator could wear the great title of \nSenator.\n  It recalls to my mind Majorian, who, in the year 457 A.D. when he was \nmade emperor of the west, said he was ``A prince who still glories in \nthe name of `Senator.' '' None of us would be here today--the pages who \nare here, the Presiding Officer, the officers of the Senate--none of us \nwould be here today. Thank God for the United States Senate. Thank God \nfor the Great Compromise that was reached by the Framers on that day so \nlong ago in Philadelphia.\n  The Romans spoke of the SPQR--Senatus Populusque Romanus: The Senate \nand the Roman people. Let us today, looking back on that great victory \nof our Framers 214 years ago, think in those Roman terms about our own \nRepublic--Senatus Populusque Americanus.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from West Virginia leaves the floor, I \nwould like to say to him I watched most everything from my office and \ncame to watch the finish.\n  I remind the Senator, when you were the Democratic leader, you \nallowed this young freshman Senator to go to the 200th anniversary of \nthe Great Compromise in Philadelphia. We took a train over there. I had \njust come from the House of Representatives. It was 1987, as I \nrecall. It was a wonderful experience to do the reenactment. You \nbrought back many memories.\n\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \npresently many people in America are thinking about the Founding \nFathers. The reason they are doing that is because of the great work \nDavid McCullough has written about John Adams, the forgotten President. \nIt is on the best seller list. It is a straight history book, very well \nwritten. I still have about 70 or 80 pages to go. But as I said, he is \na man to whom we have not, until now, paid much attention. He was the \nfirst Vice President, the person who became our second President. He \nwas involved from the very beginning with the very difficult decisions \nmade by this country. He spent 7 years of his life in Europe. He had \nnever traveled at all. He traveled to Europe, trying to work out things \nduring the Revolutionary War. It is a wonderful story.\n  Truth is stranger than fiction. As the Senator from West Virginia has \nso well portrayed here today, every day we should be thankful, in \nwhatever private time we have. We should think about how fortunate we \nare to be able to be part of this Government and especially to be part \nof this Senate, which was the Great Compromise.\n  I extend my appreciation to my friend for reminding us of how \nfortunate, how blessed we are to be able to be part of this Senate and \nto represent the people from the various States we represent. To think, \nas a result of this Great Compromise, we have developed a country that \nis certainly imperfect but, based on this tiny little document--which, \nby the way, is signed by Robert C. Byrd--even though imperfect, is the \nfinest set of standards, the finest country in the history of the world \nto rule the affairs of men and women.\n  Again I express my deep appreciation to the Senator from West \nVirginia for tearing at my heart a little bit, recognizing what a real \npatriot is. The Senator from West Virginia exemplifies that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend for his observations.\n  He might well have sat in that gallery of men who debated, who \ndisagreed, who compromised, who agreed, and who wrote that document. He \ncherishes it. He carries it in his pocket.\n  Yes, I very well remember that occasion when we went to Philadelphia. \nOur friend, Senator Domenici, the Senator from New Mexico, was there \nthat same day.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I remember that day. I am glad we three were blessed, \namong others, in our being able to attend that celebration in the City \nof Brotherly Love, on that august occasion.\n  The Senator's reference to David McCullough reminds me of what a \ngreat part women have played in the creation of this country. Senator \nReid has mentioned John Adams. John Adams' best friend, his most \ntrusted confident--and that is the way it should have been--was his \nwife, Abigail. Walt Whitman said:\n\n       A man is a great thing upon the earth, and through \n     eternity--but every jot of the greatness of man is unfolded \n     out of woman.\n\n  I am reading the book also. I have had three copies given to me, \nthree copies of this new book by David McCullough, the book titled \n``John Adams.''\n  He is, to a very considerable extent, in the shadows. Some years ago \nI read his ``Thoughts On Government.'' He distributed these writings to \nthe Framers at the convention in those critical days, and the Framers, \nI think, were wise in reading the words by Adams and I think their \nwork, their work product, reflected the thoughts of John Adams.\n\n  One of the great books I have read in my lifetime was ``The Path \nBetween The Seas'' by David McCullough, about the Panama Canal. David \nMcCullough was kind enough to send me a copy of the book. The Senator \nwho delivered it to me also autographed it. That Senator was Ted \nKennedy. So I prize that book. But I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield.\n  I am glad you mentioned Abigail Adams for the wonderful letters the \ntwo of them wrote for each other. Here he was going to become President \nof the United States--he thought. He wasn't quite sure, you will find, \nas you get through the book. He wound up winning that election by three \nvotes over Thomas Jefferson.\n  The letters from the very beginning, from Abigail to John, are \nwonderful. I mean, you could put those letters together--I am sure we \nhave only seen a few of them that David McCullough selected. But they \nwere love letters. These two people were madly in love with each other \nfrom the time they started writing, when he went away to do his \ngovernment stuff, clear across the ocean. They would wait months, \nsometimes, to get answers to letters they had written. But I was \nterribly struck by the letter she wrote to John Adams when he learned \nhe was going to be President of the United States. In this letter she \nexpressed her love for this man that she couldn't bear to be away from, \nand that they would be together soon.\n  So you are absolutely right. John Adams could not have made it but \nfor Abigail.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was present indeed at your invitation for that \nwonderful event. The reason I rise is to express to you what a great \ninstitution the Senate is, but the reason I say it to you is that over \ntime you have, more than anyone else here, continually reminded people \nsuch as me what a great institution the Senate is. And you know, if you \nare not steeped in history, like I wasn't, or if you really didn't \nspend a lot of time other than in normal schooling on the \nconstitutional framework, then you don't know about the heroes of the \nSenate. You may only know that the Senate is over there in Washington. \nBut, essentially, when the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, about 6 or 7 weeks ago got up on the floor and \ndebated--I think the Senator from West Virginia wanted 3 hours and got \n3\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\nhours--on the issue of whether the Budget Act of the United States, a \nstatute, in this instance, changed the basic Jeffersonian rules of the \nSenate or not, which the Senate voted with this Senator saying it did--\n50-49 is my recollection--I recall how passionate you were about \nreminding everyone what the rules of the Senate meant to the rights of \nthe American people, to have their issues debated as long as the \nSenator, under the rules, could get them debated.\n  Who would have thought that was an important thing, until you figure \nout what they really had in mind for the Senate.\n  We are a very different institution than the House. Sometimes we get \ninto arguments and deride each other--the House does this, the Senate \ndoes that, the upper and the lower, whatever the people say. But the \ntruth is we are tied inextricably to the notion of there being \nsovereign States that make up America.\n  As a Senator, you find a way to tie that into the Senate and what we \ndo; to the fact that the States have a tremendous amount of authority \nand autonomy in the United States. That is the way it is and should be. \nYou represent your State and I represent mine. In a very real sense, we \nare permitted to do that because of what our Founding Fathers \nsacrificed to put the Senate into this basic governance approach.\n  Remind us, once again, of our origins and how important the Senate \nis, how much it was debated, of the great concern there was, and then \nto bring it current, as you do frequently, reminding us of what we are \nand who we are. I think it requires that somebody from way off in New \nMexico congratulate you for how you do that.\n  What you had to say about the Senate, not just today but over these \nyears, will be for however long we exist and clearly will never be \nforgotten as part of our fabric.\n  I am very pleased to be here as that fabric is woven by the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a long time ago, I was a boy in the coal \nfields of southern West Virginia. My coal miner dad bought a fiddle for \nme. There was a lad in that coal mining community named Emanuel \nManchini. I remember that little boy and his family. In those coal \ncamps were Hungarian families, Czechoslovakians, Germans, Scotch, \nItalians, and Greeks. This little boy, Emanuel Manchini, also had a \nfiddle. We took lessons together at the high school.\n  So I have often listened to and looked at my friend here--this man of \nRoman stock. My, what a heritage he has. I don't know where his \nforbears may have originated--whether it was in the Apennines \nMountains, or along the shore of the Tyrrhenian Sea, or the Adriatic or \nthe Po Valleys, or on the boot of Italy. But there were stalwart people \nin that Roman Senate. I often speak to Senator Domenici about the Roman \nSenate; what a great Senate.\n  Again, I refer to Majorian, the Emperor of the West in 457 A.D. As he \nwas being made Emperor, he said he was ``a prince who still glories in \nthe name of `Senator'.''\n  I thank the Senator for his reminiscing time. I also thank the \nSenator from Nevada. I have been blessed by serving with both of these \nSenators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7671-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7671-S7678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] for Mr. Byrd and Mr. \n     Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 980.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 980) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this afternoon we begin consideration for \nthe Fiscal Year 2002 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. \nThe legislation we take up today was reported unanimously from the full \nCommittee on Appropriations last Thursday.\n  Before I begin my description of the contents of this bill, I want to \nshare one strongly felt opinion with my colleagues. It is my opinion, I \nbelieve--I have a real suspicion that Senator Domenici, the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, will agree--that this subcommittee has \nalways been among the most bipartisan in the Senate.\n  As I look back over the time that my role was filled by Bennett \nJohnston, I know he and Senator Domenici had an outstanding \nrelationship. They worked very closely together. This bill was always \none of the first to come up. This bill is the second to come up this \nappropriations cycle. I have tried--and I have no doubt, based on my \nexperience with Senator Domenici, that he has tried--to be as \nbipartisan as possible on this bill. Despite the unusual circumstances \nthis year with the shift in power of the Senate, this tradition has \ncontinued unabated.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, and I have, with the \ntireless efforts of our very professional and good staff, produced a \nbill that we acknowledge is not perfect. But it addresses the important \nissues facing our Nation. There are many important issues we are \ndealing with in this legislation.\n  We received 300 more requests than last year on this bill. It is \ncertainly fair to say that there have been over 1,000. Most requests \nwere to enhance new funding for water projects within the Corps of \nEngineers, an organization the administration cut by 14 percent in its \nbudget request this year. We have done in this bill as much as we can \non a bipartisan basis to enhance the funding for these water projects.\n  Mr. President, you are a new member in the Senate. I think a lot of \npeople who are new to the Senate and people outside the Senate would \nquestion water projects. Why do we need water projects? Are these \nthings you throw to a House Member in his district to make him or her \nfeel good? These water projects are essential to the country. There is \ncriticism given to the water projects. We have added $400 million to \nthe budget of the Corps of Engineers, $64 million to the Bureau of \nReclamation.\n  I wish we could give three times that much to each organization. But \nwith these additional funds, we have tried to accommodate as many \nrequests and priorities as possible.\n  Let me give you a few examples of these water projects and why they \nare important. For the examples that I give, I will be very succinct. \nThere are hundreds and hundreds of projects in this country that are \nlife-and-death projects.\n  One is in the State of Nevada: Flood control. There are people who \nwrite all over the country: Reid got pork for Las Vegas; flood control. \nPeople think: It never rains in Las Vegas. It rains 4 inches a year in \nLas Vegas--4 inches a year. You can get that much rain in other parts \nof the country in an hour, certainly in a day. But we get 4 inches a \nyear in Las Vegas. Yet when it rains, it can be devastating because we \nhave what we call cloudbursts.\n  Now we have 1.5 million, 1.6 million people in that valley. When that \nrain comes, it is very difficult. I can remember as a lieutenant \ngovernor, we were told by the Park Service that we were going to have \nto close a little facility on the Colorado River, Nelson's Landing. It \nhas been there well over 100 years. We were going to have to close\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\nit. The Governor assigned me to look at that and the complaints we were \ngetting. We prevailed on the Park Service not to close it. They said we \nwere going to have a 100-year flood. I went and talked to people and \nthey said they had never known that much rain coming down that canyon: \nThe Federal Government, they don't know what they are talking about.\n  Mr. President, it rained. This isn't something I am proud of, but it \nis something that is a fact. It rained. It rained in a very small area. \nIt rained very hard. But all of that water dumped down this canyon, and \npeople looked up and they saw a wall of water 100 feet high coming at \nthem. It washed cars away. It killed seven people. We never found the \ncars and mobile homes that washed away.\n  In southern Nevada, again Nelson's Landing--but in Las Vegas we have \nhad floods that have been just as devastating. We have not lost at one \ntime seven lives but we have lost lives.\n  Caesar's Palace, this great resort--I can remember rains that washed \naway everything in the parking lot. It was just washed away as if they \nwere toothpicks.\n  The Tropicana-Flamingo Wash in Nevada is the fastest growing \ncommunity in the Nation. We have been able to save lives and huge \namounts of property by virtue of the fact we have flood control \nprojects going on there as we speak. It has cost a lot of money, but we \nhave saved a lot of lives; and that is for what the Federal Government \nhas an obligation, to assist local governments. There has been local \nmoney put in it, too.\n  The Everglades: I have seen the Everglades. I really do not \nunderstand them because I understand the desert. I understand aridity. \nI understand when it does not rain much. I understand out of my little \nhome in Searchlight I have creosote bushes that are not very tall that \nare 100 years old. They do not grow very much. So I do not really \nunderstand the Everglades. I am fascinated by them. But it is water \nintensive. It is as water intensive as the desert is not water \nintensive.\n  We have worked hard with the Senators from Florida on a project-by-\nproject basis to take care of that. It is now a huge priority not only \nof the Congress, as it has been in the past, but of the administration. \nI think part of that could be that Jeb Bush is Governor. It does not \nmatter. It is an important project that the Federal Government should \nbe involved in--and we are. There is a lot of money in this bill for \nthe Everglades.\n  Not far from where we stand is the Chesapeake Bay. Books have been \nwritten about the Chesapeake Bay. It is a wonder of nature. But because \nof the growth that is occurring in this area, the Chesapeake Bay has \nbeen threatened. The health of that great body of water has been \nthreatened. It affects Maryland and Virginia very much. The bay is \nthreatened as a natural resource.\n\n  Senators Mikulski, Sarbanes, Warner, and Allen have aggressively \nsought money to restore that waterway to what it used to be so oysters \ncan be harvested there and not make people sick. The oyster industry in \nMaryland and Virginia is huge, but it has not been as huge recently \nbecause of the condition of that bay. The restoration of the beds at \nrelatively low cost, we believe, will ultimately generate hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in economic benefit and jobs. This is a water \nproject.\n  The Port of Los Angeles: We move from the Chesapeake Bay 3,000 miles \nto the Port of Los Angeles. The administration had made a decision to \nstretch this out. The problem we have found with these promises is that \neven though it sounds OK, you stretch it out and it winds up costing \nmuch more money. You are better off doing less projects and doing them \nwell. Congress has funded this project very aggressively and has saved \nthe Federal Government 25 percent of the total project cost and has \naccelerated the economic benefits to California.\n  So these are just four examples of water projects. But there are many \nmore. I am happy we have worked together with our members, our \nSenators, and, of course, many requests from people in the House, to do \nwhat we could with these projects.\n  Even with the additional funding the committee has added, we are \nstill hundreds of millions of dollars shy of current year levels. We \nare also shy of the House mark. The other body was able to artificially \nraise their numbers for the Foreign Bureau by moving defense dollars in \nthese nondefense accounts. We cannot do that. Under Senate rules, we \ncannot do that. In my opinion, not only the budget resolution but \ncommon sense does not allow us and should not allow us to move these \nfunds back and forth.\n  But I will say to everyone who is listening, in the past, the water \nnumbers have always gotten better for everyone as we have moved along \nthe process; that is, we hope we can do a better job when we get to \nconference. There is no guarantee of that, but we will work on that.\n  Our bill provides about $25 billion in budget authority and \napproximately $24.7 billion in outlays. When you work with Senator \nDomenici, you always have to make sure the outlays are smaller than the \nbudget authority. This bill exceeds the President's total request by \n$2.6 billion.\n  Let's talk about a few of the areas. The Army Corps of Engineers: The \nSenate bill provides $4.3 billion, which is $405 million above the \nPresident's request but $236 million below the current year level. Due \nto the funding constraints, this bill contains no new construction \nstarts and no new environmental infrastructure projects.\n  The intent in drafting the bill was to continue to focus on ongoing \nconstruction and operations and maintenance projects at appropriate \nlevels. The committee is eager to avoid stretching out schedules and \ncosts on projects that are already underway. Any new construction \nstarts will have to be considered in conference. We will do what we can \nat that time.\n  A lot of people are very concerned about things they want to do. I \nhave a lot of familiarity with the Bureau of Reclamation because they \nhave had such a big presence in the State of Nevada. The very first \nproject in the history of the Bureau of Reclamation was called the New \nLands Project in 1902. It took place in Nevada. It is still there. The \nSenate's bill provides $884 million, which is $64 million above the \nPresident's request and $67 million above the current year level.\n  This funding for the Bureau is higher than it has been for many \nyears. It is higher because of CALFED. This is a big project in \nCalifornia. It is a reclamation project. The State of California has \nspent billions of dollars on it already. The House put nothing in the \nbill for that. Senator Domenici and I put $40 million in this bill for \nthe CALFED and CALFED-related projects. The subcommittee has funded \nCALFED-related projects using existing authorizations under other \naccounts. Senators Feinstein and Boxer have both been very tireless \nadvocates for the Bay-Delta Program. Senator Domenici and I are both \ndelighted to provide substantial funding.\n  The Department of Energy: We in Nevada have great familiarity with \nthe Department of Energy. Nevada has been the place for 50 years where \nalmost 1,000 nuclear devices have been set off in the desert--most of \nthem underground but not all of them. I know about the Department of \nEnergy. This bill contains over $20 billion for the Department of \nEnergy. This is $2.1 billion over the level of the President's request \nand $1.9 billion over last year's level. Most of this additional \nfunding is being used to provide adequate funding for the National \nNuclear Security Administration, to enhance funding for the \nEnvironmental Management Program, and to add funding for the renewable \nenergy program.\n  Senator Domenici and I have received a letter signed by nearly two-\nthirds of our colleagues calling for more money for renewable energy \nprograms. Our bill takes care of that. Our bill provides $435 million, \nor $160 million above the President's request and $60 million above the \ncurrent year level. In a year when our Nation has struggled with energy \nproduction and distribution issues, I am pleased to be able to enhance \nfunding levels for these important research and development issues.\n  Consistent with the budget resolution, this bill provides $6.1 \nbillion to the National Nuclear Security Administration for stockpile \nstewardship activities. This funding is $705 million over the \nPresident's request and $1.05 billion over the current year level. I am \nonly going to speak a little while\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\nabout the National Nuclear Security Administration, known as NNSA. I \ndefer to Senator Domenici on this subject. Senator Domenici was the \nprimary congressional architect of the creation of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration. He worked tirelessly to get it authorized and \nhas been dogged in his pursuit of funding to make sure that this \nimportant organization gets the resources it needs to succeed. To his \ncredit, he convinced his colleagues on the Budget Committee that the \nsafeguarding and rehabilitation of the Nation's nuclear weapons was a \ncritical issue that has been underadressed and underfunded in recent \nyears. Senators Byrd and Stevens followed up with appropriation \nresources designed to support the levels in the budget resolution.\n  This morning I spoke to the interns for Senators Lincoln and \nHutchinson of Arkansas. I don't know how many interns there were--maybe \n50--a lot of young men and women. One of the young people asked me: \nWhat do you think is the most important problem facing the world? I \nthought for a minute. I said: Nuclear weapons. I really do believe that \nwith the deteriorating condition of the former Soviet Union, Russia's \nnuclear stockpile, and the responsibilities we have, that is a very \nimportant issue. I can't think of anything more important for my \ngrandchildren than to make sure they live in a safe world.\n  One of these weapons that we control and certainly one that the \nSoviet Union controls could accidentally go off. It would be \ndevastating. It would make Chernobyl look like nothing. Chernobyl was \njust a nuclear reactor gone bad. We are talking about a nuclear weapon \ngone bad. I believe that is the No. 1 problem facing the world. We have \na number of different ways of addressing it. We have to spend more \nmoney on terrorism. There are efforts being made for a nuclear shield \nfor this country. But what we are talking about in this bill is doing \nwhat we can to make our nuclear stockpile safe and reliable. Our bill \nspends some money, maybe not enough, to work on the Russians to see if \nwe can help them.\n  I have to admit, I was a skeptic when Senator Domenici and others \napproached me about the creation of this autonomous organization \nseveral years ago. I thought it was a partisan ploy to maybe embarrass \nthe administration. But as it turned out, it is working very well. I \nhave come to believe Senator Domenici was right.\n  One of the people who has done a good job of convincing me of that is \nthe person running that agency. We as a country, as a world, are so \nfortunate that a retired general would take charge of this operation. \nHe believes in it. He is a very competent, dedicated, patriotic \nAmerican. With him heading this office, we should all go to sleep at \nnight resting well that everything possible is being done to make sure \nwe do have a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile. I am going to do \neverything I can to give him the resources he needs to do his job. He \nhas a job that is very difficult.\n  I am also, of course, holding him accountable for getting the job \ndone. I have been a long-time critic of cost overruns and management \nincompetence within the weapons complex. I know General Gordon will \ntake these enhanced resources and use them to get some fresh blood and \nfresh thinking going on within the Department of Energy.\n  I am not going to go into more detail. I know Senator Domenici will \nspeak about this, since this is his so-called baby. It has grown up and \nis about to become a teenager. It is something to which the Senator can \nspeak with more authority than I.\n  Finally, I am very pleased to report that the committee has made \ngreat strides in restoring and enhancing the devastating cuts made in \nthe Environmental Management Program at DOE. This Senate bill provides \n$7.23 billion, $900 million above the President's request and $450 \nmillion above the current level. The biggest beneficiaries of these \nadditional clean-up dollars are the Hanford, Washington site, hundreds \nof millions of dollars; Savannah River site, almost $200 million, that \nis in South Carolina; Idaho, over $150 million; Ohio and Kentucky, tens \nof millions of dollars.\n  As with water programs, I realize there are never enough resources we \ncan spend to clean up the legacy of the cold war and other activities, \nbut we have done our best.\n  These are some of the highlights, from my perspective, of this bill. \nIt is a bill I have learned to like. It is a bill I have grown to \nunderstand. I have grown to acknowledge the importance it has to our \ncountry. I hope my colleagues will realize how hard we have worked on \nthis legislation.\n  Senator Domenici and I would like to have a cutoff time for the \nfiling of amendments. We tried tomorrow at 11 and 12, and we have \nreceived objections to that. We are here. If somebody wants to offer \namendments, they can certainly do that. They have to have offsets or \nfigure out some way to fund them because we are down to the nubs. We \nhave no more money. If people don't like the way we have worked the \nbill, it is their privilege to come forward with amendments.\n  I do think it would be in everyone's interest to have a finite list \nof amendments filed at an appropriate time. If anyone has any \nsuggestions when that should be, Senator Domenici and I are open for \ndiscussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me first acknowledge the wonderful \ncooperation that exists between the chairman and this Senator as \nranking member. I believe under the circumstances and considering the \nvariety of things this subcommittee has to fund, we have done a pretty \ngood job. I couldn't ask for more understanding than I have received \nfrom the distinguished Senator, the chairman of this subcommittee.\n  I believe our staff has worked together, and I hope I have been \nequally considerate and concerned about issues of importance to the \ngood Senator from Nevada.\n  As a result of this effort, we are together in trying to get this \nbill passed and get it off to conference and getting these issues \nresolved as soon as possible.\n  Let me say to my good friend, he was talking about a flood that \noccurred in the State of Nevada in one of those dry rivers where for \nmost of the year no water runs. But then you have a little cloudburst \nup in the mountains and these dry rivers turn into flooded, huge water \nresources plowing down the hills right into housing. In our State we \ncall these dry rivers a Spanish name, ``arroyos.''\n  In my home city of Albuquerque, I was pleased to serve 4 years as the \ncity councilman, sort of chairman of the commission, which made me the \nclosest thing to a mayor as you could have. I remember one Sunday \nafternoon in the year 1968. I was very young. I had just been on this \ncouncil as chairman for awhile. It started raining Sunday afternoon. I \ncalled up one of my good friends on the city council who knew more \nabout the details of the streets and everything else than anybody in \nthe city.\n  I called him up and said, ``Harry, this rain is coming down in the \nwrong places; something is going to happen.'' He said, ``Where are \nyou?'' He picked me up and we rode around. Rain kept coming down harder \nand harder, and these dry rivers started to show a little trickle. Four \nhours later, we were riding the streets of Albuquerque and big manhole \ncovers over the tunnels that carried water underground to avoid floods \nwere standing or dancing on the water. The water raised those man holes \nup 4 or 5 feet and stood them up while the place got flooded. We saw \nmore and more of them. I told my friend, ``This is a real problem.'' He \nsaid, ``No, things will be all right.'' Finally, 2 hours later, we got \na call from the police chief. He said that in one whole piece of our \ncity, maybe as many as 10,000 homes were under water. They had water in \nthe kitchens, close to the tops of the stoves. It was a gigantic flow \nof water that came down these dry arroyos.\n  I remember coming here with a group of Albuquerqueans. I was city \ncouncilman then. We appeared before the Public Works Committee, which \nhad to authorize the project after which it went on to get \nappropriated. We came up to ask if the Federal Government would expand \na program that was about to run out so we could build these rivers so \nthey would be safe. Now if one flies over Albuquerque, as you approach \nthe airport you see two giant cement waterways that are around the \nedges of\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\nthe town--huge. They catch the water in these dry rivers up by the \nmountain and run them down these no longer dry rivers, but they are \ncement-lined ditches, big ones. Water comes down, and now you can be \nriding around and your commissioner friend Harry can say, ``It is \nraining hard, Mr. Chairman,'' and you can say, ``It might hurt \nsomething else, but it won't flood anymore.''\n  That is the kind of thing we pay for in this bill for hundreds of \nplaces across America. We hope we get them before they flood, but \nsometimes we don't. Sometimes we pay for them after they flood. But to \nmake sure we are not building white elephants, we require a very \nsubstantial match. The community has to come up with money. That is the \nway we finally decide it must be important, because they are not just \nasking us to have a construction project, they are going to pay for \npart of it.\n  My good friend, the chairman, outlined water issues. Clearly, there \nis no end to the requests in our country for this. But we have the \nrule: We don't fund them unless they have been authorized. The \ncommittee has to work on them and have hearings. That bothers a lot of \nour Senators because there is such a backlog of existing authorized \nprograms that we don't catch up very often. We have many billions \nbacklogged that we can't pay for. But we will keep working on it.\n  Overall, the proposed fiscal year 2002 energy and water bill is a \nvery fair and balanced bill that makes important investments in our \nnational security, our energy security, our economic prosperity, and in \nthe health of our environment. This bill is an important step in \nimplementing the President's National Energy Policy.\n  The Senate bill in total provides $25 billion in budget authority and \napproximately $24.7 billion in outlays. The bill exceeds the \nPresident's request by $2.6 billion, and exceeds the House bill by $1.4 \nbillion. Without going into detail about all of the many great things \nin this bill, I would like to focus my remarks on two broad areas: (1) \nWhat this bill does for our energy security, and (2) What this bill \ndoes for our national security.\n  For our nation's energy security, this bill represents a major step \nin fulfilling the President's commitment to a balanced and diversified \nenergy policy--particularly in the area of expanding the supply of \nclean energy from renewable sources and nuclear power.\n  But before If focus specifically on what this bill does in those two \nareas, I want to take this opportunity to dispel two persistent myths \nthat have been unfairly associated with the President's National Energy \nPolicy. First, that the policy focuses only on supply and ignores \nconservation and efficiency. And second, that the policy fails to \naddress the possible threat of global warming.\n  The policy is so clear on the first point that those who argue simply \nhaven't read it. There are more policy recommendations impacting \nconservation and efficiency than supply. Over $6 billion in proposed \ntax reductions are targeted at conservation and efficiency.\n  Furthermore, the whole policy is based on substantial gains from \nimprovements in conservation and efficiency. If we maintained the \ncurrent ratio between energy demand and the gross domestic product \n(GDP), we would need 77 percent more energy in 2020 than we are \nproducing today--77 percent more. The National Energy Policy recommends \nconservation and efficiency measures that would reduce the required \nincrease by over half--resulting in us only needing to produce 29 \npercent more energy by 2020. That is a substantial but necessary \ncommitment to conversation and efficiency.\n  Let me turn to that second myth, that the policy doesn't address the \npossible threat of global warming. Once again, those who have read the \npolicy shouldn't make that statement. The policy has strong support for \nclean energy sources.\n  Renewable sources are encouraged in many ways, including tax credits \nfor wind, biomass, solar, and the purchase of clean fuel vehicles. The \npolicy supports a major research program in clean-coal technologies, \nadvocates increased funding for renewable energy R and recognizes \nnuclear energy for its very positive environmental benefits.\n  It is in these last two areas, renewable energy and nuclear energy, \nthat the energy and water bill takes a major step in implementing the \nPresident's national energy policy.\n  The renewable energy programs are funded in this bill at $435 \nmillion. That's $60 million and 16 percent above the current year \nlevel. There's no question that renewable sources can and should play a \nlarger role in our energy supply, and this budget will accelerate \nprogress towards that vision.\n  Within that renewable budget, several programs are slated for major \nincreases. Just to give a few examples:\n  Research on hydrogen-based technologies is up almost 30 percent over \nlast year. That research may lead to decreased use of petroleum \nproducts in transportation, certainly a critical goal.\n  Research on high temperature superconductivity is boosted by almost \n20 percent. That's a technology that may enable dramatic reduction of \nlosses we now experience in electric transmission lines and motors.\n  Geothermal research is 20 percent above last year and wind systems \nare up more than 10 percent.\n  Nuclear energy received significant increases as well in this bill. I \nstrongly agree with the President's National Energy Policy in its \nrecommendation supporting the expansion of nuclear energy in the United \nStates. Nuclear plants offer emission-free power sources, help maintain \ndiversity of fuel supply, enhance energy security, meet growing \nelectricity demand, and protect consumers against volatility in the \nelectricity and natural gas markets.\n  This bill pushes nuclear power forward with a number of important \ninitiatives:\n  The bill includes $19 million for university research reactor \nsupport--an increase of $7 million over current year--to make sure our \ncountry has the educational resources necessary for an economy that \ncontinues to rely substantially on nuclear power.\n  The bill includes $9 million--an increase of $4 million over current \nyear--to expand a program to improve the reliability and productivity \nof our 103 existing nuclear power plants.\n  The bill continues the highly successful Nuclear Energy Research \nInitiative (NERI) at $38 million--$3 million more than current year.\n  The bill provides $14 million--an increase of $7 million--to continue \nwork begun last year on advanced reactor development, including \nresearch on generation IV reactors--reactors that will be passively \nsafe, produce less waste, and reduce any proliferation concerns.\n  The bill provides $10 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nto prepare to license new nuclear power plants.\n  The bill continues an R program we started two years ago on ways to \nreduce the quantity and toxicity of spent nuclear fuel--called \n``transmutation''. This technology, which was recently highlighted in \nthe President's National Energy Policy, will be continued at $70 \nmillion in 2002.\n  Let me emphasize that I used the phrase ``spent fuel'' rather than \n``waste'' to refer to the materials coming out of our reactors. Right \nnow our national policy calls for disposing of those materials as waste \nin a future repository. But we need to remember that these materials \nstill contain 95 percent of their initial energy content.\n  I've been concerned for years that it is highly debatable for us to \ndecide that future generations will have no need for this rich energy \nsource. With improved management strategies, possibly involving \nreprocessing and transmutation, we can recycle that material for \npossible later use, recover far more of the energy, and dramatically \nreduce the toxicity and volume of the materials that are finally \ndeclared to be waste.\n  As a final thought on energy security, Mr. President, I want to share \nwith my Senate colleagues a vision, which is encompassed in this bill \nand which I've shared with President Bush.\n  We need to reach beyond the debate over Kyoto with a blueprint that \nprovides the tools to combat global warming.\n  I'm convinced that we can have growth and prosperity in America \nwithout global warming.\n  And I'm equally convinced that we can help provide those same \nbenefits for the world.\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\n  I propose that we provide worldwide leadership to eliminate the \nthreat of global warming by a commitment to prosperity and growth \nthrough clean energy.\n  And I further propose that we accomplish this goal through \npartnerships with our friends and allies, especially those in \ndeveloping countries.\n  I've specifically urged the President to lead this new initiative, to \naccelerate our own research and build international partnerships for \njoint development of all the clean sources of energy--renewables, clean \nfossil fuels, nuclear energy, and hydrogen-based fuels. Then as we \ntransition to improved technologies in the future, our partner nations \nwill also be building up their energy infrastructure with the latest \nand cleanest technologies.\n  Last year's energy and water development bill called for improvements \nin the federal government's role in international development, \ndemonstration, and deployment of advanced clean energy technologies.\n  With this new bill and the President's policy, our nation is \ndeveloping a suite of energy supplies that will provide us with clean, \nreliable, economic energy far into the future. But I continue to \nbelieve that we should be looking beyond our own borders.\n  I submit that we should be seizing every opportunity to help the \ndeveloping nations around the world achieve much higher standards of \nliving. They simply can't do that without reliable electricity \nsupplies.\n  Each nation will make their own choices for fuel sources, exploiting \ntheir own strengths. We have abundant natural gas--and it will make a \nhuge contribution to a cleaner future for our country. But every nation \nneeds diverse energy supplies, not a singular reliance on one source. \nOther nations may be well positioned to exploit their solar or wind \nresources--through this program these nations can make the choices best \nfor their needs.\n  The leadership shown by Senator Byrd on clean coal technologies \nmatches this vision very well. Some other nation's have immense coal \nresources, through this vision they can benefit by Senator Byrd's \nefforts to advance clean coal technologies.\n  We can leave the poorest countries to their own resources to develop \nwhatever energy they can, or we can offer substantial help to partner \nwith these nations to help them develop sources that are not only \nreliable and reasonably priced, but also clean.\n  It's strongly in our self interest to do this. After all, we all \nshare the same air. And in addition, countries with strong economies \nare our best choice for trading partners\n  Mr. President, let me state again how proud I am to have worked on \nthis bill with Senator Reid. With this bill, we'll be making real \nprogress on the technologies to fuel our, and perhaps the world's \neconomies of the future.\n  For our nation's national security, this bill makes a major \ninvestment in solving serious problems in the nuclear weapons complex. \nWith the leadership and resources included in this bill, many of those \nproblems are going to get fixed.\n  The bill includes $6.05 billion for the nuclear weapons (stockpile \nstewardship) activities of the NNSA, that is $705 million over the \nPresident's request, $925 million over the House level, and $1.05 \nbillion over the current year level.\n  I want to again commend Senator Reid, and our full committee \nchairman, first Senator Stevens and Now Senator Byrd, for recognizing \nthe serious problems in the nuclear weapons complex and providing the \nresources to fix those problems.\n  This bill makes three major improvements on the President's budget \nrequest for nuclear weapons.\n  First, infrastructure. We know from the subcommittee's hearing on \ninfrastructure earlier this year, that our nuclear weapons facilities \nhave degraded to the point that it will take billions of dollars to \nmodernize for the future.\n  The average age of the facilities where we do nuclear weapons work is \nover 40 years.\n  We will need to spend an additional $300-$500 million a year for the \nnext 17 years over currently planned levels to refurbish the weapons \ncomplex to perform its basic mission. These expenditures will be \nrequired even if the nuclear stockpile is dramatically smaller.\n  If we do not take action on these infrastructure problems \nimmediately, we will not be able to meet the Department of Defense \nschedules for refurbishing three main weapons systems representing over \n50 percent of our stockpile. We will not have the scientific facilities \nrequired to certify weapons. Our technicians and scientists will \ncontinue to work in unsafe facilities-increasing health risks and the \nnumber of safety related shutdowns.\n  Although the work must begin immediately, the budget request included \nno funds to begin such an initiative. Therefore, the bill before the \nSenate includes $300 million to begin a major facilities improvement \nprogram in fiscal year 2002 at facilities in South Carolina, Tennessee, \nMissouri, Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, and California.\n  The second major improvement on the administration's budget request \nis that the bill provides additional funding to rebuild current \nweapons.\n  The average age of weapons in the stockpile is now approaching 18 \nyears--most were designed for a life of no more than 20 years. Many \nweapons components degrade substantially over time and have to be \nreplaced. The Joint Department of Defense/NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council \nhas recognized the fact that most of our weapons will have to be \nrebuilt, but funds were not requested to do so.\n  Therefore, the bill includes an additional $295 million in fiscal \nyear 2002 to get the NNSA on track to rebuild weapons on the schedule \nrequired by the Department of Defense.\n  The third major improvement on the President's request is that this \nbill fully funds pit production on the required schedule.\n  We must soon have the capability to produce plutonium pits for \nweapons, a capability we lost when Rocky Flats was closed down in 1989. \nPlutonium pits are the ``triggers'' for nuclear weapons, that \noccasionally must be replaced. Today, we are the only nuclear power \nwithout the ability to produce them. The budget request puts off \nindefinitely our ability to deliver a certified pit to the military, \nbut this bill adds $110 million to get the program back on track.\n  Finally, there are a series of programs at NNSA that may be just as \nimportant to eliminating or controlling the global nuclear danger--\nthese programs are to reduce the threat of nuclear weapon proliferation \naround the world.\n  The administration proposed deep cuts in this area for fiscal year \n2002, even though a blue-ribbon review led by Senator Howard Baker and \nLloyd Cutler recently concluded . . .\n\n       The most urgent unmet national security threat to the \n     United States today is the danger that weapons of mass \n     destruction or weapon-usable material in Russia could be \n     stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation states and \n     used against American troops abroad or citizens at home.\n\n  The report also concluded that . . .\n\n       Current nonproliferation programs of the DOE . . . have \n     achieved impressive results thus far, but their limited \n     mandate and funding fall short of what is required to address \n     adequately the threat.\n\n  I am pleased that this bill adds over $100 million to the important \nnonproliferation work the NNSA carries out in Russia and other \ncountries of the former Soviet Union. These programs to control the \nmaterial and expertise necessary to make weapons of mass destruction \naddress problems identified as ``the most urgent unmet national \nsecurity threat to the United States today.''\n  Once again, Senator Reid, I want to commend you for a balanced bill. \nI do not agree with every aspect of the bill, but I cannot urgue with \nthe fair manner in which you have put it together.\n  I strongly support the bill, and urge all Members of the Senate to do \nlikewise.\n  Let me proceed as quickly as I can to summarize this bill. First, I \nam very pleased to join with Chairman Reid in considering this fiscal \nyear 2002 Energy and Water bill. I note that in the chair is a new \nSenator. I would think that he might wonder what in the world is an \nappropriation bill called Energy and Water. Well, my good friend, the \nnew Senator from New Jersey, will never sit down and rationally decide \nwhat is in this bill. What is in it has been decided between the House \nand Senate as one of the 13 subcommittees of appropriation, and there \nis no rationale to\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\nit. In it we fund water development projects, flood protection \nprojects, the harbors and rivers that need the Federal Government to \nhelp. But on the other end, believe it or not, the entire nuclear \nweapons development, preservation, and research for nuclear weapons is \nalso funded in this bill. It doesn't come under the rubric of energy. \nWhy is it here? It is here because that kind of activity was brought to \nthe Energy Department when the Energy Department was created. This \nsubcommittee pays for that.\n  So, overall, this is a very balanced bill. It covers what I have \nalluded to. I have great detail with me about what has concerned us and \nwhy we have had to fund the part of this that is for nuclear weaponry \nat a higher level than the President. I am very hopeful that the staff \nat the White House and the staff at OMB, who have looked at this since \nputting their budget out, will understand that some of this new money \nwe had to put into the part of this bill that concerns itself with a \nsafe and reliable nuclear stockpile. And remember, Mr. President, every \ntime you say that, you can put a parenthesis in and you can say, \nwithout underground testing, because we have voted not to test \nunderground. If you test, it makes it much easier to determine safety, \nto determine reliability. But we have determined we are not going to do \nthat, and still we are going to spend money and put the finest \nresources in America to work on the science and physics and \ncomputerization part of maintaining this very, very serious and almost \nunbelievable thing called the American nuclear weapons stockpile.\n  My good friend, Senator Reid, has been a marvelous student of this. \nWe have all had to learn together. I have more of a genuine parochial \nreason, because two of the three laboratories frequently called the \nnuclear laboratories--not exactly the right name--are in my State. \nThere is Los Alamos. Everybody knows that is where we did our first \nnuclear weaponry work--atomic weapon work. It was a mountain, but there \nis a city there now. In Albuquerque is Sandia Labs, an engineering \nlaboratory, which is part of this. The third one is in the State of \nCalifornia. The three of them do much in addition to the work on \nnuclear. There are great researchers who are on the cutting edge of \nmuch of the science of the future in terms of energy needs and the \nlike. So that is in this bill.\n  And then, obviously, since it is an energy bill, it has an awful lot \nin it about the energy research and development that is occurring in \nthe Department of Energy. First, let me quickly say that part of this \nis the implementation of energy policy.\n  While we are still waiting around to debate and pass judgment on \nwhether we are going to have some tax incentives that the President \nasked for in terms of developing new and different kinds of energy \ncalled ``renewables,'' or whether or not we are going to decide to open \nup more of the public domain to the development of gas and oil; in this \nbill, we get along with getting some of these things paid for and done, \nwhich everybody knows we should be doing. But it is most interesting--\nand this is an opportunity to speak for a moment about the President's \nenergy policy in one regard. There is a lot said about: what about \nconservation, and what about saving our energy? I am reminded that in \npreparation for this activity, in marking up this bill, I chose to read \nthe President's policy in its entirety. I want to cite one piece, \nbecause there is a lot said about there not being enough conservation \nin this policy, not enough things that push us to conserve and save. \nWell, I have come to the following conclusion, and if I am wrong, \nanybody that would like to read the policy and discuss it, I would be \nglad to do so.\n\n  As this energy policy tells us what we need in the future, up to the \nyear 2020, it says that we could have to produce 77 percent more to \nmeet our needs over this next 20 years--just for reasonable needs. But \nwould you believe that a huge portion of that possible need is \nprojected to come from conservation and saving energy, such that, of \nthe 77 percent, only 29 percent is from new production? So if you do \nthe arithmetic and subtract them, it is pretty obvious that there is a \nvery large amount that is expected by way of either legislation or \nconduct in our country to save and conserve energy, along with \nincreasing production of various types of energy.\n  Let me talk about one. I am very pleased that both Senator Reid and I \nand our staffs worked very hard on what's called renewable energy \nprograms. Because of the Senator's dedication and us working together \non this, we are funding the renewable energy programs at $435 million \nin this bill. That is 16 percent higher than this year. There is no \nquestion that renewable resources can and should play a larger role in \nour energy supply, and we push that or accelerate that in this bill. \nWithin this renewable budget, several programs are slated for major \nincreases, and I am going to tick some of them off.\n  Hydrogen-based technology is up 30 percent over last year. Some \npeople think this whole area of hydrogen-originated energy sources is \none of our real solutions to clean and healthy production of energy \nwithout having any adverse impact on global warming. The research may \nlead to a decrease in the use of petroleum products in transportation.\n  We also have superconductivity and geothermal, both have 20-percent \nincreases. All of these can have an incremental positive impact on \nhelping us meet our energy needs without having a major impact on \nglobal warming in the future.\n  Incidentally, the President has suggested we should move ahead with \nnuclear and not abandon it. Nuclear energy has received a significant \nincrease in this bill. I strongly agree with the President's national \nenergy policy and his recommendations supporting the expansion of \nnuclear energy in the United States.\n  I will state once--and if I have a chance I will do it a number of \ntimes--nuclear power in its current form and future generations, new \ngenerations, of nuclear powerplants do not contribute to global \nwarming. In other words, the future is protected from the global \nwarming pollution that comes from many of our traditional energy \nsources so that the evolution, development, and research in the areas \nof nuclear power can move us ahead in such a way as to provide energy \nfor growth, development, and prosperity for America and for our \nindustrial friends in the world and, yes, indeed, for those countries \nwhich do not yet have much of an economic base.\n  We can produce clean energy for the future. With renewables, nuclear, \nand other forms of energy joining together, we can say to the world: \nYou can grow and prosper. The poor countries will have an equal \nopportunity to do that, and we will not have to reduce growth, we will \nnot have to put on caps, we will just have to use our ingenuity and \nscience better.\n  There are a number of things we did to let America take a good, solid \nlook at what the next generation of nuclear powerplants or even the \nnext one after that might look like and how it will help.\n  I want to share with my friend, Senator Reid, and those who are \npaying attention to what we are doing today, a portion of my comments \ntoday which I choose to call ``Reaching Beyond Kyoto.'' I, frankly, \nbelieve the President of the United States has a rare opportunity to \nlead the world beyond Kyoto.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, I have talked to the President about \nthis very issue. I have suggested it is a rare opportunity for him to \nlead the world in reaching beyond Kyoto, and I will talk about that for \na minute.\n  This is a vision, and part of it is in this bill because this is what \nwe do in this bill. It says that we need to reach beyond the debate \nover Kyoto with a blueprint that provides tools to combat global \nwarming. Further, we should ask the world to join as our partners and \nmove ahead,\n  I am convinced we can have growth and prosperity in America without \nglobal warming. I am equally convinced we can help provide these same \nbenefits for the world. I propose we provide worldwide leadership to \neliminate the threat of global warming by a commitment to prosperity \nand growth through clean energy, and I further propose we accomplish \nthis goal through partnerships with our friends and allies, especially \nthose in developing countries.\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\n  I have specifically urged the President to lead this new initiative \nto accelerate our research and build international partnerships for \njoint development of all clean sources of energy--renewables, clean \nfossil fuels which our distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd, alludes to frequently as it relates to coal--\nnuclear energy, and hydrogen-based fuels.\n\n  As we transition to improved technologies in the future, our partner \nnations will also be building up their energy infrastructure with the \nlatest and cleanest technologies. And, yes, there is no question, then, \nthat we can send a message that the poor countries in the world can \ngrow and prosper. As a matter of fact, they, too, can participate in \nthis abundance of growth and prosperity for their people without \nadversely affecting global warming.\n  Last year's energy and water development bill called for improvements \nin the Federal Government's role in international development, \ndemonstration, and advanced clean energy technologies.\n  With this new bill which is before the Senate, and the President's \npolicy, our Nation is developing a suite of energy supplies that will \nprovide us with clean, reliable, economic energy for the future.\n  I continue to believe we should be looking beyond our own borders. I \nsubmit that we should be seizing every opportunity to help the \ndeveloping nations around the world achieve much higher standards of \nliving. They simply cannot do that without reliable electrical \nsupplies. I believe we can help them with this global approach of \npartnerships around the world to develop this technology and produce \nthe next generation of nuclear powerplants. But we should not start on \nthat path unless we set the goals for achievement of what they will \nlook like, what they will do, and what they will not do.\n  It is the same with clean coal technology: Set the goals and then \nlet's achieve them in this world so we can all grow and prosper. We all \nknow we have an abundance of energy supplies in our country. We have \nnatural gas. And it will make a huge contribution for our country. But \nevery nation needs diverse energy supplies, not a singular reliance on \na single source.\n  Leadership has been shown by Senator Byrd with clean coal \ntechnologies that match this vision very well. Some other nations have \nimmense coal resources. Through this vision, they can benefit by \nSenator Byrd's efforts to advance clean coal technologies. Through this \nbill, we can fund renewables and ask our President to join worldwide \nwith efforts to push renewables even more and to greater ends. And it \nis the same with all of those energies that have no effect, no impact \non global warming.\n  I can say, it may very well be, within a very short period of time, a \nnuclear powerplant will be developed. It will be a small little plant \ninstead of a thousand megawatts. It might be 50 or 100 megawatts. It \nwill be a module. It will be self-contained. It will have no chance of \nhaving a meltdown. Just by the physical facts about its evolution and \ndevelopment it cannot, it will not. We might not have to touch it for \n25 or 30 years.\n  Those are things we can work on as a criteria for development and \ngrowth and then set our great scientists in the private and public \nsector, with others in the world, to achieve this goal. What a great \nopportunity in the midst of a world that is frightened about whether we \ncan grow, whether poor people can get rich, where the poor countries \nhave to remain undeveloped because they cannot contribute to global \nwarming. We will say we can all grow and prosper. America hasn't \nstopped growing and prospering, but we can do it without affecting \nglobal warming if we just say let's take a lead, let's do this, let's \nask our greatest companies, our best laboratories, our greatest \nscientists, led by America, let's put some money in each year in a \nconsortium-type arrangement to get this done.\n  If I sound like I am excited about something, obviously for some of \nyou I have not even yet reached anything like an excited pitch, but in \nany event, I am because I believe it is a rare opportunity to take the \ngenius of science--and I might say, I have a bias and prejudice but I \nthink it will work. I think we have nuclear power for a reason. I don't \nthink we have developed nuclear power to throw it away. I believe we \ncan develop another generation of nuclear power plants that can help \nthis entire world prosper and put global warming behind us.\n\n  Then we can ask, what is next? What have to be next are growth and \nopportunities, and not just for us. We say to the world, let's be free. \nBut, we don't want people to think we are for them being free and poor. \nWe are for them being free and affluent, to grow and have what we have. \nIt cannot be done without better sources of clean energy.\n  I believe this bill has things in it which, if put together by the \nPresident in a partnership arrangement, I think we could see real \ndaylight and perhaps might be able to set some goals.\n  My last comments will be very brief and have to do with national \nsecurity. As I said when I started, what a peculiar bill, energy and \nwater. Who would guess that sandwiched between those two words, energy \nand water, are the U.S. national security interests in nuclear weapons.\n  We have a national policy, voted on this Senate floor on an amendment \nby the distinguished Senator Hatfield from Oregon. We don't test our \nnuclear weapons underground nor do we test them at all. We don't do \nthat anymore. That used to be the easy way. I say that because today it \nlooks easy. That is the way we used to determine reliability and \nsafety. We don't do that anymore. We don't test underground. We have \nsomething to take its place. We have a whole body of science and \ncomputerization that we put together. It is now in the Department of \nEnergy, and it has reached major nuclear laboratories. We fund a \nprogram called science-based stockpile stewardship. Stockpile is the \nnuclear weapons stockpile. We fund a part of the Department of Energy \nthat is called the NNSA. My good friend, Senator Reid, alluded to it \nwhen he spoke of creating this new institution within the Department. \nThe current leader is four-star General Gordon. He's doing a great job \nof pulling together and making sure there is one spokesman worried \nabout the nuclear weapons aspects of the Department of Energy, \nreporting only to the Secretary. In a very real way he's making sure we \ndo a better job with what we spend on this stockpile. Nonetheless, we \nhave to spend money on it. The biggest difference between our budget \nand the President's budget is what to do with replenishing some of the \nphysical facilities that are now old and broken down that are part of \nthis NNSA.\n  This bill says, let's get started in multiyear repair and \nreplenishing of some of the facilities that are nearly 50 years old in \nwhich we ask the world's greatest scientists to work to help keep this \nprogram and do this very difficult job. It will take many years to \nreplenish these physical facilities, these laboratories.\n  In addition, there are specific items such as major improvements in \nthe funding of pit production. You simply must soon have the capability \nto produce plutonium pits for weapons, a capability we lost when Rocky \nFlats was closed in 1989. We had to put extra money in this bill, in \norder to keep that program on the calendar on which it is expected to \nbe. We have put these funds in because we know they are needed. Add it \nall up and we have a very well rounded bill covering mundane things as \nwell as the complex and difficult.\n  In closing, let me say, that as part of this Department of Energy, we \nhave developed some great research laboratories and not just those \ncreated and involved in nuclear work. There are many others that work \non various aspects of research in America, most in the fields of \nenergy, but not all, where some of the very best scientists in the \nworld and some of the very best basic science research activities take \nplace.\n\n  In summary, we think we have a bill that takes care of, as well as \npossible, water resource needs of our country. It takes care of the \nbasic energy needs we can promote through the Energy Department in \nmoving ahead with another generation of nuclear reactors. And it \nencourages more progress on renewables. Through this bill and another \ndealing with cleaning up our coal so we can use it cleanly, we can have \na prosperous future without having a negative impact on global warming \nand the future of our country and the\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\nworld's people. We think we have done that fairly well.\n  We have spent more than the President asked. We hope we will be able \nto explain to the White House and OMB why and how that was done. We \nwill have time after the bill is debated to do that. In the meantime, \nas the amendments come forward, perhaps the White House will have some \nsuggestions. I hope they don't ask us to change our vision. I think the \nvision in this bill is to move ahead with new sources of energy beyond \nKyoto so we can say we are going to do it in a way that everyone will \ngrow and prosper, so the poor can get rich in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. We are on the energy and water bill. I know the Senator \nfrom Arizona wishes to speak.\n  Mr. KYL. I want to take 30 seconds to compliment the Senator from New \nMexico, and then I will ask unanimous consent to speak no more than 5 \nminutes in morning business.\n  Mr. REID. My friend from Oregon also wishes to speak for 20 minutes \nin morning business. I ask that the Senator from Arizona be recognized \nto speak for up to 10 minutes in morning business and the Senator from \nOregon be recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, what are \nyou thinking in terms of the bill?\n  Mr. REID. I will visit with you now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I will not take the full 10 minutes.\n  I take 30 seconds to simply say, Senator Domenici each year has a \nsignificant responsibility, as well as the other Members of the \nsubcommittee on which he sits, to put together a bill for energy and \nwater. As he pointed out, a great deal of the jurisdiction of that \nsubcommittee deals with our nuclear weapons program. Senator Domenici \ndoes not simply put together what he has been told is a good idea. He \nhas taken a career to learn from these laboratories--a couple of which \nhe represents, and the people in those laboratories--what is best in \nour national interests and what needs to done. It is not glorious work \nand there is no big political payoff. Very few people have the \nknowledge he does. He relies on people such as his staff, Clay Sell and \nDr. Peter Lyons, a nuclear physicist from Los Alamos Laboratory, to \nassist him in developing the kind of plans that the Senate then needs \nto act upon, particularly with the comments about the development of \nnuclear energy that will be safe and that we need to promote for this \ncountry.\n  I think he is absolutely right on the mark. I plan to join him in his \nefforts to promote that in the coming months.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I should have mentioned in my remarks, one of the \nSenators who has helped me in the many months that we engaged in trying \nto make the Department of Energy more focused with reference to our \nnuclear weapons problems was the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I \nthank him for that help. We are not over that hurdle yet. Indeed, \nGeneral Gordon and that semiautonomous agency have not been totally \nformulated. They are not grown up yet and are still walking along, \nmaybe comparing it to high school and the eighth grade. They still have \nto get the diploma. This bill should enhance it or give them some of \nthe tools they claim they need.\n  In the meantime, I thank the Senator for observations and comments \nregarding a world beyond Kyoto. Clearly, if we do this right, we can \nhave an abundance of energy and there need be no atmospheric pollution; \nwe can do it another way. Clearly, we can get it done.\n  I thank the Senator for his observation.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona missed my brief statement today \nabout how I had become a late believer in the work that he and Senator \nDomenici had done on the National Nuclear Security Administration. As \nyou may recall, last year I fought that initially. As I said to Senator \nDomenici, I thought it was being done, initially, for reasons other \nthan what it turned out to be. I commend the Senator from Arizona--I \nhave already done that to Senator Domenici--for the great work being \ndone by General Gordon and the people working with him. It certainly \nhas been a step in the right direction.\n  With the deep concern I have with the nuclear arsenal, I think there \nis not anything we could be more devoted to than making sure General \nGordon has enough money and general resources to do what he has to do \nwhich is so important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7678-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7678-S7679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we have seen for the past year a reduction \nin the growth rate of our economy. The world is experiencing a global \neconomic slowdown. The tax cut signed into law in June contained \ncompromises to make the tax cuts in the lowest bracket retroactive to \nJanuary 1. We are also going to begin to see the tax reduction checks \nin the American people's hands by the end of this month. Perhaps there \nhas never been a better-timed tax cut. The dollars we are returning to \nthe taxpayers and the rate cuts that will allow them to keep a little \nmore of their own hard earned salaries will provide some stimulus to \nkeep the economy from falling further behind.\n  I reject the advice of those who say that now is the time for the \ngovernment to retreat and try and take more money out of the American \nworkers' pay envelopes. Nothing could be worse for a weakening economy. \nIn fact, I believe that now is the time to find more ways to encourage \neconomic growth. The tax cut provides some immediate stimulus and in \nthe long-term some ways to keep the economy growing. But we need to \nlook at ways to kick-start the supply side of the economy. One \npossibility is to cut the capital gains tax rates. I will be pursuing \nthis effort in the coming weeks and months. Nothing is more important \nthan to get our economy moving again at full speed.\n  My friend Jack Kemp authored a most interesting and compelling \narticle a couple of weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal. Thirty years \nago when I came to Congress I first met Jack. He was then and continues \nto be a person who is not afraid to challenge the common norms of \neconomic thought. In the 70's Jack led the charge for tax rate cuts to \nget the economy moving. We have too easily forgotten the hopelessness \nthat many Americans felt in the late 1970's facing stagflation with no \nidea of how to turn the flagging U.S. economy around. Now we face a \nproblem of a global slowdown. Jack suggests an answer. Many will try \nand dismiss his proposal. This is a debate that needs to continue.\n  We need to get the American economy running at full speed. The tax \nbill was the first step. Getting the economy back to full growth will \nbe my primary focus.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article by Mr. Kemp be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,  as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 28, 2001]\n\n                   Our Economy Needs a Golden Anchor\n\n                             (By Jack Kemp)\n\n       How many more dashed hopes and false recoveries must we \n     experience before politicians and monetary authorities accept \n     the fact that our inability to manage fiat currencies is \n     causing the global economic slowdown? They keep waiting for \n     interest-rate reductions to kick in, yet more than six months \n     after the Fed began lowering rates the economy continues to \n     weaken. Waiting for the recently enacted tax cuts to provide \n     ``stimulus'' will prove futile as well. The economy does not \n     suffer a lack of consumer demand, and more money in people's \n     pockets will not revive the supply side of the economy.\n\n\n                        unprecedented experiment\n\n       Ronald Reagan once said he knew of no great nation in \n     history that went off the gold standard and remained great. \n     Since Aug. 15, 1971, when the U.S. ceased to redeem dollars \n     held by foreign governments for gold, we have put that thesis \n     to the test. For the first time in human history, not a \n     single major currency in the world was linked to a commodity. \n     Economist Milton Friedman called the situation \n     ``unprecedented'' and said it is ``not a long-term viable \n     alternative.'' ``The world,'' he said, ``needs a long-term \n     anchor of some kind.''\n       In the short term, at least, he was vindicated. In creating \n     a world monetary system\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\n     of floating fiat currencies with the stroke of a pen, \n     President Nixon touched off a world-wide inflation that \n     lasted through the '70s and early '80s.\n       Yet America recovered to preside over the demise of world \n     communism, and overcame the rising inflation and unemployment \n     of ``stagflation'' to enjoy an unparalleled 18-year economic \n     expansion. Today, the U.S. is at the pinnacle of its power \n     and enjoying its greatest prosperity ever.\n       Were Messrs. Reagan and Friedman wrong? I don't think so. \n     If the U.S. has so far come out on top in this experiment, it \n     is only because other countries' economies have suffered even \n     more from floating currencies.\n       Once the U.S. government ceased redeeming gold at $35 an \n     ounce, its price quadrupled on world markets to $140 to \n     reflect the dollar's diminished value. By breaking the gold \n     link, the Nixon economic team forced the unwanted liquidity \n     pouring out of the Fed--which had thus far built up in the \n     Eurodollar market and the portfolios of foreign central \n     banks--to remain inside the U.S. economy where it would \n     manifest itself in price inflation. Robert Mundell was the \n     first to predict, in January 1972, there would soon be a \n     dramatic rise in the price of oil, with general inflation to \n     follow.\n       Where the rest of the economics profession blamed the Arab \n     oil-producing states for quadrupling the oil price in 1973, \n     Mr. Mundell and those supply-siders who followed his \n     intellectual lead knew that gold's quadrupling had led the \n     way. Tax rates rose through ``bracket creep,'' capital \n     formation stopped in its tracks, and it soon took two workers \n     to produce the same income that one had brought home before \n     the experiment. The stagflation that had its roots in leaving \n     the gold standard was compounded when Congress and three \n     different presidents tried to fight it with wage and price \n     controls and high marginal tax rates.\n       But discretionary monetary policy is Janus-faced, and \n     instead of too much liquidity in the world economy we now \n     have too little. Deflation began in 1996 when the Fed \n     tightened monetary policy to combat some inflation it had \n     created attempting to offset the economic drag of the Clinton \n     tax hikes. A rising dollar then caused the dollar pegs of \n     emerging economies to snap, set off the Asian, Brazilian and \n     Russian economic meltdowns, and caused the price of oil and \n     other commodities to collapse. Oil producers took a two-year \n     holiday from drilling, which in turn created an oil shortage \n     and drove energy prices sky high.\n       Now, the energy-price hikes are working their way through \n     the economy and are misconstrued by the Fed as inflation. \n     Once again, central bank errors in the discretionary \n     management of floating fiat currencies have put the entire \n     world economy at risk.\n       The Fed has cut interest rates 275 basis points since the \n     start of the year, but the price of gold is still down to \n     about $272 from $385 in 1996, having fallen $5 yesterday \n     alone on the Fed's announcement that it was lowering the fed \n     funds rate another 25 basis points. Commodity prices are near \n     their lowest levels in 15 years, and the foreign-exchange \n     value of the dollar has risen against all major currencies \n     since the Fed began its interest rate-easing cycle.\n       Without a gold standard, the Fed has no means of \n     determining how much liquidity markets demand, and all it \n     does by targeting interest rates is guess how much liquidity \n     to inject or withdraw to counteract mistakes it made earlier. \n     The Fed may be on its way to mimicking the mistakes the Bank \n     of Japan made when it lowered interest rates to zero, all the \n     while prolonging and deepening Japan's monetary deflation.\n       This is no way to manage a currency. It's obvious that we \n     have accumulated a long series of small deflationary errors \n     by the Fed that are dragging down the U.S. economy and \n     helping depress world commerce. It's time to restore a golden \n     anchor to the dollar before our luck runs out and we suffer a \n     real economic calamity.\n       The Fed may yet get lucky with its rate cuts, although the \n     Bank of Japan never did. The only certain way to end this \n     deflation is to have the Fed stop targeting interest rates \n     and begin targeting gold directly--not by ``fixing'' the \n     price of gold by administrative fiat as some people \n     mistakenly characterize it, but rather by calibrating the \n     level of liquidity in the economy, over which the Fed has \n     exclusive and precise control, to keep the market price of \n     gold stable within a narrow band closer to $325 than $275.\n       There is nothing mysterious about how gold could be used as \n     a reference point or how a new monetary standard for a new \n     millennium would work. It would simply mean the Fed would \n     stop guessing how much liquidity is good for the economy and \n     allow the market to make that decision for it. With the \n     dollar defined in terms of gold and with American citizens \n     free to buy and sell gold at will, the Fed would forget about \n     raising or lowering interest rates and simply add liquidity \n     (buy bonds) when the price of gold tries to fall and subtract \n     liquidity (sell bonds) when it tries to rise. Markets would \n     determine interest rates.\n       The paper dollar would once again be as good as gold--no \n     more, no less. There would be no need for the U.S. government \n     to maintain a large stock of gold or to redeem gold and \n     dollars on demand since people would be free to do so on \n     their own in the marketplace. As long as the Fed calibrated \n     its infusions and withdrawals of liquidity by the market \n     price of gold, the world would be free of monetary inflations \n     and deflations caused by the whims and errors of central bank \n     governors, as was the case for more than 200 years when the \n     private Bank of England managed the pound sterling in exactly \n     that way.\n\n\n                            Nothing Simpler\n\n       The good news is that this could all be done easily, if \n     President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill could work \n     out an accord with Alan Greenspan. That accomplished, I \n     believe Britain would soon follow to make the pound as good \n     as gold and avoid having to adopt a sinking euro.\n       There is nothing simpler than a gold standard, as Alexander \n     Hamilton pointed out when he persuaded the first Congress to \n     adopt one. Just as President Nixon took us off with an \n     executive order, President Bush can put us back on with the \n     stroke of a pen. It would be politically popular, as ordinary \n     people benefit most. At Camp David in 1971, as President \n     Nixon signed the papers, he is reported to have said: ``I \n     don't know why I'm doing this. William Jennings Bryan ran \n     against gold three times and he lost three times.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7679-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7679-S7680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NAZI WAR CRIMINALS RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, last week I introduced a resolution \nthat addresses the United States' use of Nazi war criminals after World \nWar II. The resolution acknowledges the role of the United States in \nharboring Nazi fugitives, commends the Nazi War Criminal Interagency \nWorking Group for serving the public interest by disclosing information \nabout the Nazis, and calls on other governments to release information \npertaining to the assistance these governments provided to Nazis in the \npostwar period.\n  On July 14, 1934, the Reichstag declared the Nazi Party the only \nlegitimate political party in Germany. In one fell swoop, political \ndissent in Germany was quashed and a tragic series of events was set \ninto motion--a series of events that led to the genocide of six million \nJews and five million Gypsies, Poles, Jehovah's Witnesses, political \ndissidents, physically and mentally disabled people, and homosexuals. \nAfter World War II, the international community attempted to come to \nterms with what, by any measure, was a horrific episode in world \nhistory.\n  In October 1945, a tribunal was convened in Nuremberg, Germany, to \nexact justice against the most nefarious Nazi War Criminals, people who \nknowingly and methodically orchestrated the murder of countless \ninnocent people. Some infamous Nazi war criminals were tried and \nconvicted elsewhere, including the infamous Adolph Eichmann, who was \nfound guilty by an Israeli court. Still, many of the perpetrators--war \ncriminals who heeded the call of the Nazi juggernaut--escaped justice. \nSome of those who evaded capture did so with the help of various world \ngovernments, including the United States.\n  It is natural to ask why the United States would help known Nazi war \ncriminals avoid punishment. The United States had just spent four years \nfighting the Nazis at the cost of thousands of young, courageous \nAmerican soldiers. We had just liberated the Nazi death camps, \nwitnessing firsthand the carnage and degradation exacted by the Nazis \non Jews and others. Despite it all, the United States felt compelled to \nhide the very Nazis they had defeated and grant them refuge in the \nUnited States and abroad.\n  The sad fact is that although we had just finished fighting a war of \nenormous proportions, we were entering another war--a cold war that \nwould last for some 50 years. In fighting this war, the United States \nenlisted Nazi fugitives to spy on the Soviet Union.\n  The extent to which the United States used Nazi war criminals for \nintelligence purposes in the postwar years is still being studied. In \nJanuary 1999, the President charged the Nazi War Criminal Records \nInteragency Working Group with the difficult task of locating, \nidentifying, cataloguing, and recommending for declassification \nthousands of formerly classified documents pertaining to the United \nStates' association with Nazi war criminals. In addition to an interim \nreport completed October 1999, in late April 2001, the IWG announced \nthe release of CIA name files referring to specific Nazi War Criminals. \nWhile there is still work to be done, one thing is clear from these \ndocuments: the United States knowingly utilized Nazi war criminals for \nintelligence purposes and,\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\nin some cases, helped them escape justice.\n  The American people deserve a full accounting of the decisions that \nled to the acceptance of Nazi war criminals as employees of the United \nStates government. It also is important that the United States work \nwith other countries to expedite the release of information regarding \nthe use of Nazi war criminals as intelligence operatives. We need to \nlearn more about the Holocaust and its aftermath. The international \ncommunity must learn the lessons of history, so that never again will \nwe face this type of evil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7680-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7680-S7681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SMITHSONIAN BOARD OF REGENTS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

For a decade between 1972 \n     and 1982, Miss d'Harnoncourt served as Curator of 20th \n     Century Art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. A specialist \n     in the art of Marcel Duchamp, she co-organized a major \n     retrospective exhibition in 1973-74, which originated in \n     Philadelphia and traveled to The Museum of Modern Art, New \n     York and The Art Institute of Chicago. Other exhibitions \n     organized or co-organized by Miss d'Harnoncourt include \n     Futurism and the International Avant-Garde (1980), Violet \n     Oaklev (1979), Eight Artists (1978) and John Cage: Score & \n     Prints (1982). During her tenure as curator, she reinstalled \n     the permanent galleries in the wing of the Museum devoted to \n     20th-century art, creating rooms specifically dedicated to \n     the work of Duchamp and the sculpture of Brancusi. During her \n     curatorship the Museum made the commitment to building a \n     substantial contemporary collection, acquiring works by \n     Ellsworth Kelly, Dan Flavin, Brice Marden, Agnes Martin, \n     Claes Oldenburg, Katherine Anne Porter, Dorothea Rockburne, \n     James Rosenquist, and Frank Stella, among others.\n       Director: Projects undertaken by the Museum during Miss \n     d'Harnoncourt's directorship to date include a sequence of \n     major exhibitions originated by Museum curators, such as: Sir \n     Edwin Landseer (1982), The Pennsylvania Germans: A \n     Celebration of Their Arts (1983), Masters of 17th-Century \n     Dutch Genre Painting (1984), Federal Philadelphia (1987), \n     Anselm Kiefer (1988), Workers: The Photographs of Sebastiano \n     Salgado (1993), Japanese Design (1994) major retrospectives \n     of Brancusi (1995) and Cezanne (1996), The Splendor of 18th-\n     Century Rome (2000), Hon'ami Kooetsu (2000) and Van Gogh: \n     Face to Face (2000). She encouraged a series of scholarly \n     publications devoted to the permanent collections: British \n     Paintings (1986), Oriental Carpets (1988), Northern European \n     Paintings (1990), Paintings from Europe and the Americas: A \n     Concise Catalogue (1994), a new Handbook (1995), and a \n     Handbook to the Museum's textile collections (1998).\n       Between 1992 and 1995, in a massive building project \n     undertaken to reinstall all of the Museum's European \n     collections, over 90 galleries were renovated and relit, \n     while thousands of works of art were examined, conserved and \n     placed in fresh contexts. During her tenure as director, \n     appointments to the professional staff include senior \n     curators of Prints, Drawings and Photographs and European \n     Decorative Arts, curators of Indian Art, Prints and \n     Twentieth-Century Art, as well as a Senior Curator of \n     Education, a new Librarian and conservators in the fields of \n     decorative arts, furniture, painting and works on paper. Most \n     recently, following her assumption of additional \n     responsibilities in 1997 upon the retirement of Robert \n     Montgomery Scott as President of the Museum, Miss \n     d'Harnoncourt and the newly appointed Chief Operating Officer \n     led the institution through a long-range planning process \n     with a view to celebrating the Museum's 125th anniversary in \n     the year 2001 with a number of new initiatives.\n       In the year 2000, the Museum acquired a landmark building \n     across the street and embarked upon a comprehensive \n     masterplan for its use and the additional steps necessary to \n     meet the Museum's 25-year requirements for new or renovated \n     space. Twenty galleries for modern and contemporary art were \n     renovated and reopened in the fall of 2000. A capital \n     campaign with a goal of $200 million was formally launched in \n     December 2000, and $100 million was raised by March of 2001.\n       Institutional Boards (Current): Regent of the Smithsonian \n     Institution, Washington, D.C.; Visiting Committee, J.

FORD\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, former Congressman, Vice President and \nPresident Gerald R. Ford turned 88 on July 14. A birthday tribute to \nour 38th President was written by White House correspondent Trude B. \nFeldman for the New York Times Syndicate; and it includes reflections \nby former Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, given to Ms. \nFeldman for Gerald Ford's 80th birthday. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe article be printed in the Record.\n  President Ford was a healing force at a time of much greater \npolitical upheaval than we have today. The lessons to us today are \nthat: disagreements should not become divisive; and political revenge \nis a vicious cycle without winners.\n  Most important, as President Ford reiterates in this interview, is \nthat ``truth is the glue that holds government together--not only our \ngovernment, but civilization itself.''\n  He tells Ms. Feldman, who has also written numerous articles on Mr. \nFord and his family for McCall's Magazine, that his main ambition was \nto become Speaker of the House of Representatives ``because the \nlegislative process interested me and was the kind of challenge I \nenjoyed . . .''\n  Gerald Ford concluded this interview--which I recommend to my \ncolleagues and our staff--with his beliefs that during his 29 months as \nPresident, he had steered the U.S. out of a period of turmoil, making \nit possible to move from despair to a renewed national unity of purpose \nand progress. ``I also reestablished a working relationship between the \nWhite House and Congress, one that had been ruptured,'' he notes. ``All \nthat made an important difference. I consider that to be my greatest \naccomplishment as President.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                Gerald R. Ford At 88: A Birthday Tribute\n\n                         (By Trude B. Feldman)\n\n       On July 14, Gerald R. Ford will celebrate his 88th \n     birthday. Having fully recovered from a stroke last August, \n     the former president says he is now in excellent health--\n     alert, active and keeping up with world affairs.\n       Asked--in a birthday interview--how he feels about turning \n     88, he says: ``Age doesn't bother me. I'm not as mobile as I \n     was 25 years ago, but I feel fortunate to still have my zest \n     for life. I have more enthusiasm now because of the care I \n     take of myself. I follow a good diet, I don't smoke or drink, \n     and I keep busy.''\n       In association with the American Enterprise Institute, one \n     of Washington, D.C.'s leading think tanks, Mr. Ford \n     established--in 1982--the AEI World Forum which he hosts \n     annually in Beaver Creek, Colorado.\n       The forum is a gathering of former and current \n     international world leaders, business and financial \n     executives and government officials who discuss political and \n     economic issues.\n       This year--in late June--the participants included Valery \n     Giscard d'Estaing, former President of France; former Vice \n     President and Premier of the Republic of China, Chan Lien; \n     and Richard Cheney, Vice President of the United States, who \n     was a former Chief of Staff to President Ford and Secretary \n     of Defense in the first Bush administration.\n       On May 21st, at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in \n     Boston, Mass., Mr. Ford was the recipient of the John F. \n     Kennedy Profile In Courage Award. Presented by the former \n     President's daughter, Caroline, and his brother, Senator \n     Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the award cites President Ford's \n     courage in making the controversial decision of conscience to \n     pardon former President Richard M. Nixon.\n       Twenty seven years ago on August 9, 1974, Richard Nixon \n     resigned the presidency of the U.S. and Vice President Ford \n     became the 38th president. A month later (September 8), \n     President Ford granted a ``full, free and absolute pardon'' \n     to Nixon ``for all offenses against the U.S. which he . . . \n     has committed or may have committed or taken part in'' while \n     he was president.\n       Today, Mr. Ford concedes that he did not expect such a \n     ``hostile'' reaction. ``That was one of the greatest \n     disappointments of my presidency,'' he told me. ``Everyone \n     focused on the individual instead of on the problems the \n     nation faced. I thought people would consider Richard Nixon's \n     resignation sufficient punishment, even shame. I expected \n     more forgiveness.''\n       In accepting the Profile In Courage Award, Mr. Ford told \n     members of the Kennedy family and some 250 guests: ``No \n     doubt, arguments over the Nixon pardon will continue for as \n     long as historians relive those tumultuous days. But I'd be \n     less than human if I didn't tell you how profoundly grateful \n     I am for this recognition. The Award Committee has displayed \n     its own brand of courage . . . But here, courage is \n     contagious.\n       ``To know John Kennedy, as I did, was to understand the \n     true meaning of the word. He understood that courage is not \n     something to be gauged in a poll or located in a focus group. \n     No adviser can spin it. No historian can back date it. For, \n     in the age old contest between popularity and principle, only \n     those willing to lose for their convictions are deserving of \n     posterity's approval.''\n       Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg said the award was inspired by \n     her father's Pulitzer Prize winning book, Profiles In Courage \n     (first published in 1955 by Harper & Row) and was \n     ``instituted to celebrate his life and belief that political \n     courage must be valued and honored. And that Gerald Ford had \n     proved that politics can be a noble profession. . . .''\n       Sen. Kennedy said President Ford had ``withstood the heat \n     of controversy and persevered in his beliefs about what was \n     in our country's best interest. History has proved him right.\n       ``At a time of national turmoil, our nation was fortunate \n     that he was prepared to take over the helm of the storm-\n     tossed ship of state. He recognized that the nation had to \n     get on with its business and could not, if there was a \n     continuing effort to prosecute former President Nixon. So \n     President Ford made a tough decision and pardoned him.\n       ``I was one of those who spoke out against his action. But \n     time has a way of clarifying things, and now we see that \n     President Ford was right.''\n       General Alexander M. Haig Jr., Mr. Nixon's White House \n     Chief of Staff, concurs. ``The passage of time has once again \n     favored the truth and Gerald Ford has rightfully emerged as \n     one of our nation's most courageous leaders,'' he told me in \n     an interview, adding:\n       ``Despite the risks, President Ford performed a singular \n     and selfless act of courage. Almost 30 years have passed \n     since ``Watergate'' and the scurrilous accusation that then \n     Vice President Ford had made or considered a secret deal with \n     President Nixon--\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\n     through me--which traded the presidency of the U.S. for the \n     pardon of Richard Nixon.\n       Gen. Haig, also one of Ronald Reagan's Secretaries of \n     State, went on to say that the source of this accusation came \n     from individuals who claimed to be acting in the best \n     interests of President Ford, but, that, actually, it was well \n     recognized at the time that the politics surrounding \n     ``Watergate'' would lead to either the impeachment or the \n     resignation of President Nixon.\n       ``Those who fed the rumors of a deal were actually damaging \n     the reputation, if not the judgment, of our nation's first \n     non-elected president,'' General Haig recalls. ``Having \n     personally informed Vice President Ford of President Nixon's \n     intention to resign, I knew then, and now, that rumors of a \n     deal were wrong-headed or worse. If believed, they would have \n     the consequence of belittling what I have since referred to \n     as a Cincinnatian act of moral courage by President Ford.\n       ``Years later, the Nixon pardon must rank with the most \n     courageous acts of a sitting president. President Ford, \n     almost alone, notwithstanding the advice of some of his most \n     intimate advisors, recognized that the nation could not risk \n     further prolongation of the `Watergate' controversy and that \n     the very effectiveness of his presidency was at stake.''\n       Jack Anderson, long-time columnist for United Features and \n     Washington Editor of Parade Magazine, remembers Gerald Ford \n     from his days in Congress. ``He was never pumped up with self \n     importance,'' Mr. Anderson says. ``Even after he became \n     President, I was able to telephone him, leave a message, and \n     he would return my calls, without a secretary.''\n       Jack Anderson adds: ``Even though I was number one on \n     Richard Nixon's `enemies list,' I agreed with President \n     Ford's pardon of Mr. Nixon because I had learned that he was \n     then in poor psychological condition. . . . It took great \n     political courage to grant the pardon--against public will. \n     So President Ford did what was best for Mr. Nixon and our \n     country rather than what was best for himself. . . .''\n       Cong. Henry A. Waxman, (D. Calif--29th district), ranking \n     Democrat on the Governmental Reform and Oversight Committee \n     and on the Energy and Commerce Committee, remembers that when \n     he first came to Congress in Jan., 1975, Gerald Ford was \n     President of the U.S.\n       ``At the time, I was critical of his pardon of Richard \n     Nixon,'' Rep. Waxman told me. ``But, looking back now, \n     President Ford took the right action for our country, and I \n     believe history will show him as a president who helped bring \n     the country together.''\n       As a freshman Congressman, Gerald Ford was presented with \n     the American Political Science Association's Distinguished \n     Public Service Award by Ambassador Max M. Kampelman, who \n     today recalls Mr. Ford's rise to the top--``where he well \n     served America at a time of crisis . . . and the `Profile In \n     Courage' Award is a late, but well-deserved recognition.''\n       Ambassador Kampelman, currently at the Georgetown \n     University Institute for Study of Diplomacy, was the head of \n     the American delegation to the Conference on Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (1980-3).\n       During our interview at Washington, D.C.'s Willard Inter-\n     Continental Hotel, Mr. Ford was in an expansive mood while \n     reviewing his life's journey. He evaluated his achievements \n     and assessed the setbacks of his time in the Oval Office, and \n     he reflected on the highs and lows of his 53 years in \n     political life.\n       What does Gerald Ford most regret as he looks back over a \n     long and distinguished career?\n       ``Well, I wish I were a better public speaker,'' he allows. \n     ``I would have liked to be able to communicate more \n     effectively. That is so very important.''\n       He also regrets not having fulfilled his ambition of \n     becoming Speaker of the House of Representatives. ``I lost \n     five times,'' he laments. ``There were not, then, enough \n     Republicans in the House. I wanted to be Speaker because the \n     legislative process interested me, and was the kind of \n     challenge I enjoyed. I was never as enthusiastic about being \n     in the executive branch. I even turned down the chance to run \n     for governor of Michigan.''\n       In fact, he had made plans to retire from Congress in \n     January, 1977. But in 1973, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew's \n     legal and campaign finance problems surfaced; and when he was \n     forced to resign, Rep. Ford was selected as vice president.\n       Two years ago at the White House, President William \n     Jefferson Clinton presented Gerald Ford with the Presidential \n     Medal of Freedom (America's highest civilian award) for his \n     legacy of healing and restored hope. ``From his days as a \n     student and athlete, Gerald Ford was destined for \n     leadership,'' Mr. Clinton noted. ``He was an outstanding \n     player on the Michigan football team in a segregated era, and \n     his horror at the discrimination to which one of his \n     teammates was subjected, spawned in him a life-long \n     commitment to equal rights for all people. He represents what \n     is best in public service and what is best about America.\n       ``. . .When steady, trustworthy Gerald Ford left the White \n     House after 895 days, America was stronger, calmer, and more \n     confident . . . more like President Ford himself.''\n       Two months later, (October 1999) in a U.S. Capitol Rotunda \n     ceremony, both Gerald Ford and his wife, Betty, were \n     presented with the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress's \n     highest civilian honor. (He became the first former president \n     to be so honored during his lifetime, and the event marked \n     the first time a president and first lady were honored \n     together.)\n       Cong. Vernon J. Ehlers (R. Mich), who introduced the \n     legislation to award the medals, said they are a token of \n     appreciation from Congress for the former First Couple's \n     years of sacrifice and contributions . . . ``They are living \n     examples of truly great Americans. . . .''\n       Another speaker was President Clinton, who, after lauding \n     Gerald Ford for his achievements, turned to him and revealed: \n     ``When you made your healing decision, you made the Democrats \n     and Liberals angry one day, and you made the Conservatives \n     angry the next day. . . . I was then a young politician \n     trying to get elected to Congress. It was easy for us to \n     criticize you because we were caught up in the moment. You \n     didn't get caught up in the moment . . . and you were right . \n     . . You were right about the controversial decisions you made \n     to keep the country together and I thank you for that.''\n       Donald H. Rumsfeld, U.S. Ambassador to NATO (1973) and one \n     of Mr. Ford's White House Chiefs of Staff and Defense \n     Secretary (1975-1977), who is now again Secretary of Defense, \n     told me that Gerald Ford's basic human decency ``helped to \n     replenish the reservoir of trust for our country and I'm \n     delighted that the enormous contributions he made are being \n     recognized.''\n       After a taste of the presidency, Mr. Ford still does not \n     hide his disappointment at losing the 1976 election to Jimmy \n     Carter. ``As you well know,'' Mr. Ford notes, ``I tried very \n     hard to win that election. That would have given me a chance \n     to expand individual freedom from mass government, mass \n     industry, mass labor, and mass education.''\n       Despite that election, former Presidents Ford and Carter \n     are close friends and co-sponsors of various conferences on \n     world affairs at the Carter Center in Atlanta. And, on the \n     occasion of Gerald Ford's 88th birthday, Jimmy Carter today \n     reflects:\n       ``The recent Profile In Courage Award and the Presidential \n     Medal of Freedom are long overdue recognition of Gerald \n     Ford's importance to our nation. He was a strong leader \n     during a time of great challenge, and his just and noble \n     decisions may well have cost him the election. In the years \n     since then, he and I have worked together on a number of \n     issues. Each time we do so, I am reminded anew of our \n     country's good fortune to have been led by a man of such \n     principled convictions. Not only do we share the special \n     bonds of the presidency, but I am also proud to claim Gerald \n     Ford as my friend.''\n       Eight years ago, for my feature on Gerald Ford's 80th \n     birthday, another former president, Ronald Reagan, who \n     narrowly lost the 1976 presidential nomination to him, told \n     me: ``First, I can tell Jerry that turning 80 doesn't hurt at \n     all. Kidding aside, Jerry is an independent thinker and down \n     to earth. He is not impressed with his own importance. That \n     humility has stood him in good stead.\n       ``He climbed to the top of his profession without wavering \n     from his principles. When respect for government officials \n     had begun to wane, he was, and still is, held in high \n     regard.''\n       For that same birthday tribute, former President Nixon told \n     me that he had met Representative Ford in 1949 when he was \n     sworn in to Congress. ``I was then a representative from \n     California, and for all these years, we remained good \n     friends,'' Mr. Nixon said. ``In an illustrious career, he \n     became an eminent statesman, and as my vice president, he was \n     an asset.\n       ``Because he understood members of Congress, he was able to \n     encourage them, to appeal to their best qualities and to \n     unite them for the common good. He was admired for his \n     decency and his respect for each individual's rights. And so \n     this milestone gives me the chance to express my gratitude to \n     Jerry Ford for all the good he has done for our nation . . \n     .''\n       When Gerald Ford became president, he was faced with an \n     overwhelmingly Democratic Congress. He recalls that he \n     ``struggled repeatedly'' over such issues as government \n     spending, presidential war powers and oversight of the \n     intelligence community. He also advocated reducing the size \n     and role of the federal government through cuts in taxes and \n     spending, paperwork reduction and government deregulation.\n       In foreign affairs, he recalls, his administration \n     emphasized stronger relationships with American allies, \n     encouraged detente with the Soviet Union, and made progress \n     in negotiating with the Soviets on nuclear weapons. With \n     French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, he initiated \n     annual international economic summits of the major developed \n     economic nations. In the face of bitter opposition, President \n     Ford signed the Helsinki Final Act, for the first time giving \n     the issue of human rights a real ``bite'' inside the Soviet \n     bloc, which eventually led directly to Eastern Europe \n     throwing off the shackles of communism. His administration \n     initiated the second Sinai disengagement agreement, further \n     separating Israeli and Egyptian forces and reducing tensions \n     in the Middle East. It also directed the final withdrawal of \n     Americans and refugees from Indochina at the end of the \n     Vietnam War.\n       President Ford recalls that the saddest day of his \n     presidency was April 30, 1975, ``when we had to pull our \n     troops out of Saigon and withdraw from South Vietnam, which \n     soon surrendered to the North Vietnamese.''\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\n       Asked whether foreign affairs is more pressing today than \n     during his White House tenure, he says, ``I don't think it is \n     any more important than when we were faced daily with the \n     nuclear challenge from another superpower--the Soviet Union. \n     Those were tense days.\n       ``Yes, we have problems today in Europe, the Mideast and \n     elsewhere. But they are no more serious than the Cold War \n     days--with all the challenges that then existed.''\n       Mr. Ford points out that President Nixon's skillful \n     maneuvering in the Mideast will go down in the annals of \n     great diplomacy. ``In foreign policy,'' he says, ``Richard \n     Nixon is unequaled by any other American president in this \n     century.''\n       How was the presidency evolved since Gerald Ford left the \n     White House 24\\1/2\\ years ago? ``The office changes with each \n     president,'' he says. ``Each occupant defines the role and \n     his responsibilities. In my case, I tried to make a \n     difference in my leadership.''\n       He went on to say that he learned about leadership and \n     making decisions while serving as an officer in the US Navy \n     during World War II. ``I think,'' he adds, ``I was a better \n     vice president and president because of that military \n     service.''\n       He notes that there is ``a majesty'' to the presidency that \n     inhibits even close friends and heads of state from telling \n     the chief executive what is actually on their minds--\n     especially in the Oval Office.\n       ``You can ask for blunt truth, but the guarded response \n     never varies,'' he says. ``To keep perspective, any president \n     needs to hear straight talk. And he should, at times, come \n     down from the pedestal the office provides.\n       ``I'm still convinced that truth is the glue that holds \n     government together--not only our government, but \n     civilization itself.''\n       From his experiences, he cautions future presidents about \n     general abuse of power and the dangers of over-reliance on \n     staff.\n       At the outset of President Bill Clinton's first term, there \n     was criticism of his staff and operation of his White House. \n     Mr. Ford then expressed sympathy for a president undergoing \n     periods of anxiety and disarray, even turmoil.\n       He noted that he, too, had problems with staff \n     mismanagement. Today, he is still concerned about the image \n     of the presidency, and still concerned that a solution has \n     not been found about overzealous White House employees who \n     are not instructed, from the outset, that they work for the \n     president and for the people--and not the other way around.\n       He maintains that staff assistants are not elected by the \n     people, and that the president himself needs to determine how \n     much trust to invest in his aides. ``Otherwise,'' he \n     emphasizes, ``the ramifications and the consequences of their \n     arrogance and abuse of power--particularly by secondary \n     and lower staff--can be dangerous.''\n       Mr. Ford concurs with one of President Lyndon B. Johnson's \n     press secretaries, George E. Reedy, who wrote in his book, \n     ``The Twilight of the Presidency'': ``Presidents should not \n     hire any assistants under 40 years old who had not suffered \n     any major disappointments in life. When young amateurs find \n     themselves in the West Wing or East Wing of the White House, \n     they begin to think they are little tin gods . . .''\n       In his autobiography, ``A Time to Heal,'' Mr. Ford wrote: \n     ``Reedy had left the White House staff several years before, \n     but he was predicting the climate that had led to \n     `Watergate.' And that is disturbing.''\n       Born in 1913 in Omaha, Nebraska, to Dorothy Gardner and \n     Leslie Lynch King Jr., Gerald Ford was christened Leslie L. \n     King Jr. His parents divorced when he was two years old. He \n     moved with his mother to Grand Rapids, Mich., where she \n     married Gerald Rudolph Ford, who later adopted the child and \n     gave him his name, Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr.\n       If he were able to relive his 88 years, what would he do \n     differently?\n       ``I would make no significant changes,'' he says. ``I've \n     been lucky, both in my personal life and professionally. \n     Along the way I tried to improve myself by learning something \n     new in each of the jobs I held. I've witnessed more than my \n     share of miracles . . . I've witnessed the defeat of Nazi \n     tyranny and the destruction of hateful walls that once \n     divided free men from those enslaved.\n       ``. . . It has been a grand adventure and I have been \n     blessed every step by a loving wife and supportive family.''\n       He says he will never forget one of the family's worst days \n     in the White House . . . six weeks after they moved in, \n     ``Betty received a diagnosis of breast cancer,'' he recalls. \n     ``But her courage in going public with her condition . . . \n     and her candor about her mastectomy increased awareness of \n     the need of examination for early detection, saving countless \n     women's lives.''\n       Six years later (1980), former President and Mrs. Ford \n     dedicated The Betty Ford Diagnostic and Comprehensive Breast \n     Center, in Washington, D.C. (part of Columbia Hospital for \n     Women). The Center's former director, Dr. Katherine Alley, a \n     renowned breast cancer surgeon, says today: ``As one of the \n     first women of note to go public with her cancer diagnosis \n     and treatment, Betty Ford helped women to face the disease \n     more openly and with less fear.''\n       Turning to his philosophy of life, Mr. Ford says: ``I've \n     always been an optimist and still am. Yes, I suffered a few \n     disappointments and defeats, but I tried to forget about \n     those, and keep a positive attitude. When I was in sports and \n     lost a game by error, or in the political arena, when I lost \n     by a narrow margin, no amount of groaning would do any good. \n     So I don't dwell on the past. I learned to move on and look \n     ahead.''\n       Much as he had yearned to be elected president in his own \n     right in 1976, Gerald Ford is confident that history will \n     record that he ``healed America at a very difficult time.''\n       He believes that his presidential leadership for 29 months \n     had steered the U.S. out of that period of turmoil, making it \n     possible to move from despair to a renewed national unity of \n     purpose and progress.\n       ``I also re-established a working relationship between the \n     White House and Congress, one that had been ruptured,'' he \n     concludes. ``All that made an important difference. I \n     consider that to be my greatest accomplishment as president, \n     and I hope historians will record that as my legacy.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7683-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

TURNER\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear friend, James A. Turner of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Jim Turner was a \nman of great courage, intelligence and character. We were friends for \nmore than 40 years. I believe America has lost a great patriot with the \nrecent death of James A. Turner.\n  Born in 1925, Jim grew up on a farm just outside of Tuscaloosa, \nAlabama. As World War II began, Jim left high school to serve his \ncountry. He enlisted in the Marine Corps and served with honor. Indeed, \nhe earned and received the Purple Heart in 1945 on Iwo Jima when a \nmachine gun blinded him during battle.\n  Jim returned to Alabama and in spite of his blindness earned his \nundergraduate degree in 1949. He received his juris doctorate from the \nUniversity of Alabama in 1952. Jim always credited his wife and \nclassmate, Louise, for his success in school. Louise read Jim's \ntextbooks to him so he could keep up with his studies.\n  Following graduation, Louise joined Jim at their law firm, Turner and \nTurner. Today, their son, Don, and their grandson, Brian, also work at \nTurner and Turner. The family law firm has spanned five decades and \ncontinues to thrive in Tuscaloosa.\n  Together, Jim and Louise raised three wonderful sons, Don, Rick and \nGlenn, who have brought them great joy in life. Their grandchildren, \nBrian, Lindsay and Brittany; and great-granddaughter Farris, are \nsources of considerable pride.\n  Jim was active in his community. He was an active member of the \nTuscaloosa Bar Association and also served\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\nas President of the Tuscaloosa Bar Association. His family worshiped at \nUnited Methodist Church in Alberta.\n  We have in recent years heard reference to ``the Greatest \nGeneration.'' Many of us have friends and relatives who have served our \ncountry and earned the right to wear that mantle. However, I know of \nfew men who lived every day of their lives with the valor, courage, and \nlove of country with which Jim Turner lived his entire life.\n  Our country has lost a good man and great lawyer, a devoted husband \nand father, a proud Marine and a loyal American. Words cannot express \nthe respect I have for Jim Turner, nor can they express the sorrow my \nfamily and our community feels since this loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7684-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MORTIMER CAPLIN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man whose \nlifetime record of achievement and service is the embodiment of the \nbest of America. My friend, Mortimer Caplin, has for 6\\1/2\\ decades \nhonorably served his Nation, his community, and our beloved University \nof Virginia, amassing an exemplary record of accomplishment of the \nhighest order. I ask unanimous consent that the following remarks made \nby Robert E. Scott, Dean of the University of Virginia Law School, be \nprinted in the Record. These remarks are part of a speech Dean Scott \nmade during the presentation to Mr. Caplin of The Thomas Jefferson \nFoundation Medal in Law, the University of Virginia's highest honor.\n\n  Remarks of Dean Robert E. Scott Upon the Presentation of the Thomas \nJefferson Foundation Medal in Law to Mortimer M. Caplin, April 12, 2001\n\n       Mr. President, Mr. Rector, and Distinguished Guests: Today \n     is the 10th, and last time I will stand in this glorious \n     space and introduce a recipient of the Jefferson Medal in \n     Law. None of the prior occasions have given me as much joy \n     and pleasure as the duty I discharge today. It is my great \n     honor to present Mortimer M. Caplin, the 2001 recipient of \n     the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Law. Mortimer Caplin \n     represents the very best of the University's aspirations for \n     its own. Some people gain distinction by happenstance, by \n     being in the right place and the right time and then rising \n     to the occasion. Mortimer Caplin's reputation rests on a \n     lifetime of achievement. Throughout the nearly seven decades \n     that he has been associated with the University, he has \n     exemplified a singular constancy of excellence. At every step \n     of the way he has shown how talent, courage, persistence and \n     a commitment to service can combine to inspire and transform \n     us. These are exactly the qualities that Mr. Jefferson \n     exemplified in his own life and wanted his University to \n     embody.\n       Mortimer Caplin was born in New York in 1916. He came to \n     Charlottesville in 1933, graduating from the college in 1937 \n     and the Law School in 1940. As an undergraduate, he not only \n     earned the highest academic honors but excelled at what the \n     University then regarded as the most estimable athletic \n     endeavor its students could undertake, intercollegiate \n     boxing. At the Law School, he displayed the same pattern of \n     remarkable success. He was elected editor-in-chief of the Law \n     Review and went on to serve as law clerk for Judge Armistead \n     Dobie, a former Dean of the Law School who by tradition chose \n     the most outstanding graduate of each class as his assistant.\n       Mort had barely begun his career as a New York lawyer when \n     World War II broke out. In anticipation of the conflict, he \n     already had enlisted in the Navy and took up his commission \n     shortly after Pearl Harbor. Eager for active duty, he \n     requested a transfer out of the stateside intelligence work \n     that was his first assignment. The Navy responded by making \n     him a beachmaster on Omaha Beach during the Normandy \n     invasion. Facing enemy fire, Mort had to make hard choices \n     quickly to ensure that supplies and reinforcements kept \n     coming. When the occasion required it, he used creativity and \n     imagination to cut through bureaucratic impediments to \n     achieving his essential mission. Thus, when a ship's captain \n     refused to beach his vessel at a time when the ammunition it \n     carried was in short supply along the front and no other \n     method of delivering its cargo presented itself, Mort \n     invented a two-star general whose imaginary order got the job \n     done.\n       Mort Caplin returned from the war to New York, but not many \n     years later heard the University's call and answered, joining \n     the Law faculty in 1950. For over a decade he taught federal \n     taxation and constitutional law. During this time he produced \n     important scholarship and excelled in the classroom. Perhaps \n     equally important was the leadership role Mortimer Caplin \n     played at the University and in the Charlottesville \n     community. In 1950 Mort led the Law faculty in its unanimous \n     decision to admit Gregory Swanson to the Law School, the \n     first African-American to enroll at the University. \n     Subsequently, Mort was a central figure in organizing the \n     efforts of the Charlottesville community to circumvent the \n     ``massive resistance'' campaign that Virginia's political \n     leaders had launched at the Supreme Court's desegregation \n     mandate. Mort, along with other law faculty and their spouses \n     worked unceasingly to ensure that neither children nor civil \n     rights suffered during this dark time in Virginia's history.\n       A brilliant and popular professor, Mort Caplin dazzled his \n     students. One who was especially impressed was Robert F. \n     Kennedy, the younger brother of a rising star in the \n     Democratic Party. Several years later, after that rising star \n     had become the President of the United States, John F. \n     Kennedy appointed his brother's former tax professor as \n     United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Mort accepted \n     this challenge with his characteristic energy and good \n     judgment. He led that critically important if sometimes \n     unpopular agency for three years, at a time of significant \n     changes in the United States economy and the tax system. At \n     the end of his term, the Treasury Department granted him the \n     Alexander Hamilton award, the highest possible honor that \n     institution can bestow.\n       Having traveled to Washington, Mort chose to stay. He \n     recognized the need for a first-rate law firm specializing in \n     tax practice and, with Douglas Drysdale, another Virginia \n     alumnus, founded Caplin & Drysdale.\n       Shortly after establishing his law firm, Mort resumed his \n     teaching at the Law School. For more than twenty years he \n     taught advanced courses emphasizing the interplay of tax law \n     and practice. For many students at Virginia, tax law with \n     Mortimer Caplin became a springboard for a career both as \n     public servants and as practitioners in the nation's elite \n     law firms. Mort consistently emphasized the importance of a \n     lawyer's independence and judgment, and preached the central \n     obligation of advancing the public interest while serving \n     one's clients. He sought to lead his students to a life in \n     law that would ennoble and dignify the person living it.\n       During this time of building a prestigious law firm and \n     extending a teaching career, Mort Caplin still found time for \n     significant service to the bar and the general public. He \n     served as President of the Indigent Civil Litigation Fund and \n     on the executive committee of the Washington Lawyers \n     Committee for Civil Rights under Law, on numerous significant \n     committees of the American Bar Association, and various \n     charitable organizations. His service as a trustee of the Law \n     School foundation in particular provided great vision and \n     support during a period of change and growth. In recognition \n     of this service, Mort collected a remarkable number of awards \n     and distinctions, honorary degrees and other testimonials to \n     his generosity and accomplishments.\n       In 1988, at the age of 72, Mort Caplin became a Professor \n     Emeritus of the University. This simply opened a new phase in \n     his astonishing career of service and dedication to this \n     University and to the profession. Still to come was a five-\n     year term on the University's Board of Visitors and exemplary \n     service to the Law School as chair of the executive committee \n     of our recently concluded capital campaign. When we began the \n     Law School campaign in July 1992, the first person I went to \n     see was Mortimer Caplin. When I asked whether he would lead \n     what would become an eight-year fundraising effort. Mort \n     replied simply, ``I'll do it.'' True to his word, he did. By \n     dint of his example and leadership, the Law School recently \n     concluded the most successful campaign in the history of \n     American legal education.\n       Mort Caplin remains to this day a central figure in the \n     governance of the Law School and its guidance into the \n     twenty-first century. He has been a driving force behind the \n     Law School's commitment to a broad public vision, as \n     reflected in our decision to dedicate our Public Service \n     Center in his honor. He, in turn, has honored, elevated, and \n     enriched us along every possible dimension.\n       Mr. President, Mortimer Caplin comes to us today as the \n     embodiment of what Mr. Jefferson envisioned as the best that \n     we Americans have within us. He has lived a life in law as a \n     high calling, one dedicated to advancement of knowledge, \n     service to the nation, husbanding the great resources with \n     which we have been endowed and ensuring that all Americans \n     can take part in our great national banquet and enjoy the \n     opportunities that life in America presents. On behalf of the \n     School of Law and the selection committee, it is my privilege \n     to introduce Mortimer M. Caplin as the 2001 recipient of the \n     Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7684-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7684-S7688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-2802.

A bill to strengthen research conducted by the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my friend and colleague, Senator Carper, which will strengthen the \nuse of science at the Environmental Protection Agency. By improving \nscience at the Agency, we will be improving the framework of our \nregulatory decisions. It is important that these regulations be \neffective, not onerous and inefficient. To make government regulations \nefficient, they must be based on a solid foundation of scientific \nunderstanding and data.\n  Last year, the National Research Council released a report, \n``Strengthening Science at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: \nResearch Management and Peer Review Practices'' which outlined current \npractices at the EPA and made recommendations for improving science \nwithin the agency. The bill we are introducing today, the \n``Environmental Research Enhancement Act,'' builds on the NRC report.\n  When the Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970 by \nPresident Nixon, its mission was set to protect human health and \nsafeguard the environment. In the 1960s, it had become increasingly \nclear that ``we needed to know more about the total environment--land, \nwater, and air.'' The EPA was part of President Nixon's \nreorganizational efforts to effectively ensure the protection, \ndevelopment and enhancement of the total environment.\n  For the EPA to reach this mission, establishing rules and priorities \nfor clean land, air and water require a fundamental understanding of \nthe science behind the real and potential threats to public health and \nthe environment. Unfortunately, many institutions, citizens and groups \nbelieve that science has not always played a significant role in the \ndecision-making process at the EPA.\n  In NRC's report last year, it was concluded that, while the use of \nsound science is one of the Environmental Protection Agency's goals, \nthe EPA needs to change its current structure to allow science to play \na more significant role in decisions made by the Administrator.\n  The legislation we are introducing today looks to address those \nshortcomings at the EPA by implementing portions of the report that \nrequire congressional authorization.\n  Under our bill, a new position, Deputy Administrator for Science and \nTechnology will be established at the EPA. This individual will oversee \nthe Office of Research and Development; the Environmental Information \nAgency; the Science Advisory board; the Science Policy Council; and the \nscientific and technical activities in the regulatory program at the \nEPA. This new position is equal in rank to the current Deputy \nAdministrator and would report directly to the Administrator. The new \nDeputy would be responsible for coordinating scientific research and \napplication between the scientific and regulatory arms of the Agency. \nThis will ensure that sound science is the basis for regulatory \ndecisions. The new Deputy's focus on science could also change how \nenvironmental decisions are made.\n\n  Additionally, the Assistant Administrator for Research and \nDevelopment, currently the top science job at the EPA, will be \nappointed for 6 years versus the current 4 years political appointment. \nHistorically, this position is recognized to be one of the EPA's \nweakest and most transient administrative positions according to NRC's \nreport, even though in my view, the position addresses some of the \nAgency's more important topics. By lengthening the term of this \nAssistant Administrator position and removing it from the realm of \npolitics, I believe there will be more continuity in the scientific \nwork of the Agency across administrations and allow the Assistant\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\nAdministrator to focus on science conducted at the Agency.\n  In 1997, we learned the problems that can arise when sound science is \nnot used in making regulatory decisions. Following EPA's ozone and \nparticulate matter regulations there was great uncertainty on the \nscientific side.\n  When initially releasing the Ozone/PM regulations, the EPA greatly \nover estimated the impacts for both ozone and PM, and they had to \npublicly change their figures later on. Additionally, they selectively \napplied some study results while ignoring others in their calculations. \nFor example, the majority of the health benefits for ozone are based on \none PM study by a Dr. Moogarkar, even though the Agency ignored the PM \nresults of that study because it contradicted their position on PM.\n  The legislation that Senator Carper and I are introducing will ensure \nthat science no longer takes a ``back seat'' at the Environmental \nProtection Agency in terms of policy making. I call on my colleagues to \njoin us in cosponsoring this bill, and I urge speedy consideration of \nthis bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1176\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 2719 South Webster Street in Kokomo, Indiana, as the \n``Elwood Haynes ``Bud'' Hillis Post Office Building''; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \npay tribute to a distinguished Hoosier and tireless public servant, \nformer Congressman Bud Hillis.\n  My colleague, Mr. Bayh, and I are introducing legislation to honor \nCongressman Hillis by naming the Post Office in Kokomo, Indiana the \nElwood Haynes ``Bud'' Hillis Post Office.\n  Congressman Hillis honorably served the people of Indiana's 5th \nDistrict in the House of Representatives from 1971 to 1986. Congressman \nHillis was a fair and reasonable voice on national security, trade, and \nveterans' issues. A graduate of Indiana's Culver Military Academy, he \nenlisted in the Army at the age of 18 and fought in the World War II \nEuropean Theater as an infantryman for 27 months. After leaving active \nduty as a first lieutenant, Bud Hillis attended Indiana University and \nthe Indiana University School of Law. He went on to practice law in \nHoward County, Indiana, and served as Chairman of the county bar \nassociation.\n  Before being elected to Congress in 1970, Congressman Hillis served \ntwo terms in the Indiana House of Representatives.\n  The 1970s and early 1980's were difficult times for many in Indiana's \n5th District. A downturn in the auto industry during the recession \nbrought unemployment in some of the district's more highly \nindustrialized communities to over 15 percent. He founded the \nCongressional Auto Task Force and he helped to round up votes in 1979 \nto pass legislation that I had sponsored here in the Senate to \nguarantee loans to the struggling Chrysler Corporation, an employer of \nmore than 60,000 Hoosiers at the time. In 1983, he worked to protect \nthe auto industry from Japanese imports by extending a voluntary \nrestraint agreement. He was a strong force on the Congressional Steel \nCaucus and served as Vice President of the executive committee.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Congressman Hillis was a \ndependable ally of the Reagan military build-up that helped to bring an \nend to the Cold War. He supported American service men by backing \nenlistment bonuses for military personnel and was a proponent of \nreinstating draft registration, which had ended with the Vietnam War. \nFurther, he was instrumental in development and deployment of the M-1 \ntank and the preservation of Grissom Air Force Reserve Base in Peru, \nIndiana.\n  Congressman Hillis also took a personal interest with the veterans of \nour Nation.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Army to lease land at \nthe Richard B. Russell Dam and Lake Project, South Carolina, to the \nSouth Carolina Department of Commerce, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will provide economic stimulation to one of the poorest counties \nin South Carolina. This legislation will allow the South Carolina \nDepartment of Commerce, SCDOC, to proceed with a project that began \nalmost a decade ago. Well, actually the project began long before that, \nway back when the Army Corps of Engineers built Lake Richard B. Russell \nin 1984.\n  Lake Russell is a 26,000-acre freshwater lake on the South Carolina-\nGeorgia border and was very controversial when originally proposed by \nthe Army Corps of Engineers. Enhancement of economic development in the \nregion was a main selling point of the Corps to overcome State, local \nand environmental objections to the lake. Yet, to date, virtually no \ndevelopment has occurred despite efforts from South Carolina's \nDepartment of Commerce. Today, there is not a single room for rent by \nthe public within sight of, or within reasonable walking distance of, \nthe lake. There is only one gas pump on the entire lake and that is at \na State park.\n  Following the completion of Lake Russell in 1984, the Department of \nCommerce and Abbeville County began a plan for the development of a \nlakefront golf and vacation resort. The Department contracted with a \ndevelopment company in 1997 to develop the project, but in 1998, due to \nfinancial difficulties, construction was suspended and the developer \ndefaulted on its Development Agreement with SCDOC. As a result of this \ndefault, the Commerce Department terminated the agreement and the \nproperty was returned to the State.\n  In January 1999, in an attempt to complete this project, SCDOC \nsolicited proposals from various qualified developers. After \nconsideration of several proposals, a developer was selected that had a \nhistory of successful developments throughout the State of South \nCarolina. However, in order for the project to be successful, changes \nto the current lease have to be made. These changes are reflected by \nthe proposed legislation.\n  When drafting this legislation, I wanted to address several points \nthat may cause concern. First, I wanted to make sure the public had an \nopportunity to be involved throughout the process. Second, I wanted to \nmake sure any additional land that was included in the project would be \nmitigated by providing lands with similar ecological values and \nhabitat. And third, I wanted to ensure that this project would be \neconomically viable. I believe the legislation does this.\n  Like I said, the legislation is simple and will bring economic \ndevelopment to a county that has longed for it. By completing this \nproject, Abbeville County will be able to take advantage of the \neconomic stimulation created by vacationers and tourism from the \nsurrounding major cities, which include Atlanta, Macon, Columbia, \nGreenville, and Augusta. This economic development was promised when \nthe lake was built in 1984 and I believe we should honor our \ncommitment.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7691-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 134--AUTHORIZING THAT THE SENATE OFFICE OF SENATOR \n JOHN D.

Sense of Congress Concerning Coastal Impact \n     Assistance. (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States continues to be reliant on fossil \n     fuels (including crude oil and natural gas) as a source of \n     most of the energy consumed in the country;\n       (2) this reliance is likely to continue for the foreseeable \n     future;\n       (3) about 65 percent of the energy needs of the United \n     States are supplied by oil and natural gas;\n       (4) the United States is becoming increasingly reliant on \n     clean-burning natural gas for electricity generation, home \n     heating and air conditioning, agricultural needs, and \n     essential chemical processes;\n       (5) a large portion of the remaining crude oil and natural \n     gas resources of the country are on Federal land located in \n     the western United States, in Alaska, and off the coastline \n     of the United States;\n       (6) the Gulf of Mexico has proven to be a significant \n     source of oil and natural gas and is predicted to remain a \n     significant source in the immediate future;\n       (7) many States and counties oppose the development of \n     Federal crude oil and natural gas resources within or near \n     the coastline, which opposition results in congressional, \n     Executive, State, or local policies to prevent the \n     development of those resources;\n       (8) actions that prevent the development of certain Federal \n     crude oil and natural gas resources do not lessen the energy \n     needs of the United States or of those States and counties \n     that object to exploration and development for fossil fuels;\n       (9) actions to prevent the development of certain Federal \n     crude oil and natural gas resources focus development \n     pressure on the remaining areas of Federal crude oil and \n     natural gas resources, such as onshore and offshore Alaska, \n     certain onshore areas in the western United States, and the \n     central Gulf of Mexico off the coasts of Alabama, Alaska, \n     Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas;\n       (10) the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources is accompanied by adverse effects on the \n     infrastructure services, public services, and the environment \n     of States, counties, and local communities that host the \n     development of those Federal resources;\n       (11) States, counties, and local communities do not have \n     the power to tax adequately the development of Federal crude \n     oil and natural gas resources, particularly when those \n     development activities occur off the coastline of States that \n     serve as platforms for that development, such as Alabama, \n     Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas;\n       (12) the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), which \n     governs the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources located onshore, provides, outside the budget and \n     appropriations processes of the Federal Government, payments \n     to States in which Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources are located in the amount of 50 percent of the \n     direct revenues received from the Federal Government for \n     those resources; and\n       (13) there is no permanent provision in the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), which \n     governs the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources located offshore, that authorizes the sharing of a \n     portion of the annual revenues generated from Federal \n     offshore crude oil and natural gas resources with adjacent \n     coastal States that--\n       (A) serve as the platform for that development; and\n       (B) suffer adverse effects on the environment and \n     infrastructure of the States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress should provide a significant portion of the Federal \n     offshore mineral revenues to coastal States that permit the \n     development of Federal mineral resources off the coastline, \n     including the States of Alabama, Alaska, Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, and Texas.\n\n                       TITLE II--RELATED AGENCIES\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                             Forest Service\n\n\n

U.S.C. 460l-6a(i)): Provided, That unobligated balances \n     available at the start of fiscal year 2002 shall be displayed \n     by extended budget line item in the fiscal year 2003 budget \n

None of the funds in this Act may be used to \n     support Government-wide administrative functions unless such \n     functions are justified in the budget process and funding is \n     approved by the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations.\n       Sec. 320.

The projects shall \n     emphasize reducing risks to human safety and public health \n     and property and enhancing ecological functions, long-term \n     forest productivity, and biological integrity. The projects \n     may be completed in a subsequent fiscal year.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     exempt any project from any environmental law.\n       Sec. 322. Other than in emergency situations, none of the \n     funds in this Act may be used to operate telephone answering \n     machines during core business hours unless such answering \n     machines include an option that enables callers to reach \n     promptly an individual on-duty with the agency being \n     contacted.\n       Sec. 323. No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised \n     if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised under the \n     transaction evidence appraisal system using domestic Alaska \n     values for western red cedar: Provided, That sales which are \n     deficit when appraised under the transaction evidence \n     appraisal system using domestic Alaska values for western red \n     cedar may be advertised upon receipt of a written request by \n     a prospective, informed bidder, who has the opportunity to \n     review the Forest Service's cruise and harvest cost estimate \n     for that timber. Program accomplishments shall be based on \n     volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2002, the \n     annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity \n     called for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan in \n     sales which are not deficit when appraised under the \n     transaction evidence appraisal system using domestic Alaska \n     values for western red cedar, all of the western red cedar \n     timber from those sales which is surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made available to \n     domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States at \n     prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal \n     year 2002, less than the annual average portion of the \n     decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current \n     Tongass Land Management Plan in sales which are not deficit \n     when appraised under the transaction evidence appraisal \n     system using domestic Alaska values for western red cedar, \n     the volume of western red cedar timber available to domestic \n     processors at prevailing domestic prices in the contiguous 48 \n     United States shall be that volume: (i) which is surplus to \n     the needs of domestic processors in Alaska; and (ii) is that \n     percent of the surplus western red cedar volume determined by \n     calculating the ratio of the total timber volume which has \n     been sold on the Tongass to the annual average portion of the \n     decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current \n     Tongass Land Management Plan. The percentage shall be \n     calculated by Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is \n     sold (for purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' \n     shall mean that the determination of how much western red \n     cedar is eligible for sale to various markets shall be made \n     at the time each sale is awarded). Western red cedar shall be \n     deemed ``surplus to the needs of domestic processors in \n     Alaska'' when the timber sale holder has presented to the \n     Forest Service documentation of the inability to sell western \n     red cedar logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska \n     processors at price equal to or greater than the log selling \n     value stated in the contract.

ROCKEFELLER IV BE USED TO \n                     COLLECT DONATIONS OF CLOTHING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of S. Res. 134, submitted earlier today by \nSenators Rockefeller and Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 134) authorizing that the Senate \n     office of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV be used to collect \n     donations of clothing from July 13, 2001, until July 20, \n     2001, from concerned Members of Congress and staff to assist \n     the West Virginia families suffering from the recent disaster \n     of flooding and storms.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, as you may know, my state of West \nVirginia was ravaged last week by its worst flooding in years. Homes \nwere destroyed, businesses and infrastructure were shut down and, most \ntragically, lives were lost. The outpouring of support thus far has \nbeen truly heartwarming; however, much is still needed in order to \nrebuild our communities. That is why I am asking my colleagues, our \nstaffs, and our friends to support this resolution and to participate \nin a clothing drive that will give aid to the victims of this tragedy. \nI am proud to be joined by our distinguished senior Senator, Robert C. \nByrd, in our effort to help West Virginians. Our drive can only be \nsuccessful if the resolution before us is passed, and if we each give \nwhat we can.\n  Immediately following the floods, I visited some of the areas hardest \nhit. Although I have seen this type of devastation before, I was still \ntaken aback by dissolved roads, collapsed homes, and splintered \nbridges. Fortunately, the clean-up process is already underway as \nfederal disaster relief pours in. Organizations such as the American \nRed Cross and the Salvation Army have provided for residents' most \nimmediate needs, while agencies such as the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, FEMA, begin processing damage claims. Governor Wise \nand state agencies are working hard to reach out to communities \nstruggling to cope with the aftermath of the flooding. Working \ntogether, federal, state, and local officials can begin the crucial \nwork to rebuild our communities.\n  Yet, much remains to be done. Today, Sharon and I will visit more of \nthe state. With us, we will take the prayers and well-wishes we have \nbeen given. We will also present generous donations from corporations \nsuch as the Pepsi Cola Company. While I am in the state, my staff will \norganize a clothing drive to replace some of the items lost in the \nfloods. Clothing of all kinds is needed as residents rebuild their \nhomes and their lives. Many have lost everything and, as they return to \nwork and school, will need the basic items we all take for granted. \nMoreover, as the winter months approach and the season brings rugged \nweather, victims will also find themselves in need of cold-weather \nclothing and shoes. Once the clothing is collected on Capitol Hill, \nUnited Airlines will transport all of the donations to West Virginia \nand the National Guard will help distribute the clothing to families in \nneed. These are just two examples of the generosity displayed by \ncompanies and by individuals who wish to help. Each of them has my deep \ngratitude.\n  Of course, in the rush to move on and rebuild, we cannot forget about \nthose lost. I am enormously sorry for the loss of Bonnie Shumate and \nBradley Jenkins, and my heart goes out to their families and friends. \nThough rebuilding will serve as a challenge for the average West \nVirginian, grieving will, of course, prove far more difficult for the \nShumates and the Jenkins.\n  It has been said that there is light at the end of every tunnel. \nConsidering the awesome amount of support provided to date for the \nflood victims in West Virginia, I would have to agree. Let us continue \nthis support by committing to and participating in a clothing drive for \nthe people affected by the flood. On behalf of the Mountain State, \nthank you.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask consent the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, \nand any statements and supporting documents be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 134) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is located in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7712-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 17, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, let me say I appreciate what the Senator \nfrom Nevada said about the reforms that Senators Domenici, Murkowski, \nand I effectuated with respect to the Department of Energy. It was a \ntime of some confusion, and reasonable people could differ about what \nwe did there. But I think it is working out well. I appreciate that the \nSenator from Nevada is now very much in support of that. Earlier I when \nspoke, I did no use the name of the Senator from Nevada but I did thank \nthe Democratic leadership for moving nominations with such alacrity \nlast week. I think there were 54 nominations and I think I mentioned \nthat I hoped we could continue with that progress during the next \ncouple of weeks. I wanted the Senator from Nevada to know I paid him a \ncompliment today as well.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my colleague, if he will yield, I watched his \nstatement from my office, and I appreciate that very much. I say to my \nfriend from Arizona, it is important we move these nominations. There \nare a few that cause problems, but very few. And you will know about \nthose. The rest of them we need to move forward to have better \ngovernment.\n  I think it is very unfair that the system has become so complicated, \nso burdensome, that we are having trouble getting good people to take \nthese jobs. It is amazing to me the quality of the people who served in \nthe Clinton administration and those who are now\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\nwilling to serve the Bush administration with all they have to go \nthrough.\n  I look forward to working with my friend from Arizona to move as many \nof these as quickly as we can. As I told my friend on Friday, we had \none person with a little problem and we just went around that, took \ncare of everybody else. Even those we have problems with, they deserve \ntheir day in court, so to speak. So I appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from Arizona. I appreciate his cooperation in allowing us to \nhave this bill on the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Madam President, will the Chair advise me when I have gone 5 minutes. \nI do not want to impinge anymore on the time of the Senator from \nOregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7713-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7713-S7718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNITED STATES-CHINA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wanted to speak briefly about the \ndecision made last Friday to hold the next Olympics in Beijing, the \n2008 games. Our Government was not involved in that. It is not a \ngovernment-to-government kind of decision. But I am hopeful the fact \nthat the United States did not, as a nation, weigh in on that \ndecision--I am hopeful that did not send a signal to the leaders in \nBeijing that the U.S. Government either supports what that Chinese \nGovernment leadership does or does not object to many of the things \nwhich are done by that Government that violate human rights and in \nother ways suggest the country of China is not yet willing to join the \nfamily of nations.\n  I wanted to note a few of the activities of this recent Chinese \nGovernment that suggest to me the United States needs to take a very \nfirm position with respect to China. That is why I say I am hopeful \nthis decision that the Olympics go to China not be mistaken for U.S. \nsupport for what China has done.\n  As illustrated in recent press reports, China's bid for that honor \nhas been the subject of much international attention. For example, the \nEuropean Union Parliament recently passed a resolution declaring that \nChina's bid is ``inappropriate'' and that it is ``unsuitable'' for the \nGames due to its ``disastrous record on human rights.''\n  The American government, however, chose to remain neutral on China's \nbid--a decision that I hope will not convey to China's leaders a signal \nthat the United States is willing to blindly tolerate that country's \ncontinuing failure to abide by internationally-recognized norms of \nbehavior. Consider just a few events of recent months:\n  The collision of our reconnaissance plane with a Chinese fighter \njet--the result of a Chinese pilot's aggressive flying.\n  China's detention and interrogation of our plane's crew for nearly \ntwo weeks, and submission of a $1 million bill to the United States.\n  China's detention and arrest of American citizens and permanent \nresidents without clear evidence of wrongdoing or illegal activity--\nincluding Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Li Shaomin, and Tan Guangguang. Li \nShaomin was convicted of espionage on July 14 and reportedly will be \nexpelled from China in the near future.\n  China's systematic torture and murder of hundreds of members of the \nFalun Gong--including the recent deaths of approximately fourteen \npeaceful adherents in a Chinese labor camp.\n  China's hardening of its crackdown on this group--including a new \nlegal directive issued by Chinese judicial authorities on June 10 \nauthorizing courts to prosecute Falun Gong practitioners for \nintentional wounding or murder, or for organizing, encouraging or \nhelping other followers commit suicide or injure themselves. \nAdditionally, it states that followers can be prosecuted if they \nproduce or distribute anti-government materials.\n  China's execution of at least 1,781 persons during the past three \nmonths--more than the total number of executions worldwide over the \npast three years\n  A former Chinese doctor's testimony on June 27 to the House \nInternational Relations Committee that his job required him ``to remove \nskin and corneas from the corpses of over one hundred executed \nprisoners, and, on a couple of occasions, victims of intentionally \nbotched executions.''\n  The Chinese military's ongoing large-scale military exercises in the \nSouth China Sea aimed at preparing that country for an invasion of \nTaiwan.\n  China's shipments to Cuba of arms and explosives, the latest of which \nreportedly occurred in December.\n  China's continuing assistance and provision of military technology to \nrogue regimes, including the case involving the Chinese firm that \nhelped Iraq outfit its air defenses with fiber-optic equipment.\n  China's continuing purchases from Russia of conventional weapons, \nincluding plans to purchase two additional Sovremenny destroyers armed \nwith Sunburn anti-ship cruise missiles.\n\n  There is no doubt that dealing with China will continue to be a \nchallenge.\n  Whatever we do, we have to make sure that we don't send signals to \nChina that we approve of these kinds of actions. Not standing in the \nway of their getting the Olympic games I hope will not send that kind \nof a signal.\n  And there is no alternative. It is the world's most populous nation \n(and biggest potential market); it has the world's largest armed \nforces; and it is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. Its \neconomic and military strength has grown a great deal in recent years, \nand is projected to continue to grow significantly in the coming \ndecades.\n  There are many areas of potential disagreement with other nations, \nsuch as trade policy and human rights violations. But the one source of \npotentially catastrophic consequences is China's insistence that, by \nnegotiation or force, Taiwan must be reunited with the mainland, and \nthat conflict with the United States is inevitable as long as we stand \nin the way of that objective. We cannot ignore this very real and \npotentially dangerous situation. How we deal with it will dictate the \ncourse of history.\n  The United States must develop a more comprehensive and realistic \npolicy toward China, one which promotes good relations while not \nignoring unpleasant exigencies.\n  In March, two days prior to the collision over the South China Sea, I \nspoke on the Senate floor about the challenge of dealing with China's \ngrowing military strength. I discussed in detail China's threatening \nrhetoric aimed at the United States and Taiwan, and warned of that \ncountry's rapid military modernization and buildup. And most \nimportantly, I asked the question: what if China's leaders mean what \nthey say? To assume they do not, particularly in light of the \nprevalence of highly threatening public statements and military \nwritings could mean leaving ourselves deliberately vulnerable to \npotential Chinese aggression, (or impotent to deal with Chinese \naggression against others).\n  China, unfortunately, has not been a very cooperative member of the \ninternational community. Several years ago, at a New Atlantic \nInitiative conference in Prague, I discussed America's role in that \ncommunity and our vision for a world in which the United States could \nwork side-by-side with other democracies, stating,\n\n       If I had to sum up in one sentence the U.S. national \n     interest in the world, I would say that it is promoting the \n     security, well-being, and expansion of the community of \n     nations that respect the democratic rights of their peoples.\n\n  China cannot become a member of this trusted family until there is a \nserious change in the attitude of its leadership. Indeed, China's \nleaders systematically violate the most fundamental rights of the \nChinese people. Moreover, they increasingly lack respect for the \ndemocratic rights of individuals visiting China, including U.S. \ncitizens. The Chinese government seeks to maintain absolute control \nover all domestic political matters. It remains resistant to what it \nconsiders interference in its internal affairs, threatening the use of \nforce, if necessary, to achieve its objectives, including reunification \nwith Taiwan. And China actively pursues foreign policies that risk \ndestabilizing the South China Sea.\n  In the long-term, our goal must be to live in peace and prosperity \nwith the Chinese people; however, to do so requires that we reconcile \nthe different aspirations of our governments. It is clear that many of \nthe Chinese government's goals conflict with American values, and it is \nimportant that we do not to compromise these values in dealing with the \ncommunist regime.\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\n We should, instead, encourage China to adopt a less aggressive and \nless threatening attitude through firm and principled interactions with \nthat country's leaders.\n  Since the formal establishment of the People's Republic of China in \n1949, the United States has purposely remained ambiguous about the \ndegree to which we recognize the governments in Beijing and Taipei. Our \n``One-China'' policy, dating back to the Shanghai Communique of 1972, \nhas served U.S. strategic and economic interests, allowing the United \nStates to peacefully retain ties with China and Taiwan.\n\n  On one subject, however, there should be no ambiguity--U.S. policy in \nthe event China should ever attack democratic Taiwan. That is why I am \npleased that President Bush made very clear to China that the United \nStates will actively resist any such aggression. Yet even those \nmeasures ostensibly intended to eliminate any doubt of our commitment \nto Taiwan have not been so concrete. While we presented Taiwan with an \narms package that will help that island build its defensive forces, the \nUnited States cannot ensure that Taiwan will ever receive the diesel \nsubmarines that were included since we do not build them and it remains \nunclear as to whether another country would be willing to provide a \ndesign for them.\n  Additionally, President Bush chose not to include Aegis destroyers in \nthis arms package, though he reserves the right to sell them in the \nfuture should China continue or increase its belligerent behavior \ntoward Taiwan. In light of China's military exercises in the South \nChina Sea, perhaps now is the time to seriously consider this option.\n  We must be very clear in our own minds about our strategic intentions \nand just as clear in signaling these intentions to China. The object is \nto avoid a situation in which China's leaders miscalculate and are \ntempted to use force against Taiwan in the mistaken belief that they \nwon't meet resistence from the United States.\n  History is replete with examples of ambiguity fostering aggression. \nPerceptions of American ambivalence contributed to North Korea's \ninvasion of South Korea and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, for example.\n  We have also observed instances where conflict never occurred because \nof the resoluteness of our stance. Our unambiguous commitment to \ncontain Soviet expansion and defend our Western European allies during \nthe Cold War enabled Western Europe to escape the grip of communism. \nAnd it led to one of the greatest accomplishments in history: the \nWest's victory without war over the Soviet Empire.\n  There is an old saying that, ``There is nothing wrong with making \nmistakes. Just don't respond with encores.'' Let us not repeat the \nmistake--failing to signal our commitment to defend our friends and our \ninterests--that has many times led the United States to military \nconflict. China should be certain that we will help Taiwan resist any \naggression against it.\n  We should make every effort to work with China, trade with China and \nseek greater understanding of our mutual cultures--while, at the same \ntime, appropriately dealing with all aspects of China's troubling \nbehavior. This offers our greatest hope for maintaining a balanced \nrelationship near-term and helping to bring about change in the \ncommunist regime in the longer term. While reconciling our two very \ndifferent views about the relationship of a nation's people to its \ngovernment requires patience, and even some short-term compromise, the \nUnited States cannot remain true to its fundamental belief in the \nnatural rights of man without promoting respect for human rights, the \nrule of law, and the embrace of democracy by all governments, including \nthe government of China.\n  There are five specific aspects of China's behavior that require a \nstraightforward, firm response from United States: China's \nproliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction; \nits threats and corresponding military buildup opposite Taiwan; its \nthreatening rhetoric and missile buildup aimed at the United States; \nits human rights abuses; and its history of refusing to play by \neconomic rules.\n  China is perhaps the world's worst proliferator of the technology \nused to develop and produce ballistic missiles and weapons of mass \ndestruction. Beijing has sold ballistic missile technology to Iran, \nNorth Korea, Syria, Libya, and Pakistan. It has also sold nuclear \ntechnology to Iran and Pakistan. It has aided Iran's chemical weapons \nprogram and sold that nation advanced cruise missiles. And it has sold \nIraq fiber-optic cables, and assisted with their installation between \nantiaircraft batteries, radar stations, and command centers.\n  Chinese assistance has been vital to the missile and weapons of mass \ndestruction programs in these countries. And because of this \nassistance, the American people and our forces and friends abroad now \nface a much greater threat.\n  The United States needs to impose sanctions on Chinese organizations \nand government entities for their proliferation activities, as required \nby U.S. laws. Sanctions need not be the first or only tool used in the \nfight against proliferation. Nor, however, should this tool grow rusty \nfrom disuse. As the Washington Post noted in an editorial on July 14, \n2000, ``China's continuing assistance to Pakistan's weapons program in \nthe face of so many U.S. efforts to talk Beijing out of it shows the \nlimits of a nonconfrontational approach.'' We must back our frequent \nexpressions of concern with actions if our words are to be perceived as \ncredible.\n  Unfortunately, the United States has all too often sent a signal to \nBeijing that its irresponsible behavior will be tolerated by failing to \nenforce U.S. laws requiring sanctions, or doing so in ways deliberately \ncalculated to undermine the intent of the sanctions. For example, China \ntransferred M-11 missiles and production technology to Pakistan in \nviolation of the Missile Technology Control Regime, despite promising \nto adhere to that agreement. U.S. law requires sanctions to be imposed \non nations that transfer technology regulated by the MTCR. In 1993, the \nClinton Administration imposed sanctions on China's Ministry of Defense \nand eleven Chinese defense and aerospace entities for violations of \nCategory 2 of the MTCR--despite the fact that the M-11 transfers were \nCategory 1 violations--thereby imposing the mildest form of sanctions \npossible. Then, in return for a Chinese promise in October 1994 not to \nexport ``ground-to-ground missiles'' covered by the MTCR, the Clinton \nAdministration waived the sanctions.\n  After the waiver, despite a steady stream of press reports, \nCongressional testimony, and unclassified reports by the intelligence \ncommunity that described China's continued missile assistance to \nPakistan, the Clinton Administration did not impose sanctions as \nrequired by law. Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation \nRobert Einhorn said in Senate testimony in 1997 that sanctions had not \nbeen invoked on China for the sale of M-11s to Pakistan because the \nAdministration's ``. . . level of confidence [was] not sufficient to \ntake a decision that [had] very far-reaching consequences.'' The \nClinton Administration appeared to have purposely set a standard of \nevidence so high that it was unattainable.\n  Madam President, China has promised six times during the past two \ndecades not to transfer missiles and missile technology--in 1988, 1989, \n1991, 1992, 1994, and 2000--and six times has broken its promises \nwithout any consequences. It is no wonder that China does not take \nseriously its obligations.\n  I recently joined several of my colleagues in sending a letter to \nPresident Bush expressing concern about Beijing's continuing \nproliferation activities. The letter states:\n\n       The PRC's most recent missile nonproliferation promise was \n     made on November 21, 2000. China promised not to assist, in \n     any way, any country in the development of ballistic missiles \n     that can be used to deliver nuclear weapons, and to abide by \n     the MTCR. The PRC further pledged to issue export regulations \n     covering dual-use technologies. However, no regulations have \n     been promulgated, and we are concerned that China has \n     continued to transfer missile equipment and technology in \n     contravention of both the MTCR and its November pledge.\n  In return for China's November 2000 pledge, the previous \nadministration ``swept the decks clean,'' sanctioning numerous Chinese \nentities for their activities and subsequently waiving those sanctions. \nAnd again it appears as though China may be continuing to transfer \nmissile equipment and technology. We do not need more empty\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\npromises from China--we need action. It is important that the Bush \nAdministration signal to China by imposing sanctions required by U.S. \nnonproliferation statutes and making them stick that the United States \nwill no longer tolerate that country's irresponsible proliferation \nactivities.\n  In addition to enforcing nonproliferation laws, we should also resist \nefforts to weaken controls on the export of dual-use technologies, \nwhich China can use to further modernize its military, as well as \ntransfer to other countries. In particular, I am concerned that the \nExport Administration Act of 2001 would reduce the ability of the U.S. \ngovernment to maintain effective export controls on such items.\n  An Asian Wall Street Journal op-ed published on March 19 by two \nresearchers at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control described \nhow the Chinese firm that helped Iraq outfit its air defenses with \nfiber-optic equipment has purchased a significant amount of technology \nfrom U.S. firms and is seeking to import more. For example, the op-ed \nindicated that one such firm has applied for an export license to teach \nthis Chinese company how to build high-speed switching and routing \nequipment that will allow communications to be shuttled quickly across \nmultiple transmission lines. The U.S. government should have the \nability to deny exports of dual-use technology to a company such as the \nChinese firm in this case.\n  The second of five areas of concern is China's belligerent behavior \ntoward Taiwan. China is intent on gaining control over that island--by \nforce if necessary--and is taking the necessary military preparations \nthat would enable it to do so. According to an article published in the \nWashington Post on April 27, Wu Xinbo, a professor at Fudan \nUniversity's Center for American Studies in Shanghai, stated:\n\n       At this moment it's very difficult to argue that there's \n     still a high prospect for a peaceful solution of the Taiwan \n     issue . . . From a Chinese perspective there has to be a \n     solution to Taiwan either way, peacefully or with the use of \n     force. Given [the] change in U.S. policy . . . you have to \n     give more weight to the second option.''\n\n  The ``change'' to which he was referring was the U.S. commitment to \ncome to Taiwan's defense articulated by President Bush.\n  China's threats have been backed by rapid efforts to modernize its \nmilitary. The immediate focus of the modernization is to build a \nmilitary force capable of subduing Taiwan swiftly enough to prevent \nAmerican intervention. According to the Department of Defense's Annual \nReport on the Military Power of the People's Republic of China, \nreleased in June 2000, ``A cross-strait conflict between China and \nTaiwan involving the United States has emerged as the dominant scenario \nguiding [the Chinese Army's] force planning, military training, and war \npreparation.''\n  To solidify its ability to launch an attack against Taiwan, China is \nincreasing its force of short-range ballistic missiles opposite the \nisland. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal on April 23, \nU.S. defense officials estimate that China currently has 300 such \nmissiles aimed at the island, and is increasing this number at a rate \nof 50 per year.\n  China is also in the process of modernizing its air force and navy. \nThe Defense Department's June 2000 report predicted that after 2005, \n``. . . if projected trends continue, the balance of air power across \nthe Taiwan Strait could begin to shift in China's favor.'' The same \nreport warned, ``China's submarine fleet could constitute a substantial \nforce capable of controlling sea lanes and mining approaches around \nTaiwan, as well as a growing threat to submarines in the East and South \nChina Seas.''\n  In response to the growing threat and Taiwan's increasing \nvulnerability to an attack, President Bush approved the sale to Taiwan \nof some much-needed defensive military equipment. As noted, however, \nthe sales are limited in practical effect and, in any event, must be \naccompanied by proper training and coordination with the U.S. military \nin order to be useful in conflict.\n  In addition to the Chinese military's investment in hardware, Beijing \nhas increasingly focused on advanced training methods, demonstrating \njoint-service war-fighting skills in its military exercises that are \nsteadily altering the balance of power across the Taiwan Strait. Over \nthe past several years, these exercises have shifted from an \nintimidation tactic to a more serious effort intended to prepare China \nfor an invasion of Taiwan.\n  Beijing's amphibious exercises at Dongshan Island in the Taiwan \nStrait have illustrated this increasing level of sophistication in war-\nfighting tactics and interoperability. A Chinese state-owned newspaper, \nHong Kong Ming Pao, reported on June 1 that China's Central Military \nCommission proposed that these exercises be held near Taiwan ``in order \nto warn the United States and the Taiwan authorities not to play with \nfire over the Taiwan issue.'' Furthermore, according to the same \narticle, ``the main aim of this exercise will be to attack and occupy \nTaiwan's offshore islands and to counterattack U.S. military \nintervention.'' Another article in the state-owned Hong Kong Wen Wei Po \non June 4 stated that the purpose of the exercise ``not only includes \ncapture of [the islands around Taiwan], but also how to tenaciously \ndefend these islands and turn them into wedges for driving into the \nheart of the enemy.''\n  According to an article in the New York Times on July 11, the \nofficial Chinese publication, International Outlook Magazine, described \nin detail these recent ``war games''. The games reportedly occurred in \nthree stages. The first, information warfare, was intended to paralyze \nenemy communications and command systems electronically. The second \ninvolved a joint navy, infantry, and air force landing on Dongshan \nIsland. And the third, according to the Chinese publication, simulated \na ``counterattack against an enemy fleet attempting to intervene in the \nwar.'' It was also reported that this final stage incorporated Russian-\nbought SU-27 fighter aircraft. Thus far, military experts state that \nChina has had difficulty incorporating these aircraft into its arsenal, \nand its ability to do so indicates a significant improvement in its \nability to integrate military operations.\n  Taiwan's war-fighting skills are not nearly as advanced. For over \ntwenty years, the United States has cut Taiwan off from the \nintellectual capital that should accompany the hardware we sell, thus \nreducing the readiness of that island's forces. Our defense officials \nand military personnel need to be able work with their Taiwanese \ncounterparts to ensure that they know how to use the equipment and they \nwill be capable of operating alongside U.S. forces. Increased \ninteraction would better prepare Taiwan's military to defend itself in \nthe event of a Chinese attack, reduce the possibility that the United \nStates would need to become involved in such a conflict, and inevitably \nsave lives.\n  This leads directly to the third area of concern--China's actions \nthat directly threaten America. China's harsh rhetoric aimed at the \nUnited States is accompanied by Beijing's build-up of long-range \nmissiles targeted at our cities, acquisition of anti-ship cruise \nmissiles to counter U.S. carrier battle groups, and development of \ncyberwarfare and anti-satellite capabilities. China also understands \nthe importance of aggressive intelligence operations against the United \nStates.\n  In February 2000, the People's Liberation Army Daily, a state-owned \nnewspaper, warned the United States against intervening in a conflict \nin the Taiwan Strait, stating,\n\n       On the Taiwan issue, it is very likely that the United \n     States will walk to the point where it injures others while \n     ruining itself . . . China is neither Iraq or Yugoslavia . . \n     . it is a country that has certain abilities of launching a \n     strategic counterattack and the capacity of launching a long-\n     distance strike. Probably it is not a wise move to be at war \n     with a country such as China, a point which U.S. policymakers \n     know fairly well also.''\n\n  China is, in fact, continuing to increase its capacity to launch a \nlong-distance strike against the United States. The Defense \nDepartment's report, Proliferation: Threat and Response, states:\n\n       China currently has over 100 nuclear warheads. . . While \n     the ultimate extent of China's strategic modernization is \n     unknown, it is clear that the number, reliability, \n     survivability, and accuracy of Chinese strategic missiles \n     capable of hitting the United States will increase during the \n     next two decades.\n       China currently has about 20 CSS-4 ICBMs with a range of \n     over 13,000 kilometers, which can reach the United States. \n     Some of its ongoing missile modernization programs likely\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\n     will increase the number of Chinese warheads aimed at the \n     United States. For example, Beijing is developing two new \n     road-mobile solid-propellant ICBMs. China has conducted \n     successful flight tests of the DF-31 ICBM in 1999 and 2000; \n     this missile is estimated to have a range of about 8,000 \n     kilometers. Another longer-range mobile ICBM also is under \n     development and likely will be tested within the next several \n     years. It will be targeted primarily against the United \n     States.''\n\n  China's military has also taken steps to improve its capability to \ncounter U.S. carrier battle groups, in response to its encounter with \nthe U.S. Navy in 1996. It has acquired two Sovremenny destroyers from \nRussia armed with Sunburn anti-ship cruise missiles, and according to \nan article in the Washington Times on May 4, plans to purchase two \nmore. These weapons were designed to attack U.S. carriers and Aegis \nships during the Cold War and are a significant improvement to the \nChinese Navy's capabilities in this area.\n  In addition to its buildup of conventional and nuclear weapons, \nChina's military is also placing an emphasis on information warfare, \nincluding computer network attacks and anti-satellite operations. In \nSeptember 2000, the U.S. Navy identified China, among several others, \nas having an acknowledged policy of preparing for cyberwarfare and as \nrapidly developing its capabilities. In fact, an article in the \nPeople's Liberation Army Daily in 1999 stated that the Chinese military \nplanned to elevate information warfare to a separate service on par \nwith its army, navy and air force.\n  Also of great concern is the Chinese military's development of a \nbroad range of counterspace measures, including an anti-satellite \n(ASAT) capability. According to China's Strategic Modernization: \nImplications for the United States, written by Mark Stokes, ``Chinese \nstrategists and engineers perceive U.S. reliance on communications, \nreconnaissance, and navigation satellites as a potential Achilles' \nheel.'' The Defense Department's June 2000 report warned that China may \nalready possess the capability to damage optical sensors on satellites \nand furthermore, that it may have acquired high-energy laser equipment \nand technical assistance that could be used in the development of \nground-based ASAT weapons.\n\n  An article in Jane's Missiles and Rockets on May 1 confirmed the \nDefense Department's warning, stating that China's state-run press \nreports indicate that country is, in fact, developing an ASAT \ncapability. It is currently in the ground-testing phase and will start \nflight testing in 2002.\n  In light of China's threatening rhetoric and its efforts to acquire \nthe capabilities that could allow it to carry out those threats, we \nmust begin to implement a broad range of measures that will safeguard \nour national security.\n  First, we need to develop and deploy a missile defense system to \nprotect ourselves and our allies from an accidental or deliberate \nmissile launch and to eliminate the possibility of blackmail by hostile \npowers. As President Bush recently stated in a speech to the National \nDefense University,\n\n       We must seek security based on more than the grim premise \n     that we can destroy those who seek to destroy us. . . . We \n     need a new framework that allows us to build missile defenses \n     to counter the different threats of today's world. To do so, \n     we must move beyond the constraints of the 30 year old ABM \n     Treaty. This treaty does not recognize the present, or point \n     us in the future. It enshrines the past. No treaty that \n     prevents us from pursuing promising technology to defend \n     ourselves, our friends and our allies is in our interests or \n     in the interests of world peace.\n\n  Second, the United States needs to develop better anti-ship cruise \nmissile defenses. Systems to counter the cruise missile threat have \nlagged behind the level of that threat, despite the fact that, \naccording to the U.S. Navy, over 75 nations possess more than 90 \ndifferent types of anti-ship cruise missiles.\n  We must also prepare for China's potential use of information \nwarfare. It is important that we find ways to protect our computer \nnetworks from hacking, to eliminate future lapses in security, as most \nrecently occurred at Sandia National Laboratory in Mexico. According to \nan article in the Washington Times on March 16, this attack has been \npartially attributed to hackers with links to the Chinese government.\n  The United States should also develop defenses against China's ASAT \nweapons. As the Commission to Assess United States National Security, \nSpace Management and Organization recently concluded:\n\n       The present extent of U.S. dependence on space, the rapid \n     pace at which this dependence is increasing and the \n     vulnerabilities it creates, all demand that U.S. national \n     security space interests be recognized as a top national \n     priority.\n\n  With this goal in mind, Secretary Rumsfeld recently announced a \nreorganization of our Nation's space programs. Moreover, President \nBush, recognizing U.S. reliance on our network of satellites for \ncivilian and military uses, has stressed the need for ``great effort \nand new spending'' to protect our satellites from attack.\n  Of course, our ability to defend against China's increasing military \ncapabilities is largely dependent on our knowledge of their \ndevelopment. We must do a better job of ascertaining Chinese government \nplans and intentions (and proliferation activities) and improve our \ncounterintelligence vis-a-vis China.\n  The fourth area of concern is the Chinese government's deplorable \nhuman rights record that, according to the State Department's Country \nReports on Human Rights Practices, has continued to deteriorate over \nthe past year. The report states:\n\n       The [Chinese] Government continued to commit widespread and \n     well-documented human rights abuses in violation of \n     internationally accepted norms. These abuses stemmed from the \n     authorities' extremely limited tolerance of public dissent \n     aimed at the Government, fear of unrest, and the limited \n     scope or inadequate implementation of laws protecting basic \n     freedoms . . . Abuses included instances of extrajudicial \n     killings, the use of torture, forced confessions, arbitrary \n     arrest and detention, the mistreatment of prisoners, lengthy \n     incommunicado detention, and denial of due process.\n\n  According to an Amnesty International report on June 7, China has \nexecuted at least 1,781 persons during the past 3 months--more than the \ntotal number of executions worldwide over the past 3 years. Moreover, \nthe report indicates that 2,960 people have been sentenced to death in \nChina during this brief time period.\n  What is the significance to the United States of such abuses? First, \nthey are not only directed at Chinese citizens; they are also directed \nat Americans. Second, if China is to become a reliable member of the \ninternational community, it must begin to adhere to accepted norms of \nbehavior. In this regard, China's leaders seem to be oblivious to the \nunderstanding that all people deserve certain basic freedoms and that \nviolation of such fundamental rights is an appropriate concern of the \nUnited States and the world at large. For example, when questioned by \nthe Washington Post about China's detention of several Americans, \nChinese President Jiang Zemin stated, ``. . . the United States is the \nmost developed country in the world in terms of its economy and it \nhigh-tech; its military is also very strong. You have a lot of things \nto occupy yourself with . . . why do you frequently take special \ninterest in cases such as this?''\n  Jiang Zemin's perplexity speaks volumes. Until the Chinese leadership \nunderstands why Americans and most of the rest of the world make such \n``a big deal'' over denial of the rule of law, it will be hard to reach \na reconciliation of our mutual aspirations. For example, the Chinese \ngovernment's continued detention of two American citizens and two U.S. \npermanent residents--Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Li Shaomin, and Tan \nGuangguang--is unacceptable, and should be much more the focus of \nofficial U.S. government attention. One of these individuals, Li \nShaomin was convicted of espionage on July 14 and is expected to be \ndeported from China. With regard to the others, China has failed to \npresent evidence of wrongdoing or illegal activity, or indicate when \ntheir cases might begin to move forward.\n  President Bush addressed China's detention of Americans in a phone \nconversation with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on July 6, making clear \nthat they should be ``treated fairly and returned promptly.'' These \nwords need to be reinforced with actions. While the State Department \nissued a travel advisory in March to American citizens and permanent \nresidents of Chinese descent\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\ntraveling to China who have connections to Taiwan or have openly \ncriticized the Chinese government, we can also deny visas to Chinese \nofficials, seek international sanctions, and continue to link an \nimprovement in human rights to other policies, as we did with the \nSoviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I am concerned that our government's \nneutrality on Beijing's ultimately successful bid to host the 2008 \nOlympic Games may send a signal of U.S. tolerance of China's \ninappropriate behavior. With the Secretary of State visiting China to \nhelp prepare for the President's trip this fall, there is an \nopportunity to reinforce our opposition to the repressive behavior of \nChina's leaders. While some hope otherwise, it seems unlikely that the \nInternational Olympic Committee's choice of Beijing will bring about \npositive change in the communist regime. In fact, I fear that the \ndecision could serve to strengthen the standing of China's communist \nleaders in the world, as the 1936 Games glorified and emboldened Nazi \nGermany.\n  The only hope for a positive result of China hosting the games is a \nconcerted effort by our government, Europeans (and others) and human \nrights groups using the occasion to push China's leaders. The multitude \nof media covering the games can also help.\n  During the 1980's President Reagan was a champion for human rights, \nstanding up for freedom, democracy, and civil society. He passionately \nspoke of American values and universally-recognized rights, and more \nimportantly, backed his words with action. In his 1982 ``Evil Empire'' \nspeech before the British House of Commons, President Reagan stated:\n\n       While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, \n     we must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and \n     to take concrete actions to move toward them. We must be \n     staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole \n     prerogative of a lucky few but the inalienable and universal \n     right of all human beings.\n\n  This is the course we must chart in the coming years. China must \nunderstand that a friendly, productive relationship with the United \nStates can only be based upon mutually shared values. Beijing's human \nrights abuses are anathema to the American people, and relations cannot \nreach their full potential as long as the communist government \ncontinues to violate the most fundamental rights of worship, peaceful \nassembly, and open discourse. A failure to reconcile this most basic \nattitude will result in continued strained relations.\n  The final area of concern is that, in addition to its violation of \nother international norms, China has a history of failing to play by \naccepted economic rules, placing an extensive set of requirements on \ncompanies that wish to do business in China and imposing an array of \ntrade barriers on imports that compete directly with products made by \ndomestic Chinese firms. Such barriers make it difficult for U.S. \ncompanies to penetrate China's market. The result is a surging U.S. \ntrade deficit between us, reaching $85 billion in 2000.\n  On June 1, President Bush submitted to Congress a determination \nextending normal trade relations status to China for another year, \nallowing that country's WTO (World Trade Organization) negotiations to \ncontinue. Not until these negotiations are completed and China has \nacceded to the WTO will the permanent normal trade status approved by \nthe 106th Congress take effect.\n  In June, China took a significant step toward WTO accession by \ncompleting its bilateral WTO agreement with the United States. That \ncountry must now complete bilateral negotiations with Mexico and \nresolve several outstanding issues related to its multilateral \nagreement before its accession package proceeds to the WTO's Working \nParty, and then to the WTO's General Council, for approval.\n  As a member of the WTO, China will be required to play by the same \nrules as all other members. China's membership in this organization has \nthe potential to improve our trading relationship, benefitting many \nAmerican businesses and consumers, as long as China holds to its \nagreements.\n  Finally, we expect that China's accession to the WTO will be \nimmediately followed by Taiwan's accession to this organization. Last \nSeptember, I received a letter from President Clinton that responded to \na letter I sent him in July 2000 (along with 30 other Senators), that \nsought assurances that his Administration remained committed to \nTaiwan's entry to the WTO under terms acceptable to Taiwan. In the \nletter the former President stated that, ``My administration remains \nfirmly committed to the goal of WTO General Council approval of the \naccession packages for China and Taiwan at the same session.'' The \nletter went on to say that ``China has made clear on many occasions, \nand at high levels, that it will not oppose Taiwan's accession to the \nWTO.'' However, the President acknowledged that, ``China did submit \nproposed language to their working party stating that Taiwan is a \nseparate customs territory of China,'' but went on to say that it had \n``advised the Chinese that such language is inappropriate and \nirrelevant to the work of the working party and that we will not accept \nit.''\n\n  Further, in a September 2000 letter to Senators Lott and Daschle, \nPresident Clinton stated:\n\n       . . . I am confident we have a common understanding that \n     both China and Taiwan will be invited to accede to the WTO \n     under the language agreed to in 1992, namely as the Separate \n     Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu \n     (referred to as ``Chinese Taipei\"). The United States will \n     not accept any other outcome.\n\n  We must continue to make clear to China that it would be unacceptable \nto the United States for China to fail to live up to its commitments \nnot to block Taiwan's entry to the WTO as a separate customs territory, \nChinese Taipei, not a customs territory of China.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly recap the concerns I have raised today \nregarding China's proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of \nmass destruction, its threats and military buildup opposite Taiwan and \nthe United States, it human rights abuses, and its history of failing \nto play by accepted economic rules.\n  I believe our policy toward China should be one of strength and \nfirmness, with friendly intentions, but never compromising U.S. \nprinciples. In the long-term, our goal must be to live in peace and \nprosperity with the Chinese people; however, to do so requires that \nChina's leaders begin to alter their behavior. As Robert Kagan and \nWilliam Kristol wrote on April 16 in the Weekly Standard, with regard \nto China's handling of the collision of our reconnaissance plane and \nChina's fighter jet, ``China hands both inside and outside the \ngovernment will argue that this crisis needs to be put behind us so \nthat the U.S.-China relationship can return to normal. It is past time \nfor everyone to wake up to the fact that the Chinese behavior we have \nseen is normal.'' To conduct business as usual with a communist regime \nthat mistreats its people and threatens the security of Americans and \nour allies would be a dereliction of our duty as a world leader. We \nhave no higher obligation than the protection of Americans, and the \nsupport of our friends and allies, including Taiwan, which stands to \nlose the freedoms it has worked so hard to sustain in face of \nresistance from China's communist regime.\n  During his ``Sinews of Peace'' address in 1946, Winston Churchill \nstated,\n\n       Our difficulties and dangers will not be removed by closing \n     our eyes to them. They will not be removed by mere waiting to \n     see what happens; nor will they be removed by a policy of \n     appeasement.\n\n  As it has so often been said, those who ignore history are condemned \nto repeat it. In the face of obvious belligerency and determination to \nimpose a different set of rules by China's leadership, the United \nStates must not repeat the mistakes of the past. We cannot stand idle \nor look away in the face of the Chinese behavior and rhetoric I have \ndiscussed.\n  There is no doubt that China will play a larger role on the world \nstage in the coming years. Our goal must be to ensure that China's \nleaders do not assume that this heightened stature grants them the \nright to attack Taiwan or be a force for belligerency and instability \nin the world.\n  Dealing with China will be a challenge, but America does not fear \nchallenge. Our greatest hope for change remains, as it has always been, \nto stand firmly as a force for peace and progress, and to champion no \nless for\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\nthe people of other countries what we guarantee for our own citizens. I \nam confident that, if we make clear our friendly intentions to China \nand follow through with actions that reinforce our words, Beijing will, \nin time, respond positively, Taiwan will continue to flourish, and \nChina can be welcomed as a peaceful and productive member to the \ncommunity of nations.\n  I express the hope that by holding those games in Beijing, the media, \nhuman rights organizations, and others will work to hold the Chinese \nleadership accountable for what goes on in that nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, tomorrow I intend to introduce bipartisan \nprescription drug legislation with the senior Republican on the Senate \nFinance Committee's Subcommittee on Health, Ms. Olympia Snowe of Maine. \nFor more than 3 years, Senator Snowe and I have teamed up in an effort \nto address this prescription drug issue, of which the Presiding Officer \nis acutely aware. It is one of the most vexing and contentious of all \nissues. We have been trying to address it in a bipartisan fashion. \nPerhaps no issue in the last political campaign generated more \ncontroversy, more attack ads on both sides, and more bitterness rather \nthan thoughtful discussion than the question of prescription drugs for \nseniors.\n  The reason Senator Snowe and I are moving now with the introduction \nof our bipartisan legislation tomorrow is that we are hopeful that when \nthe Senate Finance Committee takes up the prescription drug legislation \nissue at this month, the legislation we have put together can serve as \na template, a beginning, for a bipartisan effort to address this issue.\n  Our legislation marries what I think are the core principles that \nDemocratic Members of this body have advocated with certain key \nprinciples that Republicans have felt very strongly about as well. I \nwant to discuss briefly tonight how our legislation does that.\n  The legislation that I drafted with Senator Snowe, for example, has a \ndefined benefit, which is absolutely key for the Nation's senior \ncitizens. The alternative is what is known as a defined contribution--a \nsort of a voucher which you hand an older person, or a family with sort \nof a wish and a hope that maybe they will get meaningful benefits.\n  What Senator Snowe and I have done--which has been extraordinarily \nimportant to Senator Daschle, and correctly so, in my view--is to make \nsure that under our legislation every senior would get these defined \nbenefits.\n\n  Second, our legislation ensures that the program is inside the \nMedicare Program. It is a part of the Medicare Program because, as the \nPresiding Officer of the Senate knows, the alternative is to in effect \nbegin the privatization of Medicare and the prescription drug benefit. \nIt is essential that this program be an integral part of Medicare. That \nis something that Senator Snowe and I have felt very strongly about.\n  The third part of the legislation ensures that older people will have \nbargaining power to help make prescription drugs in this country more \naffordable. Older people today are in effect hit by a double whammy. \nPrescription drugs are not covered by the Medicare Program, of course, \nand they haven't been since the program began in 1965.\n  When an older person isn't able to afford prescription drugs and has \nno private coverage, when they go to a pharmacy--in effect that senior \ncitizen is subsidizing the person who gets their prescription drugs \nthrough a group plan. An individual who is fortunate enough to have \nbargaining power because they have insurance coverage, in effect is \nsubsidized by the older person who has no coverage at all.\n  Our legislation ensures that older people would have an opportunity \nto have real bargaining power. This is key for the millions of older \npeople who spend well over a third of their income on prescription \ndrugs.\n  Finally, our legislation is voluntary. We want to make sure that the \nmessage goes out far and wide that any older person who is comfortable \nwith their prescription drug coverage today can just keep it and in no \nway would be required or coerced to alter the prescription drug \ncoverage with which they are comfortable. If they have a retirement \npackage, or in some way get this assistance, our legislation would not \nin any way alter what they are receiving.\n  Having had the privilege of working with the Presiding Officer on \nhealth care legislation over the years, I am pleased that I have a \nchance tonight to describe our bipartisan bill with you in the Chair.\n  I think we all understand that there is no one who has studied the \nhealth care system today--not a Democrat or a Republican--if they were \nredesigning Medicare, who wouldn't include a prescription drug benefit.\n  A physician in Washington County in my home State of Oregon wrote me \nnot long ago saying that he put a senior citizen in the hospital for 6 \nweeks because that person couldn't afford their medicine on an \noutpatient basis. Medicare Part A, of course--the hospital portion of \nthe Medicare Program--covers prescription drugs. If the older person \ngoes into the hospital, Medicare Part A will write out that check, no \nquestions asked. Medicare Part B, of course, has no outpatient \nprescription drug benefit.\n  What happened in Washington County, in my home State of Oregon, \nrecently is that the Medicare Program probably paid out $50,000 or \n$60,000 for the costs associated with hospitalizing a patient to get \nprescription drug coverage rather than making this benefit available on \nan outpatient basis the way I and Senator Snowe and the Presiding \nOfficer have sought to do for so many years.\n  Very often, when I am out around the country, people come up to me. \nThey say: Ron, can this country afford prescription drug coverage? We \nare going to have this demographic sunami. Are we going to be able to \nafford to cover all of these older people?\n  I think what we have learned here is that very clearly this country \ncan't afford not to cover prescription drugs. We can't afford to allow \nthe repetition of what happened in Washington County in Oregon and \nacross this country where so many older people could have, with modest \nprescription drug assistance, prevented much more serious \nillnesses. And I could cite one drug after another tonight.\n\n  Strokes are a very important health concern for older people. The \ncost of caring for a person who has had a stroke can be $125,000 or \n$150,000. But we have many drugs available that help prevent strokes \nthat cost $800 or $1,000 a year.\n  So the hour is late, and I am not going to go through one example \nafter another. But I would say, what Senator Snowe and I are trying to \ndo is break the gridlock on this issue. I have been at it for more than \n3 years now with Senator Snowe. We got a majority of the Senate, in the \nlast Congress, to vote for funding a prescription drug program that, \nfrankly, is much broader than what we are talking about now. Senator \nSnowe and I were able to get over 50 Members of the Senate to vote for \na tobacco tax to cover a prescription drug program.\n  We are not talking about that at all here. In the budget resolution \nwe have $300 billion to start a prescription drug program. I believe a \nproperly designed prescription drug program would cause future \nCongresses to make available additional funds to meet this pressing \nneed. The challenge today is to look at some of the sensible ideas that \nSenator Daschle, the majority leader, has advocated, such as a defined \nbenefit, ensuring that the program is inside Medicare, providing \nbargaining power for older people, and marrying the sensible ideas \nSenator Daschle has talked about with some of the Republican ideas that \npromote choice and competition.\n  As I have said to my colleagues on other occasions, we have a \nprecedent for doing that. One of the accomplishments of which I am \nproudest is to have been the sponsor, when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, of the Medigap legislation which really drained the \nswamp of so many questionable private insurers selling senior citizens \npolicies that really were not worth the paper on which they were \nwritten.\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\n  I remember back in the days when I was Co-director of the Oregon Gray \nPanthers, we would visit seniors and they would have a shoe box full of \nthese policies. They would have seven or eight private policies. They, \nin effect, were wasting money on junk that could have been used to meet \ntheir heating bills or their other health needs. We drained that swamp, \nand we did it through a Medigap law, by ensuring that seniors had \nmeaningful choices and strong consumer protections.\n  So we have an example of how you can create choice and alternatives \nand promote competition, and do it in the context of the Medicare \nProgram. You do not have to go out and privatize this program that has \nbeen a lifeline for millions of older people in order to create choice \nand competition. You can do it within the Medicare Program, which is \nwhat I am seeking to do with the senior Senator from Maine, the ranking \nRepublican on the Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, Ms. Olympia \nSnowe.\n  Our hope is that when the Senate Finance Committee gets together this \nmonth, on a bipartisan basis, they will look at our legislation, along \nwith the other very good bills that have been introduced. The senior \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Graham, for example, has talked at length \nwith me about this issue and has a fine bill. I think there are a \nvariety of ways the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of \nSenator Baucus, can take these bills and bring the Finance Committee \nDemocrats and Republicans together and break this gridlock on a vital \nissue.\n  I know of few issues that are more important at this point to \nAmerican families than prescription drugs. I think we all understand \nthat with a well crafted prescription drug program, this country can \ntake a significant step forward towards meaningful Medicare reform.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, the hour is late, and you have been \ngracious to allow me, along with the Democratic leader, this extra \ntime. I intend to keep coming back to this Chamber again and again and \nagain throughout this Congress to, in effect, proselytize--I use that \nword deliberately--with my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, for a \nbipartisan effort on this issue. It has dragged on too long. There has \nbeen too much partisan bickering and squabbling surrounding this issue.\n  I would like to see just a tiny fraction of the millions of dollars \nthat were spent on attack ads during the last political campaign on \nthis issue spent on trying to bring Democrats and Republicans--Members \nof Congress across the political spectrum --together on this issue. \nThat is what older people deserve.\n  Every month that this issue drags on is a month where older people--\nwho are walking an economic tightrope, having to balance their fuel \nneeds against their medical needs--have to worry about how they are \ngoing to pay for their essentials. The Presiding Officer understands \nthat very well. I look forward to working with her and all of our \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/16/senate-section/article/S7719-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
