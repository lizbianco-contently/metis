When we praise You, our minds and hearts are \nopened to Your Spirit, burdens are lifted, problems are resolved, and \nstrength is released. So we join our voices with the Psalmist: ``I will \ntell of all Your marvelous works. I will be glad and rejoice in You; I \nwill sing praise to Your name, O Most High.''--Psalm 9:1-2.\n  We confess that often it is difficult to praise You in troublesome \ntimes and with frustrating people. And yet it is when we deliberately \npraise You for them that we receive fresh inspiration. Help us remember \nwhat You have taught us: Praising You for the most challenging \nsituations and contentious people transforms us and our attitudes as \nwell as them.\n  Give us greater confidence in Your inner working in people and Your \nunseen, but powerful, presence in every situation. Again we join the \nPsalmist, ``Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, our lips \nshall praise You. Thus I will bless You while I live.''--Psalm 63:3-4a. \nThis is a day to praise You, O Lord! Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/13/senate-section/article/S675-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Jon S.

Under the previous order, the hour \nof 9:40 a.m. having arrived, there will now be a total of 10 minutes \ndebate equally divided on the Conrad amendment No. 2857 and the Kyl \namendment No. 2850.\n\n[[Page S676]]\n\n  Who yields time? The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if the Chair would alert me when I have \nused 4 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Conrad amendment states the following:\n\n       Since both political parties have pledged not to use Social \n     Security surplus funds by spending them for other purposes, \n     and since under the administration's fiscal year 2003 budget \n     the Federal Government is projected to spend Social Security \n     surplus funds for other purposes in each of the next 10 \n     years, and since permanent extension of the inheritance tax \n     repeal would cost, according to the administration's own \n     estimate, approximately $104 billion over the next 10 years, \n     all of which would further reduce the Social Security \n     surplus, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that no \n     Social Security surplus funds should be used to pay to make \n     currently scheduled tax cuts permanent or for wasteful \n     spending.\n\n  Here is where we are. There are no surpluses left. This chart shows, \nfrom 1992 to 2012, the fiscal condition of the country. It shows that, \nwhile we were able to avoid using Social Security funds or most of the \nSocial Security funds for 4 years, we have now gone back to the old, \nbad ways of taking every dime of Social Security funds for other \npurposes--for the President's tax cuts and for other spending \npriorities.\n  This is something we all pledged not to do. It is not just in the \ncontext of the economic downturn and the war. It is a condition that \nwill confront us the entire rest of this decade, as this chart shows.\n  Where did the money go? The Congressional Budget Office tells us over \nthe 10-year period 42 percent of the reason for the return to deficits \nis the tax cut the President proposed and pushed through Congress last \nyear; 23 percent is a result of the economic downturn; 18 percent \nresults from the additional defense and homeland security costs \nnecessitated by our response to the attack on our country; 17 percent \ncame about as a result of technical changes, largely underestimations \nof the cost of Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n  Last year we were told we would have $2.7 trillion of non-trust-fund \nsurpluses over the next decade. That is where the President's tax came \nfrom. Now that entire projected surplus is gone, and what we are left \nwith is deficits of $2.2 trillion--every dime of it being financed by \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds under the President's \nproposal.\n  Last year we were told we would be paying down $2 trillion of debt in \nthe next 10 years. Now the administration informs us that will be only \n$521 billion.\n  The consequence of more debt is that we will be paying $1 trillion \nmore in interest costs than we were told last year. That means $1 \ntrillion not available to improve the defense of the country or to \nstrengthen homeland security or to pay down the debt.\n  Now the Senator from Arizona comes and says we ought to dig the hole \ndeeper. The Senator from Arizona says: We ought to make permanent the \nestate tax elimination that was part of the tax bill last year. That \nwould cost $104 billion for the rest of this decade, and over the next \ndecade it would cost $800 billion, right at the time the baby boomers \nbegin retiring in large numbers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is where we are headed. In 2016, the \nSocial Security trust funds turn cash negative. Then these surpluses \nthat are being used to pay for tax cuts and other expenses of \nGovernment are going to vanish, and instead we will have massive \ndeficits.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Conrad amendment, to say no to \nmaking permanent tax cuts that would be financed out of the Social \nSecurity trust funds. Every Member, virtually every Member, has pledged \nnot to do that. This is the time to reaffirm that commitment to the \nintegrity of the trust funds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the problem with the argument of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota is that there is not one shred of truth to it. It is \nabsolutely false to contend that we are going to be spending Social \nSecurity surplus funds on ``permanentizing'' the repeal of the death \ntax. It is simply false.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the budget estimates \nfrom President Bush's 2003 budget submission which demonstrates this \nfact.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            BUDGET ESTIMATES--PRESIDENT BUSH'S 2003 BUDGET SUBMISSION\n                                            [In billions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   2008   2009   2010   2011    2012   2003-2012\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline non-social security surplus............................     17     51     99     199     395       463\nEffect of extending death tax repeal............................     -3     -3     -4     -25     -61      -104\nResulting non-social security surplus...........................     14     48     95     174     334       359\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: President's 2003 budget, OMB.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what this shows is that during the period of \ntime we are talking about, we are going to have a non-Social Security \nsurplus of almost a half trillion dollars, $463 billion to be exact.\n  The Senator from North Dakota can't have it both ways. In his \nresolution he uses these statistics to calculate how much a permanent \nrepeal of the death tax is going to cost and says it is $104 billion \nover 10 years. That is what the budget says. But you can't use that \nstatistic and then ignore the other half of the equation, which is that \nduring the same period of time we will have a surplus of $463 billion. \nThat doesn't count any of the Social Security surplus.\n  If you subtract 104 from 463, you are not even close to getting to \nthe Social Security surplus. You still have a significant $359 billion \nsurplus, plus Social Security.\n  I ask my colleague this: I would be happy to support his resolution \nif he would be willing to drop the clause that says it is going to cost \n$104 billion over the next 10 years, all of which would further reduce \nthe Social Security surplus, since that is a false statement, and also \nif he would drop the sentence ``Under the administration's fiscal \nbudget, the Federal Government is projected to spend the Social \nSecurity surplus for other purposes in each of the next 10 years,'' \nbecause that also is demonstrably false under the President's budget \nsubmission. Would the Senator from North Dakota be willing to drop \nthose provisions of his amendment, in which case I would be happy to \nsupport it and urge my colleagues to do the same?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have no intention of dropping those statements which \naccurately reflect precisely what the President's budget----\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator from North Dakota is not willing to amend his \nresolution, then I will have to urge my colleagues not only to oppose \nhis resolution, because it is simply false in its recitations and is an \ninaccurate portrayal of what we are going to be doing, but, secondly, \nit totally misrepresents the effect of our resolution, our sense of the \nSenate which is very straightforward.\n  It says: We voted to repeal the death tax. Let's make that permanent. \nLet's not try to play games with the American people and say we did \nsomething which we all know is only going to be in effect for 1 year \nafter which it sunsets.\n  I defer to my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. On the other side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Eight seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl-\nNickles-Gramm-Sessions amendment to make the death tax repeal \npermanent. To say we are going to reduce the death tax for the next 9 \nyears, have it go to zero in the year 2010, and then in the year 2011 \nwe are going to have a big increase and go back to death tax rates of \n50 or 60 percent is absurd. We need to make it permanent.\n  This is a sense of the Senate that says it should be permanent. I \nbelieve there is a competing resolution offered by my colleague that \nsays: Wait a minute. This is going to take Social Security money. That \nis not correct. My colleague is entitled to his own\n\n[[Page S677]]\n\nopinion. He is not entitled to his own facts. The facts are projected \nby OMB.\n  The administration's estimate by OMB is that we are going to have a \n$99 billion surplus in the year 2010, $199 billion in the year 2011, \nand $395 billion in 2012. That is not counting Social Security. That is \nover and above Social Security. Those are the administration's \nestimates. So we ought to be factual. I don't mind the ``therefore, it \nis the sense of the Senate that the Social Security surplus funds \nshould not be used to make currently scheduled tax cuts permanent or \nfor wasteful spending.'' Who is for wasteful spending? The part of this \nthat says the $110 billion would be used to reduce Social Security is \nnot factual.\n  You should not be using a death tax to pay for Social Security in the \nfirst place. But it is not in this resolution or in the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from Arizona.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's do something for agriculture that would \nbe positive and repeal the death tax. Talk to your farmers and ranchers \nand small businesspeople. Is there something you can do to help them? \nYes, repeal the death tax. The Government should not take one-half of \nsomebody's property just because they die. Let's make the death tax \nrepeal permanent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Kyl talks about the budget \nbaseline. He is not talking about the President's budget. I submit the \nPresident's budget that shows clearly it will be raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund by $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years, and add to \nit, if we pass the Kyl amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the question is on agreeing to the Conrad amendment No. \n2857.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2851, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes debate prior to a vote in relation to the Domenici amendment, \nNo. 2851, as modified. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute in favor of the amendment \nto myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Domenici amendment is a straightforward \nand simple amendment. It says, if we are going to have a dairy support \nprogram in the country, it should be fair and equitable for all \ndairymen. Currently, the bill provides for $2 billion, split 25 percent \nfor New England, although New England provides only 18 percent of the \nmilk. There are other inequities throughout. The Domenici amendment \nsimply says treat everybody the same throughout the country.\n  It likewise does away with a lot of bureaucratic, complex maneuvers \nin terms of trying to compute this formula, changing it to a \nstraightforward, once-a-year payment, the same for every dairyman. \nBecause of the equity of the amendment and its simplicity, I commend \nthe amendment to Senators and ask for their vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Domenici amendment is a reflection of \nfailed policies. What it basically says is you pay dairy farmers when \nmarkets are good. But when the markets are bad, as Senator Landrieu has \npointed out time and time again, there is too little help for our dairy \nfarmers. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  Second, we have a balanced dairy program in the bill, carefully \ncrafted, so that no parts of the country are discriminated against. \nWhat the Domenici amendment does is it upsets that. It will foster \nregional fights again and again and again in the future. We do not want \nthat. We have it carefully crafted in this bill.\n  Third, we just overwhelmingly voted for payment limitations, but in \nthe Domenici amendment, no matter how\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\nbig you are, you can get more and more payments. There is no payment \nlimitation whatsoever, no matter the size of the dairy operation.\n  For those three reasons, I believe the Senate should turn down the \nDomenici amendment and keep the underlying bill that is fair to the \nwhole country.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the dairy \namendment by my friend and colleague, Senator Domenici. I do believe \nthis amendment is an improvement to the dairy provision in the Daschle/\nHarkin substitute the Senate is now considering. I urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment.\n  I believe a market-oriented approach is the right approach for \nnational dairy policy. The existing price support program and the \nfederal milk marketing orders have served the producers and consumers \nfor many years and I am pleased the farm bill extends the price support \nprogram until 2006.\n  The Dashle-Harkin substitute creates a new $2 billion federal dairy \npayment scheme. Mr. President, the independent Food and Agricultural \nPolicy Research Institute has analyzed the dairy provisions in the \nsubstitute. The analysis shows that during the five years of this farm \nbill, the new federal payments will encourage overproduction and drive \ndown market prices. For the first two years of the farm bill, producer \nincome is up because of the federal payments. But by the third year, \nthe federal payments drop off dramatically and producers are actually \nworse off for the final two years of the farm bill. Moreover, the \nmarket prices for milk used for cheese, butter, and powdered milk are \nlower every year.\n  I don't believe the nation will be well served by the new dairy \npayment scheme in the Daschle/Harkin substitute. That's why I proposed \nan amendment last month with Senator Crapo to eliminate the new dairy \npayment program. Our amendment failed on a vote of 51 to 47.\n  Though I do not support creating any new dairy payment program, I \nsupport this modest amendment because it recognizes the fact that the \ndairy industry in America has become one national market. Today, milk \nand milk products are transported long distances economically to meet \nthe needs of consumers in every state. Mr. President, competition \nencourages efficiency and consumers benefit from national markets.\n  Unfortunately, the bill as it now is divides the country into two \nmarkets. One for 12 Northeast States where producers receive one \nfederal payment for their milk and another one for producers in the \nother States with a different federal payment. No other agricultural \ncommodity is treated this way in this farm bill. Producers in the 12 \nStates will receive 25 percent of the federal payments, though they \nproduce less than 18 percent of the nation's milk. Moreover, farmers in \nthe 12 States are guaranteed a payment of nearly $17 dollars per \nhundredweight, while payments elsewhere are based on a fraction of the \nmarket rates and undoubtedly will be substantially lower. This \namendment combines the two regions and treats producers in every State \nequally.\n  Another concern I have with the underlying language is that it is not \nfair to all farmers. Federal payments would be capped at 8 million \npounds, which will put producers in New Mexico at a serious \ndisadvantage in marketing their milk. Because of the cap, producers in \nNew Mexico would receive an average of less than 20 cents per \nhundredweight for their milk--48th out of the 50 States. Only farmers \nin Arizona and Wyoming would do worse than New Mexico. Under our \namendment, all producers are paid at the same rate.\n\n  Finally, we have not fully considered the boundary effects of the new \ndairy payment scheme. What's going to happen to producers in States \nlike Ohio and Virginia, which border the 12-State region? Will the \nhigher federal payment to producers inside the region hurt the \nproducers just outside the region? Under our amendment, there are no \nboundary effects because there is only a single, nation-wide payment \nrate.\n  New Mexico has one of the nation's fastest growing dairy industries, \nmore than tripling in the past 10 years. In 2001, New Mexico moved up \nfrom the tenth to the eighth largest dairy producing State. More \nrecently New Mexico has moved into seventh place. A recent study by Dr. \nMichael Looper of New Mexico State University showed the dairy industry \npayroll in New Mexico in 2000 was $25 million per year and the total \nannual economic impact in the State was $1.6 billion. In Chavez County \nalone, the economic impact of milk production was a whopping $527 \nmillion per year. Dairy is now a critical element of my State's \neconomy, especially in rural areas. I cannot support any new federal \nprogram that could endanger New Mexico's vibrant dairy industry.\n  New Mexico tends to have large, efficient dairies, which are the big \nlosers under the current dairy proposal. These are family-owned dairies \nin rural areas--just like in the other States. They are bigger because \nNew Mexico has the land and resources to support larger dairies. This \namendment is good for the diary farmers in New Mexico and a positive \nimprovement to the underlying bill because it treats farmers in every \nState equally.\n  I believe we should work toward a balanced national dairy policy that \nis fair to all farmers, not one that pits one State against another and \nlarge dairies against small producers.\n  I hope the Senate will soon complete work on this farm bill and I \nlook forward to working with Chairman Harkin to further improve the \ndairy programs as the bill moves to conference. I do believe this \namendment is a step in the right direction\n  I commend Senator Domenici for his amendment and urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I spoke on the floor in December about \nhow devastating the original farm bill would have been to the \nCalifornia diary industry. And I have said California cannot be left \nout of any dairy equation.\n  California is the largest dairy State in the nation. Last year, \nCalifornia dairy farmers produced 32.2 billion pounds of milk--over 19 \npercent of the nation's supply. With over 2,100 dairy farms in the \nstate, California leads the Nation in total number of milk cows at \napproximately 1.5 million. The original bill agreed to in the \nAgriculture Committee would have cost California dairy farmers $1.5 \nbillion over 9 years and driven up prices for consumers by $1.5 billion \nover 9 years.\n  The bill on the floor, however, will hold California harmless. While \nit is difficult to project exactly how much income California dairy \nfarmers will receive, I believe that by supporting the dairy language \nin the farm bill, an even better result can be achieved for \nCalifornia's dairy farmers. I wish to thank a number of Senators for \nworking together to find a way that the California dairy industry can \nbe held harmless by the dairy provisions in the farm bill.\n  While the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico might seem \nlike a better deal for California than what has been agreed to in the \nfarm bill, I believe the California dairy industry will be better off \nin the long run if I continue to support the careful balance achieved \nduring the farm bill debate in December. In theory, the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico would be good for California \nbecause there are no caps, or limitations, on the size of the dairies \nthat will qualify for payments.\n  However, the California dairy industry is at the point where they \nbelieve, like many other farm groups, that we need to get a farm bill \npassed in the Senate and get to conference. Voting against the Domenici \namendment will allow us to pass a bill. A vote for the amendment will \nbring it down. I will keep a close eye on the conference negotiations \nand expect California to continue to be held harmless, or made better \noff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to table the Domenici amendment. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2852\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Kerry-Snowe \namendment No. 2852.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am delighted to cosponsor Senator Kerry's \nimportant amendment which would provide necessary assistance to a \ncollapsing commercial groundfish fishery. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting it.\n  This amendment addresses a very serious problem facing the Northeast, \na collapse of its groundfish fishery. This fishery provided over 80 \nmillion pounds of food for our Nation last year. This collapse is \ncomparable to a crop failure and is equally deserving of our \nassistance.\n  The Federal Government has issued three times the number of permits \nas the fishery can sustain. The fishermen are now being held \naccountable for the government's actions and subjected to draconian \nmanagement measures as a result. We need to help them permanently \nremove some of this extra capacity.\n  In particular, the fishermen who rely on catching cod and other \ngroundfish are in need of assistance. This amendment provides $10 \nmillion in disaster assistance for these commercial fisherman. It will \nbring much needed help to those fishermen who need and more importantly \nwant help.\n  As a voluntary program, this amendment will extend a helping hand to \nthose fishermen who wish to make a transition and permanently exit the \nmultispecies groundfish fishery in the Northeast by giving the Federal \nGovernment the means to provide assistance. Additionally, I have worked \nwith Senator Kerry to develop language that ensure the equitable and \nefficient distribution of this aid.\n  In my home State of Maine, fishing is an integral part of our \nlivelihood, a common thread that runs along our coast and throughout \nthe State. Unfortunately, we are at a time where fisheries in Maine are \nin trouble and in need of help. This amendment would provide the needed \nhelp.\n  It is not often that we are presented with a win-win situation, like \nwe are here. Not only will this amendment provide the funding and \nflexibility needed to help fisherman, but it will promote conservation \nof the fishery.\n  I am pleased to support an amendment that will provide the necessary \nfunding and framework to meet one of the many challenges facing our \nfisherman. Again, I would like to thank Senator Kerry for sponsoring \nthis amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Kerry-Snowe \namendment, and thank Senator Kerry and Senator Snowe for their \nleadership in bringing this important proposal before the United States \nSenate.\n  The Atlantic Northeast Multispecies Fishermen Permit Buyback Program \nestablished under this amendment would allow hard-working New England \nfishermen to retire from this economically stressed industry with \ndignity, while the work continues to rebuild our fish stocks to \nsustainable levels.\n  This fishermen's permit buyback will help end the cycle of boom and \nbust that plagues our fisheries and assist in developing a long-term \nsustainable fishery in New England.\n  Fishing has been an important industry in the United States. In my \nown state of Massachusetts, as in other states, it is a trade that is \nrich in tradition. Generation after generation of families has passed \non their knowledge of this trade to their children. So it is not just a \nkey part of our economy. It is also as much a part of our heritage as \nthe family farm.\n  Many port cities across the country rely on fishing as their main \nindustry. This is particularly true in Massachusetts. The city of New \nBedford, Massachusetts is the second biggest fishing port in the United \nStates. And we have in our state more than 10,000 fishermen who rely on \nthe sea to earn a living and care for their families.\n  Over the past few years, we have taken a number of steps to help \nthese hardworking families and this important industry.\n  The fishermen in Massachusetts did not have health insurance until \nthe State and Federal Government intervened. In fact, even though this \nis one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, our fishermen \ndid not have health insurance until 1998. Today, as a result of our \nefforts, 800 fishermen and their families now have health care.\n  Fishermen have also suffered because of Federal regulations. As a \nresult of federal actions over the past decade, fishing has declined, \nand the incomes of these families has plummeted as a result.\n  In recent times, the National Marine Fishing Service has taken steps \nto help rebuild the fish stocks. The fishing season has been shortened \nfrom twelve months to six months and there are catch limits to prevent \noverfishing of fragile stocks.\n  At the same time, fishermen have adapted to the changes and working \nwith scientists at the National Marine Fishing Service to help both the \nfishermen and the government to better understand the steps necessary \nto protect fishing stocks, while protecting fishing jobs.\n  For example, in 1999, the scallop industry off George's Bank was set \nto be closed because it was believed that the scallop stocks were \ndepleted. Scientists and the fishermen worked with NASA to obtain \nsatellite photographs of scallop beds of George's Bank. They were able \nto get accurate pictures of the scallop beds and found that stocks were \nfull.\n  This past year the scallop industry logged a record year, with \nprofits over $350 million. This is an example of how science has helped \nthe fishing industry, and is the kind of cooperation that should be \nsupported.\n  The fishermen have also made changes to their equipment to minimize \ndamage to the environment and fishing stocks.\n  Preserving this historic industry will be an ongoing challenge. And \nthe Kerry-Snowe amendment moves us ahead in meeting that challenge.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have examined this amendment on our \nside, and we have no objection to this amendment. We are willing to \naccept this amendment to help the fisheries in the northeastern part of \nthe United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept this amendment. \nWe are hopeful that the fisheries that will be helped by it will move \ntoward a healthier situation generally for fishing in New England.\n  We have consulted with our Senators from New England. This is a very \nimportant issue for them and to others in the industry. For these \nreasons, we are prepared to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2852.\n  The amendment (No. 2852) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, during these moments while we are \nattempting to work out the managers' amendment, I would like to take a \nfew minutes to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Harkin, and his staff for their remarkable work and cooperation \nwith members of our staff as we have worked in the Agriculture \nCommittee. I thank also the leaders, Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, \nSenator Nickles, and particularly Senator Reid, who has guided this \nprocess with great persuasion and effectiveness.\n  I wanted to mention by name each of the members of the Agriculture \nCommittee minority staff to whom I am greatly indebted for their \nexpertise, their faithfulness, and their patience. I commend Katie \nBoots, Danny Spellacy, Andy Morton, Carol Dubard, Chris Salisbury, Beth \nBechdol, Dave Johnson, Erin Shaw, Michael Knipe, Walt Lukken, Terri \nNintemann, Jeff Burnam, Andy Fisher, Mark Tyndall, and Keith Luse, who \nhas headed this effort so ably.\n  We have also had detailees to the committee. From GAO, we had Pat \nSweeney, and from USDA, Carol Olander, Dave White, and Benjamin Young. \nI thank them all, as I know my colleagues do, for their remarkable \nwork.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I apologize to my colleagues for holding \nup the proceedings of the Senate on this very important legislation, \nbut at some point someone has to say ``enough.''\n  When I first came to the Senate, which was not as long ago as a \nnumber of the other Members, a package of technical amendments was \nsometimes two, three, four, five amendments that were purely technical \nin nature. We now have a new Senate record. This package of technical \namendments, the managers' package which has been subject to neither \ndebate nor discussion by any Member of this body, is now 396 pages \nlong. It has 137 amendments. Billions of dollars are in the managers' \npackage.\n  I want to repeat, it is longer than the original House bill. There \nare authorizations from nutrient reduction pilot programs to a \ntechnical correction to the wildlife incentive program changes from \n$350,000 to $50 million a year in fiscal year 2007. None of these has \nbeen debated and discussed, that I know of.\n  I have selected three that are particularly egregious, on which we \nwill have votes. I would like to say I am familiar with the details of \nthese three amendments on which I am seeking votes, but I am not, \nbecause they are technical amendments in a package. In fact, I am \ninterested to see the Senator from Wisconsin in the Chamber because he \nhas sort of been a triggering mechanism to what I am doing right now.\n  When we had an appropriations bill and I said, ``Who has seen the \nmanagers' package?'' no one said a word, and because it was late at \nnight, I let it go. There were 15 amendments in a managers' package \nwhich was millions of dollars earmarked for specific States. I said I \nwould not let that happen again.\n  Now we have a bill, as I say, a managers' package, which is 396 pages \nlong with 137 amendments. We have been working on this bill for months, \nas the majority leader pointed out to me. We saw 100 of the amendments \nlast night. We did not see the additional 30 technical amendments until \n10 minutes before we were supposed to vote. We cannot operate this way. \nWe cannot operate this way with the taxpayers' money.\n  If anyone has ever seen a package of technical amendments that \nexceeds this, I would like to hear from them. I do know what a \nmanagers' package is supposed to be, and that is some technical \namendments that make technical corrections, not amendments such as No. \n127, which adds a section authorizing a technical assistance program \nfor geographically disadvantaged farmers. Do you have that? This is a \ntechnical assistance program for geographically disadvantaged farmers, \n$10 million a year between 2002 and 2006. This is in a managers' \npackage. There are Delta regional economic development grants, \nadditional nutrition technology in the delta region, of $7 million a \nyear. And a pilot program for the Chesapeake Bay until 2006, $70 \nmillion.\n\n  I am sure these may be good programs. They may be very beneficial. \nParticularly in the case of the Chesapeake Bay, they may be very \nimportant. What is it doing in a managers' package? What is it doing \nwith 130 other amendments in a managers' package?\n  I will ask for votes on these three amendments. They will, I am sure, \nbe resoundingly carried. I tell my colleagues, the next time we do \nthis, we will have extended debate and discussion and second-degree \namendments. It has to stop. My constituents deserve the right to know \nwhat is in these amendments. When they are talking about $10, $20, $70 \nmillion in an amendment, they should not be in a so-called managers' \npackage.\n  I don't want to impede the progress of the Senate too long, but I \ncannot allow this practice to continue. The Senator from Kansas is \nhere. He was the manager of major legislation. I ask if the Senator \nfrom Kansas has ever seen a bill with this kind of a managers' package \nin it? I ask unanimous consent for the Senator from Kansas to respond.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am happy to respond to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona. The answer is: No.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will be glad to address the first \namendment. We will have short debate and discussion. As I said, I would \nlike to debate it at length, but I don't know anything about it. That \nis the reason I am forcing a vote. Maybe we will know something about \nthese various amendments.\n  I say again to my colleagues, this is not the right way to do the \npeople's business. It is not the right way to do the people's business, \na 396-page package of managers' amendments that are supposed to be \ntechnical in nature. I am glad to vote on whichever amendment the \ndistinguished managers choose to bring forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I think the Senator from Arizona has \nan excellent point. I know people are working hard to try to get the \nbill completed. There are things in the bill that I think are very good \nand there are things in the bill I do not agree with at all. There are \nsome amendments that a number of people are concerned about that are \nimportant, that are legitimate.\n  I don't think in the effort of expediency we should be throwing \neverything in this package. I would hope to have a much more \ndeliberative process in this bill and future bills on something so \nimportant to my State, so important to many of the States.\n  I realize the managers are pressed to get a bill through in a timely \nfashion. That is important. But on such an extensive bill I don't think \nwe are serving the people's business well to move through it so \nrapidly. Maybe we have to go longer in the evenings, voting at night, \nto get some of these amendments done. This is important legislation. It \nshould not be rushed.\n  Regarding this bill, there is some of it with which I agree; much of \nit I do\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nnot. I hope we do not follow this procedure when we move forward with \nfuture pieces of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I defer for a moment before I propound a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I will respond to the Senator from \nArizona on the issue he has raised.\n  I agree fully with the necessity of openness and providing an \nopportunity for review, and we have certainly sought to do that to make \nthis amendment available. At the same time, we cannot operate as the \nSenate unless we have an element of trust in those who have been \nappointed or elected to lead our committees on both the majority and \nthe minority side. That is why we as a Senate delegate to committees \nboth the authority and the responsibility to develop legislation, to \nhave hearings, to come up with the bills and to bring them on the \nfloor.\n  I ask any Senator, how could we ever operate as a Senate if every \nline, every paragraph, every little item in every bill had to be fully \ndebated and discussed and if every Senator is obliged to sit down and \ngo through and debate every item on the floor? It is impossible. That \nis why we have built up a system involving openness but also trust. \nThat is why when we receive a request for an amendment, if a senator \ncomes from one side and says, he or she wants to put this amendment in \nthe bill, in the managers' amendment, I look at it to make my judgment \nand then go to Senator Lugar, the Ranking Member on the other side. I \nsay: Someone on our side is suggesting they want to do this; would you \ntake a look at it, talk to your staff, go to whomever you want to on \nyour side and look it over. I go to Senators on my side and see if \nthere are any objections. If no one raises any objections, and it is \ngood policy we put it in the managers' amendment.\n  We also are careful that items added through the managers to the bill \nare not of such major importance that they substantially affect the \nunderlying legislation. That is true of the amendments in here.\n  The Senator spoke about billions of dollars being in the managers' \namendment. That is simply not so. We have kept within the budget \nallocation. Nothing in the managers' amendment goes beyond our budget \nallocation. I asked my staff to add up the total in the managers' \namendment, all of the items in there. That is, what additional cost is \nin the managers' amendment that is not in the pending legislation \nalready? It adds up to only about $38 million more over 10 years in \nmandatory spending than is already in the underlying bill. It is not \nbillions of dollars: $38 million over 10 years. These are items that \nare not large. There are some technical changes, adjustments and so \nforth. But it is a very small amount of money when you consider we are \ntalking about a $73.5 billion bill.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, we must operate on a system of trust \naround here. Obviously, with trust there has to be sunshine. The \nunderlying bill and earlier versions of the managers' amendment have \nbeen out there for quite some time. Additional amendments were recently \nadded in order to wrap up the bill. These were available for anyone to \nsee. In addition to the checking I described earlier, any Senate staff \nor any Senator who wants to come see what is in the managers' package \ncan at any time. They just need to ask. There is no secrecy. That is \nthe way we operate.\n  I hope the Senator from Arizona is not saying from now on, no matter \nhow available and open we make the process, we will not trust anyone. \nWe cannot trust Senator Lugar; we cannot trust Senator Harkin; we \ncannot trust Senator Kohl; we cannot trust Senator Roberts. Everything \nhas to be brought onto the Senate floor for every Senator to debate and \nvote on the most minute detail. We would never get anything done in \nthis Chamber.\n  This managers' amendment has been carefully drafted. It has been \nvetted. It has been fully aired and exposed to the sunshine. It has \nbeen out there for people to see as it has been drafted. I did not go \nto the Senator from Arizona and----\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The fact is, we didn't see 30 of these amendments until \n10 minutes before the vote. So how can the Senator say they are out \nthere when we did not see them? We have asked to see them. We have told \nhim we want to see them. It is well known we want to see them. How in \nthe world can the Senator from Iowa say they have been out there when \nwe didn't see them until this morning, and we didn't see the other \nhundred until last night? The Senator from Iowa is simply not stating \nthe facts as they are.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Arizona that my staff tells me \nthat as they have developed the managers' amendment over the last few \nmonths, staff has made available the various versions. That they have \nbeen e-mailed out constantly to the staff of Agriculture Committee \nmembers, so that any one who wanted to, at any point in time, could \nhave seen what was being requested and considered as an amendment. As \nfor the later amendments, we have done the best we can to make them \navailable as soon as possible. Again, both Senator Lugar and I have \nsigned off on them and worked with members on our respective sides. \nFinally, the amendment and a summary of it is available for review. We \nare operating under a consensus approach to this managers' amendment. \nIf there is an objection to putting something in the managers' \namendment it does not go in. That is exactly the process that applied \nto the Kerry-Snowe fisheries amendment. It was our understanding that \nthe Senator from Arizona did not want that amendment in the managers' \namendment so we have dealt with it separately on the floor this \nmorning.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield further, we did not see 30 of \nthe amendments until this morning. They were not available to anyone. \nIt is a fact. Just as no one had seen the 15 amendments that were \nearmarked in the appropriations bill I complained about. No one had \nseen them. It is a fact.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not agree with the characterization by the Senator \nfrom Arizona. There were not 30 amendments to the managers' amendment \ndropped on the Senate just this morning--that is a fact. Some \nadditional work on the managers' amendment occurred last evening. That \nis the nature of putting together such a substantial bill as this \nlegislation is. But any modifications were signed off on and accepted \nby the minority staff. They have been available for review. And I am \ntold that most of them, were e-mailed out at around 6 o'clock last \nnight.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One hundred were mailed out last night at 6 o'clock, and \nthen 30 more came in this morning. That is a little bit different \nversion of the facts.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator, I have checked again with my staff. \nThere were no where near 30 amendments of a substantial nature that \ncame in this morning.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to get a list of those we were given this \nmorning. There are 30 that we were given shortly before the vote, the \nfinal vote on the bill that we were apprised of that we had asked for.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am not certain what that is all about. I am told there \nmay have been some after 6 p.m. But, again, I say to the Senator from \nArizona, these were cleared on both sides. We never kept any from \nSenator Lugar. He never kept any from us--not on either side. We have \nhad our staffs look at them. We have checked with other members. That \nis what I am talking about--openness and availability but also trust \nand trusting whether or not committee chairmen and their staffs are \nsensitive enough, and ranking members are sensitive enough, to say: We \ndon't need to burden the entire Senate with this. We can make a \njudgment, check as appropriate and make the amendment available.\n\n  I also say to my friend from Arizona, even though these are in the \nmanagers' package--first of all, it is not billions, it is $38 million, \nI say to my friend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to discuss that with the Senator from \nIowa. No. 18 is changed from $375,000 to $355 million, and change \n$50,000 to $50 million. That is just amendment No. 18.\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This was a clear technical amendment. If you look at the \nunderlying bill you will see that previous fiscal year funding was all \nin the millions. The fact that the latter years were in thousands is \nobviously a typographical mistake. This did not add any money to the \nmanagers' package because it already was scored by CBO as being in the \nmillions.\n  I say further to my friend----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a dialog with the \nSenator, if that is agreeable? I just want to make sure we observe the \nrules of the Senate. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a dialog with \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am not sure what you would like to debate here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It says technical correction in the Wildlife Habitat \nIncentive Program, technical correction, mandatory funding language, \nchange it from $375,000 to $355 million, in fiscal year 2006; and \nchange $50,000 to $50 million in fiscal year 2007.\n  Obviously, this is a technical change. Obviously, it is a change of \nmany millions of dollars.\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I respond? I asked my staff about that. At a cursory \nreading, as the Senator has done, he says: My gosh, we are going from \n$375,000 to $355 million in a managers' amendment.\n  Here is what that is about. In the underlying substitute, there was \neither a typographical error or a mistake made. It was listed in the \nlegislative language as $375,000, but it was known by everyone to be \n$375 million, as it was scored by CBO as the correct amount. As I \npointed our earlier, if you look at all the funding for WHIP in context \nit makes sense. There was just a mistake made. So we are correcting the \nmistake in the underlying bill. A shift was also made of $20 million \nfrom WHIP in the managers' amendment, but that did not add to the score \nin the managers' amendment.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, it has already been scored.\n  Mr. McCAIN. You are still correcting in the underlying bill some $400 \nmillion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, there is $375 million already in the underlying bill \nthat has been scored by CBO.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Plus $50 million. I don't care if it has been scored by \nCBO or not, it is not in the underlying bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is in the underlying bill as fully understood. The \nmanagers' amendment is only a technical correction to conform to the \nclear understanding.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then you don't need the technical correction. I ask \nunanimous consent to eliminate technical amendment No. 18.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object. Because it is clearly a technical correction \nthat you have taken out of context. What you contend is that real money \nhas been added in the managers' amendment and that is not true. What \nCBO scores does matter because CBO recognized the typo and we fixed it \nin the managers' amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In the underlying bill, the amount of money for the \nWildlife Habitat Incentive Program funding language was scored by CBO \nat $375 million. It was a printing error that was made in the text of \nthe bill, it is mistakenly listed as $375,000 in the underlying bill. \nLook at all the previous funding levels--they are all in the millions. \nThe technical correction here is to make the underlying bill comport \nwith what CBO has already scored. That is what technical corrections \nare for.\n  So I say to my friend from Arizona, if this is illustrative of the \nproblems he has with managers' amendments, I say again, that is why you \nhave to have some trust in the ranking member and in the chairman and \nour respective staffs, that we are operating above board with openness \nbut also that we are only proposing technical corrections and matters \nthat are acceptable to both sides and not objected to by any member.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me repeat. It's a technical amendment that adds some \n$400 million.\n  Here is another one, authorized to be appropriated, $7 million for \neach of the fiscal years 2000 through 2006. That is another ``technical \namendment.''\n  But the larger issue here is--the larger issue is why do we need 396 \npages of technical corrections to a bill which is larger than the \nentire House bill and has 130-some technical corrections? There is \nsomething wrong here. There is something fundamentally wrong.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, I have been here almost as long as he \nhas--not as long. I have never seen bills that required trust of 396 \npages and 130 technical amendments. I have never seen any other farm \nbill that did, nor has the Senator from Kansas, who used to shepherd \nthese bills through the House.\n  I am supposed to trust a managers' amendment of 396 pages? I am glad \nto trust, but in the words of a former President of the United States, \n``trust but verify'' because time after time after time, I have seen \namendments put in that are earmarks, specifically for specific areas, \nspecific States, specific congressional districts. I have seen them \ntime after time. It is not only me who is objecting to that. The \nCitizens Against Government Waste and the Taxpayers Union and every \nother watchdog organization condemn this practice, and so do I.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, again, I don't know what is done with \nAgriculture Committee members or Agriculture Committee staff. I know I \nhave had a longstanding request to see any amendments, and particularly \nany technical amendments. Either the Senator from Iowa or his staff did \nnot show us those amendments until last night. And there were a number \nof amendments that were added as short a time as a half hour before the \nfinal vote.\n  Your staff can deny it, but it is a fact. So I will not sit still for \nthat kind of procedure. That is why we will have these votes. I am \nsorry the Senator does not like the fact that I don't trust 130-some \namendments I have never seen that cover 396 pages. I think my \nconstituents deserve better than me ``trusting''--particularly given \nall the earmarking and pork-barreling I have seen going on, on the \nincrease over the past several years.\n  I cannot debate these amendments very well because, as I said, I have \nnot seen them because they were not shown to me or other Members of the \nSenate. That is pretty much the situation. I am sure many of them are \nvirtuous, but the fact is there is all kinds of money and programs in \nhere.\n  There are interesting things in here. There is one, No. 110: Adds \n``gender'' to the list of socially disadvantaged groups covered by \nsection 2501, the outreach program for socially disadvantaged farmers.\n  Could the Senator, just out of curiosity, tell me what a socially \ndisadvantaged farmer is?\n  Madam President, will the Senator from Iowa yield for a question? \nWhat is a ``socially disadvantaged farmer''?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I know the Senator is being a little provocative to make \nhis point. That is OK. There is an existing program to help farmers, \nincluding minority farmers, who because of circumstances have a harder \ntime getting credit and making a go of it in farming. While the \nsocially disadvantaged program covers minority farmers, there was not a \nmention of gender, at least for all of the USDA programs involved. It \ncame to the attention of a member--not me, but someone who wanted us to \ndo this--that women were not adequately covered in existing law. This \nwas just a correction to put in that program the definition that gender \nis a basis on which someone may qualify for assistance under the \nsocially disadvantaged program. That way, along with other \ndisadvantaged groups the law would include gender so women in \nagriculture would receive fair treatment and opportunity. It seems to \nme to be a very harmless type of provision to put in there. Again, I \ndon't understand why that should be such a big item. We cleared it on \nboth sides.\n  I hope the Senator is not saying that every time--maybe he is saying \nthis but I do not know--an amendment comes to the managers' package \nthat has been cleared on both sides and is mailed out that we have to \nsend a message to his office specifically asking him to look at it. The \nprocess is open. If the Senator wants to have his staff come over at \nany time, the door is open. They can look at any amendment they want.\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. If I may correct something, I listened to this. I had a \nheart-to-heart discussion with the Senator from Arizona earlier today. \nI think that maybe I am partially to blame for what has gone on. I say \nthat because I have been here with the two managers of the bill for \nseveral weeks. The Senator from Arizona is right. I do not know which \nbill it was, but it was one of the last bills we had before the new \nyear. The Senator asked me if I would in the future when there was a \nmanagers' package notify him or his staff. He did ask me that. There is \nno question about that. Last night I should have done that, and I \ndidn't do that. It is not Senator Harkin's fault or Senator Lugar's \nfault. But the Senator from Arizona did come to me the last time we had \nthis problem and I told him I would do that. I didn't do it. It is \ncertainly nothing that is deceptive. I simply didn't do it. I forgot. \nOne of the reasons is that I have such great confidence in the two \nmanagers of the bill. I do not know on the minority side if there is a \nSenator who I have such great respect for than Senator Lugar. This man \nis top of the line. He has worked very closely with us on this bill, as \nmy friend, Senator Harkin, has spoken about many times.\n  I don't think we need to discuss it here today. I think the Senator \nfrom Arizona has a right to be concerned, but his concern should be \ndirected towards me, because, in fact, the last time he indicated he, \nin the future, was going to raise objections to the managers' \namendment. I should have brought this to his attention.\n  When we talked earlier today, he indicated he wanted to offer \namendments to each one of these. I indicated that the unanimous consent \nagreement wouldn't allow that.\n  Certainly the Senator from Arizona can do whatever he wishes, but I \nthink we can get to the heart of this if he makes a motion to strike \neach of these three things about which he is concerned. I think his \npoints will be very well taken.\n  When this happens again, I will do my best to make sure that he or \nhis staff are aware of the managers' package. I don't want the Senator \nfrom Iowa or the Senator from Indiana to be blamed for any of this. I \nshould have on my own brought this to the attention of the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, if I might reclaim my time, I thank the \nSenator from Nevada for that. I harbor no ill will at all. I have great \nrespect for the Senator from Arizona. He knows that. I am just trying \nto be as open as possible. We all know that legislative matters and \nrequests for changes do come up throughout the process of putting a \nbill together. Some do come in late, but that is the right of senators \nto request modifications. However, nobody is trying to ram anything \nthrough that people don't know about.\n  I will say to my friend from Arizona that this managers's amendment \nhas been scrubbed and checked carefully, but there is another stopgap \nwithin this process just in case something gets through inadvertently \nthat may not have been obvious or to which someone had a serious \nobjection but had not raised it for some reason. We have to go to \nconference. Everything in this bill and managers' amendment is out \nthere in that conference. Everything is out there for everybody to see. \nI say to my friend that there is another level which we are going \nthrough. This amendment and this bill are not the final word.\n  That is the only point I am trying to make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I appreciate his \ncomments on this issue. I say to the Senator from Iowa that I would \nlike to trust everything that goes through this body. I can tell you \ntoo many stories of things that went through without my knowledge that \ncost the taxpayers a whole lot of money. I will tell you about one.\n  Put into an appropriations bill was a provision that two ships would \nbe built in Pascagoula, MS, in return for which there would be \nexclusive rights for those ships to sail to the Hawaiian Islands. I \nnever saw that amendment until after it was done. Associated with that \nwas over $1 billion in loan guarantees from the Maritime \nAdministration. I never saw the amendment. The outfit just went \nbankrupt. The taxpayers have already spent some $300 million-plus which \nthey lost from those loan guarantees, and they stand to lose over $1 \nbillion. I am sure it was a well-meant and a well-intentioned amendment \nto help both Mississippi and the Hawaiian Islands. I knew it would fail \nbecause I know enough about shipbuilding in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Those are the kinds of things that happen time after time--maybe not \nof that magnitude--because of amendments, which are well-intentioned \nand probably good in many respects but don't undergo the scrutiny and \nthe hearings and the authorizations necessary to prevent that from \nhappening put into these pieces of legislation.\n  That proposal I told you about would have never cleared either the \nCommerce Committee or the Armed Services Committee. It never would have \ngotten through. It was stuck in an appropriations bill, which we do \ntime after time. The night I was here, I asked: Does anybody know what \nis in the managers' package? No. It was late at night. So I said: OK. I \ndon't object. There were 15 earmarks of millions of dollars for \nspecific States. That is my taxpayers' money, too.\n\n  I say to the Senator that this system is broken. We are now up to \n8,000 earmarks on appropriations bills. That is up from less than 2,000 \n3 years ago. It is wrong. It is just wrong. It is wrong from the \nstandpoint of fiscal discipline and budgetary reasons, but it is also \nwrong in the respect that these matters need to go through the proper \nauthorizing and appropriations process. At least this is an \nauthorization bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for his comments. I am very grateful \nfor the courtesy that he has shown me, not only now but for many years.\n  I withdraw my requirement to object and to seek to strike these three \namendments, and I will agree to go to final passage.\n  But I say to the Senator from Iowa one more time that this is \nunprecedented with 396 pages of technical amendments in the managers' \npackage. It is wrong and 1,130-plus technical amendments is wrong. It \nis not the right way for us to do business. I hope we can do better in \nthe future.\n  I yield the floor. I am prepared to move to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2859\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up the amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Lugar, proposes an amendment numbered 2859.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2859.\n  The amendment (No. 2859) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the substitute amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2471), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is about to \ncomplete action on this farm bill. While the bill has some positive and \nhelpful provisions, particularly with respect to\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\nconservation, rural development, research, and nutrition, I plan to \nvote against the bill.\n  One of the primary objectives of farm legislation should be to \nimprove the predictability and effectiveness of the financial safety \nnet available to farmers. However, the payment limitation amendment \nthat was adopted by the Senate will reduce the level of price support \nand shred the safety-net that our farmers need. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, cotton farmers would be able to receive \nbenefits on approximately 880 acres, and rice farmers would be able to \nreceive benefits on about 490 acres. Any additional acreage planted to \nthese commodities would not be eligible for any government assistance.\n  Since 1985, the marketing loan program has been the centerpiece of \nour Nation's farm policy. The marketing loan program provides reliable \nand predictable income support for farmers while allowing U.S. \ncommodities to be competitive in the global market. This legislation \nwill make the marketing loan program completely useless.\n  Considering the bleak forecast for the farm economy, it does not \nstand to reason that Congress should pass legislation that imposes new \nrules and regulations which will restrict government assistance so \ndrastically.\n  I hope we can resolve the differences we have over this bill in \nconference with the House and bring back a truly beneficial farm bill. \nI pledge my best efforts to achieve that result.\n\n\n                Preservation of Land for John Ogonowski\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Harkin for his \neffective work on this legislation. I particularly commend Senator \nHarkin for his leadership in including programs in this farm bill that \nwill help farmers across the Nation, including those in the Northeast.\n  I would like to take a few moments to speak about John Ogonowski, the \ncourageous pilot of American Airlines Flight 11, which was hijacked by \nterrorists on September 11th and which crashed into the first tower of \nthe World Trade Center that day. At the time of his tragic death, John \nOgonowski had been working tirelessly to preserve 33 acres of land that \nhad once been part of the Ogonowski farm in Dracut, MA. The Farmland \nProtection Program serves as a vehicle to help preserve farmland, and I \nhope that the funds from that program can be used to preserve the land \nthat John cared so much about. I hope that we can make John's dream \ncome true.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will be honored to work with the Senator \nto try to preserve the land in memory of John Ogonowski who was a proud \nfarmer and a brave man. The land in Dracut, MA would stand as a fitting \nmemorial to him. I will work, as the bill progresses, to encourage the \nuse of Farmland Protection Program funds for this important cause.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The land in Dracut is along a road that is traveled by \nmany families, commuters, and tourists. All those who pass by the land \nwill know of John Ogonowski's life and his family's love of farming.\n  John farmed these fields for many years as a young man and was often \nseen riding on his John Deere tractor with a wave and a smile for those \nhe passed. His family continues to maintain substantial farmland in the \ncommunity, but John was deeply concerned about this portion that had \nbeen sold recently. To John, the original Ogonowski farm was one of the \nwonders of the world, and John had worked skillfully and tirelessly to \ncreate the Dracut Land Trust to preserve it. Now, in a well-deserved \ntribute to John Ogonowski, we will work to help the Dracut Land Trust \npreserve these 33 beautiful acres.\n\n\n            Chesapeake Bay Nutrient Reduction Pilot Program\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to clarify that it is the \nintent of this provision to encourage the development of innovative \nsolutions to the nutrient pollution problem in the Chesapeake Bay. The \nprincipal focus of the program, as envisioned by Bay-area scientists \nand organizations, is to create new incentives for farmers to reduce \nthe application of nitrogen by at least 15 percent below what is \nnormally considered best practice and to provide financial protection \nin the event of reduced yields. In order to implement the provision, it \nis my expectation that the Risk Management Agency will make available \nthe Nutrient BMP Insurance Endorsement that was approved by the Federal \nCrop Insurance Corporation on December 12, 2001 in the states of the \nChesapeake Bay region, with such modifications as necessary to \neffectuate the purposes of this section.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct. The purpose of this provision is \nto support the development of new and innovative solutions to the \nChesapeake Bay's nutrient over-enrichment problem. It provides $70 \nmillion for States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to test new \npractices that could provide major reductions in nutrient pollution. It \nwill clearly require an underlying risk management instrument and we \nwould expect the Risk Management Agency to make its programs available \nto implement the yield insurance aspect of this provision. I will be \nhappy to work with the Senator from Maryland in Conference to ensure \nthat the mechanisms to carry out this provision are created or made \navailable.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chairman of the Committee. This provision \nis a win-win situation for the Bay and farmers. It will reduce nutrient \ninputs to the Bay and it will enable farmers to lower their operating \ncosts by avoiding the cost of unneeded fertilizer, without risking loss \nof a portion of their crops. Experience gained in this pilot program \nwill allow better understanding of risks and benefits of this practice.\n\n\n                     technical assistance providers\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the section \non certification of third party technical providers allows the \nSecretary to certify providers. The legislative language, regarding the \ncertifying programs run by the United States Department of Agriculture \nis designed so that the USDA does not run the programs in a manner that \ndirectly or indirectly undermines the ability of private, long-\nstanding, and highly regarded certification programs like those \noperated by the Certified Crop Advisors and National Alliance of \nIndependent Crop Consultants.\n  The intention of the conservation title, and especially this section, \nas I understand it, ensures that the Nation's farmers and ranchers will \nbe able to continue to receive high quality conservation technical \nassistance, and that there will be enough technical assistance to allow \nthe complete and proper delivery of the conservation programs funded in \nthe farm bill.\n  In addition, it is my understanding that the Secretary of Agriculture \nwill consult with and be advised by representatives from federal, \nstate, and local agencies as well as representatives from the private \nand non-profit sectors on an Advisory Council. It is expected that in \nselecting representatives, the Secretary shall appoint representatives \nfrom the following groups: Natural Resources Conservation Service, \nForest Service and Farm Service Agency, the National Association of \nConservation Districts, the Certified Crop Advisors, the National \nAssociation of State Foresters, the National Alliance of Independent \nCrop Consultants and the American Society of Agricultural Engineers. \nTogether with other appointed members of the Advisory Council, these \nrepresentatives will advise the Secretary of the management of \ncertification programs for the provision of technical assistance by \nthird party providers.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree with Senator Roberts that those are the intentions \nof the language regarding non-federal technical assistance providers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I also agree with Senator Roberts and Senator Lugar and \nthank them for working with me on the important work of expanding and \nenhancing conservation technical assistance. I am a strong supporter of \nthe work done by private third parties including the Certified Crop \nAdvisors and the National Alliance of Independent Crop Consultants. Our \nbill will allow them to prosper while enhancing technical assistance \nnation-wide.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and ranking member \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee for accepting my amendment to \nprovide mandatory funding for the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program.\n  Biodiesel is a home-grown renewable fuel. Even as world oil prices \nare tightening, America's farmers are producing record crops of \nsoybeans. Unfortunately, U.S. soybean prices are now at record lows. \nBuilding demand for biodiesel will help increase these commodity prices \nwhile enhancing our Nation's energy security. In Minnesota,\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\nsoybeans are the number one cash crop, grown on about 7 million acres. \nAs we increase demand for soybeans, thus boosting market prices, we are \nalso investing in the economic well-being of farmers and rural \ncommunities across our country.\n  Minnesota has been a long-time leader in the production of renewable \nfuels such as ethanol, wind-generated electricity, biomass, and solar \nenergy. As Minnesota's Commissioner of Energy and Economic Development \nduring the 1980's, I know firsthand the important role that federal and \nstate programs play in developing these industries during their \ninfancies. So I strongly support legislation that promotes the use of \nrenewable energy and programs that educate the public in order to \ncreate demand.\n  Last June, I, along with Senator Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, \nintroduced legislation to provide tax incentives for increased use of \nbiodiesel, a renewable fuel made from soybean and other vegetable oils. \nThe biodiesel bill provides a Federal excise tax credit similar to the \nexcise tax credit for ethanol-blended gasoline. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture estimates that the resulting increase in biodiesel sales \nwill increase soybean prices by at least 25 percent per bushel. As \nmarket prices go higher, the cost of government price supports become \nlower. The savings realized by the Commodity Credit Corporation, and \nthe American taxpayer, would then be used to cover the cost of the tax \ncredit. My bill directs the savings to the Commodity Credit Corporation \nto reimburse the Federal Highway Trust Fund for its lost revenues.\n  Over the past year I have been working with the Senate Finance \nCommittee to include the biodiesel tax credit in the energy tax package \nthat is scheduled to be marked up by the committee this afternoon. I \nwish to commend the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, for her help \nin this effort. If we are successful in passing this tax credit, an \neffective education program to educate the public on the benefits of \nbiodiesel fuel will be essential as biodiesel makes the transition from \nresearch and development to commercialization.\n  During the markup of the energy title of the farm bill, the Senate \nAgriculture Committee passed my amendment to authorize $25 million over \nthe next five years for the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program. My \namendment, which passed the committee unanimously, increased the amount \navailable from $1 million to $5 million annually through 2006 for \ngrants to educate Americans about biodiesel. The passage of this \namendment was a critical step toward encouraging the production and use \nof biodiesel.\n  I am pleased to report that the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee have now accepted my floor amendment that \nwill provide mandatory funding for the Biodiesel Fuel Education \nProgram. My amendment will avoid the need to go through the annual \nappropriations process by providing $5 million in mandatory funding \nannually in fiscal years 2003 through 2006.\n  The biodiesel tax credit, together with the Biodiesel Fuel Education \nProgram, provides a comprehensive approach to facilitate the entry of \nbiodiesel fuels into the marketplace. Working in tandem, these \nlegislative initiatives will educate the public, increase demand for \nbiodiesel, bring higher prices for farmers, lower government outlays, \nimprove the environment, and lower our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to comment Senator Harkin \nfor including in the farm bill a provision that is crucial to the Great \nPlains region of our Nation. The provision addresses the alarming \ndecline in groundwater in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, which extends \nunder four States: Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas.\n  A reliable source of groundwater is essential to the well-being and \nlivelihoods of people in the Great Plains region. Local towns and rural \nareas are dependent on the use of ground water for drinking water, \nranching, farming, and other commercial uses. Yet many areas overlying \nthe Ogallala Aquifer have experienced a dramatic depletion of this \ngroundwater resource. Some areas have seen a decline of over 100 feet \nin aquifer levels during the last half of the twentieth century.\n  This provision would establish a voluntary 4-year groundwater \nconservation incentives program for the Southern High Plains Aquifer \nregion. Incentive payments would be made for voluntary land management \npractices, which may include changes from irrigated to dryland \nagriculture, changes in cropping patterns to utilize water conserving \ncrops, and other conservation measures that results in significant \nsavings in groundwater use. Cost-share payments will be made for \nstructural practices that will conserve groundwater resources of the \nHigh Plains Aquifer, which may include improvement of irrigation \nsystems and purchase of new equipment.\n  The provision also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to undertake \ngroundwater education efforts in the southern High Plains Aquifer area, \ncooperating in these efforts by working with the southern High Plains \nAquifer states, the land grant colleges and universities in the area \nand their state cooperative extension services, other educational \ninstitutions, and private organizations, as appropriate.\n  This provision brings focus to an issue that concerns the long-term \neconomic viability of communities in much of America's heartland. This \nis farm country, and the cornerstone of its economy is its groundwater \nsupply, the Ogallala Aquifer, which allows for irrigated agriculture. \nThe Department of Agriculture estimates that there are over 6 million \nacres of irrigated agriculture overlying just the southern portion of \nthe Ogallala. These farms use between 6 and 9 million acre feet of \nwater per year. The problem we are confronting is that the aquifer is \nnot sustainable, and it is being depleted rapidly. This threatens the \nway of life of all who live on the High Plains. This provision will \ntake significant steps to address this serious problem.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment, cosponsored \nby my colleagues from North and South Carolina and Virginia, that will \nprovide temporary relief to flue-cured tobacco growers in our States. I \nexpress my appreciation to the chairman and ranking member for \naccepting our amendment into the manager's package.\n  Flue-cured tobacco is produced under a system of acreage allotments \nand marketing quotas. This system involves both the amount of land on \nwhich the tobacco may be grown and the amount of tobacco harvested or \nthe yield from that land. Hence, the allotment refers to acreage, while \nthe quota refers to the right to market or sell the poundage produced \non the allotted acreage. Usually to simplify discussion of this system, \nreference is only made to the term ``quota''.\n  Originally quota was owned by the producers as a tangible asset that \ncould be passed down through inheritance from the owner to his spouse, \nhis children, his grandchildren, or other heirs. Over time as people \nleft the farm, we now find quota owners who no longer have any \nconnection with Flue-cured tobacco production other than that they \nderive income from the leasing of their quota to Flue-cured tobacco \nproducers.\n  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a view that the \ncompetition for flue-cured tobacco leases was driving up the cost of \nproduction. As a result, in 1983 Congress passed Public Law 98-180. \nSection 205 of that act stated that flue-cured tobacco growers would \nnot be permitted to lease their allotments and transfer their quotas \nfor 1987 and subsequent crops. The rationale was that if tobacco \ngrowers could not lease tobacco quota and transfer it to their farms, \nthen it was presumed that tobacco growers would buy the flue-cured \ntobacco quota from the quota owners. Conversely, if quota owners could \nnot lease and transfer their quotas, they would be forced to sell them. \nFor whatever reasons, this provision of law has never been enforced by \nthe Secretary of Agriculture. Therefore, quota owners did not sell \ntheir quotas to producers. However, since growers could no longer lease \nand transfer quota, they began to rent the land to which the quota \nbelongs. Through a United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nadministrative procedure known as reconstitution, growers combined the \nquota owners' farms into their own.\n  Now, the Secretary has determined that USDA will, commencing with the\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\n2002 Flue-cured tobacco crop, began enforcing this 1983 law by a strict \ninterpretation of the rules that define a farm and govern farm \nreconstitutions. This action by the Secretary is causing considerable \nconfusion and concern among flue-cured tobacco producers and quota \nowners. Incomes and balance sheets are at risk.\n  This current effort to enforce the 1983 law to force the sales of \nflue-cured tobacco quota is most ill times. Current conditions make \nquota too expensive for the tobacco producers to buy. There are two \nmain reasons for this. First, quota owners are receiving ``tobacco \nquota payments'' as a result of the National Tobacco Grower Settlement \nTrust Agreement, also known as the Phase II settlement. Second, The \nPresident's Commission on Improving Economic Opportunity in Communities \nDependent upon Tobacco Production While Protecting Public Health has \nrecommended a tobacco quota buyout. Given the current and the potential \nincome streams to tobacco quota owners over and above the quota's value \nto tobacco growers, few if any tobacco producers could now afford to \nbuy flue-cured tobacco quota. Moreover, the ultimate objective of the \nrecommendations of The President's Commission is to completely do away \nwith the system of tobacco quotas. With the uncertainty surrounding the \nFederal tobacco program, it is very doubtful that any financial \ninstitution would even be willing to lend money to producers to \npurchasing quota.\n  My amendment suspends the enforcement of this provision of law for \none year, for the 2002 flue-cured tobacco crop. Additionally, it \naddresses a problem whereby certain local USDA offices are requiring \nflue-cured tobacco farm combinations to follow the rules governing \nreconstitutions of production flexibility contract farms rather than \nthe specific rules that control reconstitutions of flue-cured tobacco \nfarms. It also directs the Secretary of Agriculture to study the issue \nand report back to the Congress within 90 days of enactment of this \nbill.\n  Finally, I would note that while flue-cured tobacco is also grown in \nGeorgia, Florida, and Alabama, my amendment, as a result of a \nparticular set of circumstances, will not have any effect on flue-cured \ntobacco production in those three States nor on any other type of \ntobacco production. We shall be doing our Carolina and Virginia flue-\ncured tobacco farmers and quota owners a great service by adopting this \namendment in order to give the Secretary time to review the belated, \nunintended impact of this 1983 legislation and to allow time for a \nthoughtful, deliberate implementation or consideration of repeal of the \nprovision.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me first express my appreciation and \nrespect for the work of the Chairman, Senator Harkin, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Lugar, for their dedication to address the challenging \nissues facing American farmers. In addition to funding commodity \nprograms, this farm bill addresses the country's trade policy \ncommitments, goals to improve farming practices through conservation \nmeasures, establishes energy and forestry initiatives, and reauthorizes \nfood and nutrition programs.\n  Every few years we debate a new farm policy, attempting to reach that \nelusive goal of economic sustainability in the agriculture sector. Yet \nlittle seems to change from farm bill to farm bill except the title of \nthe bill. We're always taking one step forward and two steps back. \nPayments are more generous, new subsidies are created, and the Federal \nGovernment's role is expanding, not shrinking, hurting small farmers, \ncompromising agricultural exports, and penalizing American consumers \nand taxpayers.\n  In 1996, we passed a farm bill that was intended to implement a more \nmarket-oriented farm policy and wean farmers off government assistance. \nInstead, five years later, farm subsidies have ballooned by 400 \npercent. In the year 2000 alone, farm subsidies reached a record level \nof $22 billion.\n  Just a few days ago, the Senate approved an amendment to implement a \nstricter limit on payments to farmers. While certainly laudable, I was \ndisappointed that this amendment does not save the taxpayers any \nmoney--the savings are simply redistributed to other federal programs.\n  Even with this change, it's quite obvious that farm spending is still \nundeniably generous, with an additional $73.4 billion dedicated to \ncommodity and other farm programs over the next ten years, which is new \nspending over and above the CBO baseline. Although the Senate bill \nincludes a five-year authorization, and the House bill proposes ten \nyears, both bills propose to spend, in one way or another, the full \n$73.5 billion in additional spending included in last year's budget \nresolution. That means, irregardless of a five-year or ten-year bill, \nthe budget commitment for taxpayers could still tab up to $170 billion \nin total to pay for current programs and cover the costs for new ones \nproposed in this farm bill.\n  That is an enormous federal commitment. Just this past December, the \nAdministration proposed to spend $26 billion for its new education \nbill, a relatively meager amount to be spent on school programs in \ncomparison to farm programs. What is more incredible is that we are \nasking American taxpayers to foot this $170 billion bill when other \ncompelling priorities remain backlogged or unfunded.\n  For example:\n  Indian schools on Native American reservations, suffering from the \nworst dilapidated school conditions in the country, need $1.2 billion \nto fix the deferred maintenance backlog at 185 schools.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which has never been \nfully funded, would require $10 billion.\n  And, about $5-6 million a year for Special Subsistence Allowance \npayments to military households would help get service members off food \nstamps.\n  Unfortunately, these will remain low priorities and underfunded as \nlong as farm spending increasingly consumes the federal treasury.\n  Yesterday, the Senate also voted to suspend budget rules to include \nan additional $2.4 billion in crop and livestock disaster assistance \nfor 2001 crops in this farm bill. This $2.4 billion is, of course, not \nsubject to budget limitations. This is spending in addition to the $5.5 \nbillion already allocated by the Congress for 2001 crops and $33 \nbillion in ad-hoc or emergency farm assistance provided over the last \nfour years. So, that makes a grand total of $35.4 billion in additional \nfarm spending over and above the $70 billion authorized in the 1996 \nfarm bill.\n  Where's the reform? Where does this unlimited spending end?\n  Unfortunately, at the end of the debate, special interests win once \nagain. Let's take a look at the grab-bag for special interests in this \nfarm bill:\n  This bill restores counter-cyclical target price payments that were \neliminated in the 1996 farm bill, potentially spending up to $70 \nbillion for commodity programs for the life of this bill.\n  A new direct payment program is created for dairy farmers at a cost \nof $2 billion over a 3-4 year period, with one-quarter of these funds \nearmarked to the northeast States.\n  Establishment of a new peanut direct payment program, costing $2.6 \nbillion over 5 years.\n  Honey, and wool and mohair subsidy programs are reinstated, programs \nwhich were either phased out or eliminated in the 1996 farm bill.\n  Higher loan rates are provided for specific crops such as wheat, \ncorn, cotton, and others.\n  The Federal sugar subsidy program receives additional props in this \nbill, not only penalizing consumers with artificially high sugar prices \nbut costing taxpayers $254 million to support the program.\n  New authorization for payments and loans available to producers of \ndry peas, lentils, and large and small chickpeas.\n  Addition of new benefits for soybeans and minor oilseeds farmers.\n  Mandatory country-of-origin labeling requirements for wild fish--a \nprovision that has not been debated or reviewed, but simply included in \nthe manager's package.\n  $100 million in emergency assistance for apple producers.\n  Farm spending has gone unchecked for decades. Only until the GAO and \nother independent taxpayer groups singled out the disparity of farm \npayments has some light been shed on this unlimited spending.\n  The GAO's report, which highlighted the egregious disparity in farm \nbenefits, demonstrated that over 80 percent\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\nof farm payments have been distributed to large and medium sized farms, \nleaving small farmers in the cold.\n  Even with changes in this bill for payment limitations, there simply \nis nothing to prevent farm groups from seeking future disaster relief \nand emergency spending when their commodity payments are limited as \nproposed in this Senate bill. It would be nothing short of miraculous \nif this payment limitation provision survived conference negotiations \ngiven the expected resistance from entrenched farm interests. The \nbottom line is that taxpayers face the threat of a return to basic \nstatus quo farm policy, lavishing government payouts to large farming \noperations and conglomerates.\n  We had an opportunity to implement a real reform proposal, as \npresented by my distinguished colleague, Senator Lugar, and I applaud \nhim for his efforts. Senator Lugar fought a brave fight to force the \nSenate to debate a more sensible reform of farm policies, fighting \nagainst a tide of pressure from his colleagues, the distinguished \nchairman, and many agriculture groups.\n  He offered a proposal to substantially reduce federal farm payments \nand focus assistance on a needs-based approach. He boldly proposed to \nphase out cherished sugar, peanuts and dairy subsidies. He also \nsuggested that federal assistance is more appropriately focused to \nthose farmers that genuinely need assistance. Sadly, his proposal will \nnever see the light of day beyond this chamber because too many are \nwilling to adhere to the status quo rather than accept progressive \npolicies.\n  This bill is a great disappointment.\n  While not all of my colleagues are equally budget conscious when \npassing such comprehensive legislation, more than a few should be \nconcerned about how this bill could potentially impact U.S. trade \ncommitments.\n  Today, agricultural exports account for approximately one-fourth of \nU.S. farm income. Because of this, removing trader barriers to U.S. \nagricultural goods is more important now than ever. But as we travel \naround the world, championing the cause of free trade, we must practice \nwhat we preach. We cannot possibly expect foreign governments to reduce \nbarriers to entry for U.S. agricultural products, while the United \nStates Congress continues to build up greater barriers domestically, to \nreduce competition from foreign products.\n  I am a supporter of free trade. I want American farmers to be able to \nsell their goods around the world. This bill continues protectionist \npolicies that raise barriers to foreign goods. These efforts will \njeopardize the ability of America's farmers to continue to export goods \nabroad and profit from expanded exports. Passage of this legislation \ncould very well lead to violations of international trade rules and \nwill no doubt complicate the position of the United States in future \ntrade negotiations.\n  For example, a current one-year ban on catfish imports in effect \nright now because of a last-minute rider to the agriculture \nappropriations bill we passed last year. I opposed this ban, but, \nunfortunately, special interests have also secured a ten-year ban on \ncatfish imports in the House farm bill.\n  Also included in the managers' package of amendments is a provision \nthat requires country of origin labeling for ``wild fish.'' Not many of \nmy colleagues realize how difficult this provision will be to implement \nbecause so many different fish from different sources are often \nprocessed within the same fish processing plant. Fish processors will \nhave to completely change the way they operate their business in order \nto comply with this protectionist measure. Other such trade distorting \nprograms such as dairy and sugar price support programs remain a \nconstant in farm bills.\n  Farm policy is among the most volatile and complicated matters we \ndeal with in the Congress. But what seems clear to me is that the farm \neconomy seems unable to operate unless the Congress infuses billions of \ndollars in the form of direct federal payments, mandates government \nfixed prices, and imposes distorted quotas.\n  We continue to spend and spend on farm subsidies, despite the \nprojections from CBO, which indicate that if current tax and spending \npolicies remain in place, the total unified budget will show a deficit \nof $21 billion in 2002 and $14 billion in 2003, and net surpluses every \nyear thereafter through 2012.\n  According to CBO, the on-budget accounts are projected to post \ndeficits of $181 billion in 2002, $193 billion in 2003, and declining \namounts through 2009. On-budget surpluses do not appear again until \n2010. And, let's face it, medium- and long-term budget projections are \nworth little more than the paper they're printed on.\n  At this time of economic uncertainty, this farm bill is an appalling \nbreach of our federal spending responsibility and our national \nintegrity, while continuing the heavy burden long placed on taxpayers.\n  I regret that I cannot support this bill. I realize that many \nagricultural producers in Arizona have relied on some of these farm \nsubsidies and other agriculture programs, particularly from rural \ndevelopment initiatives. Unfortunately, this farm bill, like most other \nfarm bills in years past, tilts benefits toward the bigger farm \nproducing States while Arizona, like many other States, will lose out \nover the long term.\n  Sadly this bill fails by all accounts to provide a sound and \ndefensible national farm policy.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation, and I wanted \nto take a few moments of my colleagues' time to explain why.\n  Let me begin by commending the distinguished chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, for his outstanding leadership \non agricultural issues and his strong commitment to farmers. There is \nno more passionate advocate on these issues in the Senate.\n  Let me also say that I grew up on a farm--a 120 acre family farm. I \nunderstand what it means to wake up early and put in the long, hard \nhours that go along with family farming. I have tremendous respect for \nthe men and women who put food on our nation's table. And I represent a \nstate, the Garden State, with an important agricultural history, \nalthough one less dominant today.\n  But, in my view, the legislation before us is the wrong way to \nsupport America's farmers. It perpetuates an outdated system of \nsubsidies that distorts the market, unfairly benefits a limited number \nof producers, and, most importantly, imposes excessive costs on all \nconsumers. It distributes these subsidies in a manner that leaves \nfarmers in states like New Jersey with little assistance. And, while \nthis bill does more than other farm bills in recent history, it will \nuse Social Security surpluses for unrelated spending, just when we \nshould be saving to prepare for the baby boomers' retirement.\n  If we were starting from scratch, no rational person would design the \nsystem of agricultural policies that we now have in place, a system \nbegun during the Great Depression. This system provides that most of \nthe federal assistance goes to four crops: wheat, corn, cotton and \nrice.\n  If we were starting from scratch, the first question would be: why? \nWhat is it about wheat, for example, that justifies giving its \nproducers large subsidies?\n  The answer is that there is little reason. We have done it in the \npast. But there is no good reason to give wheat, or any of the other \nprogram crops, special treatment that is not provided to other \nproducers.\n  When Government chooses arbitrarily to favor some products with \nsubsidies, it creates distortions in the market. Farmers might \nordinarily be inclined to grow vegetables, soybeans, apples, or other \nfruits. That may be what consumers want and might make sense \neconomically. But if those fruits do not enjoy government subsidies, \nmany farmers will choose instead to plant more wheat. That reduces the \nsupply of fruit, which raises its price. At the same time, it increases \nthe supply of wheat, which lowers its price.\n  Under the farm program, moreover, a reduction in the price of wheat \nthen triggers even more Government subsidies. In other words, \nGovernment subsidies lead to more government subsidies, as the market \ngets increasingly distorted. The end result is often higher prices for \nconsumers and, eventually, higher taxes for everybody.\n  Let me focus on this last point. This bill calls for a dramatic \nincrease in overall spending on agriculture: as reported by committee, \na total of $73 billion over baseline levels in the next\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\ndecade. Note that baseline levels already incorporate the effects of \ninflation. So a $73 billion increase is a huge amount of money. And the \nfact is, we cannot afford it.\n  In large measure because of the tax cuts enacted last year, we \nalready are looking at deficits for years to come. President Bush's \nbudget calls for raiding Social Security surpluses of $1.5 trillion \nover the next 10 years. And I am afraid that this bill will mean that \nSocial Security surpluses are diverted to pay for farm subsidies. That, \nin my view, is wrong.\n  Our Nation faces a huge demographic bubble, as the baby boom \ngeneration moves toward retirement. We simply must save more to prepare \nfor that. This is the wrong time to be calling for huge increases in \nagriculture subsidies.\n  I also would point out that this bill, like the existing system of \nfarm subsidies, is fundamentally unfair to my State of New Jersey. The \noverwhelming bulk of the subsidies in this bill will go for commodities \nthat, by and large, are not produced in the Garden State.\n  In New Jersey, our farmers grow large amounts of specialty crops, \nsuch as blueberries, eggplant and asparagus. In fact, New Jersey ranks \nsecond in the nation for blueberry production, and fourth in the nation \nfor eggplant and asparagus production. Yet, though New Jersey's farmers \nmeet much of the nation's needs for these crops, none of our blueberry, \neggplant or asparagus farmers receive support under the existing \ncommodity programs. That is one reason, Mr. President, that New Jersey \ngot less than one-twentieth of one percent of the total commodity \nassistance provided by the Federal Government in fiscal year 2001. Less \nthan one-twentieth of one percent!\n  The people of my State get one of the worst returns on their tax \ndollar of any State in the nation. This Congress can be generous when \nit comes to rural areas in other parts of the country. But our State \nhas very different needs. And, when it comes to supporting urban areas, \nlike Newark, Camden or Trenton, we tend to come up short. Yes, HUD \nhelps some. Yes, there are some subsidies for transit. But, overall, \nthe Federal government is not treating my State equitably. We are \ncontinuously the 49th of the 50 States in our return on the Federal \ndollar. That bothers a lot of New Jerseyans. And it bothers me.\n  Having said that, I recognize that if you simply compare this bill to \nexisting law, there are a few provisions that represent improvements. I \ndo support most of the conservation and nutrition provisions. And I \nacknowledge the hard work of Senators Leahy and Torricelli in pushing \nfor more fairness for specialty crops.\n  Yet at the end of the day, the existing system of farm subsidies \nessentially remains intact in this bill, and the subsidies for favored \ncrops are only increased. That means we will continue to subsidize a \nlimited number of producers. We will continue to distort the market. We \nwill continue to impose higher costs on consumers and taxpayers. We \nwill continue to invade the Social Security Trust Fund. And we will \ncontinue to treat my State of New Jersey unfairly.\n  For these reasons, I cannot in good conscience support this \nlegislation. And I hope that, in time, we can revisit a failed farm \npolicy and achieve real, needed reform.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my \ncolleagues and the Senate leadership for bringing this legislation, the \nnew federal farm bill, to the floor so early in the year. I think the \npriority this bill received on the calendar reflects its priority to \nthe Nation, our economy, and especially our rural and agricultural \nregions.\n  In my home state of Nebraska, 55,000 families earn their living on \nthe farm. In total, one in four jobs in Nebraska is connected to \nagriculture. To say the farm bill and Federal farm programs are \nimportant to my state is an understatement.\n  Which is why I was part of a group of sensible, concerned Senators \nthat pushed this body to consider, and pass, a new farm bill last year. \nWe knew that we had to act fast to remedy the problems associated with \nFreedom to Farm. I know first hand, serving as governor of a rural \nstate during the implementation of that program, that it was a failure \nand needed to be fixed.\n  We wanted to get it done last year for two reasons. First, we wanted \nto give farmers and their lenders as much time as possible to plan for \na new federal program. Second, time was running short on the Federal \nbudget clock and in order to maintain an acceptable level of funding \nfor the farm bill, we needed get it done before the budget authority \nexpired for $73.5 billion in new farm bill funds we had secured.\n  But, that didn't happen. We had an administration that thought we \nshould wait, and a merry band of Senators agreed. So, for reasons still \nunclear to me, the farm bill was defeated last year, and the only \npeople who suffered were the farmers all across the country who depend \non these programs to thrive.\n  Now, we are here on the precipice of progress. We have addressed the \nconcerns that were raised last year and we may actually pass a new farm \nbill this week. I must say it's been an interesting process. As the \ndebate on the farm bill was underway last December, simultaneous \ndebates on how best to boost the nation's economy out of a recession \nwere being conducted.\n  I was part of the economic stimulus discussions, and a part of the \nfarm bill proceedings in the Agriculture Committee. I couldn't help but \nnotice the parallel goals of both bills: to stimulate the economy and \nto stimulate the agriculture economy.\n  An argument might be made that the best economic boost for my state, \nNebraska, is something to generate activity in the agriculture economic \nsector. Anything that improves the agricultural economy stirs the \noverall economy in my state. That is why I am here now. I am here to \nsay that this farm bill represents the best economic hope for rural, \nagriculture-based, states like Nebraska.\n  Commodity prices for crops remain at historic lows for the fourth \nstraight year. Livestock producers--the largest sector of agriculture \nin my State--are facing costly new environmental regulations with \nfrightfully few federal resources to help share the burden.\n  This farm bill addresses these concerns and will have a positive \nimpact on the rural economy. This farm bill is the right thing to do, \neven if it's a few weeks late.\n  We have made great strides with this bill. I am proud to say we have \nnearly doubled conservation spending--encouraging agriculture to \nimprove resource management and for the first time providing incentives \nfor conservation on land in production.\n  This farm bill promotes trade, promotes conservation and competition. \nIt breathes new life into our commodity programs.\n  For example, it reauthorizes the programs for sugar beet growers, \nwhich are so critical to the 550 sugar beet families in western \nNebraska. It also provides nutrition programs for hungry children and \nadults, supports our international food donation and trade efforts, and \nprotects millions of acres of environmentally sensitive land, among \nother important priorities.\n  The farm bill before us makes a real commitment--both in programs and \nfunding--to rural development. This farm bill removes barriers to the \nschool lunch program for military families by eliminating an accounting \nglitch that uses their housing allowance to prohibit their \nparticipation.\n  I am pleased that despite the obstacles laid down before us, the \nSenate is about to do the right thing and pass this needed and \nimportant legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the people who \nfeed our nation and the nations around the world, our farmers and \nranchers, by supporting the new farm bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I opposed the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. Senator Kyl's amendment \ncalled for the removal of the sunset date for the estate tax changes \nmade in last year's tax cut package. I opposed it because the proposal \nwas both unfair and unaffordable.\n  The Senator's proposal was unfair because only a tiny number of \nAmericans pay the estate tax under current law. In fact, in 1999 only \n636 Minnesotans paid any estate tax whatsoever. This is simply not a \nburden that falls on many families. That does not mean that I don't \nsupport raising the estate tax exemption to a higher level to shield \nsmaller estates--particularly the few\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nsmall business owners and farmers who end up being affected by the tax. \nI would support raising the exemption immediately to $4-5 million, with \nperhaps higher exemptions for small businesses and farms.\n  The current law, as amended last summer, provides for much slower and \nuneven estate tax relief. It has made the estate tax process much more \ncomplicated--not less. And when full repeal phases in in 2010, it will \nshield the wealthiest estates in America--worth hundreds of millions \nand even billions of dollars--from any tax liability. That's what the \nKyl amendment proposed we make permanent and I think it would be \nterrible policy.\n  And it is made all the more terrible because it is so expensive. The \nKyl proposal would cost $104 billion over the next 10 years--literally \nto protect a few thousand ultra-wealthy families. Even worse, from \n2013-2022 it would cost other taxpayers over $800 billion to provide \nthis ``relief.'' Most of this cost would be financed out of the Social \nSecurity surplus and at precisely the moment that the baby boomers \nstart to retire in large numbers.\n  I will not jeopardize Social Security--which tens of millions of \nAmericans rely upon for their retirement--to grant tax breaks to the \nheirs of multi-millionaires and billionaires. For that reason I opposed \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1731, the \n2002 farm bill. This legislation makes much needed changes to the \nfailed farm policies adopted under the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act and \ncharts a course that promises a better future for all of America's \nfamily farmers.\n  The 2002 farm bill takes significant steps in ensuring that the \nfamily farmers throughout my State and across the Nation are able to \ncarry on in the face of a rural economy that has continued to lag \nbehind the general economy for two decades. Over the past several \nyears, the Congress has repeatedly had to intervene with a series of ad \nhoc disaster relief measures in an attempt to remedy the failed farm \npolicy instituted under the so-called ``Freedom to Farm Act.'' The 2002 \nfarm bill takes significant steps toward ensuring that Federal support \nis provided to those farmers who are most in need. The legislation \nseeks to reform the farm system by reinstituting an income safety net \nto provide more support in difficult years and less during good years. \nIt contains provisions to help ensure that commodity payments that \nindividual farmers can receive reach those who need them most: our \nsmall and medium sized farmers.\n  Agriculture plays a vital role in Maryland. It remains the State's \nlargest commercial industry, providing over $17.5 billion in annual \nrevenue. In all, agriculture and related industry employs about 350,000 \nresidents, including those who own and operate Maryland's 12,400 farms. \nAnd 2.1 million acres, or 33 percent of the total area of my State, is \nused for farming. This represents the largest single land use in \nMaryland.\n  The commodity title of the farm bill contains a number of provisions \nthat are of particular importance to Maryland's agricultural economy. I \nwould like to just touch upon two, those concerning our dairy producers \nand our specialty crop farmers.\n  First, our Nation's dairy policy has been amended to reflect the \nunique needs of dairy farmers in the Northeast, including Maryland. The \n1997 Census of Maryland Agriculture indicates that there are 1,091 \ndairy farms in the State, a number that is about 600 below 1987, and \none which I fear will be significantly lower upon the completion of \nthis year's census. If these small dairy farmers are to succeed, it is \nessential that they be able to compete on a level playing field. This \nlegislation creates a new counter-cyclical payment system for \nnortheastern states when minimum fluid prices fall below $16.94 per \nhundredweight.\n  The farm bill also includes provisions that address the needs of \nspecialty crop producers, crops such as fruits and vegetables that do \nnot benefit from traditional commodity support programs, which are \nmaking up an increasingly important part of Maryland's agricultural \neconomy. The legislation includes several provisions concerning \nspecialty crops, including a provision authorizing funds from USDA's \nCommodity Credit Corporation to be used to purchase these specialty \ncrops over the next 5 years. Further, using savings incurred as a part \nof the payment limitations amendment, USDA's Risk Management Agency has \nbeen directed to develop cost-of-production insurance for a variety of \nspecialty crops to cover documented costs of production in the event of \nlow prices.\n  The farm bill also includes a significant increase in funding for \nvital conservation programs, devoting over $21 billion in new spending \nto conservation efforts over the next 10 years. This figure is double \nthe current baseline spending and marks the largest increase in \nconservation spending ever in a farm bill. These additional funds mean \nincreased funding for programs of great interest to the State of \nMaryland, including: wetland restoration, wildlife habitat incentive \nprograms, and above all farmland and grassland protection, critical to \nhelping farmers resist the pressures of sprawl.\n  The legislation authorizes two new programs targeted specifically at \nrestoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay. First, it authorizes a $70 \nmillion nutrient reduction pilot program to encourage the development \nof innovative solutions to the nutrient pollution problem in the \nChesapeake Bay.\n  Nutrient over-enrichment from agricultural operations and other non-\npoint sources is one of the most serious problems facing the Chesapeake \nBay. In 1987, the Chesapeake Bay Program established a goal of a 40 \npercent reduction of controllable loads of nitrogen and phosphorus \nentering the bay by 2000--a goal that was unprecedented in this \ncountry. Over the past 15 years, farmers in the six-state Bay \nwatershed, with assistance from the Conservation Reserve Enhancement \nProgram or so-called CREP and other USDA conservation programs, have \nmade substantial progress in reducing nutrient inputs. From 1985 to \n2000, total nitrogen loads to the bay were reduced by 51 million \npounds, with the largest percentage of this reduction coming from \nagriculture. Unfortunately, we continue to fall short of the nitrogen \ngoal. If we are to remove nutrient impairments to the bay, additional \nreductions from agricultural sources must be made and that will only be \naccomplished with new and innovative programs.\n  A recent summit of leading agricultural and marine scientists from \nacross the Nation convened in Maryland concluded that the most \neffective means to reducing nitrogen losses from agricultural lands is \nto reduce the over-application of nitrogen that the crops do not use. \nBecause some agricultural crops are relatively inefficient nitrogen \nusers at high yields, the last pound of nitrogen applied to a crop is \nthe least helpful to a farmer's yield, but the most likely to run off \ninto our nation's waters. By providing incentives and financial \nprotections for farmers to accept slightly reduced yields in some \nyears, the Nutrient Reduction Pilot Program will reduce farmers' risks, \nlower their operational costs, and at the same time substantially \ndecrease nitrogen losses to the environment.\n  The principal focus of the Nutrient Reduction Pilot Program, as \nconceived by bay-area scientists and organizations, is to create new \nincentives for farmers to reduce the application of nitrogen by at \nleast 15 percent below what is normally considered best practice and to \nprovide financial protection in the event of reduced yields. The way \nthe program is envisioned, farmers in an area would bid in and say how \nmuch money they would demand for each pound of nitrogen reduced so long \nas the 15 percent threshold is met. Farmers do not have to agree to \nfarm in any particular way; the only question is have they reduced \ntheir nitrogen applications at least 15 percent below recommended \nlevels. The program allows for flexibility in achieving nutrient \nretention targets through such methods as cover crops, constructed \nwetlands, stream buffers, and switch grass. The program would be \nmonitored based on actual performance by comparing how much nitrogen is \napplied to how much is removed in crops. It would also provide rewards \nbased on each increment of superior performance. The program goal is to \nincrease enrollment annually and have one million acres of cropland \nenrolled in year four. Five to 10 percent of the funding will be used \nto support promotion and education as well as monitoring and evaluation \nof program impacts.\n\n[[Page S690]]\n\n  I anticipate that in implementing this program, the Department of \nAgriculture will work with States and the private sector to create the \nmechanisms to carry out this provision. Specifically, I would \nanticipate that the Department would work to achieve the following in \nimplementing the program: Target investments in nutrient reductions \nwhere they are most cost effective through competitive selection \nprocesses and through a bidding process to establish incentive rates; \nreward producers for each incremental level of nutrient reduction and \npossibly increasing incentive rates for each incremental level; test a \nvariety of reduction techniques including both decreasing nitrogen \ninputs by at least 15 percent below land grant university recommended \nrates and increasing nitrogen removal from agricultural runoff; \nencourage alternative land use practices that reduce nutrient runoff \nwhile still producing income; and develop a complementary nutrient \ninsurance program to provide financial protection to farmers who \nexperience reduced yields due to reductions in nutrient applications.\n  This is a very important provision that will use market incentives to \nreduce nitrogen discharge into our Nation's largest estuary. This pilot \nprogram is a cutting-edge approach that allows watershed scale testing \nof a new practice that could provide major reductions in nutrient \npollution throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed while maintaining or \nenhancing farm viability.\n  Second, the managers' amendment authorizes the Chesapeake Bay \nWatershed Forestry Program. Forest loss and fragmentation are occurring \nrapidly in the Chesapeake Bay region and are among the most important \nissues facing the Bay and forest management today. According to the \nNational Resources Inventory, the States closest to the Bay lost \n350,000 acres of forest between 1987-1997 or almost 100 acres per day. \nMore and more rural areas are being converted to suburban developments \nresulting in smaller contiguous forest tracts. These trends are leading \nto a regional forest land base that is more vulnerable to conversion, \nless likely to be economically viable in the future, and is losing its \ncapacity to protect watershed health and other ecological benefits, \nsuch as controlling storm water runoff, erosion and air pollution--all \ncritical to the bay clean-up effort.\n  Since 1990, the U.S. Forest Service has been an important part of the \nChesapeake Bay Program. Administered through the Northeastern Area, \nState and Private Forestry, this program has worked closely with \nFederal, State and local partners in the six-State Chesapeake Bay \nregion to demonstrate how forest protection, restoration and \nstewardship activities, can contribute to achieving the bay restoration \ngoals. Over the past 11 years, it has provided modest levels of \ntechnical and financial assistance, averaging approximately $300,000 a \nyear, to develop collaborative watershed projects that address \nwatershed forest conservation, restoration and stewardship. With the \nsigning of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, the role of the USDA Forest \nService has become more important than ever. Among other provisions, \nthis agreement requires the signatories to conserve existing forests \nalong all streams and shoreline; promote the expansion and connection \nof contiguous forests; assess the bay's forest lands; and provide \ntechnical and financial assistance to local governments to plan for or \nrevise plans, ordinances and subdivision regulations to provide for the \nconservation and sustainable use of the forest and agricultural lands. \nTo address these goals, the U.S. Forest Service must have additional \nresources and authority, and that is what this provision seeks to \nprovide.\n  Specifically, the provision codifies the roles and responsibilities \nof the USDA Forest Service to the bay restoration effort. It \nstrengthens existing coordination, technical assistance, forest \nresource assessment, and planning efforts. It authorizes a small grants \nprogram to support local agencies, watershed associations and citizen \ngroups in conducting on-the-ground conservation projects. It also \nestablishes a regional applied urban forestry research and training \nprogram to enhance urban forests in the watershed. Finally it \nauthorizes $3.5 million for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2006--a \nmodest increase in view of the six-State, 64,000 square mile watershed.\n  The 2002 farm bill, also authorizes a number of critical programs \nwhich will be of great benefit to the people of my State and all \nAmericans. The legislation includes provisions to address the \ndevelopment needs of America's rural communities, including \ninfrastructure funds for businesses and communities to promote genuine \nrevitalization. It doubles the amount proposed by the administration \nfor nutrition programs, in an effort to ensure that no Americans go to \nbed hungry.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the legislation strikes an ill-conceived \nprovision proposed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to dispose of \nland at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. As you know, \nBeltsville Agricultural Research Center is the Nation's premier \nagricultural research facility. The research undertaken at Beltsville \nhas helped ensure the irradication of certain plant and animal diseases \nand the production of high-quality agricultural products so that our \nfarmers and agribusinesses can compete in the global marketplace. And \nthe work at Beltsville has led to products and production methods that \nare safer for both consumers and the environment. Parceling out this \nproperty would most certainly be a step in the wrong direction. \nBeltsville Agricultural Research Center is a national asset which has \nserved as a much needed buffer in the midst of an otherwise highly \ndeveloped area. In my view, the Federal Government would not realize \nproceeds from the sale of this property sufficient to compensate for \nBeltsville Agricultural Research Center's great value to the Department \nof Agriculture and to the American public. This sale would be extremely \nshort sighted and ultimately regretted.\n  In closing, I want to congratulate the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Harkin, who has done a terrific job in ensuring that \nthis legislation reflects the needs of America's family farmers and our \nnation's rural communities. And I urge my colleagues to join with me in \nsupporting its passage.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, for several months now, the attention \nof the Senate has been focused on the condition of farming in America. \nWhile this is a rite of some regularity every few years when we \nconsider again the many hundreds of Federal programs that affect \nAmerican agriculture, it is a subject of ongoing interest for those of \nus whose States rely disproportionately on farming. As Kansas' \nSecretary of Agriculture I had a unique opportunity to see all aspects \nof farming in our state and I rise today to briefly discuss the \nimportant priorities for Kansas in this farm bill.\n  Despite my concerns about many other provisions in this farm bill--I \nam very pleased to see that our carbon sequestration provisions are \nincluded. This portion could help build a new market for farmers--one \nthat pays them for how they produce, not just what they produce.\n  The Wyden-Brownback amendment builds on this promise and expands it \nto help us explore how carbon trading might work by using our \ncooperatives.\n  Carbon sequestration is a largely untapped resource that can buy us \nthe one thing we need most in this debate: time. The Department of \nEnergy estimates that over the next 50 to 100 years, agricultural lands \nalone could have the potential to remove anywhere from 40 to 80 billion \nmetric tons of carbon from the atmosphere. If we expand this to include \nforests, the number will be far greater--indicating there is a real \ndifference that could be made by encouraging a carbon sink approach.\n  Carbon sequestration alone can not solve the climate change dilemma, \nbut as we search for technological advancements that allow us to create \nenergy with less pollution, and as we continue to research the cause \nand potential effects of climate change, it only makes sense that we \nenhance a natural process we already know has the benefit of reducing \nexisting concentrations of greenhouse gases--particularly when this \nprocess also improves water quality, soil fertility and wildlife \nhabitat. This is a no-regrets policy--much like taking out insurance on \nyour house or car. We should do no less for the protection of the \nplanet.\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\n  In addition to this carbon sequestration provision, I am also pleased \nthat we will be able to address another pressing environmental issue \nfacing our country and particularly Kansas. Water, so essential to \ncultivation, is a top priority for Kansas farmers and I am pleased to \nsay that this Farm Bill can help in this vital area as well.\n  The Kansas Water Authority has been considering ways to extend the \nusable life of the Ogallala Aquifer and assure ground water will be \navailable to meet the needs of future generations. The long term \nsustainability of ground water supplies is a concern of mine and I am \npleased with the portion of the farm bill that creates the Southern \nHigh Plains Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Program. This legislation \ntakes the necessary first step to protect and conserve this valuable \nresource. A reliable source of groundwater is essential to the economy \nof Kansas. There have been dramatic declines in water table levels in \nthe last half of this century. It is projected that if no action is \ntaken the aquifer could in some portions be completely dry in 100 \nyears. Kansas is one of the States where this decline is especially \npronounced.\n  Through this new program in the farm bill, farmers will be given \nincentive payments for improving irrigation systems, changing from \nhigh-water intensity crops to low-water intensity crops, as well as \nconverting from irrigation to dryland farming. Payments will be made as \nresult of a true savings in groundwater resources. I am pleased to have \nworked with my colleague, Senator Jeff Bingaman, in supporting this \nportion of the farm bill and hope that the rest of our colleagues will \nsee how important this program is to saving the usable life of the \nOgallala Aquifer.\n  The farm bill currently under consideration is not the bill that I \nwould have drafted, independent of the deliberations of this body. \nHowever, this effort is an initiative that is desperately needed by \nAmerica's farm families. I am hopeful that, working with our colleagues \nin the other body, we will craft a compromise that protects our \npriorities. We need a farm bill that can provide a safety net for \nfarmers, but that will not create negative incentives to overproduce \nand depress crop prices. We need a bill that supports expanding trade \nopportunities and respects our international commitments. We need a \nbill that will, in the President's words, ``offer producers a reliable \nsafety net that protects them from the financial events and \ncircumstances beyond their control, while enabling them to better \nmanage their individual financial situation.'' I remain very hopeful \nthat we will be able to speed help to American agriculture and remove \nthe cloud of uncertainty that presently shrouds the prairie farms in \nKansas and America's agriculture economy generally.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, the Senate voted 98 to 0, recorded \nvote No. 27, in support of Senate amendment No. 2857 to S. 1731, the \nAgriculture, Conservation, and Rural Enhancement Act of 2001.\n  This amendment contained sense-of-the-Senate language that ``no \nSocial Security surplus should be used to pay to make [sic] currently \nscheduled tax cuts permanent or for wasteful spending.'' I voted aye \nbecause I knew that a vote against it would be construed wrongly as a \nstatement in favor of dipping into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Factual inaccuracies in the amendment deserve to be noted. It states \nthat ``permanent extension of the inheritance tax repeal would cost, \naccording to the administration's estimate, approximately $104 billion \nover the next 10 years, all of which would further reduce the Social \nSecurity surplus.''\n  This statement is factually incorrect. In fact, the confiscatory \ninheritance--or more accurately, the estate or death tax--will be \nrepealed for 1 year in 2010. In 2011, the death tax is resurrected and \nat the potency of 2001 rates. I support making permanent the repeal of \nthe death tax. This would in no way endanger the payment of future \nSocial Security benefits.\n  Over the next 10 years, from 2003 through 2012, the President's \nbudget projects a baseline surplus of $463 billion. That amount does \nnot include any Social Security funds. A permanent death tax repeal is \nestimated to reduce Federal revenues by $104 billion over that time \nperiod. The resulting surplus, made up entirely of non-Social Security \nfunds, would be $359 billion.\n  To further illustrate the inaccuracy of the contention that permanent \nrepeal would reduce the Social Security surplus by $104 billion, it is \nuseful to look at the effect of permanence in 2011 and 2012.\n  In 2011, the Federal Government is projected to generate a $199 \nbillion surplus--a surplus that does not include any Social Security \nfunds. Permanently repealing the death tax would reduce Federal \nrevenues by $25 billion in 2011, which is 12.5 percent of the projected \nsurplus for that year.\n  In 2012, the Federal Government is projected to generate a $395 \nbillion surplus--a surplus that does not include any Social Security \nfunds. Permanently repealing the death tax would reduce federal \nrevenues by $61 billion in 2012, which is 15.4 percent of the projected \nsurplus for that year.\n  The facts are clear. Making the death tax permanent will not deplete \nthe Social Security surplus. Supporters of the continued existence \ndeath tax have long underestimated the depth of moral opposition to \nthis ``virtue tax'' on our American families, small businesses, family \nfarmers, and ranchers. Unfortunately, the death-tax supporters are now \nresorting to outright misstatements about the ramifications of \npermanent repeal. They are attempting to convince the country that \nmaking the repeal of this tax permanent will jeopardize our seniors' \nSocial Security benefits. Not true.\n  That is shameful and false, and a bipartisan majority of the Senate \nacknowledged so--in approving, right after amendment 2857, my amendment \nto make repeal of the death tax permanent.\n  By a vote of 56 to 42, the Senate memorialized its support for the \nfollowing statement:\n  ``Therefore, it is the Sense of the Senate that the repeal of the \nestate tax should be made permanent by eliminating the sunset \nprovision's applicability to the estate tax.''\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President: I rise today in support of the farm bill and \nlook forward to the House and Senate conferees working quickly to \nensure that it is in place for the 2002 crop year. I also rise to \nexplain my opposition to the amendment offered unsuccessfully earlier \ntoday by Senator Domenici regarding the dairy program included in the \nSenate version of the farm bill. This amendment would have replaced the \ndairy program that exists in the farm bill with a program that pays \nproducers regardless of the actual market price of milk. Furthermore, \nthe amendment failed to place a cap on the level of production eligible \nfor a payment.\n  The Senate version of the farm bill restores a much needed safety-net \nfor farmers and ranchers throughout the country. This bill rewrites the \n1996 farm bill which has left farmers vulnerable to the continued \ndownward spiral of prices. Because of the 1996 bill's deficiencies, \nCongress has had to approve billions of dollars in emergency assistance \nevery year. This is not an effective or responsible or fair way to set \nthe farm policy for our Nation, and I am pleased that the Senate has \nstepped up to the task of providing needed and honest reform. The \nSenate bill also provides significant new spending for conservation and \nnutrition programs. And it targets assistance where it is needed, the \nsmall family farm, by limiting Federal payments to $275,000 a year. All \nin all, the Senate bill is a comprehensive measure that will help \nfarmers in Wisconsin successfully weather volatile price fluctuations \nand other risks associated with farming.\n  Of particular interest to my State is the dairy title of this bill. \nIt is counter-cyclical creating a price safety-net for dairy producers \nwhen milk prices fall below the 5-year all-milk price or a $16.94 class \nI price. The Domenici amendment would have made payments to producers \nregardless of market conditions. I cannot support that. We should \nprovide adequate relief to producers when prices decline, not simply \npay farmers to over-produce and depress prices.\n  Another key component of the dairy program currently in the Senate \nversion of the farm bill is the limitations on payments. I worked with \nSenator Daschle and Senator Harkin to make sure payments under our \ndairy\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\nprogram were capped so that benefits would not flow primarily to huge \nfarms. We limit payments to 8 million pounds of production or the \namount of milk produced in a year by approximately 400 cows. Given that \nthe average herd size in Wisconsin is 65, I would have preferred a much \nlower cap. However, the final number was a compromise capable of \nwinning the support of a majority of the States. Unfortunately, the \nDomenici amendment would undo this fragile coalition by removing any \nlimit on the payment a producer can receive. This uncapping of the \nbenefits would have shifted the level of assistance from the small and \nmedium size producers, who need the help the most, to the larger \noperators. And while that may be popular out west, where dairy herds \nroutinely run to the thousands, it is unfair to the Midwest and \nNortheast where smaller family farms predominate.\n  The dairy program in the Senate bill is not ideal for me nor any \nother Senator in this body. Yet it represents a significant improvement \nover previous policies, such as regional price-fixing compacts, and \nrepresents a delicate balance between previously warring regions. I am \npleased that the Senate rejected the Domenici amendment and agreed to \npreserve the dairy program we worked out, perhaps the only dairy \nassistance plan that can garner majority support. Furthermore, I urge \nthe conference committee to consider carefully the enormous effort \nbehind and enormous fragility of the dairy section of this bill. I \nplead with the committee not to return to the days of bitter regional \nwars over compacts and other special dairy deals. Let this farm bill be \nremembered as the legislation that marked the beginning of national and \nfair dairy policy in this country.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, it is with great regret that I vote \nagainst the farm bill today. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, \nI have worked extensively on this bill at the committee level and on \nthe floor. I appreciate Chairman Harkin and his staff, who have been \ntireless in their efforts to work with me on behalf of Arkansas \nfarmers. The bill we passed out of the Agriculture Committee was a \nstrong bill that was carefully balanced to represent both the diversity \nof our various regions and the different elements of our rural economy. \nBut passage of the Dorgan-Grassley amendment on payment limitations \nlast week as well as prohibition on packer ownership of livestock make \nit untenable for me to support this bill.\n  I won't go into great detail on the effect of the Dorgan-Grassley \npayment limitations on Arkansas farmers. Instead, I refer my colleagues \nto the February 7th Congressional Record and the extensive remarks I \nmade during debate on the amendment. In addition, I would like to \nsubmit for the Record an article from today's Arkansas Democrat-\nGazette, which outlines the effect this amendment will have on Arkansas \nfarmers. This article refers to a Congressional Research Service study \nwhich finds that a single farmer growing rice will hit his limit at \nonly 487 acres. As I told my colleagues during debate on the Dorgan-\nGrassley amendment, many farmers in Arkansas have had to extend their \nfarms to over one thousand acres in order to break even because their \ninput costs are so high.\n  Last week, I cautioned my colleagues that the information they had \nseen in the press and on websites about plutocrats getting rich off \nfarms payments was misleading. I said that the Environmental Working \nGroup, which was lobbying heavily in favor of payment limitations, did \nnot represent the family farmer. Now it seems that at least one \neditorial writer agrees with me. I quote from the February 11th \nWashington Times: ``Make no mistake. The agenda of the Environmental \nWorking Group and its financial backers is not simply to eliminate \nunfair public subsidizes to agribusiness, but to cripple agribusiness \naltogether. . .''\n  Freedom to Farm demanded that farmers engage the volatile and \nsubsidized global marketplace and learn how to become more competitive. \nNow, with passage of these terribly unfair provisions, the Senate would \nattempt to penalize America's farmers and ranchers for taking the very \nmeasures they need to complete in that same global marketplace.\n  Although I sadly vote against the farm bill today, I look forward to \nworking with Chairman Harkin and members of the conference committee to \nmodify this version of the farm bill so that I might support a more \nbalanced and fair farm bill conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorials to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 11, 2001]\n\n                        Behind the Green Curtain\n\n                          (By Michelle Malkin)\n\n       Among the political chattering classes, there's a big buzz \n     over a tiny activist organization called the Environmental \n     Working Group.\n       Both liberals and conservatives, including the left-leaning \n     New York Times editorial page and the right-leaning Wall \n     Street Journal editorial page, have praised the group's farm \n     subsidy database. The National Journal notes that the \n     research vaulted the group ``into the big leagues and, \n     according to many observers, profoundly shaped the \n     congressional debate over pending farm legislation.'' \n     Hundreds of stories from The Washington Post on down have \n     cited the group's findings over the past month.\n       Posted on the Internet, the Environmental Working Group \n     database documents $71 billion in federal agricultural \n     handouts from 1996-2000. Some of the money has gone to truly \n     undeserving and ridiculous recipients, including prosperous \n     companies, members of Congress, and part-time celebrity \n     ``farmers'' such as professional basketball star Scottie \n     Pippen, banking giant David Rockefeller, media mogul Ted \n     Turner and ABC news personality Sam Donaldson.\n       As a longtime critic of government pork, I agree that the \n     group's database is a commendable public service. But \n     conservative opponents of farm subsidies should perhaps be a \n     little warier of jumping into bed with these radical greens. \n     The Environmental Working Group is not just a humble \n     ``nonprofit research outfit,'' as it is being described by \n     the mainstream press. It is a savvy political animal funded \n     by deep-pocketed foundations with a big-government agenda of \n     their own. And it is engaged in aggressive eco-lobbying that \n     belies its image as an innocuous public charity dedicated to \n     ``education'' citizens.\n       The Environmental Working Group's main claim to fame is its \n     anti-chemical fear-mongering. It scares pregnant women about \n     the nondangers of chlorinated water and says even one bite of \n     some fruit sprayed with pesticides could cause ``dizziness, \n     nausea and blurred vision.'' The group has also declared war \n     on nail polish, hairspray, playgrounds, portable classrooms \n     and ABC News correspondent John Stossel.\n       The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit, 501(c)(3) \n     charity, thrives on funding from an array of extremely \n     liberal foundations. One of its leading benefactors was \n     the W. Alton Jones Foundation--which failed miserably a \n     few years ago in its widely publicized attempt to scare \n     people out of using plastic sandwich bags by claiming they \n     contained endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The group \n     continues to tout the foundation's efforts and plug its \n     alarmist junk science book, ``Our Stolen Future,'' on the \n     group's Web site.\n       In 2000, the Environment Working Group received a $1.62 \n     million grant over three years from The Joyce Foundation. On \n     its Web site, the eco-advocacy foundation describes the \n     grant's purpose in a political terms as supporting ``a \n     concentrated program of agriculture policy reform.'' But in \n     the foundation's tax filings, the purpose of the \n     Environmental Working Group grant is stated in more explicit \n     detail: ``For work on 2002 Farm Bill.''\n       Under federal tax laws, public charities can engage in \n     limited political activities--but the Environmental Working \n     Group's zealous legislative lobbying raises questions about \n     its status as a public charity. In a complaint to be filed \n     this Friday with IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti, the \n     Bellevue, Wash.-based Center for the Defense of Free \n     Enterprise charges that the Environmental Working Group's \n     ``excessive lobbying and politicking'' activities are \n     ``clearly illegal and should (at a minimum) result in \n     revocation of the organization's tax-exempt status.''\n       The complaint charges that the group hid its lobbying \n     political expenditures, failed to register as a lobbyist in \n     California, submitted false or misleading reports with the \n     IRS, and acted as a political action organization in \n     violation of 501(c)(3) rules. Ron Arnold, executive vice \n     president of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise, \n     warns: ``The Environmental Working Group is not what it \n     seems. Its goal is not protecting the environment. Its goal \n     is power--political power.''\n       Make no mistake. The agenda of the Environmental Working \n     Group and its financial backers is not simply to eliminate \n     unfair public subsidies to agribusiness, but to cripple \n     agribusiness altogether in favor of ``organic'' alternatives, \n     increased regulation of manufacturers and tax-supported \n     environmental conservation programs.\n       Sometimes the enemies of enemies don't always make the best \n     of friends.\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n          [From the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Feb. 13, 2001]\n\n                Subsidy Cuts to Wound Rice, Cotton Farms\n\n                           (By Kevin Freking)\n\n       Washington.--A report from the Congressional Research \n     Service confirms that the lower federal subsidy limits \n     approved by the Senate last week would be felt mostly by the \n     nation's rice and cotton farmers. That means Arkansas, the \n     nation's largest rice producer, would be bit particularly \n     hard.\n       The nonpartisan agency projected the acreage that subsidy \n     recipients could farm before they reach the proposed $275,000 \n     limit. The limit for rice farms would be reached at 731 \n     acres; the limit for cotton farms, at 1,321 acres.\n       ``For cotton and rice, those are not large farms,'' said \n     Andy Miller, assistant director of governmental affairs for \n     the Arkansas Farm Bureau. ``We have many folks with farms \n     larger than that.''\n       How many? It's hard to say at this point, but the number \n     will reach into the thousands, agriculture experts say.\n       The average farm in Arkansas is slightly more than 300 \n     acres, but most rice and cotton farms are far larger. Census \n     statistics from 1997 show that nearly 1,000 rice farms in \n     Arkansas covered at least 500 acres. And about 500 cotton \n     farms covered 1,000 acres or more.\n       But even those numbers are conservative, experts said. \n     Arkansas has experienced continued consolidation of farms in \n     the past five years; there are fewer small farms, but the \n     number of large farms has grown.\n       Also, Arkansas farmers who are not married will be \n     ineligible for a spouse allowance. Their limit would be \n     $225,000 in subsidies, so they could plant even fewer acres. \n     For example, a rice farmer who does qualify for the allowance \n     would hit his limit at only 487 acres, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service.\n       The limit is part of the farm bill the Senate continued to \n     debate Tuesday. It was supported by many rural lawmakers from \n     the Midwest, and the report shows that farmers in that region \n     will not be affected by a $275,000 limit. For example, a \n     wheat farm will cover nearly 6,000 acres before it reaches \n     the maximum subsidy payment.\n       The House has already passed its version of the bill, which \n     will set the nation's farm policy for the next five to 10 \n     years. Its bill set a $550,000 limit on subsidies, up from \n     $460,000 under current law.\n\n\n                         house, senate versions\n\n       The Senate could bring its bill to a final vote as early as \n     today. If the bill passes as expected, it will be sent to a \n     conference committee in which negotiators would work out the \n     differences between the House and the Senate versions of the \n     bill.\n       Miller said the Arkansas Farm Bureau has little choice but \n     to oppose the bill before the Senate, ``What we're hoping for \n     at this point, if it does come out of the Senate with all \n     these onerous measures for Southern agriculture, that some of \n     this can be worked on in the conference committee,'' Miller \n     said.\n       Congressional staff members said it was unclear whether any \n     Arkansans would be named to the committee. The state has two \n     senators, Republican Tim Hutchinson and Democrat Blanche \n     Lincoln, and two congressmen, Democrats Marion Berry and Mike \n     Ross, on agriculture committees.\n       One rumor expanded upon in a Wall Street Journal editorial \n     Tuesday is that a trade is in the offing. Three senators from \n     the Northeast--Jim Jeffords and Pat Leahy of Vermont, and \n     Jack Reed of Rhode Island--voted against the $275,000 limit \n     when most observers expected them to vote for it. Leahy and \n     Reed are Democrats; Jeffords is the independent whose switch \n     from the Republican Party put the Democrats in control of the \n     Senate.\n       Leahy, almost sure to be named to the conference committee, \n     could back a higher subsidy cap in exchange for Southern \n     support for the resurrection of a dairy compact that \n     guarantees New England dairy farmers a higher price for their \n     products.\n       ``Nobody will be surprised if [Republican Sen. Thad] \n     Cochran [of Mississippi] suddenly likes the idea of a milk \n     compact. So New Englanders will vote to subsidize rich \n     farmers in Mississippi in return for Southerners voting to \n     soak milk drinkers everywhere,'' the Journal said.\n\n\n                          livestock ownership\n\n       One of the Senate farm-bill votes Tuesday kept a ban on \n     meatpacker ownership of livestock. That's an important issue \n     to Tyson Foods Inc. Tyson recently bought IBP to make the \n     Springdale-based company the largest meat producer in the \n     world.\n       A bid to kill the ban, backed by both Hutchinson and \n     Lincoln, failed 53-46. IDP officials released a written \n     statement expressing disappointment with the vote.\n       ``IBP depends upon independent livestock operations of all \n     sizes to supply our plants,'' company officials said in a \n     press release. ``While we have no interest in becoming a big \n     player in the livestock feeding business, we believe more \n     government regulation, such as those in the proposed ban, \n     will produce unintended consequences and be detrimental to \n     the livestock industry.''\n       The bill would ban packing companies from owning or having \n     control of cattle, hogs or sheep within two weeks of their \n     slaughter.\n       The provision is wildly popular in the Midwest, where \n     livestock producers fear they are losing their independence \n     and market power as packing houses gain control over \n     livestock production, much as they have already done with the \n     growing of chickens. Poultry was exempt from the Senate \n     legislation.\n       IBP officials said that without some degree of packer \n     participation in livestock production, some plants may have \n     to close.\n       The provision is not part of the House-passed farm will and \n     so would present another issue for the conference committee \n     to settle.\n       An amendment offered Monday by Hutchinson and Lincoln will \n     not make it to the floor. A Hutchinson spokesman said \n     managers of the bill declined to offer an amendment that \n     deals with double-crested cormorants.\n       The large, fish-eating birds are causing havoc for many \n     fish farmers in Arkansas. The senators proposed to let \n     farmers apply to the Agriculture Department for permits to \n     rid their farms of the birds. Now those permits must continue \n     to come from the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n       The Senate voted to add $2.4 billion in disaster assistance \n     to compensate farmers in Montana and other states who lost \n     crops to drought last year. The Bush administration has \n     already said the bill costs too much, but the disaster aid \n     was approved 69-30.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for \nfinal passage of the farm bill. I want to thank Chairman Harkin for his \nhard work and strong leadership in getting this bill through the \nSenate.\n  Not a day goes by that a North Carolina farmer doesn't call my office \nand tell me that he or she can't get credit with a local bank and can't \nmake planting decisions. And you can't really fault the banks; they are \nreluctant to make decisions while some here try to play partisan games \nwith farm programs. We must get this bill passed and to the conference \ncommittee. We must send a signal to our farmers and our farm lenders \nthat their Government will provide them a safety net.\n  But while I recognize the importance of moving this process along, I \nstill have serious reservations about this measure and the effect the \nstringent payment limitations enacted here on this floor will have on \nmy farmers. The Grassley-Dorgan amendment, which I did not support, \ncould quite literally mean the end for many of North Carolina's \nfarmers.\n  Those who supported this amendment did so in an effort to rid the \nfarm subsidy system of abuses and that's an important goal. I don't \nthink there is a person, myself included, who would argue against \nensuring millionaires aren't profiting from Government payments. So I \ndon't question the good faith of those who offered this amendment. But \nif this amendment remains in the final conference report, it won't rid \nthe system of abuses. In fact, his amendment would hurt those hard-\nworking men and women who are trying to make a decent living on family \nfarms.\n  Some people like to call this amendment the ``Scottie Pippen \namendment'' after the basketball player who reportedly received farm \nsubsidies. I am sure we have all heard other stories about millionaires \nsupposedly profiting off of this system. But I want to tell you a story \nabout the real impact of this amendment.\n  Kenneth is a cotton farmer in North Carolina. It costs about $475 an \nacre to grow cotton in North Carolina, and this year the price was \nroughly 36 cents per pound. For Kenneth, that meant he lost about $150 \nan acre--and he would be the first to tell you last year was a good \nyear.\n  So he got by with subsidies and his Loan Deficiency Payments. Kenneth \npoured almost every cent of that money back in to that farm. And if \nthis amendment remains in the final bill, Kenneth will no longer be \neligible for most of the Government's assistance programs and I suspect \nhe wouldn't be able to survive 1 year.\n  And if you think he should just hang it up, then what should he do \nfor the other families who partner with him to work that farm? What do \nyou suggests Kenneth do for the farm hands--all with families to \nsupport--who will be out of work? And let me tell you, eastern North \nCarolina is struggling and employment opportunities are few and far \nbetween.\n  I am sure if you asked him, Kenneth would tell you he doesn't like \nreceiving Government payments. I don't want him to have to give up his \nfarm because we here passed an amendment with unintentional \nconsequences.\n  Talk to my farmers. Talk to the dozens of people who are calling my \noffice every hour scared to death that if this\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\namendment remains in the final conference report, they'll be put out of \nbusiness. They will tell you the reality. And not a single one of them \nis a rich, corporate farmer. They are the salt of the earth, \nhardworking men and women who want to make a decent living on their \nland.\n  None of us wants wealthy people to profit from farm subsidies. But \npayment limitations and gross income caps don't prevent millionaire \nathletes from profiting from farm subsidies; they punish families with \nmassive debt and not a penny of cash flow, no matter what they are \nworth on paper.\n  I urge the conferees to remove this amendment. I trust the conferees \nwill address this problem before they send their report to the full \nSenate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, water laws are always an issue of great \nconcern. However, they are of even greater concern in this day and \nage--especially in the West. This was so evident late last night and \nthis morning when a deal was struck that relieves much of the West from \nparticipating in the Reid-Bingaman Water Conservation Program, but \neffectively sends New Mexico water down the river.\n  All Western Senators, whose States are in much the same situation as \nNew Mexico, opposed the Reid-Bingaman amendment. I came to the floor \ntoday and learned that in an attempt to keep this ill-conceived program \nalive, all Western States with the exception of five--Nevada, New \nMexico, Oregon, California, and Washington--were exempted. This was an \nattempt to get most of the Western Senators who oppose this program \nfrom voting against it in its entirety.\n  I was not consulted about New Mexico being allowed to drop out like \nother Western States because apparently Senator Bingaman wanted to keep \nNew Mexico in the program--a program that is vehemently opposed by the \nNew Mexico Cattle Growers, the New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, \nthe New Mexico Wool Growers, Inc., the New Mexico Public Lands Council, \nthe Dairy Producers of New Mexico, the Arizona and New Mexico Coalition \nof Counties, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, the Elephant \nButte Irrigation District, and the Carlsbad Irrigation District.\n  Major policy changes with regard to State water issues should be \nconsidered carefully. The Reid-Bingaman proposal has never been the \nsubject of a hearing. My staff has been given at least six drafts of \nthis language--a sign that this should be introduced as legislation, \nreferred to committee, and then brought to the Senate with the benefit \nof committee review.\n  The Reid-Bingaman proposal is a State program only in appearance--\nespecially for those Western States who are reclamation States, such as \nNew Mexico. There are many questions left unanswered when it comes to \nreconciling the Reid-Bingaman program with Federal Reclamation law. For \nexample, does the entity that holds water rights in a reclamation \nproject mean the Secretary of the Interior, the irrigation district or \nthe individual landowner who receives the water under contract with the \nirrigation district? Is this relationship altered if the land is under \na management contract or is leased in accordance with reclamation law? \nDo all of these parties have to agree? If one landowner enters into an \nagreement, what happens to the repayment obligations of the irrigation \ndistrict? Can the irrigation district be forced to transfer water \noutside district boundaries by the landowner?\n  Another problem with the Reid-Bingaman program is that it allows the \nSecretary or a State to use condemnation powers under other authority \nto further the purposes of this program. I see nothing in this language \nthat prevents either the Federal Government or a State from extorting \ncompliance and eligibility. It is evident from the comments spoken on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate that the clear objective of this program \nis to take water from farmers for urban needs by laundering water for \nconservation.\n  The Reid-Bingaman program requires that States have a program to \nprotect in stream flows. New Mexico does not have such a program and \nstates that do have a program may not have as comprehensive a program \nas the sponsors of this amendment want. The New Mexico legislature has \npreviously defeated legislation that would create any type of water \nbank or similar program.\n  State water laws--especially in the West--are all different. Yet, the \nthrust of this program seems to be forcing states to conform their \nwater laws into some Federal mold.\n  Additionally, the Reid-Bingaman amendment allows for the transfer of \nwater to a ``designee of the State.'' That could be a third party. \nPresumably, one could be ordered to transfer rights to an urban area or \nprivate group or individual. It is not completely clear, but it seems \nthat state water law, especially as it applies to junior appropriators \nis being preempted.\n  The ``savings'' clause in this amendment is too limited. It does not \npreserve any limitations under other Federal law, nor does it clearly \npreserve interstate compacts, treaties and the myriad of regulations \nthat define interstate streams.\n  Finally, I have heard many claim that this program is strictly \nvoluntary. It is voluntary on its face only. The language is drafted to \nread that anyone who participates is ``willing.'' That is part of what \nis wrong in the West. We don't have enough water and people do not want \nto give up what little of this resource they have. If there were \nwilling sellers out in New Mexico, all of the groups I mentioned above \nwould not oppose the Reid-Bingaman program.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr President, I rise today as we debate the farm bill to \nremind my colleagues of the vulnerability of American agriculture to \nacts of biological terrorism directed against livestock and crops, \ncommonly known as ``agroterrorism.'' In December, I addressed the need \nfor new technologies to detect biological agents that could be used in \nmalicious attacks against our Nation's agricultural industry.\n  The hard-working men and women who provide our meat, poultry, and \ndairy products, our fruits and vegetables, and our lumber and fibers \nnow have a renewed sense of urgency when they consider potential \nthreats to American agriculture. Responding to diseases in plants and \nanimals has always been a fact of life for American farmers and \nranchers. Now they are confronted with the possibility of intentional \nacts to release biological agents that cause disease in crops and \nlivestock.\n  The impact of an animal or crop disease outbreak could be swift and \ndevastating to the U.S. economy. Although the threat to our Nation's \nfood supply is a serious concern when discussing agroterrorism, we must \nremember that the primary purpose of agroterrorism is to inflict \neconomic damage. The combined annual sales from the U.S. agricultural \nsector exceed $100 billion. American agriculture accounts for 13 \npercent of the gross domestic product and nearly 17 percent of domestic \nemployment. The U.S. accounts for about 15 percent of all global \nagricultural exports.\n  The impact of agroterrorism is not a just concern for rural America \nalone. All of America benefits from a healthy agriculture sector. \nTherefore, all of America must share in protecting our critical \nagricultural resources.\n  Agricultural security for American farmers and protection from the \nintentional release of biological agents that cause disease in crops \nand livestock are essential features of the agroterrorism legislation I \nam drafting. My legislation will help American farmers and ranchers \nprotect their investments and livelihood by providing grants or loans \nfor security measures on their farms and ranches.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation, and Federal Services I have held hearings on the need \nfor enhanced coordination of the Federal agencies that respond to acts \nof conventional bioterrorism. The same is true for agroterrorism. By \nstrengthening agency coordination and emergency response planning, we \nwill also be preparing the American agricultural sector to deal with \nboth intentional and natural crop and livestock disease outbreaks when \nthey occur.\n  Many of the diseases that potentially threaten American crops and \nlivestock have been virtually eliminated within the U.S. borders, or \nhave never appeared on American soil. For this reason, a crucial \nelement of agricultural security will involve the surveillance of plant \nand animal disease outbreaks\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nin foreign countries. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and \nPlant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, already serves as an \nagricultural disease watchdog at our borders and around our farms. We \nmust support ongoing APHIS efforts to detect and eradicate diseases at \nhome by establishing stronger connections to the international \ncommunity of agencies and organizations that monitor plant and animal \ndisease outbreaks.\n  A critical component of this legislation will involve establishing a \nlegal framework for agroterrorism, including penalties for those who \nperpetrate destructive acts against crops and livestock. Indeed, acts \nof biological terrorism are not limited to the intentional release of \ndisease agents to harm humans, livestock or crops. Deliberate and \ndestructive acts against agricultural and forestry research programs \nare also routinely perpetrated by extremists who oppose biotechnology. \nThese acts of domestic terrorism do not involve the direct use of \nbiological agents, but they can be just as destructive as the \nintentional release of disease-causing agents.\n  Recently, States from Washington to Maine have experienced \ndestructive attacks on agricultural research projects. Reports of these \nacts of vandalism are often suppressed to avoid drawing further \nattention to the vulnerabilities of Federal and private agricultural \nresearch projects. Quite frequently, these attacks fail to destroy \nbiotechnology experiments. Instead, the hard work accomplished by \nresearchers who use traditional crop breeding methods is wiped out in \nthese senseless and illegal activities.\n  In closing, I would strongly urge my colleagues to lend their \nattention and support to legislative efforts that will benefit all \nsegments of the U.S. agriculture economy. American farmers, Federal, \nState and local emergency managers, law enforcement officers, \nagriculture researchers, and consumers require our help in addressing \nconcerns about the intentional or inadvertent spread of exotic and \nemerging agricultural diseases and the economic security of the United \nStates' agriculture industry.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, nothing the Senate does ths session will be \nmore important than passing a good farm bill that provides a strong \nsafety net and some certainty for our Nation's farmers.\n  I believe that Chairman Harkin has put forward a sincere effort to \naccomplish these goals. However, I find that much to my regret, I must \nvote against this legislation. There are a number or provisions in the \nbill that lead me to this conclusion, but chief among them is that it \nputs at risk our system of water rights in the West. I refuse to \ncompromise Utah's water rights.\n  Under this bill, farmers would be required to sell or lease their \nwater rights to the Federal Government if they choose to participate in \na specific conservation program. This sets a terrible precedent. I \nstrongly oppose using Federal dollars to encourage farmers to give up \ntheir water rights. The Federal Government has enormous financial \nresources with which it could purchase unlimited acre-feet of precious \nwater in the West. I cannot support a large incentive aimed at \nstripping our farmers of the resource that makes our way of life \npossible in the West.\n  The water conservation program I am referring to would also create an \nunprecedented link between the Endangered Species Act and farm \nprograms. I have no doubt that this will lead to conflicts between the \ngoals of the act and the livelihood of our farmers. From what I have \nseen, when such a conflict arises the farmer always loses. Our farm \nfamilies struggle enough. We shouldn't add to this burden.\n  From a broader perspective, I disagree with the overall approach of \nthis farm bill. I believe it is a return to the outdated, socialistic \nfarm policies of the past. As it is written it, 60 percent of farmers \nwill not benefit from the programs in this bill. The bill provides many \nbillions of dollars on subsidies for overproduced commodity crops such \nas wheat, cotton, and corn. These crops are important, but what about \nthe many crops being grown by other farmers? In my opinion, the Harkin \nfarm bill does too little for farmers of minor crops, who face just as \nmany difficulties as the farmers of the main commodities.\n  Still, it is very difficult for me to vote against the farm bill \ntoday, because there are provisions in it that Utah's farmers \ndesperately need. I was particularly pleased that the Wool Marketing \nLoan Deficiency Payment Program for our struggling wool growers was \nincluded. This was one of my top priorities. Also important, was the \npassage of the Baucus amendment, which I supported, that would give \nneeded emergency financial assistance to livestock producers and apple \ngrowers who have suffered losses due to drought conditions. Finally, I \nwas able to add a provision that would begin the process of creating a \nfree market for state inspected meat products. Of course, I will fight \nto keep these provisions in the bill as it goes through the conference \ncommittee.\n  These and other aspects of the farm bill are worthy of my support. \nHowever, I do not believe we should benefit farmers on one hand, and \nthreaten their livelihoods and water rights on the other. That is not \nwhat a Farm Bill should do, and for that reason I oppose it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning my \namendment No. 2852 to the farm bill, S. 1731. As chairman of the \nOceans, Atmosphere and Fisheries Subcommittee I am pleased to be joined \nby my ranking member, Senator Snowe, in offering this amendment. In \naddition, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Kennedy and Collins, \ntwo other New England Senators, who know all too well the problems that \nour fishermen face in New England.\n  This amendment will permanently revoke Northeast multi-species \nfishing permits using a ``reverse auction,'' a measure that has been \ndeveloped to ensure we remove the maximum amount of capacity from the \nfishery at the lowest possible price to the taxpayers. We have more \nthan 1,600 permits in New England. Approximately two-thirds of these \npermits allow fishermen to fish for only 88 days each year. The \nremaining fishermen can fish, on average, 130 days a year based on \nhistorical days-at-sea usage. As a result of a similar provision we \nsecured in July of 2000, the National Marine Fisheries Service has \nbegun the process of reducing latent capacity in this fishery, but \nrecent events have indicated the need to expand the program further.\n  While the New England stocks are slowly recovering after years of \nsubstantial restrictions, additional limits are coming. The most recent \nscientific advice suggests that we need to cut days-at-sea by 65 \npercent in order to meet our 10-year rebuilding targets for Gulf of \nMaine cod. Basically, two-thirds of New England fishermen could be down \nto 31 days a year of fishing, from the 88 days they are allotted today. \nObviously working families would be severely affected by such cuts. We \nalso desperately need to reduce capacity so that the size of the \nfishery is in proportion to the available resource. The current latent \npermit capacity reduction program will help tremendously, but I am \nconvinced a second round is needed to build a sustainable fishery.\n  To add pressure to this already difficult situation, the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia will shortly be issuing its \ndetermination on additional management measures that must be taken in \nthis fishery to meet Federal legal requirements as the result of a \nlawsuit filed by a number of conservation groups against the National \nMarine Fisheries Service. The plaintiffs have already prevailed in that \ncase, in which the court found unequivocally that the Federal \nGovernment, which has the authority to approve or disapprove plans \ndeveloped by the New England Fishery Management Council, had not \nensured that these plans included rebuilding measures required under \nthe management plan nor measures to limit the bycatch of fish. In this \nfishery, bycatch largely results from vessel-specific mortality \ncontrols called ``trip limits.'' I must agree, as does every fisherman \nI know, the idea of throwing fish overboard in order to meet management \ngoals designed to increase fish abundance is both counterintuitive and \nwasteful. In order to fix the problem we need to increase the trip \nlimits for our fishermen so they no longer have to waste good fish in \norder to make a day's pay. However, we cannot increase these trip \nlimits until we have reduced the number of permits available for this \nfishery.\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\n  This is unfortunately a long-term problem for many traditional \nfishing communities in New England. This money will allow some \nfishermen to retire with dignity, others no doubt will seek job \nretraining and enter another profession. I am grateful to the managers \nof this bill, Senators Harkin and Lugar, for agreeing to a voice vote \non this amendment. I am confident that this money will allow us to \nbuild both sustainable fisheries and sustainable fishing communities in \nNew England in the years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation and for working through this bill. It has taken a good \nwhile. But I believe, all in all, we have come out with a well-balanced \nbill. It is a comprehensive bill, and it does reflect a great deal of \nbipartisan cooperation.\n  I especially commend and thank my ranking member, Senator Lugar, the \nformer chairman of this committee, for all of his help and his support, \nhis guidance, his suggestions, his very close working relationship to \nget this bill through. We had an excellent working relationship in the \ncommittee. We did that expeditiously.\n  I knew we were going to have to have votes on the floor. As it turned \nout, we did have quite a few on different parts of the bill. But I \nbelieve, all in all, the relationship has been a great relationship. I \nthank Senator Lugar and his staff for that.\n  I also thank Senator Reid for all of his help in pulling people \ntogether and getting the votes structured and making sure that we had \nan orderly process on the floor.\n  I thank our majority leader, Senator Daschle, also a member of the \nAgriculture Committee, for all of his guidance and leadership in \nbringing this bill to its final conclusion.\n  I thank Senator Lott on the other side for working with us. There \nwere numerous times when I went to Senator Lott, and we discussed what \nwe were going to do. I can say, without any hesitation, at no time was \nhe less than most helpful in moving this process along. So I thank \nSenator Lott for that.\n  We have had some disagreements, of course. That is the crucible of \ndemocracy that we have. We have had our votes. But what may not have \nbeen fully reflected on the floor is the extraordinary degree, I \nbelieve, of bipartisan cooperation and collaboration we have had \nthroughout the bill.\n  As I mentioned a number of times, all titles that we reported out of \nthe Committee were reported on bipartisan votes. We have a demonstrated \nbipartisan majority for this bill on the Senate floor.\n  So, as I say, the bill is comprehensive. It is balanced. It is the \neconomic recovery vehicle and jobs bill for rural America. We have met \nour responsibilities to farm families, rural communities, consumers, \nand the environment. We have done so while fully complying with our \nbudget limitations.\n  I believe the highlights of the bill are the following:\n  First, we restore and rebuild the farm income safety net that has \nbeen missing for the last 6 years.\n  Second, we have doubled our commitment to conservation. There are \nmore resources devoted to conservation in this bill than any farm bill \nthat has ever come to the Senate. We are proud of that. We have a new \nconservation program--the Conservation Security Program--that will move \nus in a new direction in this country, that will expand conservation to \nevery part of America. Whether it is a corn or soybean field in Iowa, \nan orchard in Michigan, a citrus orchard in Florida, a vegetable farm \nin New Jersey, or an almond farm in California, this Conservation \nSecurity Program is going to promote conservation throughout the \ncountry.\n  Third, on rural development, we include substantial new funding for a \nvariety of rural community development activities. We also create and \nfund new rural development initiatives, including new programs for \nrural equity capital investments in rural America. Senator Lugar and \nhis staff, and my staff, have worked closely together to develop this \nconsensus rural development title. I believe it is going to provide for \ncrucial new investment in rural America.\n\n  Fourth, we have a new title in the farm bill that has never been in \nany farm bill, a renewable energy title, with $550 million mandatory \nspending over 5 years for things such as ethanol and soy diesel, and \nfor biomass, wind energy, and hydrogen energy. If nothing else, we \nlearned from September 11, I think, that we have to address our \ndependance on foreign oil. This bill will start to do that by \ndeveloping the renewable energy resources in our country.\n  Fifth, nutrition. In our bill we now over twice what the \nadministration proposed. The administration proposed $4.2 billion in \nincreased nutrition spending over the next 10 years. We have $8.9 \nbillion in this bill. So we can be proud of the fact that we make this \ngreat effort to make sure no one goes to bed hungry in America, to make \nsure we have an adequate system of nutrition assistance through food \nstamps, emergency food assistance and commodity distribution, in \naddition to school breakfast and school lunch and other programs.\n  Lastly, on credit, agricultural trade, agricultural research--all of \nthese titles make substantial improvements to what we have done in the \npast.\n  So, in conclusion, I thank Senator Lugar. I thank all of the staff. I \nthank the staff on our side. I want to thank all of them by name: \nVershawn Perkins, Frank Newkirk, and Bob Sturm. I especially thank Bob \nbecause all of the time we were out of our office in the Hart Building, \nwe crowded into his space. I really thank Bob Sturm for all of his help \nin working out the situation of taking care of our staff.\n  I thank Terri Roney, Lloyd Ritter, Charlie Rawls, Erin Peterson, Doug \nO'Brien, Stephanie Mercier, Mary Langowski, Jay Klug, Susan Keith, Eric \nJuzenas, Sara Hopper, Amy Fredregill, Alison Fox, Kevin Brown, Seth \nBoffeli, Karil Bialostosky, Rich Bender, and, of course, our \noutstanding staff director, Mark Halverson.\n  I cannot say enough good things about Mark and all of the long hours \nhe has put in. I do not know if he has slept in the last 4 months. I do \nnot know if he has or not, but I think he deserves a break now. He has \nperformed superlatively in, guiding, directing, and working with our \nstaffs.\n  On the other side I will not mention all of the minority staff. I \nknow Senator Lugar already did. But I do want to mention Keith Luse, \nthe minority staff director, formerly the majority staff director. \nAgain, I thank Keith Luse for all of his wonderful working \nrelationships with me personally, with Mark Halverson, Charlie Rawls, \nand all the people on our staff. It has just been outstanding. I just \ncannot thank you enough for all the kindness and generosity you have \ngiven to me and to our staff throughout this process.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a bill that we can go to conference with \nthat we can be proud of. It had strong bipartisan support as we came \nout of committee. We worked our problems out on the floor, and I think \nwe have a bill that will revitalize and renew rural America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nfinal passage of H.R. 2646 occur at 12:30 p.m. today with rule XII, \nparagraph 4, waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are moving to final passage of the \nfarm bill shortly. I would like to make a couple of comments prior to \nthe time we have the vote.\n  First, I commend our chairman for the extraordinary job he has done. \nHe has been remarkable over a long period of time. His leadership and \nhis cooperation and the tremendous effort he has put forth are to be \ncommended.\n  Again, one of the most able ranking members we have in the Senate is \nthe ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar. \nI admire him immensely for his intellect and for his ability to work \nwith people on all sides and all philosophies. Once again, he \ndemonstrated his ability, his leadership, and the kind of person he is \neach and every day he came to the floor. I commend him as well.\n  Let me also commend, as Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar did, the \nstaff. We are very dependent upon our\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\nstaff on all pieces of legislation; in particular, on the complexities \nof agricultural policy. I must say for the record and emphatically \nremind my colleagues of the work that they do, especially the staff I \nam fortunate to have in my office. I am very grateful to them for their \nwork, for their persistence, for their ability to come up with \ncompromises oftentimes when we really had not thought there was one. I \nthank them publicly and thank them especially today as we bring this \ndebate to a close.\n  This has been the longest debate on a farm bill in over 30 years. \nSometimes it has felt that way. Thanks to the work done in the \ncommittee and on the floor, we now have a farm bill and a farm policy \nthat is improved in many ways, providing certainty for producers and \nincreased commitment to conservation, expanded nutrition, provisions \nmaking farmers and ranchers more competitive, and needed assistance for \nrural development.\n\n  I know we have had disagreements over the time period in which we \nneeded to get this farm bill moving. In the end, though, this is a good \nbill. It will do a lot for rural America that is hurting right now, a \nrural America that is hurting in large part due to the failure of our \ncurrent farm policy. Now we need to take the final step and pass it.\n  Agriculture and the farm economy provide roughly $1.3 trillion to our \neconomy and account for 24 million jobs. Rural America comprises 80 \npercent of our Nation's landmass and 20 percent of our population.\n  Our Nation literally cannot afford to leave rural America behind. Yet \nrural America is hurting as never before. Farmers have already seen \nprices drop every single year since the current farm bill was approved. \nThey are getting roughly half the prices they were receiving in 1996. \nThe record price drops farmers have seen in recent months and the \nwarnings from USDA that farm income could drop another 20 percent add a \nlevel of urgency to this debate.\n  A recent study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that farmers \nand ranchers are expected to lose 238,000 jobs over the next 10 years. \nThat is more than any sector of the U.S. economy. That is nearly the \npopulation of St. Louis or Pittsburgh or Minneapolis.\n  We just cannot let that happen. Unless we pass this bill now and get \na new law soon, USDA will not be able to implement it for this crop \nyear. Instead, we would leave farm families to rely on a law so flawed \nthat we have needed to grant emergency assistance for each of the last \n4 years. Make no mistake, passage of this bill is essential for the \nsurvival of rural America.\n  This fall, I was in my State and met a ranch couple named Hight. When \ndisaster struck on September 11, Don and Adeline Hight of Murdo sold \n100 calves and donated the proceeds, about $40,000, to help victims of \nthe attack. The manager of the local livestock association called their \ndonation ``an act of true Americanism.''\n  Rural families have always sacrificed for our country. They have been \nfacing a disaster now for years. With this bill, we have a chance to \nprovide certainty to producers, fix our failed farm safety net, and \nhelp address the challenges we face in rural America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can move immediately \nto conference with the House and then present the bill to the President \nfor his signature as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from \nMaine would like to address us. I invite her to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that legislation I \nauthored has been included in the final version of the farm bill. The \nlegislation, known as the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open \nSpace Initiative Act, would help to combat the threat of suburban \nsprawl which has already consumed tens of thousands of acres of forest \nland in the southern part of my home State.\n  I very much appreciate the assistance of Senator Lugar and Senator \nHarkin, as well as Senators Jack Reed and Mike Crapo, who have worked \nwith me to put together this initiative.\n  Sprawl occurs because the economic value of forest or farmland cannot \ncompete with the value of developed land. In my home State, the problem \nis particularly acute in southern Maine where over a 100-percent \nincrease in urbanized land over the past two decades has resulted in \nGreater Portland being labeled as the ``sprawl capital of the \nNortheast.''\n  I am alarmed by the amount of working forest land and open space that \nhas given way to strip malls and cul-du-sacs. Our State is trying hard \nto respond to this challenge. The people of Maine have approved a bond \nissue to preserve land through the Land for Maine's Future board, and \nthey continue to use scarce local funds and contribute their time and \nmoney to preserve special lands and to support our State's 88 land \ntrusts.\n  Of course, the problem of sprawl is not limited just to Maine or to \nthe Northeast. Rapid, unmanageable growth affects many States and poses \na significant threat to forest land across the United States.\n  The effects of sprawl were highlighted by a study conducted by the \nU.S. Forest Service last year. It examined forests in 13 southern \nStates and found that 12 million acres of southern forest land could be \nlost to sprawl by the year 2020.\n  In Maine and elsewhere, communities are working hard to come up with \nnew strategies to protect our working forests and to safeguard our \ncommunities from the effects of sprawl. I think it is time for the \nFederal Government to lend a hand to these efforts.\n  My legislation, which was drafted with the advice of landowners, \nconservation groups, and forestry experts, would establish a $50 \nmillion grant program within the Forest Service to support locally \ndriven projects that preserve working forests. State and local \ngovernments as well as nonprofit organizations could compete for funds \nto purchase land or conservation easements to keep forest lands in \ntheir traditional uses.\n  The $50 million that would be authorized by my legislation would help \nachieve a number of stewardship objectives. First, it would help \nprevent forest fragmentation and preserve working forests, helping to \nmaintain the supply of timber that fuels Maine's most significant \nindustries. Second, the resources made available would be a valuable \ntool for communities that are struggling to properly manage growth and \nprevent sprawl. Currently, if a community were to turn to the Federal \nGovernment for assistance, none would be found.\n  My bill will change that by making the Federal Government an active \npartner in preserving forest land and managing sprawl, while leaving \ndecisionmaking to States and communities.\n  Mr. President, by enacting this legislation, Congress will provide a \nmuch needed boost to local conservation initiatives and will help \nsustain the vitality of our natural-resource-based communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of endorsement from the Maine \nNature Conservancy, the Maine Audubon Society, and the National \nAssociation of State Foresters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                           of State Foresters,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Association \n     of State Foresters, I would like to thank you for your \n     efforts to reduce the impacts of urban and suburban sprawl on \n     our nation's forest lands. Your proposed amendment, the \n     Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative, to \n     Chairman Harkin's Farm Bill (S. 1731) demonstrates your \n     commitment to minimizing conversion of suburban forest lands \n     to non forest uses.\n       We support the overall concepts of the legislation. NASF \n     does not currently have a position on whether easements or \n     title to land purchased with federal funds should be expanded \n     from state to non-profit entities. However, maintaining \n     working forested lands in suburban environments is consistent \n     with NASF's goals.\n       As the Southern Forest Resource Assessment recently \n     released by the U.S. Forest Service clearly demonstrates, one \n     of the major threats to forest land is urban sprawl.\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\n     The provisions in the Forestry Title of S. 1731 provide \n     important tools to enable landowners to keep their land in \n     trees and sustain the public benefits their forests provide. \n     Your amendment is another tool to address this critical \n     concern.\n       Thank you for your commitment to sustainable forest \n     management and to reducing suburban sprawl.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Larry A. Kotchman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Maine Audubon Society,\n\n                                   Falmouth, ME, November 2, 2001.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: We are pleased to be able to offer \n     our support of your proposed Suburban and Community Forestry \n     and Open Space Initiative Act of 2001, which would expand \n     opportunities for conserving forestland under the Cooperative \n     Forestry Assistance program. This Act offers a new \n     opportunity to protect some of the remaining actively managed \n     forestlands that provide habitat for many of our native \n     species, and encourages those lands to be managed \n     sustainably, with input and use from the local community. \n     This Act comes at a time when pressure to develop small \n     woodlands in southern Maine is ever increasing, interest in \n     conserving those woodlands is also increasing, but funds for \n     forest conservation are still limited.\n       Southern and Coastal Maine has the highest level of woody \n     plant and wildlife species diversity in the state. \n     Unfortunately, this area is one of the most desirable for \n     development and increasing development pressures are creating \n     a checkerboard of non-contiguous habitat for wildlife. \n     Although the overall population is relatively stable in \n     southern Maine, residents of larger towns and cities are \n     moving to surrounding rural communities, with residential \n     development, both permanent and seasonal homes, spreading \n     into large expresses of formerly agricultural and forested \n     open space.\n       In its final report dated January 1996, the Maine \n     Environmental Priorities Project (MEPP) concluded that \n     ``patterns of development throughout southern and coastal \n     Maine and in riparian zones statewide seriously threatened \n     some species and some rare and critical habitats as well as \n     the overall productivity of Maine's terrestrial ecosystems.'' \n     Protecting forest land throughout southern Maine wildlife.\n       During the past two years Maine Audubon, in concert with \n     several other state and federal agencies and nonprofit \n     conservation organizations, has been conducting outreach to \n     municipalities and land trusts to encourage the conservation \n     of forestland, including large blocks of underveloped and \n     unfragmented forestland that provide habitat for a wide \n     variety of Maine's native plants and animals. We are \n     providing local citizens with information about the high \n     value habitats in their community, and many of those we have \n     spoken with are intersted in acting to conserve forest land \n     but have few choices for funding land protection. If the bill \n     passes, we will be able to suggest a new source of funds for \n     their hard work.\n       Thank you for taking the initiative to help conserve \n     Maine's forest landscape and all the public benefits they \n     provide amidst the threat of sprawl. We look forward to \n     working with you on passage of the bill and on the subsequent \n     rule-making which will speak out just have the bill would be \n     implemented.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Sally Stockwell,\n     Director of Conservation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    The Trust for Public Land,\n\n                                   Portland, ME, November 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Trust for Public \n     Land, I am pleased to express our support for the Suburban \n     and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative Act of 2001. \n     This proposal will provide a much-needed focus on working \n     forests that provide important resources in and around \n     Maine's towns and cities that are facing significant \n     development pressures. We applaud your foresight in \n     addressing this issue.\n       As the Trust for Public Land pursues its mission of \n     protecting land for people in Maine, we are acutely aware of \n     the difficult choices many landowners face as land values \n     rise and development pressures intensify. In addition, the \n     forest lands that lie in the path of development are \n     incredibly important to local residents for a variety of \n     resources, including recreation, wildlife habitat, water \n     quality and open space. Your legislation will allow these \n     critical lands to remain intact as community assets by \n     focusing federal assistance to landowners in areas affected \n     by suburban sprawl. This is a much-needed addition to the \n     resource conservation efforts that states, localities and \n     non-governmental partners are already undertaking and will \n     provide the extra funding leverage needed to successfully \n     meet the challenges of the future.\n       Our work with willing sellers across the state leads us to \n     believe that the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open \n     Space Initiative Act of 2001 will make a difference in many \n     Maine communities and will leave them in good shape for \n     future generations. Maine's forest resources are absolutely \n     critical to the quality of life that attracts residents and \n     visitors alike, and proposals like this one will ensure that \n     we address the conservation of those resources wisely.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this and many other issues \n     affecting Maine. We look forward to working with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jennifer Melville,\n     Maine Field Office.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Nature Conservancy,\n\n                                  Brunswick, ME, November 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Trustees and 13,000 \n     members of The Nature Conservancy of Maine, I am writing to \n     you in support of your recently filed Suburban and Community \n     Forestry and Open Space Initiative Act of 2001.\n       From the St. John project in Northern Maine to the Machias \n     River downeast to Mt. Agamenticus in the South, the Nature \n     Conservancy is working in partnership with local communities, \n     the state, and federal governments to protect the best \n     remaining natural place in our state. As population continues \n     to increase in southern Maine, it is becoming increasingly \n     clear that growth and development could overtake and destroy \n     some of southern Maine's most outstanding forests and natural \n     areas. Your legislation could play an important role in \n     forever protecting these places. Two key sites, in \n     particular, come to mind as projects that could benefit from \n     Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative \n     funds:\n       Leavitt Plantation Project, Parsonsfield: Encompassing \n     8,600 contiguous acres, Leavitt Plantation represents the \n     largest remaining block of forestland in one ownership south \n     of Sebago Lake. Threatened by sprawl and development, this \n     forest includes identified deer wintering and waterfowl/\n     wading bird habitat, and populations of seventeen rare \n     plants. The Leavitt Plantation Forest was to be cut up into \n     as many as 13 parcels early last year. The land's fate as \n     wildlife habitat, hunting and fishing grounds, hiking and \n     snowmobiling destination, and as an economic resource for the \n     region hung in the balance. Today, thanks to the cooperative \n     approach of a forest investment company, a conservation \n     group, the State, a small Maine town, area citizens and more, \n     this land is slated to be protected forever. But additional \n     funds are needed to complete the conservation of this \n     project.\n       Mt. Agamenticus, York, South Berwick, Elliot, Wells, \n     Ogunquit: Mt. Agamenticus, located in rapidly developing York \n     County, is the largest block of unfragmented, undeveloped \n     land near the coast between Baltimore and Portland. This vast \n     area is rich in native plants and wildlife, and home to \n     important and rare species. The forest also provides an \n     economic boost to the region. Mt. Agamenticus is also one of \n     the largest remaining recreational open spaces in southern \n     coastal Maine, the area is popular with birders, hikers, \n     bikers, and hunters, and a ``Mecca'' for mountain biking in \n     New England and the area consistently draws visitors from all \n     over the country to experience the mountain. In this rapidly \n     growing area of southern Maine, large, vast areas of open \n     space are becoming very scarce. The remaining forested lands \n     of Mt. Agamenticus area are threatened by sprawl and \n     development. However, if funded, a plan is in place to \n     protect this area for the benefit of the citizens of Maine \n     and future generations.\n       The Nature Conservancy supports your efforts to bring \n     additional federal funds to projects like these in Southern \n     Maine and throughout the state. Conservation of these great \n     places requires a commitment from the private sector as well \n     as from government, we appreciate your willingness to provide \n     leadership on such a vital issue to the people of Maine.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Kent Wommack,\n     Executive Director/Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Friends of Acadia,\n\n                                 Bar Harbor, ME, October 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Susan: Friends of Acadia offers its full support for \n     the anti-sprawl bill you have initiated. It will have utility \n     across Maine.\n       Your proposal is of special interest in our region. It \n     offers a real hope of dealing with the sprawl that is \n     consuming so much of the Route 3 gateway landscape on the \n     mainland just above Mount Desert Island and Acadia National \n     Park.\n       Please let me know how we can help you advance this \n     important legislation.\n       Thank you for your leadership.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                    W. Kent Olson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Maine Coast Heritage Trust,\n\n                                     Topsham ME, October 26, 2001.\n     Re Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative \n         Act of 2001.\n\n     Senator Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: It is with great enthusiasm that I \n     write to express Maine Coast Heritage Trust's support for \n     your far-sighted Suburban and Community Forestry and Open \n     Space Initiative.\n       Maine's rural and suburban lands are changing fast as more \n     people move into Maine or move out of Maine's urban areas\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\n     and into the rural countryside. This pattern of development \n     is altering the character of our state by diminishing both \n     its traditional villages and surrounding open farms and \n     forests. It also has a significant impact on local and state \n     budgets as expensive new schools and roads are built to \n     service these new neighborhoods.\n       Your initiative would provide important federal funds to be \n     matched by state and private dollars. As you know, Maine \n     voters showed their strong support for conserving open land \n     when they overwhelmingly endorsed the $50 million Land for \n     Maine's Future bond in 1999. Furthermore, the success of \n     Maine's 88 land trusts (perhaps the highest number of trusts \n     per capita in the nation) is a testament to Mainers' \n     commitment to maintaining the rural character of the state. \n     Your proposal would help leverage hard-won public and private \n     dollars.\n       I was particularly pleased to learn that your proposal \n     would complement the Forest Legacy Program. Forest Legacy has \n     been a critically important source of federal funds for \n     conserving large tracts of Maine's northwoods. Its \n     continuation is vital.\n       Thank you ever so much for your creative leadership and \n     hard work on behalf of land conservation efforts in Maine and \n     across America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James J. Espy,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Congress may now be closer to \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform than at any time in 30 years. It \nholds the promise of restoring public confidence by reducing the amount \nof money flowing into American politics while simultaneously reducing \nthe costs of campaigns themselves. It gives a fair chance to \nchallengers, an opportunity for people to bring different ideas and a \nbroader national debate because we end the dominance of special \ninterests money.\n  This can be an extraordinary, even historic week in the life of the \nCongress. But the well-crafted balance reached in the Senate is now in \njeopardy. Campaign finance reform has meant a change in various \ninstitutions within our political culture. One of those institutions is \nresisting the change. I am speaking of the network broadcast industry. \nJust as political candidates would be challenged under the law to raise \nless money under stricter limits, and the political parties would \noperate under different rules, and the American people would operate \nunder more restrictions to assure that money did not dominate the \nprocess, the broadcast industry, operating under Federal license in the \nuse of the public airways, would be challenged to reduce the costs of \nadvertising for Federal campaigns.\n  The Congress could have insisted on free air time. We could have \ninsisted that time be made available for public debate as in many of \nthe great democracies of Western Europe. Our request was much more \nmodest. Indeed, our request was to put into law that which we believe \nwe had done 30 years ago anyway. In 1971, Congress required that the \nnetworks provide advertising rates at the lowest unit rate. Through \nevasion, by finding loopholes in the law, the television networks have \nevaded their responsibility under the law.\n  Senators Corzine, Durbin, Enzi, and many of my colleagues offered an \namendment on the floor of the Senate, adopted 69 to 31, on a bipartisan \nbasis, requiring once again that the networks provide television \nadvertising at the lowest unit rate in the period immediately before a \nprimary and general election. We did this because a 1990 audit by the \nFCC found that 80 percent of network television affiliates were failing \nto make time available as required by law at the lowest unit rate, \nmeaning that a typical candidate ad sold for 65 percent more than what \nshould have been charged--65 percent higher costs than should have been \nrequired had the law been followed.\n  If in this debate on campaign finance reform we lower the amount of \nmoney raised without lowering the costs of the campaigns themselves, we \nwill have achieved very little. The best funded incumbents will always \nfind the resources to advertise. The question is, What about those \ncandidates for Federal office who do not represent popular ideas or \npowerful interests? And what of the challengers who would challenge the \nstatus quo, represent new ideas or sometimes unpopular ideas? They will \nnever have the resources to enter into the national political debate.\n  The goal of campaign finance reform is not to lessen the national \ndebate. It is not to bring less political discussion to the country. It \nis to have a more vibrant debate, of more varied ideas, less\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\nrepresented by the requirement of political fundraising.\n  If, indeed, the national broadcasters, represented by millions of \ndollars' worth of lobbying--and, ironically, the use of their own \npolitical contributions--succeed in removing this provision from \ncampaign finance reform, not only have we achieved very little but we \nadd a new distortion to the national political debate.\n\n  In the New York metropolitan area, it is not uncommon to charge \n$30,000, $40,000, and $50,000 for a 30-second ad. How will these ads be \npurchased? This applies in Chicago or Los Angeles or Miami or Boston. \nWe have eliminated soft money; we are adding restrictions to reduce the \namount of money. The simple truth is, most candidates will not be able \nto afford them at all.\n  The costs have not stopped rising. Since 1996, the cost of political \nadvertising in some jurisdictions has increased another 30 percent, and \nit will keep rising as candidates compete not with each other for time \nbut with General Motors or Ford or General Foods or Procter & Gamble.\n  What have we done to our political system when candidates have to \nraise money in obscene amounts, from hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans, to buy the public air time on federally licensed stations, \nair time that belongs to the American people, in order to communicate \nin the middle of a Federal campaign public policy issues? There is no \nother Western democracy that has such a system because no one else \nwould tolerate it--and neither should we.\n  How is it that American politics has deteriorated into this endless \nspiral of campaign finance, where candidates should be spending their \ntime thinking of new ideas, challenging each other for the Nation's \nfuture, where Members of Congress should spend their time legislating, \nspend time with the American people who have problems--not just the \nAmerican people who have money?\n  How did we get here? How did it happen? It is not by chance. In the \naverage Senate campaign, 85 percent of the money raised is going to the \ntelevision networks. Every year, it is a larger percentage; every year, \na higher bill. Yet the broadcasters are arguing that this is \nunconstitutional--we are taking their property.\n  For 30 years there has been a requirement that they make the lowest \nunit rate available. If it was constitutional then, it is \nconstitutional now. They just evaded the law. Every one of them, when \nthey got a Federal license to broadcast, agreed to comply with Federal \nlaw and to serve a public purpose. This is no taking. They still will \nbe able to charge exorbitant fees, just the same fees they are charging \nother corporate customers at different times of the year. We have a \nright to do it. There is a precedent to do it. And it is fair to put \nthese restrictions on broadcasters.\n  Second, they say this will lead to perpetual campaigns, reducing the \ncost of advertising so there is nothing but campaigns, year to year, \nyear after year, all year. The legislation passed by the Senate only \nmakes the lowest unit rate available 45 days before a primary and 60 \ndays before a general election. There are no perpetual campaigns. The \ntime limits are actually quite strict.\n  Then the broadcasters argue that this is such an onerous burden that \nthey can financially not survive, they can't deal with the cost of \nmaking the lowest unit rate available. They are charging political \ncandidates $1 billion to advertise. It is estimated that this will be a \nreduction of $250 million. I believe the networks, still collecting \nthree-quarters of a billion dollars in political advertising, are doing \nquite well by this system.\n  Indeed, the reduction from making the lowest unit rate available \nwould equal less than 1 percent of the $41 billion in ad revenue. If \nevery other segment of our society can deal with change in order to \nrestore integrity in this political process--the political parties \nforego soft money, Federal candidates eliminate soft money, the \nAmerican people live with these restrictions, American business accepts \nthese restrictions--can the broadcasters themselves under Federal \nlicense, challenged to use the airwaves for the public good, not accept \na 1-percent reduction in ad revenue?\n  It is an extraordinary irony that the media, having rightfully \nchallenged the Congress to change the political fundraising system, \nhaving put so much scrutiny on campaign fundraising, has played a vital \nrole in bringing us to this historic moment. But what an irony. While \nthe network anchors rail against the campaign finance system, \nchallenging the Congress to change it, their corporate executives pay \nmillions of dollars in lobbying fees, as we speak, to lobbyists who \nline the Halls of the House of Representatives, and PAC directors who \nuse the leverage of their political contributions to attempt to \nintimidate the Congress into eliminating them from this process of \nchange.\n  I hope this provision of campaign finance reform remains intact. But, \nif it fails, this Senate will face a difficult moment: The specter of a \nnew campaign finance system in which the amount of money raised will be \ndramatically reduced, but the cost of the campaigns themselves will \ncontinue to dramatically rise.\n  I recognize that most Members of this Senate can adjust to the new \nsystem. Powerful incumbents will find the means to raise the money. But \nwhat of the young man or woman who has different ideas, one who \nrepresents no powerful interests, who may not live in a State of great \nwealth or come from a wealthy family? They, too, would like to serve in \nthe Senate. They, too, have contributions to make to our political \nsystem. They, too, believe in our country. There is a chance that by \nthe reforms that we passed they will be silenced; for who among them, \nin raising campaigns funded only by hard money, with access to no other \nresources, can pay their share of the $1 billion in advertising costs \nthat are the modern equivalent of a gold soap box that the Founding \nFathers would have had as a restriction to the exercise of free speech?\n  What free speech is there, what kind of open political system do we \nhave, if the only means of running for public office is purchasing the \ngold soap box of our time, a $1 billion price of entry to the network \ntelevision affiliates? Indeed, that is no free speech at all. That is \nnot an open, competitive political process.\n  So the next great hurdle of campaign finance reform is now. Do we \nhold firm, those 69 of us on a bipartisan basis who insisted that as \nfundraising is controlled, so, too, must be the costs?\n  I ask my colleagues to remain committed, not for themselves or their \ninterests but for those who would follow us and for those who believe \nthis political system is open and fair to all those who wish to serve \ntheir country in the years to come.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.

Mr. President, in his State of the Union address on January \n29, President Bush reminded the nation, at great length and in great \ndetail, that we are a nation at war, and that we will stop at nothing \nto rid the world of terrorism.\n  His words were stirring, his message sweeping.\n  The war on terror, he said, has only begun:\n\n       Tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large. \n     These enemies view the entire world as a battlefield, and we \n     must pursue them wherever they are.\n\n  Strong words--strong words indeed.\n  The President outlined an ambitious agenda for the war against \nterrorism: first, to shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist \nplans, and bring terrorists to justice. Second, to prevent terrorists \nand regimes that seek chemical, biological or nuclear weapons from \nthreatening the United States or the world. The President singled out \nthree such regimes--Iran, Iraq, and North Korea--describing them as an \n``axis of evil'' that is posing a grave and growing danger to the \nworld.\n  The President's speech laid out a sweeping plan for the U.S. response \nto\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\nglobal terrorism. It is a manifesto that he has stated many times to \nmany different audiences in the days following that address. At Eglin \nAir Force Base in Florida last week--Feb. 4--the President told \ncheering troops that ``We're absolutely resolved to find terrorists \nwhere they hide and to root them out one by one. . . . History has \ncalled us into action, and we will not stop until the threat of global \nterrorism has been destroyed.'' Strong words--strong words, indeed.\n  Less there be any doubt as to where I stand, I have been a hawk on \ndefense issues for all of my 50 years in Congress.\n  When I came to Congress 50 years ago this year, I was strongly \nopposed to the entry of Red China into the United Nations. I supported \nthe war in Vietnam and the budgetary requests that President Johnson \nmade. I supported down to the last penny his budgetary requests for \ndefense.\n  When I came to this body 44 years ago, I went on the Appropriations \nCommittee at the beginning of my service in this body, and I have been \non the Appropriations Committee 44 years this year.\n  I spoke highly of President Bush last Friday in my reference to his \nspeech at the National Prayer Breakfast. His expressions concerning \nfaith I complimented on the floor.\n  But when it comes to national defense, let nobody have any doubts as \nto where I stand. I was supporting national defense and appropriations \nfor national defense in Congress when our President, Mr. Bush, was in \nknee pants. On two committees, I served with the late Senator Richard \nRussell of Georgia. He was chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He \nwas chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He held both positions--\nnot at the same time but at different times when I was on his \ncommittees. I was on the Appropriations Committee and I was on the \nArmed Services Committee. I supported Senator Stennis of Mississippi, \nwho was one of the giants of the Senate. So I need no one to stand \nbeside me and bear witness to my support for national defense.\n  During the war in Vietnam, I was majority whip in the Senate during \npart of the war. I was also secretary of the Democratic Conference \nduring part of that war. There was pretty much solid, undivided support \nalmost at first. Then there developed a divisiveness among Senators on \nthe war in Vietnam.\n\n  The late Senator Mike Mansfield was majority leader of the Senate. I \nbecame his assistant in 1967 as secretary of the Democratic Conference. \nI sat on this floor practically every hour of every day and was always \nat Mike Mansfield's elbow. Then I became the whip. I carried out his \nwishes on this floor and watched the floor, worked the floor, learned \nthe rules, and Mr. Mansfield pretty much left the floor work to me as \nhis whip.\n  There came a time in that war when the Vietcong were striking at \nAmerican soldiers from across the Cambodian and South Vietnamese \nborder. I offered an amendment during a debate in which the late \nSenator Church, the late Senator Cooper on the other side of the aisle, \nand others were joined on the matter. I offered an amendment expressing \nsupport for the President, who at that time was Richard Nixon, in his \nefforts to bomb the Vietcong who were, as I say, working from enclaves \nin Cambodia across the border from South Vietnam.\n  The Vietcong would go across the border and kill American soldiers. I \noffered an amendment during that debate, in essence, saying that the \nPresident of the United States has a duty to do whatever it takes to \nprotect American boys, who perhaps didn't ask to go to a foreign \nbattlefield. But they were sent into battle and a President has a \nresponsibility to do whatever it takes to protect those men from \nattack. So I offered that amendment and it was defeated. I lost on the \namendment.\n  I need no one to attest to my credentials when it comes to supporting \ndefense, particularly from an appropriations standpoint--my having been \non that committee now for 44 years, as I say, this year.\n  I have been a hawk on defense issues for all of my 50 years in \nCongress.\n  I fully support the President's resolve to strike back at the \nterrorists who caused such devastation, destruction, and carnage here \nin our country on September 11, 5 months and 2 days ago today. But I \nalso understand, having lived through several wars and studied the \nhistory of many more, that war cannot be fought or won by rhetoric, \nthat true victory is tangible victory, that words do have meaning, that \nwords do have consequences, and that a rhetorical declaration of global \nwar may well precipitate real global conflict, involving horrific loss \nof life.\n  It is crucial that we all realize that the war on terrorism is not \njust a war of hot words. This war, like any war, must have tangible and \nachievable goals and objectives. There must be benchmarks by which to \nmeasure progress in attaining those objectives. And the American people \nmust clearly understand what sacrifices must be made and what \nconstitutes victory. These essential elements must be more clearly \ndefined than they have been thus far. We cannot be left to guess as to \nwhat is meant.\n  I had the opportunity to discuss the war on terror with Defense \nSecretary Rumsfeld a few days ago when he appeared before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. I think it was on February 5. The Secretary \nappeared before the Committee to explain and defend the President's \n$379 billion defense budget request for Fiscal Year 2003.\n  Socrates would say, ``Define your Terms.'' I asked Secretary Rumsfeld \nto define the parameters of our war on terrorism. What are our goals? \nWhat are our objectives? What are the standards by which we should \nmeasure success in this war? How will we know when we do achieve \nvictory?\n\n  Much has been said about bringing terrorists to justice. We have \nbombed the Afghanistan mountains into rubble. We have struck deeply at \nthe caves. We have already spent $7 billion in Afghanistan. Where is \nOsama bin Laden? How will we know when we do achieve victory?\n  Secretary Rumsfeld is an outstanding Secretary of Defense. I have \nseen a good many Secretaries of Defense in my time here, and I have a \ngreat respect for Secretary Rumsfeld. He has been around a long time, \ntoo. I have watched and listened to many of Secretary Rumsfeld's \nbriefings on the war in Afghanistan, and he has impressed me. He is \ncandid, straightforward, and to the point. If he cannot answer a \nquestion, generally he says he cannot answer the question.\n  Unfortunately, Secretary Rumsfeld could not answer my questions, \nalthough he certainly was candid. I think he basically told the \ncommittee that it is difficult to say how we will know when we have won \nthe war on terrorism.\n  Although he has said the war on terror has just begun, President Bush \nhas also said on numerous occasions that we are winning the war in \nAfghanistan. Perhaps it was to our good fortune that there was, one \nmight say, a ready-made military force on the ground there opposing the \nTaliban.\n  The President is correct, if winning means routing the Taliban from \nthe Government of Afghanistan. But if winning this war means destroying \nthe al-Qaida terrorist network, or if winning means bringing to justice \nOsama bin Laden, and Mullah Omar, and the rest of the al-Qaida \nleadership, then we may have jumped the gun in such expressions. By \nthose standards--standards the President himself has set--we still have \na way to go in Afghanistan. In fact, many of the former Taliban forces \nare still in that country. They have simply switched sides for now. \nShould circumstances change, they may very well switch back again. \nThose are the realities of Afghanistan.\n  The President said in his State of the Union Address: ``I will not \nwait on events, while dangers gather. I will not stand by, as peril \ndraws closer and closer. The United States of America will not permit \nthe world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most \ndestructive weapons.''\n  Mr. President, facts matter. Standards matter. Words matter. Words \nhave consequences. When the President described Iran, Iraq, and North \nKorea as an ``axis of evil,'' and pledged that the United States will \nnot permit those nations to threaten the world with weapons of mass \ndestruction his florid words were cause for alarm to many of our \nallies. What did the President mean? Was he signaling a plan to attack \none or more of these three nations?\n\n[[Page S702]]\n\n  I asked Secretary Powell that question during his appearance \nyesterday before the committee. Secretary Powell answered: There is no \nplan.\n  He was very careful in the way he responded to my questions. He said: \nThere is no plan. There is no such recommendation on the President's \ndesk today.\n  I will put the entire transcript of Secretary Powell's responses, and \nmy questions, in the Record at the close of my remarks. But what did \nthe President mean? Was he signaling a plan to attack one or more of \nthese three nations?\n  Secretary Powell, as I said, was very careful in his responses. \nSecretary Powell has been around a long time. I remember working with \nthen-National Security Adviser Colin Powell when I was majority leader \nof the Senate in 1987, 1988.\n  I remember the INF Treaty, I withstood great pressure from the then-\nReagan administration, to bring up that INF Treaty. I withstood that \npressure and said: I will not be stampeded into calling up the INF \nTreaty until we have answers to our questions, until Sam Nunn, who is \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, has answers to his questions \nabout futuristic weapons and other very key and important questions. I \njust will not bring up this treaty. Say what you will, I will not bring \nit up.\n  I remember quoting the words from, I believe it was Scott's ``The \nLady of the Lake'':\n\n       Come one, come all! this rock shall fly\n       From its firm base as soon as I.\n\n  I said: I will not call up this treaty until we have the answers to \nSam Nunn's questions, not until we have the answers to David Boren's \nquestions--David Boren was chairman of the Intelligence Committee--not \nuntil we have the answers to the questions of Senator Pell. He was \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n  I said: We have to have these answers before I will call this treaty \nup. And I did not call it up until we had the answers.\n  At that time, Colin Powell was National Security Adviser. He \nscampered across the ocean to Europe to help get those answers. Colin \nPowell, as I say, at that time, who was the National Security Adviser, \ncomplimented the Senate, and complimented me as leader at that time of \nthe Senate, the majority leader, on staying the course, on standing our \nground against being pushed into a premature consideration of that INF \nTreaty. Mr. Powell, himself, said, the Senate rendered a service. And \nhe complimented me personally.\n  I have had a long experience here with Mr. Colin Powell. He is now \nSecretary of State, and I have a great deal of confidence in him. He \nhas had the experience. He was a soldier for 35 years, National \nSecurity Adviser, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He has led men into \nbattle. He has made command decisions. Here is not a man who blew in by \nthe winds from a cyclone that came from far away. He has been around \nhere a long time. He has the experience that gives him the independence \nof thought.\n  Secretary Powell was very careful as to how he answered my questions, \nleaving me to believe that, indeed, the administration is certainly \nconsidering, as an option--this is a conclusion I have drawn from what \nhe said and from what newspaper stories have reported--the \nadministration, indeed, has under consideration, as an option--this is \nmy reading, but it would be pretty hard, I think, for others not to \nreach the same conclusion--that the administration is, indeed, \nconsidering, as one of its options in dealing with Iraq and Iran, maybe \nNorth Korea--certainly as an option--an attack upon one or more of \nthese states. That is a conclusion I have drawn.\n  As I said to Secretary of State Powell, does the President have some \nnew evidence of complicity in the September 11 attacks by these three \nnations? Those are very strong words. The President seems to be saying \nthat we will attack any nation we consider to be a threat. Perhaps I am \nreading something into the matter that is not there.\n  The question is, How do we back up that message if Iran, Iraq, and \nNorth Korea do not change their behavior? Does the President intend to \ninvade or strike one or more of these nations? Why has he included \nNorth Korea in that list? It is certainly not clear to me that North \nKorea was in any way involved in the September 11 attacks on our \nNation. Perhaps I am overlooking something.\n  A Nation's leaders have a responsibility to think beyond the stirring \nrhetoric of war, particularly in the case of what could be a long, \ncostly, global conflict which could very well unleash forces most of us \nonly dimly understand and which could cause great loss of life. This \nNation's leaders also have a responsibility to obtain the support of \nthe people's elected representatives in Congress before undertaking \nendeavors which may claim the lives of the Nation's sons and daughters.\n  The U.S. Constitution. I have a copy of it in my pocket--a copy of \nthe U.S. Constitution. May I say to the distinguished Senator who today \nsits in the chair and presides over this deliberative body with dignity \nand skill, may I say that his two representatives from the State of \nGeorgia who signed this Constitution were William Few and Abraham \nBaldwin. This Constitution still lives. That is the mast which will \nhold us always to the ship of state--the Constitution.\n  I hope this administration remembers that there is still a \nConstitution. I hope that we in this body still remember there is a \nConstitution to guide us.\n  This Constitution does not mention ``consultations'' with Congress. \nThis Constitution does not reference the United Nations and what the \nUnited Nations may want or not want. But this Constitution, in section \n8 of article I, says that Congress shall have the power to declare war, \nto raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a navy, and so on. \nSo let us in this body remember that there is still a Constitution. It \nhas served us well, and it will always serve us well.\n  I am going to follow that Constitution as closely and as nearly as I \ncan follow it in the days to come; in perilous times, if they come. I \nwill support a Commander in Chief when I think he is right. I will not \nsupport any Commander in Chief, be he Democrat or Republican, if I \nthink he is making a mistake in such a very serious matter.\n  The U.S. Constitution declares the President to be the Commander in \nChief. But see what the Constitution says about the Commander in Chief. \nOne can almost count the sentences that are enumerated in this \nConstitution with reference to the Commander in Chief's powers as the \nnumber of fingers on one's hand. But there are many sentences, one will \nfind enumerated in this Constitution, with respect to the Congress--\nmany sentences. Let us keep an eye on this Constitution.\n  The President would do well to obtain the support of the people's \nelected representatives in Congress before undertaking endeavors which \nmay claim the lives of our Nation's sons and daughters. The \nConstitution declares the President to be the Commander in Chief, but \nit is Congress that has the constitutional authority to raise and \nsupport armies, to provide and maintain a navy, and to declare war.\n  It is no accident that the Constitution, in assigning these powers to \nCongress, includes both the common defense and the general welfare of \nthe Nation on this list. The structure, the scope, and the cost of the \nNation's defense have an enormous impact on the general welfare of the \npeople. It is Congress, and specifically the Appropriations Committees \nof the Congress, that has the responsibility for appropriating the \nmoney to fight the war on terrorism.\n  The President has said that this war is costing American taxpayers \nover $1 billion a month. We have already spent over $7 billion waging \nwar in Afghanistan. The President's 2003 defense budget amounts to an \nexpenditure of $379 billion, over $1 billion a day. The President is \nforecasting continued increases in the defense budget.\n  I will insert into the Record the amounts that are being considered \nand questioned by the administration over the next 10 years for \nnational defense, and the total over that period, I think we will find, \nwill be nearly $5 trillion.\n  That is serious money. It is made more serious by the fact that we \nare returning to budget deficits. We are borrowing to support this huge \ndefense budget, and that means we are paying interest on that money \nthat is borrowed, interest on that debt.\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n  How long--we have heard that phrase before--how long, how long can \nthis Nation afford to spend $1 billion a day? We will find that that $1 \nbillion a day will increase substantially over the next 10 years--more \nthan $1 billion a day on defense.\n  Exactly what level of national security are we buying with that \ninvestment of money? What nondefense needs are we forfeiting? As \nPresident Bush said in a 1999 speech at the Citadel:\n\n       We must be selective in the use of our military, precisely \n     because America has other great responsibilities that cannot \n     be slighted or compromised.\n\n  I agree with every word of that statement by now-President Bush.\n  We must not allow a bloated defense budget to eat away at our ability \nto fund other important priorities such as Social Security, Medicare, \nhealth care, and education, to name just a few priorities.\n  Clearly, the budget that was presented to Congress on February 4 \nsacrifices a great deal for defense. While domestic discretionary \nspending increases by only 2 percent, and is essentially flat in some \nareas, the President has asked for an additional $48 billion in \nmilitary spending, 15 percent above last year's defense budget, which \nwas itself 10 percent above the previous funding level for 2001. The \nsize of the requested increase alone is greater than the military \nspending of many, if not all, of our NATO allies.\n  Moreover, such a colossal defense budget increase must be justified. \nIt must be approved by Congress. Both Congress and the American people \nmust understand how this money is to be spent and whether it will \nreally enhance our national security.\n  Let me repeat: Look, again, at my record of support for \nappropriations for national defense over a period of 50 years. There is \nno equivocation in that record.\n  Congress must also understand much, much more about the proposed $10 \nbillion defense reserve fund that is in this budget, including the \nplans for its use.\n  The President's huge defense budget does make minimal cuts in a few \noutdated weapons systems, but it also increases spending on the big-\nticket ships and airplanes that account for a good portion of the U.S. \ndefense procurement funds. Do these types of weapons fit into a \nnational security strategy in today's world, where asymmetrical warfare \nand the existence of terrorist cells in more than 60 countries, \nincluding the United States, seem to constitute the most serious threat \nto our national security? Are these big-ticket items that we are \npurchasing moving us toward a 21st century military, or are they \nsquandering tax dollars by continuing a cold war military structure?\n  May I remind ourselves that there has been on the books a law which \nrequires appointments and agencies to audit and to be able to come up \nwith clear audits of their expenses. The Constitution itself requires a \nclear accounting of the moneys that are appropriated by Congress. I \nbelieve it was last year that I raised this question with Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld. The Defense Department could not identify $3.5 \ntrillion in its more than $7.6 trillion in defense accounts--in \naccounting entries. Now, if the Defense Department cannot, after a \nlaw's having been passed and put on the books requiring Departments to \nbe able to come up with audits, if the Defense Department cannot \naccount for $3.5 trillion in its accounts--it doesn't know what the \nweapons are, what is on hand, what spare parts are on hand, what spare \nparts it really needs, what moneys have and have not been spent--how \ncan the American people have confidence enough to support an additional \n$48 billion for defense this year? Who can account for this money? How \nare we going to account for it? Where are we going? And we are denying \nother needs. The President said in his speech to the Citadel some time \nago that we must not overlook other very important priorities. How can \nwe do it? Where are we going with all of these expenses?\n  Are these big-ticket weapons we are purchasing moving us toward a \n21st century military, or are we squandering taxpayers' dollars by \ncontinuing a cold war military structure? Are these weapons the best \nones with which to wage a global war on terrorism, or are they intended \nto attack the ``axis of evil,'' as the President called Iran, Iraq, and \nNorth Korea? Could they be meant to counter the threat of a rising \nworld power such as China? How about China?\n\n  No one has explained. These are critical questions for which we have \nyet to hear clear, concise answers. Congress needs to be given those \nanswers. The American defense budget should not be a cookie jar with \ngoodies for every defense contractor lucky enough to afford a hefty \nlobbying budget. This Nation is again in deficit status, and we have to \nguard against committing huge sums for weapons that are not needed, \nwhich will only drive us deeper into debt and sap our overall economic \nstrength.\n  The patriotism that runs deep in the veins of Americans, and the \nhorrors of September 11, have aroused our emotions and galvanized our \nsupport for the fight against terror. But that support could wane, both \nat home and abroad, if the administration does not carefully weigh its \nuse of broad threats, undefined objectives, and the murky consequences \nof shackling both our domestic and foreign policies to a militaristic \nfervor which may or may not reflect realistic possibilities or sound \nchoices.\n  We would do far better to hear clear explanations of our goals in the \nwar on terrorism, and detailed justifications of our defense budget \nthat use cold logic, rather than a hot head. We are a powerful country. \nThere has never been one so powerful. We cannot hope to eliminate \nterrorism from the world without other nations on our side. A \nrecognition of our limitations in that regard is critical. We are a \nrich country--so rich that if the Queen of Sheba were today alive, she \nwould come to this country and forget about Solomon in all of his \nglory. We are a rich country, but we can never, never spend our way \ninto perfect national security--I say perfect national security. Our \nresources are finite and choices have to be made, and there will always \nbe forces and circumstances in the world that are unpredictable and \nbeyond our control. There always have been and always will be. But we \ncan strive to be a wise nation--one that avoids bombast in favor of \nmethodical analysis, one that understands its extraordinary \npossibilities as well as its very real limitations on the global stage.\n  I do not know what these words by President Bush may portend for our \nfuture. Are they meant to convey the chilling possibility that Mr. Bush \nmay be contemplating an invasion of Iraq, or Iran, or North Korea? I \ndon't know. Just looking at the words themselves, I cannot understand. \nAre they meant to be the harbinger of an attack on one or more of these \nnations? When Secretary Powell testified before the Budget Committee \nyesterday, he could only give weak assurances that the President ``has \nno plan on his desk'' to start a war with one of these countries. It \nhas yet to be seen whether the President's strong words will mean some \nfuture action against Iran, Iraq, or North Korea, or whether they are \njust considered as a rhetorical flourish to a wartime speech.\n  What is for certain is that other countries have reacted to the use \nof bellicose terms.\n  Our European allies are now wondering if the United States will soon \ncall upon them to support military action against one of those three \ncountries.\n  Hasn't Russian leader Putin raised a question, has he not expressed \nconcern about our intentions toward Iraq? Only yesterday I believe, or \nthe day before, I read in the newspaper about his cautionary words. \nRussia has issued a strong warning against a possible U.S. attack on \nIraq. Alliances between nations can be fractured and broken because of \nrash or insulting statements.\n  Iranians who voted for moderate candidates in last year's elections \njoined with hardliners in taking to the streets of Tehran on Monday, \nFebruary 11, to protest the categorization of their country as \n``evil.''\n  I read from the New York Times of the day before yesterday:\n\n       Millions of Iranians galvanized by President Bush's \n     branding of their nation as part of an ``axis of evil'' \n     marched in a nationwide pep rally today that harkened back to \n     the early days of the Islamic revolution, with the American \n     flag burned for the first time in recent memory.\n\n  The story goes on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\n\n       Ever since Mr. Bush designated Iran part of an \n     international terrorist network open to American attack, \n     conservatives in Iran have been greatly buoyed, trying to use \n     a resurgence of disgust with America to quash reform at home, \n     daily denouncing Washington and exhorting Iranians to follow \n     suit. This has made it difficult for President Khatami to \n     preserve his reformist agenda of promoting democracy and \n     rooting out corruption an agenda he emphasized today before \n     he, too, criticized American foreign policy.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article in its entirety be printed \nin the Congressional Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that at the \nclose of my remarks there be printed a transcript of the questions that \nI asked of Secretary Colin Powell and his answers when he appeared \nbefore the Senate Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, will my friend from West Virginia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield to the distinguished senior Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleague. Before I ask my \nquestion, I wish to thank the Senator from West Virginia for taking to \nthe floor on such an important and timely issue because we are in a \ngrave new world.\n  No one can doubt the Senator's fidelity as a patriot and somebody who \ncares about a strong America, an America that defends itself. I \nfollowed his career long before I ever came to the Congress in 1980. It \nwas true then and it is every bit as true, even more true today.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Only he could give such a speech with the strength that \nis needed. I wish to ask the Senator a question, given his knowledge of \nthe Constitution and our history.\n  Senator Byrd has focused on two issues: the ability to declare war \nand the ability to spend funds in execution of that war. It is my \nunderstanding that if there were ever a part where the Founding Fathers \nwanted the checks and balances of our system--the consultation of the \nexecutive branch with the Congress, the legislative branch--it would be \nin these two areas.\n\n  I wonder if the Senator might address that issue briefly because I \nthink it ties his knowledge of history with the very appropriate and \napt words of today.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend, the senior Senator from New York, whose \nState experienced the greatest sacrifice in blood and human lives that \nhas ever been brought to this country by terrorists in its entire \nhistory, brought in 1 day in the course of a few hours, and is still \nsuffering from the losses that were visited upon New York City by these \nmen who, indeed, were evil men.\n  The Founding Fathers were very suspicious of a strong Executive. The \nFramers of our Constitution were not strong devotees of ``democracy.'' \nThey believed in a strong legislative branch. They believed in checks \nupon an Executive. And so they were rather sparse in the language that \nthey used when it came to enumerating the powers of the Chief \nExecutive, the Chief Magistrate of the country.\n  Some of the Framers had a concern that a legislature might impinge \nupon the powers of a Chief Executive; that the vortex of the \nlegislative branch was ever seeking more power. I think in these \nregards, the Founding Fathers would find that their concerns about a \nChief Executive were perhaps well-founded, especially in time of war.\n  In a time of war, powers and authorities seem to gravitate toward the \nChief Magistrate as Commander in Chief. They felt that they had \nadequately protected against that by virtue of the many powers that are \nenumerated in the Constitution and vested in the Congress, the most \npowerful of which, the most important of which is the power of the \npurse which we find vested in the Congress. We find it in section 9 of \nthe first article of the Constitution.\n  Yes, they were concerned about an overweening Executive, so they \nincluded adequate safeguards. They vested this power to send the \nNation's sons and daughters into war in the hands of Congress when they \nsaid, in section 8, the Congress shall have the power ``To declare \nwar.''\n  This was a safeguard that the Framers wisely put into the hands of \nthe elected representatives in the people's branch--that first branch, \nmentioned in the very first sentence of the Constitution. There is \nwhere the power to make law resides. These are people who are directly \nelected by the people.\n  The Framers were not at all enamored with the idea of having an all-\npowerful Chief Executive.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. His speech, which I have heard thus \nfar, is a marvelous one. I commend it to my colleagues and will read \nthe rest of it myself. I apologize; I must go chair a hearing, but it \nis one of the reasons I am glad to be in the Senate, to hear brave and \nimportant words such as these. I thank the Senator and yield back to \nhim.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, for his words and his confidence. I thank him also for his \nreference to the Constitution.\n  We need to retire into the inner sanctums of our minds and ponder the \nConstitution every once in awhile.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a chart regarding defense budget \nexpenditures be printed in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3).\n  Mr. BYRD. How lately have we read the Constitution?\n  When we send a signal to the rest of the world, we should pay more \nattention to the content of our message than to creating a sound bite. \nIt seems that a new front has opened in our public relations war \nagainst terrorism, and the world wants to know what kind of action we \nmay be contemplating to back up those words.\n  I am reminded of the words of Gaius Sallustius Crispus. Gaius \nSallustius Crispus was a Roman historian. He lived between the years 86 \nand 34 B.C. If one wants to read a good account of the Catilinian \nconspiracy, one ought to read Sallustius' account of the conspiracy of \nCatiline. One ought to read Sallustius' account of the Jugurthine War \nwhich occurred perhaps between the years 112 and 106 B.C. It was \nSallustius Crispus who said, ``It is always easy to begin a war but \nvery difficult to stop one, since its beginning and end are not under \nthe control of the same man.''\n  The country is behind the President's efforts thus far to trace the \nwhereabouts and to bring to justice--to use Mr. Bush's words--Osama bin \nLaden and other terrorist leaders. But if, indeed, the President is \ncontemplating an attack on a sovereign nation, the President should \ncontemplate seeking a declaration of war by Congress in advance. I may \nvery well vote for such a declaration, depending upon the circumstances \nat the time. I would not rule that out.\n  As Edmund Burke so well stated, ``War never leaves where it found a \nnation.''\n  The President would be well advised to have the people of the Nation, \nacting through their elected representatives in Congress, behind him in \nthe event that he seriously contemplates an attack on any one or more \nof the nations which he included in his ``axis of evil'' about which he \nspoke during his State of the Union Address.\n  Going to war with Iraq or North Korea would be a very--and the same \ncan be said with reference to Iran--serious undertaking. Given the \nright cause, I would say let's go. Given the right cause and the right \ncircumstances, yes, but let us be cautious and prudent.\n  North Korea is estimated to have the fourth largest military in the \nworld. Iraq has had 11 years since the Gulf War to rebuild what was \nonce touted as the world's third largest military. Going to war against \nwell-armed foes such as these will require the serious and sustained \nsupport of the American people.\n  The President should not misinterpret the support which he enjoys in \npoll after poll throughout the Nation to mean that he can throw the \nweight of the Nation's full military power at any one of these three \nnations and expect this Nation and its elected representatives to \nfollow down that road\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\nwithout their elected representatives also having had an opportunity to \npass some judgments in committing the Nation's blood and the Nation's \ntreasure to the task. In the words of Aeschylus, ``the people's voice \nis a mighty power.''\n\n  All of us have supported the President in his actions thus far, but \nthere are some things that are worthy of pause. I do not offer my words \ntoday in criticism. I merely offer my words as cautionary.\n  I have heard much saber rattling, much jingoism. It is one thing to \ntrack down terrorists, to chase them into the holes and caves, and to \nvow they shall not hide and we will ``get 'em.'' It is quite another to \nconsider going to war--if that indeed is being weighed as an option in \nhigh places--without a declaration of war by Congress, as set forth in \nthe Constitution.\n  Let me say again, I will leave no doubt about it, I am not saying \nthat a declaration of war on a certain nation at a given time cannot be \njustified. As to Iraq, for example, there may arguably be a sufficient \njustification to make a solid case, given our past experiences with \nthat country and the leader of that country. I might very well be one \nSenator who would support such a declaration at a given time, based \nupon compelling facts. But as someone once said, ``A wise man should \ntry everything before resorting to arms.''\n  There is an old English proverb that says, ``He that preaches war is \nthe devil's chaplain.'' I do not believe that there is any such thing \nas an inevitable war. Given the history of our relations with Saddam \nHussein, it may be that such a conflict one day must take place or \nshall take place. Our military might is overwhelming, but as Cicero is \nreported to have said, ``An Army is of little value in the field unless \nthere are wise counsels at home.'' Then, let us have wise counsels, not \njust consultations. Cato the Elder used to close every speech, every \nletter, with the words, ``Carthage must be destroyed!'' Eventually, in \nthe year 146 B.C., Carthage was destroyed. There must be careful \ncounsels, and let us vote when the time comes.\n  I hope and pray that the President will think and pray carefully as \nall options are being considered. He will do well to heed, and to read \nagain and again, the records of history. In particular, he must not \nforget the lessons we learned in the war with Vietnam. We did not lack \na mighty military in the field in that war. However, the unstinting, \nunflagging dedication to the prolonged waging of that contest was \nlacking among the people back home. It is a lesson worth remembering.\n  Scriptures say that a strong man armed keepeth his palace. I have \nsupported defense budgets now for 50 years, to keep our ``palace,'' our \nShip of State, our country strong. I expect to continue to do so. But \nthere need to be questions asked. It will require a lot of questions \nand a lot of answers. And they should be asked.\n  Let us remember the Constitution. It will keep us bound to the mast \nof our Ship of State.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 12, 2002]\n\n                  Millions in Iran Rally Against U.S.\n\n                         (By Neil MacFarquhar)\n\n       Tehran, Feb. 11.--Millions of Iranians galvanized by \n     President Bush's branding of their nation as part of an \n     ``axis of evil'' marched in a nationwide pep rally today that \n     harkened back to the early days of the Islamic revolution, \n     with the American flag burned for the first time in recent \n     memory.\n       Amid the dirgelike chants of ``Death to America!'' marking \n     the revolution's 23rd anniversary, President Mohammad Khatami \n     tried to display Iran's milder face, stressing his \n     government's interest in detente.\n       Ever since Mr. Bush designated Iran part of an \n     international terrorist network open to American attack, \n     conservatives in Iran have been greatly buoyed, trying to use \n     a resurgence of disgust with America to quash reform at home, \n     daily denouncing Washington and exhorting Iranians to follow \n     suit. This has made it difficult for President Khatami to \n     preserve his reformist agenda of promoting democracy and \n     rooting out corruption an agenda he emphasized today before \n     he, too, criticized American foreign policy.\n       ``Our policy is a policy of detente, Mr. Khatami told the \n     throng clogging all avenues to Freedom Square in Tehran. ``We \n     intend to have ties and peaceful relations with all nations \n     in the world,'' except Israel.\n       Although less strident than his old guard foes, Mr. Khatami \n     suggested that the United states was partly to blame for the \n     Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ``The American people,'' he said, \n     ``should ask today how much of the awful and terrifying \n     incidents of Sept. 11 were due to terrorist acts, and how \n     much of it was due to the foreign policy adopted by American \n     officials.''\n       The threat to Iran ``originates from the fact that America, \n     or at least some of its officials, see themselves as masters \n     of the world,'' Mr. Khatami said. ``Since they have power, \n     they want to force the world to obey them and exert pressure \n     on countries that disobey. Your revolution threatened \n     America's illegitimate interests in the region, so it is \n     obvious that your are the target of its animosity.''\n       After each important line, the orderly crowd burst into \n     another round of ``Death to America!'' and waved a variety of \n     signs, including one in English quoting the late \n     revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, saying, \n     ``The U.S. cannot do a damn thing.''\n       The chanting switched occasionally to ``Death to Bush!'' \n     One man wrapped his white donkey in a hand-painted American \n     flag with ``Bush'' written on the side, while a truck carried \n     a hug poster mounted with five large close-up photographs of \n     the American president next to five similarly sized pictures \n     of an ape.\n       In his State of the Union address on Jan. 29, Mr. Bush \n     singled out Iran for trying to develop weapons of mass \n     destruction and for its support for groups like Hezbollah \n     that the United States labels terrorist. In addition, \n     Washington has recently accused Iran of sending weapons to \n     the Palestinians, of trying to undermine the effort to build \n     a stable central government in Afghanistan and of helping Al \n     Qaeda members to escape.\n       In suggesting that the United States review its own foreign \n     policy rather than cast aspersions. Mr. Khatami specifically \n     cited what he depicted as the plight of Palestinians denied \n     human rights because of American support for Israel.\n       The threats expressed by Mr. Bush and other administration \n     officials over the last two weeks surprised many in Iran. In \n     some ways, they have united the reformists and the old guard \n     here in criticism of the United States; in other ways, they \n     have strengthened the hand of the conservatives.\n       Any time we face international problems, democracy stops,'' \n     said Ali Reza Haghighi, a political science professor. ``Now \n     all the discourse must be against the Americans.''\n       Mr. Khatami worked to keep his reformist agenda alive.\n       Some people must not object that we are talking so much \n     about democracy, religious democracy,'' he said. ``The stress \n     on democracy is the soul of the Islamic revolution.''\n       Mr. Khatami's supporters had envisioned the efforts to \n     rebuild Afghanistan as a kind of side door to re-establishing \n     ties with Washington, a prospect that alarmed the hard-liners \n     who still control many of the levers of power here.\n       Mr. Bush's remarks thus delighted the old guard, which \n     gleefully presented them as evidence that the American \n     attitude toward Tehran remained unchanged, no matter that \n     Iran helped in toppling the Taliban.\n       The reformists, while critical of America, have tried to \n     suggest that the actions Mr. Bush criticized were the work of \n     shadowy groups within the Iranian elite who want to keep the \n     country isolated and autocratic.\n       Possibly reflecting uncertainty over how to deal with an \n     American-backed government in Kabul, Afghanistan was barely \n     mentioned at the rally. ``The Taliban were a major \n     bete noire,'' said one western diplomat. ``But now they \n     see a U.S. colony with bases developing in their backyard \n     and they don't know how to handle it.''\n       At the rally, Iranians were generally polite to the few \n     Western reporters in their midst, saying things like \n     ``Welcome to Iran.'' But there were occasional outbursts of \n     animosity. ``Garbage!'' ``Pigs!'' ``Get out of here!'' \n     shouted one woman, while a man veered close to say, ``I would \n     like to punch America right in the mouth!'' at which point \n     the crowd edged in, bellowing ``Death to America!''\n       While the size of the Tehran crowd was impossible to \n     estimate authoritatively, the wide avenues and highways \n     leading to Freedom Square in Tehran were jammed with hundreds \n     of thousands of people. Iranian television suggested that \n     millions turned out across the country, showing pictures of \n     jammed streets in every city. Marchers said they were more \n     galvanized than in years past because they felt maligned by \n     President Bush.\n       The turnout also reflected the daily exhortations to attend \n     that accompanied every news bulletin since Mr. Bush's speech. \n     Employees at various government ministries said they had been \n     told to go.\n       The calls to attend did not move everyone. In affluent \n     north Tehran, where one occasionally hears support for the \n     idea that Mr. Bush should carry through with his threat to \n     bomb, cars laden with skis headed out of town toward the \n     slopes.\n       As marchers headed toward the rally, periodically one would \n     step out of the crowd to offer spontaneous thoughts about the \n     day. ``As long as our revolution is against America, we \n     support it,'' said one man, wagging his finger. ``The day \n     there is peace between this country and America, the \n     revolution is over.''\n       After 23 years, though, the sense of brooding menace that \n     pervaded marches of the past had mellowed. This one felt more \n     like a carnival, complete with a gold coin on offer for the \n     best Uncle Sam effigy.\n       A yellow banner painted with giant letters in Persian was \n     stretched across one over\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\n     pass. In the early days of the Islamic Republic it would have \n     been read as ``America Is the Greatest Satan.'' But today the \n     lettering helpfully included its own English translation, \n     reading, ``America Is Extremely Naughty.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\nBudget Committee Hearing With Secretary of State Colin Powell, February \n                                12, 2002\n\n       Senator Byrd. I think the secretary, and I regret that we \n     have scheduled our votes in such a way that we overlooked the \n     importance of these committees and the importance of the \n     questions and the answers that may result in our attendance \n     here and the imposition on the time of witnesses like \n     Secretary Powell.\n       Let me begin by saying that I join in the commendations \n     that have been expressed by our chairman. I've had a long \n     service with Secretary Powell. When we debated the INF \n     treaty, 1988, I believe it was, I was majority leader for the \n     second time, and Secretary Powell at that time I believe was \n     the national security adviser to the president.\n       Secretary Powell complimented the Senate on the work that \n     the Senate did on that treaty. I refused to be pushed and \n     pressed and stampeded into a scheduling for debate of that \n     treaty until we had resolved some very, very important \n     questions raised by the then chairman of the Armed Services \n     Committee, Senator Nunn, the then chairman of the \n     Intelligence Committee, Senator Boren, the then chairman of \n     the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Pell. And I recall \n     that we waited until we got the answers, and the secretary of \n     state--now secretary of state, at the time complimented the \n     Senate on taking the time to resolve these important \n     questions. And Mr. Powell at that time I think engaged \n     himself and was active in helping to resolve some of these \n     very important questions.\n       So he is a man who has made command decisions, he has led \n     men in war. I think he speaks independently. He has the kind \n     of experience that affords him that view, that independence \n     of thought. He doesn't have to just listen to what somebody \n     else says and reports, he has analyzed many of these \n     questions. And I compliment him on his great service to this \n     country.\n       Our time is limited. There are two questions I would like \n     to ask. Let me premise the first one by what you have said \n     with respect to the president has no plan to attack, there \n     are no recommendations on his desk at this moment. Now, those \n     are very carefully worded responses to the questions by the \n     chairman, and those of us who have been around here anytime \n     at all recognize that they're not direct answers, and I can \n     understand the secretary.\n       The president, let me say, though, has made some very bold \n     statements about prosecuting those responsible for the \n     September 11 attacks. The president said that the terrorists \n     are on the run and that they will find no safe haven, there's \n     no cave that's deep enough. He said in the State of the Union \n     address that the terrorists will not escape the justice of \n     this country. I am with the president 100 percent when it \n     comes to punishing the individual terrorists, those who are \n     still living--some of them died on September 11, which was \n     five months ago yesterday--when it comes to punishing those \n     terrorists for the acts of September 11.\n       But the president has gone further in naming three states \n     that comprise an axis of evil, and you have used that term, \n     Mr. Secretary, already. Iran, Iraq and North Korea, the \n     president has said, ``are arming to threaten the peace of the \n     world,'' and he ``will not stand by as peril grows closer and \n     closer. The United States of America will not permit the \n     world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the \n     world's most destructive weapons.''\n       Those statements have left me wondering, is the president \n     signaling that we will attack one or more of these countries? \n     Congress passed a resolution on September 14 to authorize the \n     president to use force against those who carried out, \n     assisted or gave safe harbor to those responsible for the \n     attack of September 11. Iran, Iraq and North Korea are not \n     named in that resolution. I've heard no evidence that this \n     axis of evil was responsible for or complicit in the \n     September 11 attacks.\n       Now, if the president seeks to extend this war on \n     terrorism, a case must be made before Congress and the \n     American people that Iran, Iraq or North Korea are a clear \n     and present danger to our country, and I, for one, am willing \n     to listen to that case. But to carry out the war, the \n     president will need the sustained support of the American \n     people. We saw in Vietnam what the lack of support, sustained \n     support for that war, resulted in. If the president wants to \n     crystallize the support of the American people, he would be \n     well advised to seek from Congress a declaration of war.\n       After all, we're not talking about using our military \n     against terrorist cabals. We're talking about war against one \n     or more sovereign states. Now, reading many of the news \n     stories about this subject, I have come to a conclusion that \n     while there is no plan perhaps, while there is no \n     recommendation upon the president's desk today perhaps, these \n     matters are evidently being pursued, they're being discussed, \n     they're being considered as options.\n       Now, when it comes to making war, let's say on Iraq, having \n     been here when you helped to direct the war on Iraq, I \n     possibly could be convinced that we ought to vote--I would \n     vote for a declaration of war. But we're not dealing with \n     Afghanistan if we deal with Iraq. With respect to Iraq and \n     North Korea, we're dealing with countries that have powerful \n     military forces on the ground.\n       And I would hope, Mr. Secretary, that before we venture \n     into an attack or an invasion or whatever against any one or \n     more of these countries, the help, the support, the sustained \n     support of the American people would be carefully sought \n     through their elected representatives. We ought not to go \n     around shooting from the hip. And I think that some of the \n     statements that have emanated from the administration have \n     alarmed other countries and they're alarming a lot of people \n     in this country.\n       Now, is the president signaling that we will attack one or \n     more of these countries? If he is considering such an attack \n     as a possible course of action, do you believe, Mr. \n     Secretary, that the president should seek a declaration of \n     war from Congress before unleashing our military might on any \n     one of these sovereign states?\n       Now, I can understand the inherent powers of the commander \n     in chief. If there's an attack about to occur against this \n     country, he has the inherent power to act. But we have time \n     here to discuss these matters, to discuss the case, to debate \n     pro and con. And I personally believe that the president, \n     before he takes such a step, if that's being considered as an \n     option, we'd better be very careful to bring the American \n     people in on making the case, and we'd better seek a \n     declaration of war from Congress in such a case. That's going \n     to be a very costly venture, if it occurs, it's going to be \n     costly in treasure and in blood, and you know that as well, \n     perhaps more so than I do. And unless he has that support, \n     that sustained support, we'll be engaged in another very \n     costly, dreadful, Vietnam-like venture where the support of \n     the American people vanished. That's one question.\n       Let me give you one other question to conserve my time, and \n     then you can answer them as you see fit. My other question--\n     well, perhaps you'd better try that one first. [Laughter]\n       Secretary Powell. First of all, Senator Byrd, I could not \n     even begin to answer this question without commenting on your \n     opening remarks about the INF treaty. It is one of the more \n     vivid experiences of my career, to have been, shall I say, \n     taught by you about the Senate's prerogatives with respect to \n     treaties. And I'll never forget the meeting you, I and Howard \n     Baker had in your chambers one day, where you made it clear \n     that the Senate had to give its advice and consent in a \n     measured way, only with full information, and I went off to \n     Geneva the very next day to get that full information.\n       And if I may, I'll never forget you looking at me and say, \n     ``We will not be hurried by any summit meeting that you all \n     have scheduled or anything else of that nature, we will do \n     our job.'' And the Senate did do its job, and I thank you for \n     that guidance and that support at that time.\n       To get directly to your questions, the president's words in \n     the State of the Union speak for itself. He did not declare \n     war on anyone, nor was he saying he was getting ready to \n     declare war on anyone. In fact, since the State of the Union \n     he has repeated what he had said two times before the State \n     of the Union with respect to Iraq: Let the inspectors in, let \n     the U.N. inspectors in to determine whether or not you were \n     doing the things we are accusing you of, and if you can \n     establish that you are not doing these things, then the world \n     will be a safer place, and you will have dealt with the U.N. \n     We still think we would be better off with someone other than \n     Saddam Hussein running the country.\n       So the president has made no decisions--to repeat myself--\n     and no recommendations on his desk, even though, as a matter \n     of prudence, we should be examining options with respect to \n     all of these countries. But the first instance is looking at \n     diplomatic and political means.\n       We have been eyeball to eyeball with North Korea for the \n     last almost 50 years now, and trying to make sure that they \n     are contained, this regime that is a despotic regime. And so \n     I can assure you that the president is very sensitive, first, \n     to the feelings and the views and the perspective of the \n     American people, and he is very appreciative of the role that \n     Congress plays in such matters.\n       And I'm sure that if he believes some action is taken, or \n     some action is required, he will consult with the Congress, \n     and as a result of consultation will make a judgment as to \n     how Congress should be involved in whatever actions are \n     taken, whether it is by declaration of war or a resolution of \n     the Congress supporting an action that is taken pursuant to \n     some United Nations resolution or through the president's \n     inherent right as commander in chief to engage the armed \n     forces of the United States. You'll recall what we did at the \n     time of the Gulf War, Senator, where with a resolution we \n     then got a resolution from both houses. So I'm sure the \n     president would consult at an appropriate time and determine \n     what he would ask Congress to do, and Congress has, of \n     course, it's own inherent power and right to do what it \n     chooses to do.\n       Senator Byrd. Mr. Secretary, I thank you for that response. \n     Of course, you and I know that the Constitution does not \n     speak about consultations, nor does it refer to U.N. \n     resolutions. Those are things that have developed over later \n     time. But the Constitution\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\n     still says that Congress shall have the power to declare war.\n       And I believe, as I said earlier, that if the president is \n     contemplating attacking one or more of these countries, I \n     would urge that he not just seek consultation, but he seek a \n     declaration of war. And I might very well vote for that, \n     depending on the case that is made at the time.\n       My second question, I may miss this vote--I'd do that with \n     regret--but I'm very appreciative of this opportunity to \n     visit with you across the table that's here and to ask these \n     questions. By the way, I've cast more roll call votes than \n     any senator in the history of this republic, and this is not \n     a democracy, this is a republic. But I've cast more votes \n     than any other senator in its long history, and so I don't \n     pass up a vote easily, but I will in this case if I have to.\n       My second question is this. The president's FY 2003 foreign \n     operations budget requests reflect business as usual when it \n     comes to U.S. aid to Egypt and Israel. But despite providing \n     roughly $5 billion a year--my, how the Appropriations \n     Committee would like to use that $5 billion a year to help \n     some of the states in this country and the people throughout \n     this country with some of their problems--$5 billion a year \n     in economic and military assistance to the Middle East, the \n     conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians continues \n     to worsen.\n       It seems to me that our foreign aid dollars to the Middle \n     East, which have no strings attached that I know about, and \n     are not conditioned on any progress being made in the peace \n     process, are being squandered in pursuit of an increasingly \n     elusive peace. Now, this subject, this question isn't often \n     laid on the table as plainly as we're doing right now, but I \n     think it ought to be.\n       Every year we appropriate roughly $5 billion countries with \n     virtually no questions asked, and they look upon it, I think, \n     as an entitlement, almost as an entitlement. They, I'm sure, \n     from what I've read and learned, that they include it in \n     their budgets at the beginning of the budget process because, \n     as I said, they look upon it virtually as an entitlement. \n     They can be pretty sure of it. I think it's time for \n     questions to be asked.\n       As a result of the current escalation of violence between \n     the Palestinians and the Israelis, the U.S. seems to be \n     increasing its historic tilt toward Israel and abandoning \n     attempts to negotiate with Yasser Arafat. Given the \n     continuing terrorist attacks by the Palestinians, it is \n     understandable that we're fed up with Arafat. But I've read \n     in the media that even some Israeli reserve soldiers are \n     refusing to serve any longer in the occupied West Bank and \n     Gaza Strip, citing the dehumanizing impact of the occupation.\n       Do you have any concern that the perception of a greater \n     U.S. tilt toward Israel could prove and is proving to be \n     counterproductive by increasing anti-American and anti-\n     Israeli sentiment in the region by emboldening hardline \n     Israelis who are opposed to the peace process and by \n     precluding the U.S. from fulfilling the role of honest broker \n     in the peace process?\n       I think, Mr. Secretary, that it is time to put some strings \n     on our foreign assistance in the Middle East and to condition \n     our assistance, to condition our assistance on evidence of \n     progress in the peace process. I think that would be the axis \n     of my questions.\n       I think it's time to condition our assistance on evidence \n     of progress in the peace process. We have a tool here. We \n     don't seem to use it. Both sides are able to count on a \n     continuation of this money every year, it seems to me. It \n     isn't being used as leverage, as it should be, in the pursuit \n     of the peace process, which would be of the greatest benefit \n     to both of those countries and to our own country and to \n     world peace. Yasser Arafat may be unwilling or unable to act \n     on his own, but I have to believe that Egypt and Jordan, and \n     hopefully other Arab nations, would apply considerably more \n     pressure on the Palestinians if their foreign assistance \n     dollars were at stake.\n       And I have to believe that Israel might be more willing to \n     discuss the issue of Israeli settlements, which are a real \n     bone of contention, in disputed areas if their foreign \n     assistance dollars were at stake. Mr. Secretary, this is my \n     question: Why shouldn't we condition our assistance to the \n     Middle East, why shouldn't we use this leverage on both sides \n     to get them to the peace table and to make them understand \n     that this money is just not going to be had there for the \n     asking, that they have to produce some evidence, they have to \n     show a willingness, they have to act in pursuit of that \n     willingness? That's my question.\n       Secretary Powell. Thank you, Senator Byrd. On the first \n     question, as you know, the roughly $4.6 or close to $5 \n     billion that is spent every year for Egypt and Israeli in FMF \n     and ESF funding is a result of decisions that were made many \n     years ago, after the Camp David accord, and there's been a \n     balance between those two, and as a result we did have a \n     peace agreement between Egypt and Israel.\n       And as part of that, this funding was appropriate to let \n     both sides develop and let both sides feel strong as a result \n     of defensive FMF funding, which allows them to maintain their \n     military. With respect to the situation with the Palestinians \n     and the Israelis, I must say that Egypt has been enormously \n     supportive of our efforts, and Egypt has been applying \n     pressure on Chairman Arafat to get the violence under control \n     so that both sides can move forward to achieve the kind of \n     peace that you talk about.\n       With respect to should we use Egypt's money to pressure \n     them, they're doing what we ask of them now with respect to \n     this, they're putting pressure on Mr. Arafat. They are one of \n     our strongest interlocutors with respect to how we deal with \n     Mr. Arafat. We have not cut Mr. Arafat off. I am in touch \n     with his closest associates, and I spoke to him about 10 days \n     ago.\n       With respect to the Israelis, they are under attack from \n     terrorist organizations that are linked to the Palestinian \n     Authority. We saw the ship come in with 50 tons of military \n     equipment that escalated the situation or would have if it \n     arrived. And to say to them, ``We're going to cut your funds \n     while you are under these kinds of terrorist attacks unless \n     you do something to reward these terrorist attacks,'' is not \n     a strategy that I think will be successful. The strategy we \n     are trying right now and applying right now is to remain \n     committed to a vision of these two states living side by \n     side, remain committed to the Mitchell plan, which provides a \n     path to get there, and committed to the Tenet work plan, \n     which gets us into the Mitchell plan by getting a cease-fire, \n     by getting the violence down.\n       And in recent days I have been in touch once again with the \n     closest aids to Mr. Arafat talking about the specific things \n     that need to be done so that we can get the violence down and \n     then see an Israeli response, because they now are confident \n     of moving forward into the Mitchell plan. The Mitchell plan \n     talks about settlement activities stopping. The Mitchell plan \n     talks about opening closures. The Mitchell plan has \n     everything we need to get the negotiations, negotiations \n     which under appropriate U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 can lead \n     to a settlement of this crisis and a peace between these two \n     sides.\n       But until Mr. Arafat really is able to crack down, if he \n     can--and I think he still can, I still think he has that \n     authority, people want to push him aside as a leader, but \n     he's still the leader of the Palestinian people, they see him \n     as such and he's the elected leader of the Palestinian \n     Authority. And so I think he has to use his moral \n     authority and his political authority to get the violence \n     down, as which point we can get into a cease-fire and move \n     toward the Mitchell plan.\n       We are constantly reviewing the level of funding for both \n     Egypt and Israel and the determination of how it should be \n     allocated between FMF and ESF, and we believe they both make \n     solid cases to us every year that justifies the allocation \n     that we have made to them, and that is the case again this \n     year. But we have not walked away from this, and we are \n     always looking for a means by which we can encourage both \n     sides to show restraint, both sides to do everything that is \n     possible to get toward a cease-fire and progress into the \n     Mitchell plan.\n       Senator Byrd. Mr. Chairman I have signaled to the floor \n     leadership that I'm willing to give up that vote in order to \n     have been here to ask these questions, Secretary Powell, and \n     I gave it up very reluctantly. My attendance record over a \n     period of 44 years, my roll call attendance record is 98.7 \n     percent of the time. I wouldn't have done that for many \n     secretaries.\n       Secretary Powell. I'm honored.\n       Senator Byrd. I thank you for your response to the \n     question. I hope that there will be increased consideration \n     given to my suggestions here as to the use of this \n     assistance. The American taxpayers give up a lot, they give \n     $5 billion a year to these countries, and there needs to be a \n     return to the taxpayers' investment, I believe to use your \n     words, in the Middle East. So I hope that there will be \n     increased consideration of using this leverage.\n       And also, Mr. Secretary, I hope you'll convey to the \n     president that we need to use our words with care. Words mean \n     something, especially in this context. We cannot shoot from \n     the hip if we're contemplating as one of the options going \n     into one of these countries or attacking them. This would be \n     a very sobering, somber, serious matter, and I would \n     appreciate it if you would tell the president about this.\n       And I'm not out to pick on the president, I spoke on the \n     Senate floor one Friday about the president, about his speech \n     to the National Prayer Breakfast, and I have many good things \n     I can say about the president. But this is very sobering, and \n     some of the words that have appeared to come from the hip \n     from this administration have caused considerable alarm. I \n     don't have to tell you that, you sense that, I'm sure.\n       Secretary Powell, Senator Byrd, thank you. And I've been \n     through several crisis with the president in our year \n     together, some big, some small. There was the Soviet spy \n     crisis of the early days of the administration, then the \n     Chinese reconnaissance plane, and then what we've done since \n     September 11, and I have been through many crises in my \n     career with several presidents.\n       And this president does not shoot from the hip and he does \n     not act from the hip. He handles each one of these with a \n     clarity of purpose, with patience, with prudence, listens to \n     all the advisers that he has in his administration and \n     gathers the support of the American people and his coalition \n     partners as he moves forward. And I'm sure that as new \n     challenges arise in the future, particularly if they arise \n     with these three countries or other countries, he will act in \n     a similar manner.\n       Senator Byrd. I hope so, Thank you.\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n          DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.--MILITARY (051)--DISCRETIONARY\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Budget\n                            Year                              authority\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2002.......................................................        330.8\n2003.......................................................    \\1\\ 379.3\n2004.......................................................        387.9\n2005.......................................................        408.8\n2006.......................................................        429.6\n2007.......................................................        451.4\n2008.......................................................        463.7\n2008.......................................................        476.3\n2010.......................................................        489.3\n2011.......................................................        502.7\n2012.......................................................        516.4\n2003-12....................................................      4,505.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncludes $10 billion request for the Defense Emergency Response Fund.\n \nSource: Office of Management and Budget, January 24, 2002.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I appreciate the comments from my \ncolleague from West Virginia and his thoughts. We have some important \ndecisions to make.\n  I speak on an event taking place currently in the Capitol, the \nwelcoming of the President of Pakistan. Yesterday, we passed a \nresolution welcoming President Musharraf of Pakistan to the United \nStates. He arrived in Washington last night. He will be here for a \ncouple of days.\n  I rise to call attention to this visit of President Musharraf and \npraise his courageous leadership in standing by the United States in \nits war on terrorism. President Musharraf has taken action within his \nown country to align with the international community to reject \nterrorism. It has been a very difficult task for him. Pakistan has been \nin a great deal of turmoil. President Musharraf has worked to bring \ncalm and peace to that region. But when we went forward with our \nefforts in Afghanistan, which to date have been quite successful, this \nwas a very trying time in Pakistan.\n  President Musharraf stood by his commitment to end terrorism, stood \nby his commitment to work with the United States. That has been a help \nin our efforts in that region of the world and for the future of \nPakistan and relationships with the United States.\n  In a speech last month, President Musharraf set Pakistan on a new \ncourse with his version of a moderate, dynamic, Muslim nation. He \nreminded the Pakistani people that charity begins at home. It was time \nto fight the root causes of extremism: poverty, and illiteracy. He has \ndone this at great risk to himself on behalf of a peaceful and \nprosperous future for Pakistan. He has opened the way to eventual true \npeace with India. It is an important message for Pakistan, for South \nAsia, and for the whole world.\n  President Bush also made note of President Musharraf's important \nleadership in the State of the Union Address. The President said: \nPakistan is now cracking down on terror, and I admire the strong \nleadership of President Musharraf.\n  Pakistan's support remains essential to our fight against terrorism. \nWe are grateful to President Musharraf for his leadership. Without it, \nOperation Enduring Freedom could not have been accomplished and could \nnot have received its accomplishments or made the accomplishments that \nit has to date. We owe much to the Pakistani people. However, the fight \nis not yet over and risks still remain. Violent extremists could still \nundermine peace and security in the region. As we isolate our enemies, \nso, too, must we aid and draw closer to our friends.\n  Pakistan's bold stand against terror alongside the United States is \nnot made in a vacuum. There are real economic and social consequences \nin Pakistan for assisting the United States in our war effort. It would \nbe a failure of U.S. foreign policy not to pursue the means of \nassisting our ally in its time of need. We must provide assistance to \nPakistan in all the areas that will help keep it on track with \nPresident Musharraf's vision for a prosperous, strong, independent, \nmodern Islamic state, a democracy of capital markets.\n  As we have all seen, a small yet very focused and vocal Islamic \nminority within Pakistan has spoken out against the Pakistani \nGovernment and the assistance it received from the United States. The \nsmall minority has called for and implemented damaging labor strikes \nand encouraged countless numbers of young Pakistanis to cross the \nborder into Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban. This is a \nstrong vocal minority in Pakistan. A further weakened economy and \nincreased unemployment in Pakistan, the clear results of some weakened \nmarkets that have taken place because of the war on terrorism, only add \nto the influence of fundamentalists in Pakistan by strengthening social \nand economic unrest on which extremists prey.\n\n  This is why it is crucial that the United States now provide \nassistance and support to Pakistan. It is time to make sure that our \npolicies of all sorts--economic, social policies, geopolitical \npolicies--reflect what is best for America, not only in terms of our \neconomy but also for our future security. Helping Pakistan through this \ndifficult and necessary transition is in the direct interests of the \nUnited States. We must support those willing to take on the fight for \nfreedom if we are to see our values flourish around the world.\n  I am delighted President Musharraf is visiting the United States at \nthis time. I know he will receive a strong, positive welcome from the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/13/senate-section/article/S708-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PHILIPPINES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

This is very important in \nhelping to subdue a terrorist group called Abu Sayyaf. They have a \ncouple of my constituents. They are being held by the Abu Sayyaf \nterrorists. We are hopeful this exercise in the Philippines that the \nFilipino troops are carrying out and the training exercise the United \nStates is doing with the Philippines will result in that group, the Abu \nSayyaf, being subdued; the Americans being freed safely and being \nreturned home to their families. They have been held since May of last \nyear and have been on the move constantly in the jungle.\n  I am appreciative of the administration for stepping forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/13/senate-section/article/S708-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S708-S709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, as Senator Byrd mentioned, we have \nserious issues to contemplate concerning Iraq. This is a country we \nhave had conflict with before, a country that has weapons of mass \ndestruction. Iraq has been at war with itself and its neighbors for 22 \nof the 23 years that Saddam Hussein has ruled that country. The people \nof Iraq have not known peace under Saddam Hussein.\n  History reveals repression at home is often the breeding ground for \noutside aggression. Iraq is certainly a case in point. There has been \nno peace in Iraq since Saddam Hussein came to power more than two \ndecades ago. First, he declared war on Iran, a war that lasted nearly a \ndecade. He then declared war on the Iraq Kurdish population in the \nnorth. He even used chemical weapons against them in his pursuit of \ntotal and absolute control of Iraq.\n  After the war with the Kurds, he declared war on Kuwait, calling \nKuwait an integral part of Iraq. Since his defeat at the hands of the \nU.S.-led coalition, Saddam has spent the past decade defying the United \nNations and the United Nations imposed agreements and building weapons \nof mass destruction to use against his next victims.\n  History has also shown that authoritarian dictators do not \nsuccessfully become integrated into civilized society. On the contrary, \nthey seek any and all means to pursue their goals and perceive any \npositive overtures towards them as acts of weakness on the part of \ntheir adversaries. It has been the policy of the U.S. Government to \nseek the overthrow of Saddam Hussein since the passage of the 1997 Iraq \nLiberation Act. This policy is strongly supported--it was then and is \nnow--by both Houses of Congress and both parties. It was also embraced \nby President Bush in the Republican Party platform.\n  This is going to be a key issue as we continue to look at what we are \ngoing to do to remove Saddam Hussein from power. We are not safe. That \nregion of the world is not safe as long as Saddam Hussein rules in \nIraq. This situation is not tenable over the long term. I am hopeful we \ncan move forward to see\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\nsome stability established in the region without Saddam Hussein in \npower.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, earlier this afternoon, an hour or so \nago on this floor, we adopted a new farm policy for our country. In \nDelaware, in Michigan, even in Connecticut and Kansas, farmers are \nstruggling to try to make a go of it.\n  Some of the woes that our agricultural communities face are laid at \nthe foot of the agricultural policy which was adopted by the Congress, \nI believe, in 1996. I would just observe that some of the problems our \nfarmers face may be fairly attributable to that national farm policy. \nBut not all of the woes of agricultural communities can be traced back \nto the legislation adopted some 6 years ago.\n  In my own view, the bigger problem is overproduction. In my own view, \nthe bigger problem is we have too much commodity and not enough demand \nfor that commodity, whether the commodity is corn or soybeans, the \ncommodity is milk or rice or cotton or beef--even chicken. We have too \nmuch commodity and not enough demand, too much commodity produced in \nthis country and around the world.\n  The bill we have just passed provides subsidies to support those who \nare raising major crops, including corn, soybeans, rice, and cotton. \nThose supports--loan prices--are important. But the answer to what ails \nour farms and our agricultural communities is not merely more subsidies \nor greater subsidies. The answer, I believe, ultimately is better \nalignment of supply and demand.\n  Let me mention a few ways we can do that. One is through biomass. At \na time when our country is importing about 60 percent of the oil we \nuse, we also live in an age where you can take soybean oil and mix it \nwith diesel fuel and provide a perfectly good fuel for diesel vehicles. \nWe can do a similar thing with corn for ethanol vehicles.\n  We are learning how to transform plants into factories. We can now \nraise plants that will create an enzyme that is otherwise created in a \nchemical factory. The plants literally enable you to produce the same \nenzyme 40 percent cheaper than might be produced with a chemical \nfactory, with fewer negative environmental consequences.\n  We learned how to infect or inject a virus into a product or crop \nsuch as soybeans or even tobacco, and the plant then creates a vaccine \nwhich can be used, among other things, to fight cancer.\n  The folks at DuPont have recently perfected a soybean seed that grows \na soybean that produces soy milk that is almost impossible to \ndistinguish from regular milk with respect to its taste.\n  Those are just some of the things we can do to create more demand, \nuntraditional demand for the enormous amount of commodities, farm \ncommodities we are producing in this country and in other places.\n  I add to those, we found out in Delaware, as we clean out our chicken \nhouses, we can take some of the chicken litter and, instead of \nspreading it on our farm fields, we can burn it and derive a Btu value \nfor electricity, and do so in an environmentally clean way. We can take \nthe chicken litter out of chicken houses and treat it under high \ntemperature and make a high nitrogen/high phosphorus fertilizer and \nship it across the country and across the world and provide a source of \ncash revenue for farmers from what was previously a waste product of \nwhich we had too much.\n  One of the aspects I especially like about the bill we passed is it \nsupplements and supports the efforts of States such as Delaware and \nperhaps others here to preserve agricultural land through conservation. \nIn my State, we have invested tens of millions of dollars, State \ndollars in recent years, to purchase agricultural development rights, \nproviding money for farmers for farm equipment, irrigation systems, and \nother ways to support their farming operation by agreeing to put their \nfarms in perpetuity in farmland. It is going to continue to be a farm \nforever. This legislation we passed here today provides Federal support \nfor what many of us have done at the State level.\n\n  The last thing is companies such as DuPont and Syngenta and others in \nour country have developed ways to create seeds and to grow plants that \nare more drought resistant than otherwise would be, plants and seeds \nthat are resistant to a particular kind of inspect, plants that need \nfewer fertilizers, less fertilizer, less insecticides, less pesticides. \nWe have the ability, through that kind of research and the application \nof that research, to build a better mousetrap--if not a better \nmousetrap, a better soybean plant, and to enable us to have a leg up on \nthe competition in other parts of the world. Those are some of the \nthings, some of the factors that will enable us to help revive our \nagricultural industry in this country.\n  There are a lot of good things in that farm bill that we passed. Part \nof the solution, part of the way out of the duress in which farmers \nfind themselves, is in that legislation. But a good deal is not. I \nwanted to share some of my thoughts today, and I thank the Chair for \nindulging me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD.

Madam President, some four decades ago, Dr. Martin Luther \nKing said:\n\n       The history of our nation is the history of a long and \n     tireless effort to broaden and to increase the franchise of \n     American citizens.\n\n  This afternoon, we are gathered to consider the election reform bill \nwhich will live up, in my view, to the words Dr. Martin Luther King \nuttered 40 years ago; that is, to broaden the franchise of American \ncitizens.\n  It is a great honor and privilege to bring this bill to the floor, \nthe Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act, with a bipartisan compromise \nthat will be substituted for the committee-reported text of the bill \nwhen we get to that point.\n  As Thomas Paine once said:\n\n       The right to vote is the primary right upon which all other \n     rights are based.\n\n  Therefore, there is no greater challenge facing this body than \nrestoring Americans' faith in our electoral process.\n  Fourteen months ago yesterday, the American public decided--the \ncountry decided--who would be the 43rd President of the United States. \nWhat we are engaged in today, and will be over the next day or so, is \nnot any discussion or debate about the past. George W. Bush is the \nPresident of the United States and has been since January 20 of last \nyear. This bill is about the future, what we can do to try to make our \nelection systems more fair, bring them up to date, to make it possible \nfor people to cast votes more easily, and to see to it that those who \nmay want to corrupt the system somehow will find their job far more \ndifficult.\n\n  I consider this to be landmark legislation. It will help to ensure \nthat our voting procedures are uniform and nondiscriminatory, and that \nAmericans can have faith in the integrity of our election results.\n  While we should not underestimate the significance of this action, we \nshould be cautious not to overstate the Federal role in the \nadministration of Federal elections. This legislation does not replace, \nnor would I tolerate it replacing, the historic role of State and local \nelection officials, nor does it create a one-size-fits-all approach to \nballoting in America.\n  We, by no means, intend to supplant the traditional role that State \nand local governments have played administering elections for Federal \noffice. But, for the first time, with this legislation, the Congress--\nthe Federal Government--will set basic minimum requirements and provide \ncritical resources for Federal elections.\n  This bipartisan compromise ensures that the most fundamental right in \nany democracy--the right to vote and have that vote counted--will be \nsecure. But it also allows States to meet the legislation's broad \nrequirements in a way best suited for their voting jurisdictions.\n  Notwithstanding this flexible approach, the primary objectives of \nthis compromise remain expanding the franchise, protecting our Federal \nelections system from corruption, and providing the ongoing leadership \nthat is required of a Federal partner.\n  Let me be clear from the outset, this legislation is not about one \nState or one election. While the problems that took place in Florida a \nyear ago last November brought the flaws in our election system to the \nNation's attention, these are systemic problems that have existed in \nmany States for many years.\n  In fact, the General Accounting Office found that 57 percent of \nvoting jurisdictions nationwide experienced major problems conducting \nthe November 2000 elections. Meanwhile, the Caltech/MIT Voting \nTechnology Project found there have been approximately 2 million \nuncounted, unmarked, or spoiled ballots in each of the last four \nPresidential elections.\n  Luckily, unlike many other issues that are presented to the Congress, \nthe vast majority of the flaws in our election system are eminently \nfixable.\n  As the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, led by former \nPresidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, found:\n\n       The weaknesses in election administration are, to a very \n     great degree, problems that Government can actually solve.\n\n  We have the opportunity today to take an incremental step forward \ntoward solving our election problems as we begin debate on the Equal \nProtection of Voting Rights Act.\n  This bill also represents a major step forward for the United States \nCongress. For the very first time, the Federal Government will become a \nreal partner with State and local governments in the administration of \nFederal elections.\n  This legislation has been 15 months in the making. In the wake of the \nNovember 2000 elections, then-chairman of the Rules Committee, and my \ngood friend, Mitch McConnell, first pledged that our committee would \nconduct a series of hearings on election reform. Under his leadership, \nthe committee held the initial hearing on March 14 of the year 2001.\n  When I assumed the committee chairmanship in June, I pledged to \ncontinue to make election reform the top legislative priority of the \nSenate Rules Committee. Toward that end, we held an additional 3 days \nof hearings on election reform last summer, including the committee's \nfield hearing in Atlanta, GA.\n  Recognizing that comprehensive election reform legislation could not \nbe a partisan endeavor, we brought together last fall a bipartisan team \nof Senators devoted to this issue.\n  Our election reform working group included, of course, Senator Mitch \nMcConnell of Kentucky, who deserves tremendous accolades for initially \nfocusing the Rules Committee on this important issue and for being a \ngreat partner in trying to resolve the many difficult issues we \nresolved in presenting this piece of legislation to our colleagues; our \nRepublican colleague from Missouri, Kit Bond, who was a passionate \nadvocate for including provisions to ensure the integrity of Federal \nelections; and my fellow Rules Committee members, New York Senator \nChuck Schumer and New Jersey Senator Bob Torricelli, who were among the \nvery first Members of this body to forcefully push for bipartisan \nelection reform legislation.\n  I am grateful to all of these Senators for their tireless work and \nthat of their staffs who put in literally hundreds of hours to bring us \nto this point of considering a proposal on election reform.\n  All of us worked many months to develop legislation that would try to \nmeet one central goal; that was to make it easier to vote in America \nand much harder to corrupt our Federal election system.\n  On December 19 of last year, we introduced the compromise legislation \nas a Senate substitute amendment No. 2688, an amendment to S. 565, the \nelection reform bill reported out of the Rules Committee on August 2. \nToday, Majority Leader Daschle acted on his commitment to make this \nbill one of the first items on the Senate agenda during the 2nd session \nof the 107th Congress and I mark himself his considerable efforts.\n  Our legislation simply establishes three basic minimum Federal \nrequirements that support our principle of making it easier to vote but \nharder to corrupt the system: One, voting system standards so that \nevery eligible blind or disabled person and every language minority can \ncast a vote privately and independently; two, provisional voting so \nthat an eligible voter in America will never be turned away from the \nvoting booth and voting information posted at the polls so that voters \nare informed of their rights; and three, statewide voter registration \nlists and verification for first-time voters who register by mail so \nthat all eligible voters who choose to vote will be able\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nto do so and those who are not eligible cannot.\n  Our bill offers not just goals but some guarantees as well. We ensure \nthat these reforms will be implemented by authorizing the Attorney \nGeneral to bring civil action against jurisdictions that fail to comply \nwith these requirements. The compromise also establishes a new Federal \nagency with four bipartisan commissioners. They will be appointed by \nthe President, confirmed by the Senate, and each will serve a single 6-\nyear term. Our colleague, Senator Mitch McConnell, deserves great \ncredit for originating this idea which I think is going to bring great \nvalue in years later, as other Congresses meet to consider ways to \nachieve the goal of making it easier to vote and harder to corrupt the \nsystem. That commission, which we will establish with this bill, will \nserve a very valuable purpose, where election officials from across the \ncountry can get unbiased advice and counseling as to what is the best \nequipment and material to have in order to improve the election system.\n  The Election Administration Commission will eventually administer the \nminimum requirements and grant programs to fund them. It will also \nserve as a national clearinghouse and resource for information on \nelection administration.\n  Finally, our legislation provides Federal funding to States and \nlocalities. For the very first time, again, the Congress and the \nFederal Government will start paying their fair share of the cost of \nadministering elections for Federal office. I don't believe in having \nFederal minimum requirements, as logical and as sensible as they are, \nand not coming up with the resources to our States and localities to \npay for them. We do that.\n\n  The Senate bill authorizes a total of $3.5 billion towards this end: \n$3 billion with no matching requirement over 4 years for the purpose of \nfunding the requirements; $400 million in this fiscal year for an \nincentive grant program to allow States and localities to immediately \nfund improvements to their voting systems and election administration \nprocedures, including education programs and other such provisions that \nStates may see as being in their interest.\n  We also authorize $100 million for an accessibility grant program to \nhelp make polling places physically accessible to the blind and \ndisabled in this country.\n  This generous commitment of Federal resources underscores the fact \nthat nothing in this bill establishes an unfunded mandate on States or \nlocalities. We give States and localities the resources as well as the \nflexibility they need to get the job done. We recognize that State and \nlocal election officials are uniquely qualified to determine what \nvoting systems and procedures are most appropriate for their individual \nStates and communities.\n  Importantly, in passing this bill, Congress will also meet the first \ncivil rights challenge of the 21st century. During our hearings on \nelection reform, our committee heard repeated testimony regarding the \ndisproportionate treatment minorities received at the polls in the 2000 \nelections: African-American men asked about felony convictions; Arab \nAmericans forced to produce citizenship papers or to take a loyalty \noath; Hispanic Americans failing to receive language assistance \nrequired by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The committee also received \ndisturbing testimony regarding the disenfranchisement of Americans with \ndisabilities.\n  There are 21 million Americans with disabilities who did not vote in \nthe last election. This makes the disabled community, persons with \ndisabilities, the single largest demographic group of nonvoters in the \nUnited States of America, 21 million. We hope that with the provisions \nI have already mentioned in this bill, we will see that number, if not \ndisappear entirely, certainly be reduced considerably.\n  The General Accounting Office found that only 16 percent of all \npolling places in the contiguous United States are physically \naccessible from the parking area to the voting room. Not one of the 496 \npolling places visited by the General Accounting Office on election day \n2000 had special ballots or voting equipment adapted for blind voters.\n  Certain voters and communities are disproportionately affected by the \ninadequacies in our voting systems and election administration policies \nand procedures. As evidenced by testimony received by the Rules \nCommittee and numerous commission reports and studies, racial and \nethnic minorities, language minorities, disabled voters, overseas and \nmilitary voters, and poor communities all encountered unique and \ndisproportionate problems with the November 2000 elections--and \nelections before then, I might add--even after accounting for the \neffects of income, education, and poor ballot design.\n  For example, the General Accounting Office found that both a \njurisdiction's voting equipment and its demographic makeup had a \nstatistically significant effect on the percentage of uncounted votes. \nThe General Accounting Office found that counties with higher \npercentages of minority voters had higher rates of uncounted votes.\n\n  The GAO also reported that percentages of uncounted Presidential \nvotes were higher in minority areas than others, regardless of voting \nequipment.\n  These findings underscore the importance of instituting minimum \nFederal requirements that will ensure that all voters have an equal \nopportunity to vote and have their vote counted.\n  By passing this bipartisan election reform bill, the Senate will help \nensure that every single eligible American has the equal opportunity to \nboth cast a vote and, of course, have their vote counted.\n  Let me be as clear as I can: Nothing in this bill or in this debate \nis intended to call into question the results of the November 2000 \nPresidential election. This legislation is not about the past, it is \nabout the future of our democracy. I hope my colleagues will agree that \nthis bill, while not a perfect piece of legislation--it does not deal \nwith every imaginable election reform proposal--is a solid bill. It is \na good bill. It is a bill that took a lot of hours and a lot of \ncompromise between people committed to seeing to it that we improve a \nsystem that is so fundamental to the workings of our democracy.\n  The House has already enacted comprehensive election reform. I \ncommend Congressman Steny Hoyer and Congressman Ney, who worked very \nhard to put together a bill that they could pass, and we will have to \nmeet with them and resolve differences if we are able to ultimately \npass the bill that Senator McConnell and I present to the Senate today.\n  Certainly the President also deserves a great deal of credit. He \ncould have sat back and not included anything in his budget and said: \nLet's wait and see what you do up there, if you can get something done, \nand then talk to me. But the President included $1.2 billion in the \nbudget he submitted several weeks ago for election reform. I thank him \nin this Chamber; I have done so elsewhere. It is not all the resources \nwe will need, but it is a major commitment by the President of the \nUnited States to this issue. Our hope is that we can get our job done \nand get a bill passed and then take advantage of the offer made by the \nPresident in his budget proposal.\n  Finally, we believe this compromise is constitutionally sound. The \ncompromise is squarely within the broad grant of congressional \nauthority to legislate in the subject area of the administration of \nFederal elections. The GAO concluded that with regard to the \nadministration of Federal elections, Congress has constitutional \nauthority over both congressional and Presidential elections.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who labored so hard. I thank Tom Daschle \nand Trent Lott, our respective leaders, for allowing this bill to come \nto the floor; our staffs, for their tireless work; and again, my \ncolleagues, Mitch McConnell, Kit Bond, Chuck Schumer, Bob Torricelli, \nand many others who have expressed their views and thoughts on this \nlegislation.\n  I thank the witnesses who testified before our committee.\n  Finally, a very special thanks is reserved for my friend, John \nConyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and my \ncoauthor in the House of the original election reform legislation. His \ncommitment to this issue is unparalleled.\n  With that, I conclude with the words I opened with of Dr. Martin \nLuther King:\n\n       The history of our Nation is the history of a long and \n     tireless effort to broaden and to increase the franchise of \n     American citizens.\n\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\n\n  Today, when we gather to discuss this reform measure, we are \nfulfilling the commitment Martin Luther King suggested in his words 40 \nyears ago--to broaden and increase that franchise.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the context of human history, it was \nnot so long ago that the mere concept of having the right to vote was \nscarcely imaginable for most people. Even in America, the world's \ngreatest democracy, half our citizenry was denied the right to vote \nuntil the 19th amendment was ratified early in the 20th century.\n  At the outset of the 21st century, we still have work to do to ensure \nthat all Americans who are eligible to vote, who have the right to \nvote, do indeed have their votes counted on election day--counted, I \nhasten to add, within an election system in which the integrity of the \nprocess is not in question, so voters can know their right to vote is \nnot diminished through fraud committed by others, nor diminished \nthrough error, poor procedures, or faulty equipment.\n  This is the mission that Senator Dodd, Senator Bond, Senator  \nSchumer, Senator Torricelli, and I tasked ourselves with in crafting \nthe bipartisan legislation before the Senate today. We sought to make \nAmerican election systems more accurate, more accessible, and more \nhonest. And we worked to achieve these ambitious goals within the \nframework of legislation which both sides of the aisle could support \nand which would not financially crush the states who will be changed \nwith its implementation.\n  None of us got everything we wanted in this bill, not even close. \nThere are things in this bill that one or more of us are not big fans \nof. But that was the price for putting this bipartisan bill together.\n  The Dodd-McConnell bill is a comprehensive compromise. In other \nwords, it is a target-rich environment for amendments--legitimate, \ngermane, relevant, even laudable efforts to make the bill better, or \nworse, depending on one's perspective. I myself could easily come up \nwith a couple dozen amendments. My staff already has, just in case. If \nthe Senate passed them all we would, in my view, have crafted the \nperfect election reform bill.\n  Regrettably, we all have different notions of what comprises \nperfection in this realm. So in the interest of advancing a pretty darn \ngood election reform bill, I will not be offering my two dozen \nmeticulously-crafted, well-intentioned amendments to make the bill \nabsolutely perfect.\n  Senator Bond, who has done tremendous work in making sure that the \neffort to make voting easier is balanced with provisions to make vote \nfraud harder, could certainly offer up some excellent amendments to go \nfurther in that direction. I think the Senate should do more to reduce \nvote fraud but, realistically, we are not going to get everything we \nwant in that regard through this Senate. The Dodd-McConnell bill does a \nlot which is worthwhile, overdue and, significantly, is doable.\n  This quest for election reform has its roots in the photofinish 2000 \npresidential election that culminated in the protracted battle over \nFlorida's electoral votes. While that saga was playing out, some of us \nin the Senate began formulating reform legislation to make a recurrence \nless likely in the future and to make improvements in the system that \nelection officials in the states have long known needed to be made but \nfor a variety of reasons, primiarly financial, were not done. Over a \nyear ago, Senator Torricelli and I proposed a comprehensive election \nreform bill. Last May, Senator Torricelli and I joined with Senator \nSchumer to put together yet another bill. The McConnell-Schumer-\nTorricelli bill garnered even more bipartisan support with a remarkable \ncosponsorship list of 71 cosponsors, a solid roster fairly even between \nRepublicans and Democrats. Senator Dodd, meanwhile, headed up an effort \nthat had much in common with the McConnell-Schumer-Torricelli approach, \nbut was distinct in important ways, and gathered all the Democrats \nbehind it. Between our bills and others introduced in the past year, we \ncome into this floor debate with over 90 Senators having cosponsored \nsome version of election reform. That is a ringing, approaching \nunanimous, endorsement for serious election reform.\n  All of my colleagues who have worked to advance election reform and \nget us to this point deserve thanks. Most especially, Senator Dodd, the \nChairman of the Rules Committee, whose dogged determination to put \ntogether a consensus these past few months has paid off. He was so \nfocused in pursuit of a bill that as the weeks were going by in \nDecember without an agreement, it occurred to me that he would never \nlet up and I might have to spend Christmas around his conference table. \nFortunately, there is a Santa Claus and his present to me was a ticket \nhome to Kentucky for Christmas, a bipartisan election reform bill in \nthe can, and Chris Dodd off my back. I say that, of course, with humor \nand only the greatest respect for the chairman's tireless effort.\n  The Dodd-McConnell bill is legislation that the entire Senate can be \nproud of supporting, and pass knowing that it would significantly \nimprove America's election systems. Americans should also take note \nthat the chairman is a champion in promoting accessibility in \nelections, a real hero to America's disabled community for whom the \nright to vote can be difficult to exercise. This bill reflects his \ncommitment in this respect as well. The Dodd-McConnell bill before the \nSenate incorporates three key principles contained within the original \nMcConnell-Torricelli bill put together over a year ago.\n  No. 1, Respect for the primary role of the States and localities in \nelection administration. The Constitution's 10th amendment too often \nget short-shrift around here, but we tried mightily in this compromise \nto respect it. I will say this bill treads more than I would like on \nstate prerogative but it does so a good deal less than with some of the \ninterest groups out there would like and which some other bills have \nproposed.\n  No. 2, Establishment of an independent, bipartisan commission--\ncomprised of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed by the \nPresident--to provide ongoing election assistance to the states, in the \nform of grants and as a clearinghouse for information on new \ntechnologies and effective election procedures.\n  The point to this, in my view, was to have one place in the country, \na repository of objective advice, where State and local officials, who \nare constantly confronted by vendors trying to sell them one election \nsystem or another, could go for objective advice. Nobody is selling \nanything at this commission--just giving objective advice about what \nkind of upgrade, if any, is necessary to improve the election system in \na particular State.\n  As Chairman Dodd can attest, I fervently believe that for long-term \nreform of election systems, we need a permanent repository for the \nbest, unbiased, objective information that states can tap into the \nfuture. At present, the typical county-level or State official is \nbesieged by commercial vendors who want to sell their product, \nballoting machines and the other implements of election administration. \nThe new commission in the Dodd-McConnell bill will provide objective, \nstate-of-the-art information that can be weighed against whatever sales \npitch is coming from vendors.\n  No. 3, Strong anti-fraud provisions to clean-up voter rolls and \nensure integrity in American elections.\n  We want eligible people to vote. Dogs, cats and cadavers are making \nfar too many appearances in American elections, even though a \nconstitutional amendment giving them a right to vote has not been \nenacted.\n  As good as the Dodd-McConnell bill is, and as high as my hopes are \nthat it will result in much better election systems in America, we \nshould temper somewhat the expectations it may raise. We cannot \nlegislate perfection in this arena. Voters are imperfect people whose \nballots are counted by imperfect people and tabulated by machines \ncreated and maintained by imperfect people. If in the future another \npresidential election comes down to the wire, with an electorate \ncomprised of hundreds of millions of people virtually evenly split in \ntheir candidate preference, then there could well be some controversy \nin arriving at a conclusion.\n  In the meantime, the Dodd-McConnell bill would go a long way in \nmaking\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\nelections better, more accessible, more accurate and more honest. And \nit would prevent some of the chaos in close, competitive elections. If \nwe can do that, I would call that a pretty good day's work in the \nSenate.\n\n  Again, I compliment Chairman Dodd for his persistence in getting us \nto the point we are, and I thank particularly Senator Bond, Senator \nSchumer, and Senator Torricelli.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \ncompromise amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 565, the Equal \nProtection of Voting Rights Act of 2001. I am proud to join Senators \nDodd, McConnell, Schumer, Bond, and Torricelli in co-sponsoring this \nhistoric piece of legislation designed to improve our Nation's voting \npractices and procedures. I am glad that we are addressing this issue \nnow, and hope that legislation is enacted soon. In many states, voters \nwill go to the polls this year using much of the same equipment as was \nused in 2000, which will result in many of the same problems. Our \npurpose here today is to prevent the problems of the Year 2000 election \nfrom occurring in the future.\n  While we all remember the ``butterfly ballots'' and ``hanging chads'' \nof Florida, we must also consider the facts that show the problems of \nElection 2000 were nationwide. In Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, \nnearly 123,000 presidential votes went uncounted, and in Fulton County, \nGeorgia, one of every 16 ballots for president was invalidated. The \nGeneral Accounting Office found that 57 percent of jurisdictions \nnationwide had major problems in Election 2000. The MIT/Caltech Voting \nProject estimates that 4 to 6 million votes were lost. During two \nhearings by the Senate Commerce Committee, our witnesses testified that \nmany of these problems were caused by outdated and inaccurate lever and \npunch card voting machines, distinct inadequacies in poll worker and \nvoter education, and confusion over election administration and voting \nregistration procedures. I believe that the mandatory standards and \nfederal grant programs found in the compromise amendment I am \ncosponsoring will play an important role in resolving these problems in \nthe future.\n  However, I am concerned that this bill will not address the concerns \nof disabled voters, who time and again confront physical barriers when \nthey attempt to vote. Disabled voters should not be forced to bring \ntheir own ramps to polling places, go through alternative entrances, \nand put up with numerous other barriers and humiliations when they \nattempt to vote. According to a 2001 General Accounting Office report, \n84 percent of all polling places in the contiguous United States have \none or more potential impediments to disabled voters. While many of \nthese polling places use curbside voting, many disabled voters complain \nthat curbside voting infringes on their privacy, when they cast a \nballot. So instead of voting, many disabled Americans simply stay home. \nAccording to the National Organization on Disability, 21 million voting \nage citizens with disabilities did not vote. President Alan Reich of \nthe National Organization on Disability summed it up best, when he \nstated that ``there is great irony that a person in a wheelchair can't \nget into some polling places, whereas a person using a guide dog can \nget inside, only to find out there is no accessible voting machine.'' I \nintend to offer a minor technical amendment to this legislation that I \nhope will resolve many of these concerns. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in addressing this issue.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this historic \nlegislation. This legislation should be addressed in a timely manner by \nthe Senate, and I hope that the conference with the House can also be \nresolved soon, so that we can send a bill to the President for his \nsignature. I am afraid that it is already too late to do much to help \nvoters for the 2002 election, but we can and must make sure that the \nproblems of Election 2000 are not repeated in 2004.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2858 to Amendment No. 2688\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Colorado in sponsoring this important amendment to reserve voting \nrights for our service men and women.\n  I yield the floor to the sponsor.\n  Mr. DODD. Is the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire the same \namendment as the amendment of the Senator from Colorado?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is addressing \nthe matter of election reform. Like carpenters tending to their tools \nor fishermen working on their nets, this Nation's government must \nconstantly maintain and improve the voting rights of American citizens, \nthe very basis of our democracy.\n  I am pleased with the work of Senators McConnell and Dodd and others \non the bill before us. Nobody who has ever participated in an election \nin any serious way, running, campaigning, judging, and so on, would \nbelieve that our system is perfect. It is based on a sound framework, \nbut the devil in the details requires constant exorcism.\n  Today we are moving to address in this body various problems that \nhave come to our attention, some of them alarmingly so in the November \n2000 elections.\n  I have been in contact with the Colorado Secretary of State, and \nlocal election officials, and I know that there are problems on a \nfederal level, on the state level, and the local level. Everybody from \ncounty clerks to Senate Rules Committee chairmen have recognized the \nfaults that currently call for correction.\n  As a Member of the Senate Armed Services, I paid special attention to \nthe complaints I heard from our uniformed services men and women. \nWithout undue politicalization, I believe it is appropriate to at least \nallude to the spectacle of campaign lawyers hovering over election \nofficials with pre-printed military absentee ballot challenge forms. I \nunderstand that in an election every opportunity available will be \nutilized. I think, however, that this body should undertake efforts to \nensure that military service men and women are given all due chances to \nexercise their right to vote.\n  Now, this body has tried to do so. Last year, during consideration of \nthe Defense Authorization, the Senate passed a bipartisan amendment \nstrongly supported by Chairman Dodd and Senator McConnell that \nsignificantly improved the voting rights of military service members. I \nwas pleased at this passage, and so were the various military support \ngroups, veterans organizations, and others who contacted me with their \nnotes of encouragement and support.\n  Unfortunately, in conference the House refused to accept two of the \nprovisions. I believe their position on this matter was not the correct \none. I think they were seriously wrong. And so we must try again.\n  My current amendment, cosponsored by Senators Bob Smith, Phil Gramm, \nAllen, Roberts, Cochran, Collins, and Lugar, is another attempt to \nlegislate protection for our military voter's franchise.\n  The first section prohibits a State from disqualifying a ballot based \nupon lack of notarization, postmark, address, witness signature, lack \nof proper postmark, or on the basis of comparison of envelope, ballot \nand registration signatures alone, these were the basis for most \nabsentee ballot challenges.\n  There has been report after report of ballots mailed, for instance \nfrom deployed ships or other distant postings, without the benefit of \npostmarking facilities. Sometimes mail is bundled, and the whole group \ngets one postmark, which could invalidate them all under current law. \nFurther, military ``voting officers'' are usually junior ranks, quickly \ntrained, and facing numerous other responsibilities.\n  We can not punish our service personnel for the good faith mistakes \nof others.\n  The second section addresses a certain group of voters who can slip \nthrough the cracks. Military voters who are discharged and move before \nan election but after the residency deadline cannot vote through the \nmilitary absentee ballot system, and sometimes are not able to fulfill \ndeadlines to establish residency in a State.\n  This language allows them to register absentee and vote in person at \ntheir new polling place. This brings military voters into their new \ncommunity quicker.\n  The third section contains language denying States the ability to \ndeny a military ballot because it is mailed in too early. There are \nvery good administrative reasons why early ballots are prohibited in \nsome cases, but there are better reasons why we should offer uniform \nvoters--who are subject to rapid deployments, temporary duties, and \nunexpected assignment changes, the option to secure their vote by \nmailing their ballot when they can, even if it is early.\n  Finally, given all the changes considered and passed by the Congress \nin various vehicles, I have included language directing the DoD to mail \na copy of current military voter laws to every state to be distributed \nto each voting jurisdiction. I think it would be a good idea to assist \nState Secretaries of States in their duties and clarify Congressional \nintent by codifying all the modifications.\n  Given the current deployment schedule of our armed forces, I can \nconceive of no time more urgent than the present to let our men and \nwomen in uniform know that the government of the Unites States will not \ntolerate any appearance of a challenge to their voting rights. I urge \nacceptance of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong support \nof Senator Allard's efforts to protect the voting rights of our \nmilitary men and women. It would be a pretty empty debate on election \nreform if the Senate ignored the discrimination that military voters \nsuffered in the last Presidential election and, indeed, I would say \nprobably have suffered in the past, in prior elections.\n  I visited Afghanistan just a month or so ago and saw the \ncircumstances that those men and women were under out there. Had that \nbeen at election time, I can imagine how difficult it might have been \nto make all the arrangements to get ballots to these people, get these \nballots out, get them back, and have them counted on time. I think it \nis important to understand it is the spirit and intent that matters. If \na person is trying to get his or her ballot in and it gets in a day or \nso late but it is in time to be counted, then we ought to err on the \nside of caution for the military person who is out there putting his or \nher life on the line for us every day.\n  I can speak from firsthand experience. I was aboard a ship during the \nVietnam war. Although that was not an election time at the time I was \nout at sea, there were periods of time when we were out at sea for 3 \nweeks, sometimes longer, with no access to any mail or the opportunity \nto get any mail off the ship. So had I been in a situation where the \nPresidential election or any other election was going on during that \ntime, there may have been a time when I might not have been able to get \na ballot off the ship. So I think we have to err on the side of caution \nand make absolutely certain we go out of our way to make sure these \nballots are counted.\n  That is what the Allard-Smith amendment is. I am proud to support it \nand proud to have my second-degree amendment to be sure we get a vote \non this very important measure.\n  The uniformed services election reform amendment is a comprehensive \npackage for all of our military voters. Section 401 of the amendment \nprovides, for example, that a State may not disqualify a military \nabsentee ballot for some technical reason.\n  Stop to think about it. Maybe somebody didn't put his name on right \nor something--some technical reason. Think about the circumstances \nwhere, for a smudge, for example, or something might be a technical \nviolation, that ballot could have come out of the mud of Afghanistan, \nmaking its way perhaps through rain or sleet or snow or some other way \nto get to a vehicle, perhaps to a helicopter and then out of there and \nover to some other location where it can eventually make its way back \nto Florida or Colorado or New\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\nHampshire or wherever the votes are supposed to be counted. That is a \nlong trek through some very difficult conditions sometimes.\n  I think it is sad that this new provision of law is necessary. \nReally, reasonable people ought to make reasonable efforts to count the \nballots of our military. We saw, unfortunately, that didn't happen. In \nFlorida, military voters were systematically disen-\nfranchised and there was an organized effort even to refuse to count \nthese ballots. I find that outrageous. There is some irony that all \nthis effort took place in Florida, to disenfranchise military voters, \nand now look what happened just 9 months later, 9-11. I wonder what \nsome of those same people who refused to count military ballots and \nwere looking for excuses not to count them might be saying right now.\n  There are no allegations of military voter fraud. That is not the \nissue. There is a difference between fraud and trying to disqualify \nballots for every technical reason that comes down the pipe. Yet \nmilitary votes were disqualified in the last Presidential election.\n  If, for example, someone was out at sea and the mail call was missed \nby an hour and because the mail call was missed by an hour a ballot may \nnot get to the returning ship for another week or so, or perhaps even--\nwhatever, a couple of days or weeks or whatever, and because they \nmissed that one mail call, that means they can't get that ballot in. If \nit comes in a day late or an hour late or whatever, is it the intent, \nis it the right thing to do to count that person's ballot? Of course \nthe answer is yes.\n  Section 402 provides new protections to recently separated uniformed \nservice voters as well. It protects the rights of military voters to \nregister to vote and request absentee ballots. It provides that the \nSecretary of Defense provide to the States new laws on military voting.\n  On April 6, I introduced a bill entitled the ``Armed Forces Voting \nRights Protection Act of 2001.'' This bill provides an amendment to the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965, to protect against a discriminated class of \nvoter--the military voter. Isn't it somewhat tragic and ironic that the \nmilitary voter is discriminated against?\n  Senator Allard's amendment is more comprehensive than mine, and I am \nmore than pleased to support his comprehensive effort to protect the \nvoting rights of the military. The reason why the pending amendment is \nneeded is because current law failed members of the Armed Forces in the \nlast Federal election.\n  We are not making allegations against anybody about fraud. It needs \nto be tightened up so we can make it work so the military folks get the \nbenefit of the doubt.\n  Federal law allowed military voters to be disenfranchised in the \nState of Florida. The pending amendment would stop discrimination \nagainst our military men and women.\n  Over time, the Federal Government has increased protection of the \nvoting rights of military personnel who serve overseas. Several Federal \nlaws have been enacted since 1942 to enable those in the military and \nU.S. citizens who live abroad to vote in Federal elections.\n  The Soldier Voting Act of 1942 was the first attempt to guarantee \nFederal voting rights for members of the armed services, and that law \nonly applied during wartime. But members of the armed services were \nprovided the use of a postage free, Federal postcard application to \nrequest that absentee ballot.\n  Again, when the request comes in, when you send that request out, are \nyou in a position to get that ballot and mail it out promptly? Not if \nyou are out on some bivouac for a week someplace or you are out in a \ncombat zone somewhere for a month and you don't get back. It may not be \nconvenient for you to get it back that quickly. So we need to get them \nout there promptly so they can get these ballots filled in and sent \nback. That expired at the end of World War II.\n  In 1986 President Reagan signed the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens \nVoting Act, which required the United States to permit uniformed \nservices voters, their spouses and dependents, and overseas voters who \nno longer maintain a residence in the U.S., to register absentee and \nvote by absentee ballot for all elections for Federal office.\n  These Federal laws were insufficient to protect our men and women in \nthe last election because many of these military voters were \ndisenfranchised by canvassing boards throughout the State of Florida.\n  Anyway, the pending amendment fixes Federal law to prevent this \ndiscrimination. Whether it is accidental or intentional, it does \ndiscriminate against military voters stationed overseas. This law would \nfix that law.\n  Over 1,500 overseas ballots were challenged in the State of Florida \nduring the election in 2000.\n  Think about that: 1,500 military ballots changed most of the time on \ntechnicalities, and many of those military men and women who served our \ncountry in some hostile environment were disenfranchised.\n  In Tallahassee in November of 2000, Robert Ingram, who was awarded a \nmedal for heroism as a Navy corpsman serving in the Marines in Vietnam, \nsaid the following about Florida elections boards:\n\n       They need to count the votes for service people abroad.\n\n  It seems to me that to even allow one military ballot to be \ndisqualified on a technical reason is really outrageous.\n  According to the Miami Herald of November 26, 2000:\n\n       Many canvassing boards have said, however, they followed \n     State law to the letter in disqualifying overseas ballots \n     with no signature, no witness, incorrect address, no postmark \n     or date and a variety of other problems.\n\n  Let me focus on one from my own personal experience. When I was \naboard ship, you would give a letter to the so-called mailperson on the \nship. If he didn't take that down and postmark it that particular day, \nhe might carry it around for a couple or 3 days. Why? Because the mail \nis not picked up from off the ship. It doesn't happen until you enter \nport. If you are not going to enter port for 3 days, why postmark it \nthe day it was picked up from you as the person who is mailing the \nletter?\n  That is what could happen. That is one example of why the postmark \nshould not be a criteria for why we take a person's right to vote. The \npending amendment would fix that law.\n  The Miami Herald did not cite actual fraud to disqualify 1,500 votes, \nmere technicalities in the State law.\n  The pending amendment repairs this problem with Federal law and does \nnot allow a ballot to be disqualified without ``evidence of fraud.''\n  If there is evidence of fraud, absolutely the ballots would be \ndisqualified. I think if there is any suggestion, or any indication, or \nany evidence whatsoever that there was fraud committed, disqualify \nthem. Fraud applies to everybody--military or nonmilitary. If you \ncommit fraud, your ballot shouldn't be counted.\n  There is evidence that there was a coordinated effort to \ndisenfranchise our military voters, I am sad to say.\n  Former Montana Governor Mark Racicot said last fall:\n\n       In an effort to win at any cost, the Vice President's \n     lawyers launched a State-wide effort to throw out as many \n     military ballots as they can.\n\n  Forty percent of the 3,500 overseas ballots in Florida were thrown \nout in November of 2000 for technical reasons.\n  You can go on and on. There is plenty of indication. We don't need to \ngo through all of it.\n  Felon convictions ranged from murder to rape and drunk driving. What \ncrime did our military personnel commit? I can understand why you \nwouldn't put a ballot in the hands of a rapist or a murderer or a drunk \nso he could vote. But no such crimes were committed by our military.\n  It is not a crime to volunteer to serve in the military. Every vote \nmust count including our military votes.\n  Basically, the ballots in Florida were disqualified for two reasons: \nThe requirement that ballots must be postmarked by election day, and \nfailure to either have a proper signature or date on the actual ballot. \nNeither of these issues are currently addressed in the Federal law. So \nthis changes that. Federal law leaves details to the State, such as \npostmark requirements and authentication of ballots.\n  In conclusion, I ask that voting rights be restored to our military \nvoters.\n  This is not something that anybody should oppose. It is not \ncontroversial, in my view. I think the Senator from Colorado has a good \namendment. It is\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\nthe least we can do. The statute did not cover it. People got a little \nbit excited in the heat of a political campaign and were trying to \ndisqualify ballots, or qualify ballots, whatever the case may have been \nand on whichever side you were on, and the military was caught in the \nmiddle. That is not right. We owe it to our service men and women to at \nleast allow them to participate in this great Republic that they \nsacrifice so much to defend.\n  I am pleased to support the Allard amendment.\n  If it is appropriate, I will ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment at this point.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am proud to co-sponsor this amendment \nwith my friend and colleague Senator Allard, who has been involved \ndeeply in this issue from the first whispers of improprieties following \nthe 2000 election.\n  Like him and many Americans, my conscience was struck by the failure \nof our voting system as a whole. The inadequacies exposed in Florida \nmay well have been found in any election district in any county in any \nstate in the Union. While my state of Indiana has been hard at work \nremedying its own shortfalls, it is essential that coupled with \nimportant changes we made as part of the FY 2002 Defense Authorization \nbill, we take the steps outlined in this amendment to improve the lot \nof the military voter.\n  We live in the 21st Century. We are used to instantaneous information \nand communication and data exchanges. We hold ourselves up as an \nexample to the world in the area of free and fair elections. Everyone \ncan vote, we say. Register, show up at the polls. Or, if you are not \ngoing to be in your home state, you can get a paper ballot through the \nmail and send it in. Simple.\n  Unfortunately, the reality has been much more complicated. In fact, \nas recent history has indicated and any military member deployed \noverseas can tell you, it's not simple. Depending on the election year, \nDoD goes to varying lengths to get the word out to the individual \nservice members, however, there is no real oversight and many times the \nSailor, Soldier, Airman or Marine in the weeks leading up to the \nelection is far away from a polling place without the materials he or \nshe needs to register or vote.\n  For the overseas military voter, registering and voting is a multi-\nstep process that can take months: first, a member must register to \nvote; second, a member must request an absentee ballot for each \nelection and its primary; third, the ballot must be received from the \nlocal voting jurisdiction; fourth, a member must complete that ballot \nand get it in to his or her election Board in the allotted time; and \nlast, the ballot is subject to a myriad of state and local election \nboard requirements.\n  With mail delays, remote deployments and other very real \ncircumstances, it can take literally months to complete the multi-step \nprocess. And, in the end, a military voter has no idea whether that \nballot was received and counted, or disqualified because of some \nobscure state standard for those ballots. Some jurisdictions, as we saw \nin Florida, execute a stringent checklist on each ballot to ensure that \nit meets exacting standards, unbeknownst to the servicemember.\n  To say the least, military voters need to plan ahead, especially when \nthey are going to be deployed during an election. Certainly, the right \nto vote implies some level of responsibility for the member, but even \nsuch matters as the proximate scheduling of primary and general \nelections in some states renders obsolete even the most prudent \nplanning. This is further complicated by run-offs and local ballot \nissues, making even a 45-day turnaround, the recommended standard, \nchallenging.\n  This amendment, coupled with the changes we made in the fall, will \nhelp alleviate this situation for the 2.7 million military members and \ntheir families who may at some time in their careers be sent overseas.\n  The Government Accounting Office, the Reserve Officers Association, \nthe Carter-Ford Commission and others discuss each of the shortfalls we \nseek to correct. And, as my colleague from Colorado has stated, we are \nlooking for very modest changes.\n  Among the provisions we are advocating, Senator Allard's amendment \nclarifies the standards that states must follow when processing the \nballots for our military personnel, and in maintaining their \nregistrations following discharge or release from active duty. All \nstates should use the same checklist when evaluating a ballot in a \nfederal election, and it should not be promulgated only during recount \nproceedings.\n  Fairness and simplification is important. But even as we tout its \nmerits and strive for simplification, we must maintain a cautious eye \non ensuring an accurate list of qualified voters. Fraud happens. As we \nwatch the trend toward more permissive absentee voting, the \nopportunities to commit fraud could very well expand. The Allard \namendment is thoughtful about balancing procedural simplification and \nstandardization with the imperative to prevent fraud.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues, on behalf of the men and women in \nuniform who are serving overseas today and those who will be in the \nremote corners of the globe in future election seasons, to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't know of any reason why we can't \naccept the amendment. I commend both my colleagues. I know this was \noffered earlier in the Armed Services Committee, and for reasons that \nthe Senator from Colorado may be more aware of as a member of the \ncommittee, getting rid of what they considered to be extraneous \namendments may have been the rationale.\n  But I think our colleagues pointed out good rationale as to why it is \nworthwhile. In fact, the basic thrust of this bill that Senator \nMcConnell and I are trying to address is why the two friends offered \nthis amendment; that it ought to be easier to cast the ballots. Too \noften I think these places can be less than user friendly when it comes \nto exercising one's franchise. Rejection on minor technicalities and \ndiscarding someone's effort to express a choice in an election is \nsomething we need to minimize, to put it mildly.\n  I support the amendment. I am happy to accept it, if the Senator \nwants to do it that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I didn't formally request it. I said if \nit is appropriate, I would do it. I withdraw my request.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am certainly pleased to hear the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Dodd, indicate that he is willing to \naccept the amendment.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from New \nHampshire. When this amendment was offered last year, there was a \nsignificant effort to derail it. I think that as a result of the hard \nwork of the Senator from Colorado--I see the Senator from Kansas who is \ndeeply interested in this issue is in the Chamber. They were all \nchagrined, as I recall, that it was lost in conference on the DOD \nauthorization bill. I think as a result of their perseverance and \ncoming back here today and pressing forward, it seems as if we are on \nthe verge of having it accepted.\n  I think it is a tribute to the Senators from Colorado, Kansas, and \nNew Hampshire. I thank all three of them.\n  I see the Senator from Kansas. He might want to address this issue \nbefore we wrap it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair, and I thank my distinguished friend \nfrom Colorado. Addressing this issues is certainly long overdue. If we \nare going to have an election reform bill, the very definition of \nelection reform begins with the intent of my friend's legislation.\n  As most marines know, there are no ex-marines. There are only former \nmarines. As a veteran and as a member of the Armed Services Committee, \nI recalled what happened in our last election to military personnel.\n  We witnessed a travesty. Election officials in some areas of the \ncountry failed to count thousands of military absentee ballots. This is \na slap in the face to the men and women who serve in the armed forces \nprotecting American interests.\n  We must respect the constitutional rights of all citizens--especially \nthose\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\nin uniform defending our country. It seem to me that a very basic \nConstitutional right was abrogated. This amendment achieves the goal of \ngiving military personnel the confidence that their vote matters.\n  It ensures that military personnel have the right to cast votes in \nlocal, state and federal elections, and makes certain those votes are \ncounted. It extends voter registration, absentee ballot protections, \nand requires that states prove fraud before disqualifying votes in \nfederal elections.\n  Until recently, we took for granted the sacrifices our military made \non a daily basis. The supreme purpose of the federal government is \ndefense of our homeland. Give those who defend our homeland the same \nrights and privileges ordinary citizens enjoy.\n  Consider a 1952 letter written by a former member of this body, which \npertains to this issue:\n\n       Many of those in uniform are serving overseas, or in parts \n     of the country distant from their homes. They are unable to \n     return to their states either to register or to vote. Those \n     risking their lives deserve to exercise the right to vote. \n     The least we can do at home is make sure they can enjoy the \n     rights they are preserving.\n\n  President Harry Truman penned those words. His support of the \nmilitary vote was so strong that he signed the Federal Voting \nAssistance Act into law in 1955. That legislation laid the groundwork \nfor the 1975 Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act, and it is now being \nimproved the Senator from Colorado and others who are cosponsoring this \nbill.\n  Voting is the cornerstone of democracy. Before passing any piece of \nthis legislation, we must first show our appreciation to service men \nand women by letting them know that their vote is a right, not a \nprivilege.\n  So again, I credit the distinguished Senator from Colorado, and all \nthose involved--Senator Smith, Senator McConnell, and the distinguished \nchairman, who I know is also very supportive.\n  I am very proud to have my name as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his \ngracious remarks and really appreciate him working with us on this \nparticular issue. I also thank the Senator from New Hampshire for all \nhis help. I particularly thank the chairman for his support, and the \nranking Republican Senator, Mr. McConnell, for his help in relation to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If I could have the indulgence of the \nleader, I would like to share a personal anecdote that does not relate \nto voting but relates to smudges and things that may occur from time to \ntime.\n  For military personnel, as you know, some of the ballots were \ndisqualified because of a smudge mark or something not clearly \nreadable.\n  In 1945, when my father was killed at the end of the Second World War \nin a plane crash in the Chesapeake Bay--serving in all of his combat \nmissions, he was killed in a military aircraft that went down in the \nChesapeake Bay--his body was recovered 2 days later. Of course, in the \nrecovery of his body, they recovered his wallet.\n  My mother--who was then a young widow with two boys--had to follow \nthe limousine from Virginia back to the funeral parlor in Trenton, NJ, \nwhere my father was buried. She had no money for gasoline because we \ncould not use it then; you had to use stamps. The only stamps she had \nwere the stamps from my father's wallet.\n  After filling up with gas, when she went into the gas station to \npresent those stamps, the attendant would not take the stamps because \nhe said he could not read them; they were smudged.\n  My mother never forgot that story. Until almost the day she died, she \ntalked about it, about how much that hurt her, that no matter how much \npressure was put on that attendant, he refused to accept those stamps.\n  So I think we have to err on the side of caution for our military. \nThey go through a lot. There is a lot of sacrifice. That story was not \nabout a ballot, but it was about a document, if you will.\n  So I really appreciate the support of Senator Dodd and Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Allard and others for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if there is no further debate, I ask that we \nvote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2861.\n  The amendment (No. 2861) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Allard \namendment No. 2858, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2858), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the measure that \nis before us. I have had the pleasure of coming to this Chamber on \nseveral occasions to talk about it as we prepared to move forward.\n  I think it is vitally important that we have taken up this extremely \nimportant measure so early in this session. It is not the first bill to \nbe considered, but it is probably the first new one to be considered \nafter the others that have carried over.\n  I offer my very special thanks to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Kentucky for the great work and effort \nthey have put in on this legislation. We have also worked with the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer, and the Senator from New Jersey, \nMr. Torricelli, because we are all concerned about assuring that we \nsafeguard the most important right that a citizen in a democracy such \nas ours has; and that is the right to select the leadership, the right \nto select those who represent them.\n  Today, together, we are in the process of delivering on the promise \nthat for all Americans we want to make it easier to vote and harder to \ncheat. I think that is what the American people want: Every American \ncitizen--appropriate age, appropriate qualifications, properly \nregistered--ought to be able to cast a ballot without difficulty. They \nalso ought to be able to do that only once. That is the other part. We \nshould, and we will in this bill, make it very hard for people to \ncheat. We know that every fraudulent vote cast dilutes the rights of \nthose who cast lawful ballots.\n  The Missouri Court of Appeals, on election day in November 2000, was \npresented with a case where an order was entered in St. Louis City \nCircuit Court to keep the polls open. The court of appeals was very \nclear. They expressed what higher courts in this land have expressed \npreviously; that is, if you permit people to vote more than once, to \nvote in the name of a dead person, a nonexistent person, or even a dog, \nas we have talked about previously in this Chamber, you are diluting \nand, thus, devaluing the vote of those who cast their vote legally, who \nhave a right to vote, who have a right to have their voice counted, and \ncounted once.\n  I think we have accomplished this goal. We have worked long and hard. \nAs we know, there has already been one amendment offered that has been \nacceptable to both sides to improve this bill. So we are not saying \nthat this has dealt with every area. I know there will be several other \nquestions and concerns raised. But I think we have a very good \nfoundation which will move the process forward.\n  I am not a member of the Rules Committee, nor prior to the year 2000 \ndid I consider myself an expert on election reform.\n  I first saw the corrosive effects of potential fraud in the 1972 \nelection, when I was running for Governor of Missouri. My opponent \nengineered an effort to keep the polls open late in St. Louis.\n  We thought we were doing well, but they kept voting in the city of \nSt. Louis, which runs about 70 percent or\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nmore Democratic. We were concerned. The polls stayed open until, as I \nrecall, late in the evening. It finally appeared that there had been \nenough of a margin in the votes that rolled up out in the State that \nthere were not, even laughably, enough votes in St. Louis to turn it \naround. So they finally shut it down.\n  I was elected. I went on to say we were going to clean up the State \nof Missouri. When I had the power to appoint the election board, as I \ndid in the city of St. Louis, the county of St. Louis, Kansas City, \nJackson County--I appointed good, solid Republicans for the Republican \npositions, and I took the nominations of Democratic members of the \nMissouri General Assembly to appoint good, solid Democrats.\n  One of the best protections we have in the voting process is to have \ngood, solid Republicans and good, solid Democrats watching each other, \nmaking sure that neither side cheats. That is important.\n  I am pleased to say that during the 8 years I served as Governor, I \nthought Missouri ran elections pretty well.\n  Let's fast forward 28 years: Same State, same city, same play called \nfrom the same vote fraud playbook.\n  I saw firsthand an effort to influence an election illegally. On \nelection day, we heard, in advance, there was going to be a lawsuit \nfiled, as reports circulated throughout the day that they expected \nthere would be voting ``irregularities.'' And sure enough, they went \ninto court.\n  It was the Gore-Lieberman team that went into court in St. Louis. \nFourteen minutes later they filed an almost identical suit in the city \nof Kansas City, again an overwhelmingly Democratic area. The suit was \nthrown out in Kansas City.\n\n  In St. Louis, they entered an order keeping the polls open. \nSurprisingly enough, they had recorded messages from Rev. Jesse Jackson \nbeing played on the radio saying you can vote until 10 or you can vote \ndown at the election board until midnight. It seems they planned this \nin advance. The contention they took to the judge was that the \nDemocratically appointed election board in the city of St. Louis was \nconspiring to prevent the overwhelmingly Democratic voters of St. Louis \nfrom voting for the Democratic ticket and therefore they needed to keep \nthe polls open so they could continue to vote.\n  If you are going to cheat in an election, you don't go into an area \nwhere you have an overwhelming number of your votes and have your \npeople conspire to keep your voters from voting for your candidates. \nNevertheless, they introduced the measure, and it was ultimately--very \nshortly, fortunately--overturned by the Missouri Court of Appeals.\n  This was truly extraordinary. But, frankly, it underscored for me the \nfact that vote fraud is not merely something to be studied in the \nhistory books. You have all heard that joke in various parts of the \ncountry--I have used it in some areas in Missouri--I am so committed to \npolitics, when I die I want to be buried in a certain county or even in \na certain State because I want to be able to continue voting from the \ngrave.\n  That is a joke that, unfortunately, was alive and well in St. Louis.\n  Here is what happened. The day before the 2000 election, there was a \nprediction that there would be so much confusion on election day that a \nlawsuit would be necessary to keep the polls open. This candidate for \noffice said: If it requires keeping the polls open a little longer, we \nare going to get a court order to do it.\n  Sure enough, as predicted, on election day there was much confusion, \nsome of it from people bussed in. A lawsuit was filed to keep the polls \nopen late. This is where it really gets interesting.\n  The plaintiff in the case was a man named Robert D. Odom. His lawyer \nclaimed that Robert D. Odom could not vote because of the long lines \nand feared his client would be unable to vote unless the polls were \nkept open late. But what we discovered was that Mr. Robert D. Odom's \nreal problem was not that he faced long lines at the polling place. \nThat was not his problem. The main reason that Robert D. Odom was \nunable to vote had to do with the fact that he had been dead for a year \nand a half.\n  Long after the court case was thrown out, when confronted with the \nuncomfortable fact of the death of Robert D. Odom, Mr. Odom's attorney \nadmitted the mistake, one he never bothered to share with the presiding \njudge or the court to correct the record. The plaintiff seeking relief, \naccording to that lawyer, wasn't Robert D. Odom. The attorney claimed \nit was actually Mr. Robert M. Odom, also known in local political \ncircles as Mark Odim, a political operative for a candidate Lacy Clay, \nwho was successful as Democratic candidate for Congress in that \nelection. The plaintiff's identity only raised more troubling \nquestions. The more we dug, the more we found.\n  In the case of Mark Odom, the Congressman today, we found, despite \nhis plea to the courts for relief from the lines that were too long at \nthe local polling places, the evidence showed that Mr. Odom had in fact \nalready voted earlier that day. The evidence is his own signature on a \nsignature card retrieved from his own polling place.\n\n  Certainly we hope he was not trying to vote a second time. What we \nwitnessed in St. Louis was a premeditated effort to keep the polls open \nlate in St. Louis, an overwhelmingly Democratically controlled city, \nbecause an aide to a Democratic candidate for Congress feared he would \nbe unable to vote even though he had already voted that day. It sounds \nincredible, but that is the record. It is right there in the record, \nand we have the court transcript and the documents to prove it. The \njudge approved the scheme. The polls were kept open late, until the \neffort was overturned in the evening.\n  The effort to keep the polls open late in St. Louis was not the only \n``irregularity'' we saw on election day. Elsewhere in town, a panel of \ncity judges was rubber-stamping court orders to allow unregistered \npeople to vote. The Missouri Constitution says you have to be \nregistered. So they went in, and the secretary of state's office \nreviewed the applications filed by 1,233 St. Louis city and county \nresidents who were allowed to vote, even though they were not \nregistered to do so.\n  Here are some of the reasons given to judges for people who failed to \nregister before the deadline passed and were the bases for circuit \njudges in St. Louis ordering them to be allowed to vote:\n\n       I want a Dem President.\n       I did not know it was required.\n       I was a felon. I was released on November 1999, and I \n     didn't know that I had to register again to vote.\n\n  Parenthetically, you are not permitted to vote if you are a convicted \nfelon unless you have been pardoned.\n\n       I was late registering due to me were going through a \n     mental disorder.\n\n  Do you know what the city judges did? They rubber-stamped these \nrequests, even though they failed to meet the clear standards under \nState law for court orders to vote. Only 35 of the 1,268 court orders \nto vote met the legal standard set by Missouri law.\n  All of the evidence gathered by Missouri's Secretary of State \nindicates it was no accident that hundreds, if not thousands, of \nunregistered people showed up in front of judges willing to rubber-\nstamp these requests. No accident, indeed. The evidence indicates that \nthere was a premeditated effort to organize the delivery of these \nillegal voters to the polls, where they would be welcomed by judges all \ntoo willing to disregard the law and grant them illegal court orders.\n  That wasn't the extent of it. The investigation of the secretary of \nstate turned up some truly amazing things: 62 Federal felons voted in \nthat election, along with 52 State felons, people who are not legally \nentitled to vote; 68 people voted twice; 14 dead people cast votes--I \nhave heard of people with an undying commitment to politics, but that \nis carrying it a little too far--79 people registered to vacant lots in \nthe city of St. Louis voted in the election; 45 of the city's election \njudges were not registered to vote as they are required to do in order \nlawfully to hold the position of election judge; the discovery of 250 \naddresses that are not identified as apartments from which 8 or more \nindividuals are registered to vote. A random sampling of 54 of these \nlocations indicates that 14 of them might have been used as drop sites \nfor multiple false voter registrations.\n  All this is only what we know from the press and the public reports. \nThere may be more. There is an ongoing Federal investigation. We don't \nknow what the results of that will be. We can't\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\nsay. Frankly, we had a very active and alert press corps that began to \ndig out some of these things and helped bring to the attention of the \nsecretary of state and others what was going on.\n  Sadly, this vote fraud was not a one-time occurrence in November of \n2000. The specter of vote fraud returned to St. Louis as the flowers in \nthe spring. Just before the daffodils were coming up, probably the \ncrocuses, we saw suspect voter mail-in registrations to vote. On the \nvery last day to register to vote before the mayoral primary, someone \ndropped off 3,000 voter registration cards, most for purported would-be \nvoters in the third and fifth wards north of St. Louis, on 2 specific \nstreets, most written with identical handwriting. And as it turns out, \nalmost every single one of them was fraudulent.\n  The brazenness of that vote fraud is stunning. One of the fraudulent \nvoter registration cards belonged to what was purported to be a \nreregistration of the late city alderman, Alberto ``Red'' Villa. It \nmight have been about the 10th anniversary of his death--certainly, a \ntheologically significant date, but not significant in terms of \nqualifying for registration. There was a registration card belonging to \nthe deceased mother of another city alderman also found among the 3,000 \ndropped off on the last day of voter registration.\n  Yes, even in this day and age, just because you die is not grounds to \ndisqualify you from voting in St. Louis, because everybody knows how \nyou would have voted if you had been there.\n  Now, it seems that in some places nobody gets stirred up by vote \nfraud during general elections between Democrats and Republicans. But \nwatch out if it happens during a Democratic primary for mayor because \nthat is real jobs and patronage at stake.\n  After the shocking attempts to steal the mayoral primary race in St. \nLouis, the local press reported that the FBI had subpoenaed all of the \nrecords at the city election board for both the general election and \nthe mayoral primary.\n  While we await the results of that Federal investigation, it has \nalready provided quite an education. Some days, I feel as if my staff \nand I are in a graduate program at the St. Louis school of election \nfraud. The more we dug into the issue, the more we were able to see the \nsize of the problem in St. Louis.\n  We found, for example, that the number of registered voters in the \ncity of St. Louis threatens to outnumber the voting-age population. A \ntotal of 247,135 St. Louis residents, dead, alive, or even canine, are \nlisted as registered voters, compared to the city's voting-age \npopulation of 258,532. That translates to a whopping 96 percent \nregistration rate. Were that they were all legitimate registrations, \nthat would be a tremendous mark of civic involvement and participation \nin St. Louis. But I am from Missouri; you have to show me that those \nwere all one person, one registration, one vote.\n  Lest you think I am only talking about St. Louis, according to the \nAssociated Press, there are 18 municipalities in Allegheny County, PA, \nwith more registered voters than voting-age adults. Upper St. Clair has \n15,361 registered voters, but, unfortunately, they only have 14,369 \nresidents of voting age.\n  Back to St. Louis. About one-quarter of registered voters in that \ncity are on the inactive voter list, meaning that the U.S. Postal \nService has failed to verify that 70,000 people are actually still \nliving at the addresses from which they registered, or even whether \nthey are still alive.\n  But it gets worse. More than 23,000 people registered to vote in the \ncity of St. Louis are also registered somewhere else in the State. That \nmeans 1 out of 10 St. Louis City voters are double registered. We saw \nsome who were triple registered. Some were even quadruple registered.\n  In a review of the voter registrations, we found five Missouri voters \nregistered at four different places in the State--certainly among our \nmost active civic volunteers, with four different voting locations. Of \ncourse, there is my favorite case of Ritzy Mekler, a loyal St. Louis \nregistered voter, and loyal mixed-breed canine. Yes, a dog is \nregistered to vote in St. Louis. I have respect for the dearly departed \nsuch as Red Villa, and I like dogs, but I really don't think either one \nof them ought to be able to vote.\n  About the only thing we have not seen in St. Louis is the actual \nelection of a dog or a dead person to political office.\n\n  Voting canines is not only a St. Louis problem. There was also the \ncase of Cocoa Fernandez in West Palm Beach, FL. Cocoa's owner \nregistered the dog to shed light on the ``failings in our voter \nregistration system.''\n  Some of these cases are humorous. Others are deadly serious. For \nexample, a Saudi man detained by Federal authorities in Denver, CO, for \nquestioning about the September 11 terrorist attacks was found to have \nregistered to vote at the local department of motor vehicles even \nthough he was not a citizen. Worse yet, the records show that he \nactually voted in last year's Presidential election.\n  In Greensboro, NC, a Pakistani citizen with links to two of the \nSeptember 11 hijackers was indicted by a Federal grand jury for having \nillegally registered to vote.\n  It is really quite sad that in the 21st century, in the world's \ngreatest democracy, we still tolerate woefully tangled and fouled up \nvoter registration systems that all but invite vote fraud.\n  I have recounted in the last few minutes some of the stories that \nformed my education in vote fraud. So while many wanted to talk about \nFlorida after the last election, I wanted to make sure we learned \nadditional lessons from vote fraud in St. Louis and elsewhere. This is \nnot merely a local story. The root cause of what is so terribly wrong \nwith St. Louis elections lies in the Federal law.\n  More specifically, it lies within the loopholes in the Federal law. \nFor example, Federal law actually makes it very difficult for cities \nsuch as St. Louis to maintain accurate voter registration lists. It \nblocks States from authenticating mail-in registration cards--the first \nline of defense in preventing vote fraud.\n  In order to prevent this kind of election scandal from occurring \nagain in St. Louis or elsewhere, I knew we had to fight to close the \nelection law loopholes. I had to share with my Senate colleagues what I \nhad learned. So I testified before the Senate Committee on Governmental \nAffairs. That brought me to tell my story of the St. Louis problems to \nChris Dodd, chairman of the Rules Committee. I told him how important \nthe topic of election reform was to me. I told him that election reform \nwithout protections against vote fraud could not earn my support. He \nlistened, and we talked a great deal and agreed on a formula that we \nbelieved could attract bipartisan support. We agreed to write a bill, \nalong with Senator McConnell particularly, and others, to make it \neasier to vote and much harder to cheat.\n  I think we have done that. I thank Senator Dodd and Senator McConnell \nfor listening to the concerns of Missourians who were outraged by what \nwe saw in the November 2000 elections in St. Louis. We worked closely \ntogether for several months to close loopholes while taking every \nprecaution to protect the rights of legal voters. That is what I think \nwe have done.\n  One of the most important things we did was to agree to make it \neasier to vote and tougher to cheat. We ought to have statewide \nregistration systems to eliminate the patchwork overlapping of county \nand city voter registration lists that have resulted in the kinds of \nmultiple registrations and the kind of confusion that certainly \nbedevils some legitimate voters in St. Louis and elsewhere. No longer \nare we going to see people registered in four, five different places in \nany State. We need to find out where they are living and legally \nregistered, and get the others off the rolls so those who are entitled \nto vote can vote and those who are not entitled to cannot.\n\n  Registration cards will now require prospective voters to declare \nunder penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens--a very simple but \nvery important affirmation. And individuals who register by mail will \nbe required to provide identification when they vote the first time.\n  Mr. President, will this stop all vote fraud in St. Louis and all \nAmerican cities? Of course not. But these changes in Federal law will \nput power back into State and local law enforcement officials so that \nthey can clean up their rolls.\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\n  These are commonsense measures that will strengthen safeguards that \nprotect the ballot box. To any of my colleagues who question the need \nto strengthen safeguards, just look at what happened in St. Louis. Why \nis it acceptable to require a photo ID to board an airplane, buy \ncigarettes, or alcohol, but to not require some kind of identification \nto carry out the most important of all of our civic responsibilities?\n  We have a responsibility to ensure that all legally cast votes are \ncounted and an equal responsibility to ensure that legally cast votes \nare not diluted, downgraded, or nullified by illegal votes. We must \nstrengthen confidence in our voting system. People must know that their \nvotes are actually going to be counted and not discounted.\n  In the wake of the St. Louis vote fraud scandal, the Missouri Court \nof Appeals for the Eastern District issued its ruling on the lawsuit to \nkeep the polls open late in St. Louis. As I mentioned earlier, the \ncourt's opinion accurately characterized the task now before the \nSenate, each of us. I quote:\n\n       (C)ommendable zeal to protect voting rights must be \n     tempered by the corresponding duty to protect the integrity \n     of the voting process . . . (E)qual vigilance is required to \n     ensure that only those entitled to vote are allowed to cast a \n     ballot. Otherwise, the rights of those lawfully entitled to \n     vote are inevitably diluted.\n\n  That is what we are about today. We are here to see that everybody \nhas an opportunity to vote. We need to clean up the underbrush.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut has taken a very strong \nposition to ensure that those with special needs are accommodated, and \nthis is landmark legislation to ensure that those who need special \nassistance or equipment can vote and can participate fully in our \nsystem.\n  Clearly, the steps that we are taking to regularize the registration \nsystem are going to go a long way to empower local election officials \nand State election officials to ensure that everybody who is entitled \nto vote has a chance to vote but to vote only once.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the other important \nmeasures that will be brought before this body. I thank my colleagues \nwho have worked so long and hard on crafting the bill that is before \nus, and I trust that we will wind up presenting, not only from this \nbody but from conference with the House, a measure that will go to the \nPresident that will be signed into law to ensure that it is easier to \nvote and tougher to cheat.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to share with my \ncolleagues some endorsements of the underlying substitute bill, the \nDodd-McConnell bill, along with others who are cosponsors of the \nsubstitute. There are numerous cosponsors of this bill, and I will \nsubmit momentarily the list of all those among our colleagues who are \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  Secondly, I will submit a list of various organizations such as the \nNAACP, the AFL-CIO, Public Citizen, and a lot of other groups that are \nendorsing the bill as well, and I will submit for the Record letters \nthat these organizations have offered on behalf of this legislation. \nThe National Civil Rights Coalition is listing this as their No. 1 \nlegislative priority this session of Congress.\n  I will not read them all, but the following organizations have \nendorsed the Dodd-McConnell bipartisan compromise on election reform \nand urge the Senate to act on it: AFL-CIO, the NAACP, the Carter-Ford \nCommission, Public Citizen, American Association of People with \nDisabilities, National Federation of the Blind, the United States \nCerebral Palsy Associations, People for the American Way, the League of \nWomen Voters, the National Coalition of Black Civic Participation, the \nMexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Laborers' \nInternational Union of North America, U.S. Public Interest Research \nGroup, Common Cause, and a variety of Secretaries of State, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, not all of them but some have specifically \nsent letters endorsing the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that some letters expressing \nwhy they think this bill is worthy of their support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Washington Bureau, National Association for the \n           Advancement of Colored People,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chair, Senate Rules and Administration Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd; The National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the nation's oldest, \n     largest and most widely recognized grassroots civil rights \n     organization, strongly supports the Dodd/McConnell/Schumer/\n     Bond substitute to S. 565, the Equal Protection of Voting \n     Rights Act.\n       The NAACP is well known for being a long and steadfast \n     champion of the American promise of the right to vote. As \n     such, I urge you, on behalf of the more than 500,000 NAACP \n     members across the nation, to move as quickly as possible to \n     pass this important legislation. The sooner comprehensive \n     election reform legislation is enacted, the more assured we \n     can be that every eligible American who wants to vote can, \n     and that his or her vote will be counted.\n       The NAACP's support of the Dodd/McConnell substitute is \n     based on the fact that it is a balanced, comprehensive \n     response to the problems that have plagued our national \n     electoral system for too long. As we saw in the most recent \n     Presidential election, states and municipalities throughout \n     our nation need to reform their election procedures. The \n     Dodd/McConnell substitute would require that by the year 2006 \n     all voting machines across the nation allow the voter to \n     verify their choices and correct errors before the ballot is \n     cast. The legislation would further require that, by the \n     beginning of the year 2004, all states and local \n     jurisdictions have provisional balloting, which would allow \n     an individual whose eligibility is in question to vote and \n     have the vote set aside pending verification. The legislation \n     would also require states, by January, 2004, to keep \n     computerized voting rolls to help ensure that a state-wide \n     list of eligible voters is readily available on election day \n     and to help cut down on fraud or abuse.\n       Furthermore, the Dodd/McConnell substitute contains \n     provisions which would dramatically increase access to the \n     voting booths for language minority and disabled Americans. \n     While we do have a few lingering concerns regarding specific \n     provisions currently in the Dodd/McConnell substitute, most \n     specifically the provision requiring that first time voters \n     who registered by mail provide a photo identification, we are \n     committed to working with the you and the bill's other \n     sponsors, as well as the rest of the Senate, to improve them \n     and build upon the bill's obvious merits as we move forward.\n       While the NAACP applauds and appreciates the fact that the \n     House has already acted on election reform legislation, the \n     final version of the bill (H.R. 3295, the Help America Vote \n     Act), falls short of fixing our electoral problems and, in \n     some instances, represents a step backwards for civil rights \n     laws. Furthermore, H.R. 3295 does not contain any provisions \n     to address election fraud. Due to the fundamental flaws in \n     H.R. 3295, the NAACP was forced to join dozens of other \n     national civil, voting, consumer and disability rights \n     organizations, as well as major national labor and religious \n     organizations in opposing the legislation.\n       I urge you again, on behalf of the NAACP and every American \n     who is concerned about the protection of our basic democratic \n     right to vote, to pass the strongest election reform \n     legislation possible. The Dodd/McConnell substitute is an \n     aggressive, comprehensive solution to many of the problems \n     that continue to plague our nation, and I hope that you will \n     do all you can to see that it is enacted quickly.\n       Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. \n     Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is \n     anything more I can do for you on this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hilary O. Shelton,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         Americal Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                  Washington DC, January 18, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: The AFL-CIO strongly urges you to cosponsor \n     the Dodd-McConnell substitute to S. 565, the Equal Protection \n     of Voting Rights Act, which was also sponsored by Senator \n     Schumer, Bond, Torricelli, McCain, and Durbin.\n       The bipartisan substitute to S. 565 would help strengthen \n     our democracy by requiring all states to meet three new \n     minimum federal standards over the next few years. More \n     specifically, this legislation would require states to create \n     statewide voter registration lists and allow registered \n     voters whose names do not appear on these lists to cast \n     provisional ballots by 2004. It would also require States to \n     use voting technology by 2006\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\n     that informs voters if they have voted for too many \n     candidates, and allows all voters, including the disabled and \n     language minorities, to verify their votes before casting \n     them. In addition, this legislation would authorize federal \n     funds to help states meet these new minimum standards and \n     create a new commission to study various election reform \n     issues, oversee federal elections, and disburse the new \n     federal election reform funds.\n       Since the House recently passed an election reform bill \n     (H.R. 3295) that does not include the minimum standards \n     necessary to fundamentally improve our nation's election \n     system, the 107th Congress will only be able to pass \n     comprehensive election reform before the 2002 elections if \n     the Senate acts quickly on the substitute to S. 565. While we \n     have concerns with some of the language currently in this \n     legislation, we are committed to working with the bill's \n     sponsors to improve this proposal as if moves forward.\n       Last Election Day, countless citizens in Florida and \n     throughout the country were denied their Constitutional right \n     to vote by flawed voting equipment, erroneous voter \n     registration records, and confusing ballots. While many \n     lawfully registered voters were disenfranchised outright, \n     others cast votes that ultimately were not counted. Now that \n     the 2000 elections are over, we have a responsibility to use \n     what we learned from this bitter experience to enact \n     comprehensive election reform before the 2002 elections.\n       For all of these reasons, we strongly urge you to cosponsor \n     the bipartisan Dodd-McConnell substitute to S. 565.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n     Director, Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                     People With Disabilities,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2002.\n     Members of the U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The American Association of People with \n     Disabilities (AAPD), the largest national membership \n     organization dedicated to promoting the economic and \n     political empowerment of all people with disabilities, \n     strongly supports the Dodd/McConnell/Schumer/Bond substitute \n     to S.565, the Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act. On \n     behalf of the nearly 30,000 nation-wide members of AAPD, I \n     urge you to support this important legislation and see that \n     it is brought before the full Senate and passed without any \n     weakening amendments. Our support for moving this legislation \n     to the Senate floor is conditional upon being certain that \n     the photo i.d. requirement will have added to it an \n     attestation allowing voters with disabilities and others who \n     lack a photo i.d. or utility bill to confirm the validity of \n     their registration. We feel that this important addition \n     makes it easy to vote and hard to steal an election.\n       AAPD has worked to ensure that all members of the \n     disability community cast their votes and have their votes \n     counted. The 2000 presidential election exposed many problems \n     in the nation's electoral system. Millions of votes were \n     either unable to cast their votes or have their votes \n     counted. the sooner comprehensive election reform is passed, \n     the sooner more voters with disabilities will be able to cast \n     their vote with the confidence that their vote was cast to \n     their wishes and that their vote will indeed be counted.\n       To protect the millions of voters with disabilities and \n     others, the substitute provides for minimum national \n     standards in three essential, but limited areas. Including \n     provisional ballots, statewide voter registration lists, and \n     standards that require voting machines to inform the voter of \n     an error and give the voter the opportunity to correct it. \n     Such standards would also protect against high voting machine \n     error rates.\n       We are particularly pleased that the substitute's standards \n     offer millions of voters with disabilities the opportunity to \n     cast a secret and independent ballot for the first time and \n     that the legislation provides the states and counties with \n     the necessary funding to make this happen. We are also \n     pleased that the definition of disability, in the substitute \n     bill, includes people with physical, sensory, and mental \n     disabilities.\n       While AAPD is pleased that election reform has already been \n     addressed in the House, the final version of H.R. 3295, the \n     Help America Vote Act, falls short in fixing electoral \n     problems for voters with disabilities. Due to the fundamental \n     flaws in H.R. 3295, AAPD was forced to join with other \n     national disability, civil rights, and voting groups to \n     oppose this legislation.\n       I urge you on behalf of the 56 million Americans with \n     disabilities to pass the strongest election reform bill \n     possible. The Dodd/McConnell substitute is that bill and I \n     hope you will do all that you can to see that it is enacted \n     quickly.\n       Thank you, in advance, for your attention to this matter. \n     Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there is \n     anything more I can do for you on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Andrew J. Imparato,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                                 of the Blind,\n\n                                 Baltimore, MD, February 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the strong \n     support of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) for the \n     Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act of 2001 (S. 565), \n     including language we requested to address the needs of \n     people who are blind. Thanks to your efforts and \n     understanding, this legislation points the way for blind \n     people to vote privately and independently at each polling \n     place throughout the United States.\n       While the 2000 election demonstrated significant problems \n     with our electoral system, consensus regarding the solution \n     has been much more difficult to find. Nonetheless, it is \n     clear that installation of up-to-date technology will occur \n     throughout the United States. This means that voting \n     technology will change, and devices purchased now will set \n     the pattern for decades to come. Therefore, requirements for \n     nonvisual access must be an essential component of the new \n     design. S. 565 will make this happen.\n       With more than 50,000 members representing every state, the \n     District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, the NFB is the largest \n     organization of blind people in the United States. As such we \n     know about blindness from our own experience. The right to \n     vote and cast a truly secret ballot is one of our highest \n     priorities, and modern technology can now support this goal. \n     For that reason, we strongly support S. 565 now pending in \n     the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James Gashel,\n     Director of Governmental Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  People for the American Way,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the more than 500,000 \n     members and supporters of People For the American Way (PFAW), \n     we write to express our strong support for the Dodd/\n     McConnell/Schumer/Bond substitute to S. 565, the Equal \n     Protection of Voting Rights Act.\n       PFAW is especially pleased with the strong provisions of \n     this bill which would require each state to meet a set of \n     minimum standards when it comes to voting equipment, the \n     training of poll workers, language minority assistance, \n     provisional ballots, and accessibility for the disabled. We \n     are also pleased that S. 565 contains strong language \n     providing for provisional voting, for the posting of critical \n     election information at polling places on Election Day and \n     for enforcement by the Department of Justice.\n       We are committed to working with you, and other members of \n     the Senate, to strengthen the bill. Specifically, we want to \n     ensure that first time voters who have registered by mail \n     have the maximum numbers of options available to properly \n     identify themselves to election officials. We would \n     especially support efforts to allow these first time voters \n     to attest to their identity should they not have any other \n     form of identification.\n       We applaud you for your tireless work in moving election \n     reform to the top of the Congressional agenda, and your \n     leadership and vision of this bipartisan legislation that \n     would facilitate a full democratic participation in \n     elections. We especially want to thank you for your \n     commitment to work with PFAW and our allies in the civil \n     rights, voting rights, labor, and disability communities to \n     make necessary improvements to achieve the full potential of \n     this legislation. We look forward to working with you \n     throughout the legislative process to ensure that \n     comprehensive election reform legislation is enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ralph G. Neas,\n                                                        President.\n     Stephanie Foster,\n     Director of Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   United Cerebral\n\n\n                                            Palsy Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 2002.\n     Senator Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of UCP, our more than 100 \n     affiliates in over 40 States and millions of voters with \n     disabilities, I want to congratulate you on your historic \n     leadership in crafting the Senate bipartisan agreement on \n     election reform.\n       We are deeply appreciative of your efforts to ensure that--\n     by enacting this legislation--Americans with disabilities \n     will have equal access to the polling place and the voting \n     booth for the first time in history. We are proud and \n     pleased, therefore, to lend our full support of the \n     bipartisan substitute amendment to S. 565, which, it is our \n     understanding, you will bring to the floor as soon as \n     possible so that it can be debated and approved by the full \n     Senate. We believe swift passage of this legislation is \n     essential to strengthening the basic tools of our democracy \n     at a time when the attacks of September 11th remind us all of \n     how vigilant we must be in safeguarding our most basic \n     freedoms.\n       The Senate bipartisan measure sets vitally needed national \n     minimum voting rights standards. They will let every voter \n     know that regardless of where they live neither their \n     ethnicity nor disability will prevent them from entering \n     their polling place and casting their ballot in privacy \n     knowing it will be counted fairly and accurately. The \n     provisions requiring that new voting systems be accessible \n     and the $100 million grant program to make polling places \n     accessible will go far to realize the full promise of the ADA\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\n     to make Americans with disabilities first class citizens of \n     our democracy. This is a critical civic lesson for America \n     and the rest of the world as well.\n       We believe, however, some changes are needed in the \n     substitute amendment to ensure that election reform goes \n     forward in as fair and effective a manner as possible. The \n     first of these relates to the role, which the Access Board \n     will play in providing policy direction to the newly created \n     federal election accessibility grant program. As drafted, the \n     substitute amendment provides that the Attorney General will \n     carry out the grant program consistent with policies and \n     criteria for the approval of funding applications set forth \n     by the Access Board. Responsibility for administering this \n     grant program--as with the other election reform grants \n     established by this bill--will transfer from the U.S. Justice \n     Department to the new Election Administration Commission once \n     it is fully functional. For clarity and continuity sake, we \n     believe that language needs to be added to the bill to make \n     clear that the policies and criteria set by the Access Board \n     for the election grant program shall guide its implementation \n     both at DOJ and the Election Administration Commission.\n       We also believe that changes need to be made to the \n     provision in the substitute that would require first time \n     voters who register by mail to produce a photo identification \n     card when they show up at the polls or to send a copy of one \n     or other verification of their identity by mail if they vote \n     by secret ballot. While we recognize that this provision is \n     meant to prevent voter fraud, we believe it would prove \n     largely unworkable and therefore, ineffective in doing so. \n     Moreover, we are extremely fearful that this provision would \n     have a significant chilling effect on potential voters, \n     including those with disabilities as well as language and \n     ethnic minorities. Those with disabilities and others often \n     lack formal identification cards through no fault of their \n     own. They must not be denied their fundamental right to vote. \n     Over half the States ensure the accuracy of the balloting \n     process by having each voter sign a statement attesting--\n     under penalty of law--to both their identity and eligibility \n     to vote. This is a far more straightforward and fairer way to \n     ensure the sanctity of elections. We urge you to support the \n     inclusion of the same procedure in the substitute amendment.\n       As with any living document we believe that there may be \n     changes that could be made to it that either significantly \n     strengthen or undermine its basic intent. We want to urge you \n     as its chief author and all others in the Senate to consider \n     each amendment that may be offered very much in this light \n     and we will keep you informed of our views on all such \n     proposed changes as the Senate debate proceeds.\n       Thank you once again for your extraordinary leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kirsten A. Nyrop,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The National Commission\n\n\n                                   on Federal Election Reform,\n\n                                                February 12, 2002.\n     Senator Chris Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chris and Mitch: In 2000 the American electoral system \n     was tested by a political ordeal unlike any in living memory. \n     The American political system proved its resilience. But we \n     must think about the future. We all saw that the ordinary \n     institutions of election administration in the United States \n     just could not readily cope with an extremely close election \n     and had many other weaknesses.\n       That is why we agreed to lead the foundation-funded \n     National Commission on Federal Election Reform. We issued our \n     report last year and the results have been gratifying. \n     President Bush welcomed the report and endorsed our approach. \n     He has allocated money for election reform in his FY 2003 \n     budget proposal. State and local officials around the \n     country, including many conscientious election \n     administrators, have been galvanized to action. Two months \n     ago the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a \n     bipartisan bill on election reform sponsored by Bob Ney and \n     Steny Hoyer.\n       The fate of federal election reform now rests with you and \n     your colleagues in the Senate.\n       We were glad to learn that both of you have worked with \n     some of your colleagues to fashion a truly bipartisan bill \n     for the Senate. Your staffs have asked us to comment on the \n     relation of this effort to the Commission's goals.\n       Naturally your bill was a compromise. Naturally interest \n     groups on both sides of the political spectrum find some \n     things in it they dislike. If we had been writing the bill, \n     we might have made some different choices too, but on the \n     whole it is a good bill and a real improvement over the \n     status quo.\n       Your bill is clearly a reasonable bipartisan vehicle for \n     moving the legislative process forward. Its core is sound. It \n     addresses the right issues, such as statewide voter rolls and \n     provisional balloting. If it passes the Senate it will go to \n     conference with the Ney-Hoyer bill. There are some aspects of \n     Ney-Hoyer we like better. But there are also some aspects of \n     Dodd-McConnell that have improved on the House approach. So, \n     starting from good foundations on both sides, a conference \n     committee should be well positioned to bring a strong bill \n     back to each House for final approval.\n       The critical issue now is to get this bipartisan bill to \n     the floor of the Senate as soon as possible. All over the \n     country, state legislatures and county administrators are \n     aware that federal action may be imminent. The states should \n     continue to have the primary responsibility for administering \n     elections, but do so in a national framework. Many of these \n     legislators and officials are now understandably frozen about \n     what they should be doing.\n       If the 107th Congress passes a bill founded on the current \n     House and Senate bipartisan approaches, you will have \n     achieved a landmark accomplishment. Such a law will touch \n     every county in America--and for the good. With the exception \n     of the civil rights laws of the 1960s, such a law could \n     provide the most important improvements in the democratic \n     election system in our lifetimes.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gerald R. Ford,\n                                                Honorary Co-Chair.\n     Robert H. Michel,\n                                                         Co-Chair.\n     Slade Gorton,\n                                                       Vice-Chair.\n     Jimmy Carter,\n                                                Honorary Co-Chair.\n     Lloyd N.

It is vastly superior \n     to H.R. 3295, the House-passed bill because it establishes \n     strong national voting standards, promotes coherent state and \n     local planning for voting improvements, and includes \n     necessary federal monitoring and enforcement.\n       As we work with you and the other sponsors of the bill, we \n     are gratified by your commitment to us and other members of \n     the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights coalition to work \n     together on the Senate floor to pass a few needed \n     improvements in the legislation. Such changes will remove \n     unnecessary ambiguity, ensure that the bill's goals are fully \n     achieved, and strengthen the political position of the bill \n     as it heads for Conference.\n       Thank you Senator once again for your dedication to this \n     fundamental legislation for our democracy.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joan Claybrook,\n                                                        President.\n     Frank Clemente,\n     Director, Congress Watch.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Statement of Rebekah Harriman--Executive Director--Common Cause/\n                              Connecticut\n\n       Common Cause in Connecticut is a non-partisan citizen's \n     lobby dedicated to ensuring that government clean, open, and \n     accountable. Central to this mission is our belief that our \n     democracy is participatory and inclusive to all Americans. It \n     is entirely fitting that we come together on this day, the \n     day the country observes the remembrance of the great \n     Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., to show our strong support \n     for The Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act, sponsored by \n     Senator Dodd.\n       Over forty years ago, thousands of Americans dedicated and \n     gave their lives to a movement that fought to end \n     discrimination and ensure that every American was afforded \n     the opportunity to vote without prejudice. Just over one year \n     ago, hundreds of thousands of Americans were unjustly turned \n     away from the polls or were otherwise locked out of our \n     democracy when their votes were not counted due to faulty \n     voting procedures. We must make every effort to ensure that \n     this injustice does not occur again in America. The Equal \n     Protection Voting Rights Act is strong legislation that will \n     help ensure that every American's vote counts.\n       Common Cause/CT supports The Equal Protection Voting Rights \n     Act because it would require that each state meet a set of \n     minimum standards when it comes to voting equipment, the \n     training of poll workers, absentee and bilingual ballots, \n     provisional ballots, overseas voters, and accessibility for \n     the disabled.\n       This legislation would be essential in Connecticut, where \n     our voting equipment must be evaluated. In the year 2000, \n     thousands of votes were invalidated in the presidential \n     election because many of our states' voting systems are \n     outdated, inconsistent, and inaccurate. Common Cause/CT \n     believes it is essential to replace our nearly extinct voting \n     machines and that we strive to have a uniform mechanism for \n     voting in every precinct in Connecticut.\n       Another important facet of the legislation is the mandate \n     that states compile a statewide voter list. Without a \n     statewide centralized voter registration system that allows\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\n     for the accurate and timely exchange and updating of \n     information, too many eligible voters are turned away from \n     the polls each election because their name was either failed \n     to be placed on their precinct list by election day or was \n     purged from the rolls in a careless attempt to clean up an \n     inefficiently maintained list. The technology and the \n     administrative know-how already exist in the state and \n     mandating that all jurisdictions participate in the system \n     would greatly reduce the number of Connecticut voters \n     disenfranchised in this way.\n       The Equal Protection Voting Rights Act also sets an \n     important standard by requiring states to implement \n     provisional balloting. This would ensure that no registered \n     voter in Connecticut is ever turned away from the voting \n     booth.\n       We believe that every possible step must be taken to ensure \n     that the election process is fair, accurate, and accessible \n     to every voter in the country. We believe that every option \n     must be looked at to afford the most citizens possible the \n     ability to vote with ease and precision. The Equal Protection \n     Voting Rights Act is the type of election reform that is \n     essential to this process and we commend Senator Dodd for his \n     leadership in this crucial fight for justice and equality.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        The League of Women Voters\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2002.\n     Re Election Reform\n\n       Members of the U.S. Senate: The League of Women Voters \n     urges you to support the bipartisan election reform bill \n     developed by Senators Dodd, McConnell, Bond and Schumer. The \n     legislation will be offered as a substitute to S. 565. While \n     the substitute is not perfect, it contains the key elements \n     needed to improve our nation's election systems.\n       The 2000 election demonstrated that basic reforms are \n     needed at the federal, state and local levels to protect \n     voters and to improve election administration. It is also \n     clear that it is time for the federal government to pay its \n     fair share of the costs of administering federal elections.\n       The Dodd-McConnell substitute provides for basic national \n     standards in vital, but limited, areas. It provides \n     substantial federal funds for election reform efforts. And it \n     provides a blueprint on which federal, state and local \n     efforts can be built.\n       To protect voters and improve administration, the \n     substitute provides for minimum national standards in three \n     areas. First, voting systems standards will assure that \n     voters can verify and correct their ballots, as well as be \n     notified of overvotes. These standards also protect against \n     high voting machine error rates and enhance access for \n     persons with disabilities. Second, a national standard will \n     assure that voters can receive provisional ballots. This \n     fail-safe system means that if a voter's name is not found on \n     the registration list at the polls, or if other problems \n     occur, the voter can still cast a ballot that will be counted \n     if the voter's eligibility is confirmed. Third, statewide \n     computerized voter registration lists will be required. This \n     facilitates removal of duplicate registrations across \n     jurisdictions, provides greater assurance that names will be \n     on the rolls, and streamlines administration while combating \n     possible fraud.\n       The substitute provides funding through state grants \n     programs that will be developed with public involvement. \n     Funds are provided not only for meeting standards, but also \n     for other vital areas of election administration, including \n     poll worker training and providing access to the polls for \n     persons with disabilities. The substitute sets up a new \n     federal commission that can provide effective guidance, while \n     Justice Department enforcement of voter protection laws, such \n     as the Voting Rights Act, is maintained.\n       While the substitute is a strong bill, it contains a photo \n     ID requirement that will result in discrimination and create \n     real administrative problems at polling places. Though the \n     requirement is described as an anti-fraud device, effective \n     alternatives exist to meet anti-fraud objectives that will \n     not undermine voter participation through absentee balloting \n     by persons with disabilities, seniors and others. We strongly \n     urge you to correct this provision. We are also concerned \n     that the so-called ``safe harbor'' provisions of the bill \n     will have unintended, deleterious consequences.\n       The League of Women Voters believes that the Senate must \n     act expeditiously on this important topic. We urge you to \n     move ahead with the Dodd-McConnell substitute, which is \n     clearly preferable to the House-passed bill in setting a \n     workable structure for reform and creating an effective \n     election commission.\n       America deserves an election system that will protect the \n     most basic and precious right of all citizens in a \n     democracy--the right to vote. Each citizen's right to vote, \n     and to have that vote fairly counted, is at stake.\n                                        Carolyn Jefferson-Jenkins,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Secretary of the State,\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                    Hartford, CT, January 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: Thank you for your leadership in the \n     area of election reform and for all of your hard work in \n     developing your bi-partisan compromise on election reform. I \n     have reviewed the language in S. 565 and I am extremely \n     pleased with its contents, particularly with the statewide \n     voter registration system and voting machine requirements. \n     The federal funding provided for those and other purposes \n     will greatly benefit Connecticut and all the states.\n       At the close of the 2001 legislative session, the \n     Connecticut Legislature established a Voting Technology \n     Alternatives Commission to study and make recommendations \n     regarding voting technology issues. The federal guidelines \n     and assistance provided for in S. 565 will help shape both \n     the Commission's final recommendations and any state \n     legislative action in this area. As a member of this \n     Commission, I have already provided all the members of the \n     Commission a copy of S. 565 for their review.\n       In addition, I will be attending the National Association \n     of Secretaries of the State winter meeting in Washington D.C. \n     from February 7-10 and hope to have the opportunity to meet \n     with you. My Office will contact your staff with more \n     details. I look forward to working with you on the important \n     issue of election reform and I wish you well in securing its \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Susan Bysiewicz.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Secretary of State,\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                    Atlanta, GA, January 18, 2001.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd: I am pleased to write to express my \n     support for S. 565 and for your efforts, and that of Senators \n     McConnell, Schumer, Bond and Torricelli, to craft strong, \n     effective and bipartisan election reform legislation.\n       As you are aware, Georgia has moved to the forefront among \n     states in the drive to acquire and deploy election systems \n     that are more accurate, more convenient and more accessible \n     and disabled voters. With the passage of our own SB 213 last \n     year, Georgia became the first state in the nation to mandate \n     a modern, uniform voting system for every county and every \n     community. This year, Governor Roy Barnes has endorsed our \n     ambitious plan to acquire and deploy new generation \n     electronic voting equipment (DRE) in every Georgia county in \n     time for the November 2002 general election.\n       While Georgia election officials and policymakers are \n     strongly united behind our initiative to improve voting \n     equipment, critical to our efforts is the expectation that \n     the federal government will be a helpful partner in advancing \n     this goal, and will make available substantial funding to \n     help pay for these improvements. In that regard, we were \n     heartened by House passage of the Ney-Hoyer election reform \n     package, and were then extremely pleased to learn that you, \n     ranking member McConnell and others had reached bipartisan \n     agreement on S. 565.\n       I believe your legislation provides an excellent platform \n     and roadmap for election reform which, as you know, must \n     primarily be executed at the state and local level. The \n     funding provisions of S. 565 are outstanding, and would \n     enable states to make much needed investments in new voting \n     and registration systems. I also strongly support your \n     emphasis on assuring that blind and disabled voters have a \n     full opportunity to cast their ballots independently and \n     without assistance. The bill's emphasis on assuring that each \n     state has procedures under which a provisional ballot can be \n     cast is also welcome.\n       While there are areas of the bill where I would prefer some \n     modifications, (as would be the case with nearly any \n     legislation of such magnitude and scope) it is my belief that \n     S. 565 represents a giant step forward towards reaching our \n     goal of designing and deploying election systems that assure \n     that the electoral choice of each and every voter will be \n     accurately counted.\n       Thank you for your steadfast leadership in moving election \n     reform legislation forward in the United States Senate and I \n     look forward to continuing to work with you to achieve our \n     common goals.\n       With best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n     Cathy Cox.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                           Secretary of State,\n\n                                Carson City; NV, January 25, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd: On behalf of the citizens of Nevada, I \n     would like to express my support for Senate Bill 565, which I \n     feel is an important step in the election reform process. I \n     am especially impressed with the bipartisan support the bill \n     has received, and believe wholehartedly in many of the \n     provisions called for in S. 565, particularly its focus on \n     civil rights and accessibility issues. Moreover, S. 565 \n     includes an impressive financial commitment from the federal \n     government that will help meet the mandates outlined in the \n     bill, thereby allowing Nevada counties to update antiquated \n     equipment with the latest technology without bearing the \n     enormous cost of undertaking such a project on their own.\n       I would like to personally thank you for asking for my \n     opinion and thoughts on the legislation. I believe very \n     strongly that as secretaries of state, it is important for us \n     to work as closely as possible with members of Congress as \n     they seek to enact real and meaningful federal voter \n     protections and reform. I hope that as deliberations progress \n     in\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\n     the House and Senate, secretaries of state will continue to \n     be asked by Congress to add their important voices and \n     experience to the discussions.\n       The bipartisan leadership demonstrated by you and Senators \n     McConnoll, Schumor, Bond and Torricelli and other members of \n     the U.S. Senate in crafting a package that would be a \n     positive step in the election reform process is very \n     encouraging. The principles outlined in the ``Equal \n     Protection of Voting Rights Act'' are certainly a step in the \n     right direction, and I recognize S. 565 as important \n     legislation that will better ensure the integrity of the \n     election process.\n       I have long been an advocate of election reform. In each of \n     the past three sessions of the Nevada State Legislature, I \n     have promoted legislation that would create a statewide \n     system of voter registration. This statewide system would \n     allow the Secretary of State's office to act as a central \n     repository for voter registration rolls, and ease the process \n     of clearing those rolls of duplicate names, deceased persons \n     and others who are ineligible to vote. Although this proposal \n     would have dramatically reduced the potential for voter \n     fraud, it has failed in every legislative session in which it \n     was introduced. Likewise, my calls to improve the absentee \n     balloting process, especially for our overseas military \n     personnel, have faced strong resistance from state \n     legislators. Senate Bill 565 parallels many of my efforts and \n     may motivate Nevada lawmakers to pursue election reform for \n     the Silver State.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership and efforts in \n     bringing this important legislation to the forefront of \n     deliberations in the U.S. Senate. I look forward to \n     continuing to work closely with you and your colleagues to \n     achieve our common goal of election reform measures that will \n     truly enhance the voting process for all Americans\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      Dean Heller,\n                                               Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I know there are discussions going on regarding a couple of \nproposals to try and work out some things, but I invite my colleagues, \nwho may be engaged in other activities in their respective offices, if \nnothing particularly important is happening, and if they have a \nproposal they would like to have heard on on this bill, to come on \nover. We are open for business on amendments. We will consider them on \neither side. I do not know of many we have, but there may be some. I \nhave talked to some colleagues who have some questions about the bill. \nIf they do have questions, I invite them to come to the Chamber, and I \nwill try to address them in colloquies to either alleviate their \nconcerns--or heighten them, I suppose, depending upon my answer to \ntheir question.\n  We would like to get this bill done. I know there are other matters. \nThe leader, I know, wants to bring up the energy bill. I think that is \nthe next item on the agenda. Given the amount of work we have put into \nelection reform--and, again, I thank immensely my colleagues from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell; Missouri, Senator Bond; New York, Senator \nSchumer; New Jersey, Senator Torricelli; Trent Lott, and Tom Daschle, \nthe majority leader. A lot of work and a tremendous amount of effort \nhas gone into this effort over many hours. Obviously, we are not there \nyet. We still have to go to a conference with the House. Our fervent \nhope is to get this done as soon as we can.\n  With the $3.5 billion that we provide in this bill and the $1.2 \nbillion the President has already put in his budget, there is every \nreason to believe we could actually get resources back to our States \nand our localities to improve the election systems for the elections \nthis fall.\n  There are a lot of other provisions in this bill that do not become \neffective for several years down the road, but for our Secretaries of \nState and our registrars of voters across the country who are anxious \nto get some financial help on these matters, if we get this bill done, \nget the conference report done, and then get a Presidential signature, \nwhich I think we can get if we work out this legislation, then there is \nevery good reason to believe those resources could begin flowing to our \nStates even this year.\n  I do not need to remind anyone in this Chamber, or anyone in the \nother body, that the events of September 11 and ensuing events have \noverwhelmed, obviously, our attention, but it was only 14 months ago \nthat this Nation was fixated on one of the worst election debacles in \nthe history of the country. It is not in any way to question the \noutcome. We all support the outcome uncategorically. Certainly, \nwatching day after day, week after week--and for the Presiding Officer, \nthis was not just an intellectual exercise.\n  As the distinguished junior Senator from the State of Florida, he \nknows painfully how long and how difficult this process was for his own \nconstituents, as not only the Nation but the world was fixated on his \nState. I have said in this Chamber on numerous occasions, it was an \nunfair fixation. There were plenty of other places around the country \nwhere the problems were identical to the problems that the people of \nFlorida went through, but because of the nature of the electoral \ncollege, the attention was focused on Florida.\n  I think the American public--in fact, every survey I have seen--\nbelieves our election system is in desperate need of repair. We lecture \na good part of the world about how to conduct elections, how important \nit is to vote, how important democratic institutions are. We realized \nwhat happened last year. According to nonpartisan analyses from \nCaltech, MIT, the General Accounting Office, the Carter-Ford \nCommission, along with many other groups around the country who \nanalyzed the elections nationwide, our system is broken. It is in \nserious shape and it needs repair. That is not an adverse reflection on \nthe thousands and thousands of people all across the country who worked \nvery hard, under very difficult circumstances, to see to it that people \nhad the right to vote and their votes counted. We also painfully know \nthat when it comes to allocating resources at the State level, this is \na very difficult budget item; that there are always other items that \nseem to have more public support than the issue of better voting \nmachines or better equipment or training for poll watchers and the \nlike.\n\n  So painfully, despite all of the notoriety about the 2000 election \nlast year, only three States have acted, the State that the Presiding \nOfficer represents so ably, the State of Florida, and the State of \nGeorgia--and a great tribute should go to Cathy Cox, by the way, the \nSecretary of the State of Georgia. And I want to thank our two \ncolleagues from Georgia, Max Cleland and Zell Miller, who hosted the \nRules Committee's field hearing in Atlanta, GA. Also, the Governor \ncould not have been more gracious. To their great credit, they really \nstepped up to the plate. Georgia, Maryland and Florida are leading the \ncountry today in some of the most innovative ideas on election reform.\n  Unfortunately, other States did not. There is one other State that \ndid, but after all the events of last year those are all the States \nthat rose to the occasion.\n  So, again, I invite my colleagues to come on over. We would like to \nfinish this bill. I am not suggesting we go to third reading in the \nnext few minutes, but I invite Members who have amendments to come and \ngive us a chance to consider them, accept what we can of various \nproposals, debate others, vote on them, if necessary, but move the \nprocess along.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make a \nstatement at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Daschle are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.''\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor up to 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader has asked that I \nannounce there will be no more rollcall votes today. Senator Dodd and \nSenator McConnell have, I will not say begged but they sure have asked \npeople to come over and offer amendments. We need to finish this bill. \nWe have so much more that needs to be done. This is an extremely \nimportant bill, one of the most important bills to have come through \nthis body in a long time. These two men have spent not hours or days \nbut weeks and weeks of their time trying to get the bill here. We need \nto get the bill finished tomorrow.\n  Those with amendments need to bring them over. We are going to start \nearly in the morning. If they do not, I will join with the managers of \nthe bill to go to third reading. It is not fair to everyone with so \nmuch to do to have to wait around for amendments.\n  There will be no more rollcall votes tonight.\n  The managers have indicated they will try to clear some amendments \ntonight that will require no more rollcall votes. These are two of the \nmost experienced managers we could have in the Senate, but they need \nsomething to manage. Right now there is a lot of talk about offering \namendments, but nothing is happening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2688\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate \namendment No. 2688, the bipartisan substitute, be agreed to; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the bill as thus \namended be considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendment, and provide further that no points of order are waived by \nthis agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2688) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2874\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished \nSenators from Washington, Ms. Cantwell and Mrs. Murray, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Ms. Cantwell, \n     for herself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2874.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To treat absentee ballots and mail-in ballots in the same \n manner as other paper ballot voting systems under the voting systems \nstandards and to ensure that voters are informed how to correct voting \n              errors before a ballot is cast and counted)\n\n       On page 5, strike lines 4 through 14, and insert the \n     following:\n       (B) A State or locality that uses a paper ballot voting \n     system, a punchcard voting system, or a central count voting \n     system (including mail-in absentee ballots or mail-in \n     ballots), may meet the requirement of subparagraph (A) by--\n       (i) establishing a voter education program specific to that \n     voting system that notifies each voter of the effect of \n     casting multiple votes for an office; and\n       (ii) providing the voter with instructions on how to \n     correct the ballot before it is cast and counted (including \n     instructions on how to correct the error through the issuance \n     of a replacement ballot if the voter was otherwise unable to \n     change the ballot or correct any error).\n\n  Mr. DODD. I will defer to my colleague from Washington to take a few \nminutes, if she would like, and describe what this amendment is and \nwhat it does. I am informed by my friend from Kentucky that this is an \namendment to which we can agree. The staffs have worked on this \namendment. But why doesn't the Senator from Washington take a few \nminutes. I am glad we could work this out with her and others in her \nState.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Dodd's strong \ncommitment to this legislation. Together with Senator Murray I also \nappreciate his efforts here today to work with us on language that \npreserves the ability of States like ours, that have high volumes of \nabsentee and mail-in voters, to continue to use those mail in systems.\n  This amendment adds to the voting system standards section of the \nlegislation to make sure that the ability of voters to vote by mail-in \nand absentee ballot is not limited by our efforts to improve the \nability of other voters to cast accurate ballots in the polling place.\n  This system is very important. The voters of my State are proud of \nthis system and extremely committed to seeing it continue. In addition, \nI believe the voting by mail adequately protects against the types of \nproblems encountered in Florida because in these elections voters take \ntheir time in casting their votes and are able to consult instructions \nand other ballot information.\n  Voters in my State have made it clear that they are willing to work \nwith the system but want to make sure mail-in ballots and absentee \nballots are preserved. This amendment preserves the ability to vote by \nmail while also setting forth new safeguards that will better inform \nvoters how to correctly fill out their ballot and ensure their votes \nare counted.\n  I thank the leaders of this legislation for their support for this \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The amendment of the Senator from Washington is agreed \nto on this side of the aisle. I am aware of no opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2874) is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from New York is about to be \nheard. As the majority whip pointed out, there will be no further \nrollcall votes tonight, but Senator Schumer has an opening statement he \nwould like to make. There is an effort right now to reach agreement on \ntwo or three amendments by the Senator from New York. During his \nremarks on the bill, my hope is we might clear these other three \namendments. I think that would be it for the evening, if we can do \nthat.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend, we are looking at the amendments \nnow and hope we can achieve that goal shortly.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this legislation with \nwhich, as many of my colleagues know, I have been long involved. The \nlegislation we consider today is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we will consider all year. Congress has a responsibility to \nensure that every eligible American who goes to vote gets to vote and \nthat every vote cast counts.\n  What we have learned from the 2000 elections is that as strong as our \ndemocracy is, we have been lax in the upkeep of the actual mechanism \nthat drives it, our voting systems. That is why we have come together \nacross party lines to pass this election reform legislation.\n  I thank our chairman, Senator Dodd, for his leadership in bringing \nthis critical legislation to the floor. He has been tireless in his \ndevotion to getting it done.\n  I also commend the ranking member of the committee, Senator \nMcConnell, for his commitment to improving our Nation's election \nsystems as well. Senator McConnell and I had introduced a bill that in \nmany ways is part of this ultimate bill. I am proud to be part of the \neffort, along with Senators Dodd and Bond and Torricelli and McCain and \nDurbin, to make this happen.\n  The right to vote, as we all know, is at the very heart of our \ndemocracy. It is a right that, throughout our history, brave men and \nwomen have risked their well-being, their very lives, to exercise. It \nwas for the right to vote that American patriots fired the shots heard \naround the world at Lexington and Concord, thereby initiating the \nRevolutionary War in 1775. It was for the right\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\nto vote that Susan B. Anthony bore arrest, trial, and conviction after \nshe challenged laws barring women from the polls by casting a ballot in \nRochester, NY, in 1872.\n  It was for the right to vote that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and \nother civil rights activists--including my former colleague in the \nHouse, Congressman John Lewis--marched from Selma to Montgomery, AL, in \n1965.\n  Blood continues to be spilled over our democratic ideals. The core \nreason for the September 11 attacks that so devastated this Nation, and \nparticularly my home State and city, is that terrorists hate our \ndemocracy: a democracy where all Americans--regardless of religion, \ngender, race, economic status, physical ability--have a say in how our \nGovernment is run; a democracy where every person is equal, and because \nsome people are in some high theocratic or political position, they \ndon't have any more right to determine the outcome of an election than \nour average person.\n  We in the United States have a special obligation, a duty, to ensure \nthe right to vote--not only to honor those who sacrificed so we have \nthis right but to ensure that Americans today and in the future will be \nfully able to exercise it.\n  First and foremost, we must have voting machines and systems that are \naccessible to people, that are easy to use and that work. To my mind, \nthe most important provisions in this bill are the grant provisions \nthat will provide $3.5 billion to states and localities to meet federal \nstandards and to update and modernize their voting systems. Federal \nfunds for the improvement of old voting machines is something that I \nhave been talking about ever since the 2000 election, and was something \nthat I included in my election reform bill last year that Senator \nMcConnell and I sponsored.\n  I first voted in 1969, and I sued the same type of machine when I \nvoted in 2000 in spite of all the technological changes in the \nintervening years. Just because we are the world's oldest democracy \ndoes not mean we have to use the world's oldest technology that is \nsimple.\n  The problem does not end with the machines, although in my State that \nis a big problem. Throughout this nation there are inadequately \nmaintained registration lists, confusingly designed ballots, and phone \nlines that were so busy that voters could not get through to conform \ntheir registration status.\n  In my home state of New York, in November 2000, people waited in line \nfor hours to vote. Many voters--those who could not afford to be late \nfor work or that had to get home to their children--waited in line and \nultimately left the polling place without being able to participate in \none of the most critical and closest elections of our time.\n  You should have seen the look on the faces of these people, some of \nthem voting for the first time, doing good for the country, many of \nthem in their work clothes, and the look of disappointment as they \nwaited and waited and then could not vote.\n  Others waited and waited only to be confronted with the cruel reality \nthat the voting machines in their precinct were broken or that the \npolling place had run out of emergency ballots. Again, the looks on \ntheir faces had a lasting impression on me.\n  Voting should be accessible, accurate and speedy--in all places, all \nthe time. You cannot say, well, it is good most of the time because the \nright to vote is so precious. The grant programs included in this bill \nwill allow states and localities to do just that.\n  This bill also includes standards for the states and localities--\nwhich I believe will be a great improvement in the ability of people to \nvote across this nation.\n  To Wit:\n  The bill sets voting system standards that will allow voters to check \ntheir ballots and correct errors, that will make voting more accessible \nfor the disabled and non-English speakers, and that requires voting \nsystems to meet the error rate set by the FEC;\n  The bill establishes provisional voting in every state, which will \ninsure that every person who goes to the polls has the opportunity to \ncast a ballot;\n  The bill establishes important anti-fraud provisions, including a \nstatewide computerized voter registration database that will allow poll \nworkers to have the information that they need in front of them on \nelection day.\n  I think that these provisions make a lot of sense. They will help \npeople to have greater access to the polls while at the same time \ndecreasing fraud in our voting systems.\n  The final critical piece of this legislation is the establishment of \nan independent election agency. This is something that I have \nsupported, and that I included in the election reform bill that I \nintroduced with my colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell.\n  The bipartisan four-person Commission will oversee the grants \nprograms and the implementation of the federal standards, will provide \ninformation to the states and to the public about federal elections, \nand will keep a watchful eye on our voting systems so that we are \ncontinuously updating them. With the Commission in place, hopefully we \nwill never face the situation that we faced in the 2000 elections \nagain.\n  Like most bipartisan legislation, this bill is a compromise--but I \nbelieve that it is a good compromise that is based on core principles \nthat we all share. It will allow us to improve our voting systems and \nmake our election process better.\n  The right to vote is a sacred trust--a covenant--between the \ngovernment and the people. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this \nbipartisan election reform legislation, so that we can give the \nAmerican people the election system that they and our grand democracy \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2871 and 2873, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have two amendments which I would like \nto be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2871 and 2873, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2871\n\n(Purpose: To specify how lever voting systems may meet the multilingual \n                     voting materials requirement)\n\n       On page 8, strike lines 5 through 18, and insert the \n     following:\n       (B) Exceptions.--\n       (i) If a State meets the criteria of item (aa) of \n     subparagraph (A)(i)(I) with respect to a language, a \n     jurisdiction of that State shall not be required to provide \n     alternative language accessibility under this paragraph with \n     respect to that language if--\n\n       (I) less than 5 percent of the total number of voting-age \n     citizens who reside in that jurisdiction speak that language \n     as their first language and are limited-English proficient; \n     and\n       (II) the jurisdiction does not meet the criteria of item \n     (bb) of such subparagraph with respect to that language.\n\n       (ii) A State or locality that uses a lever voting system \n     and that would be required to provide alternative language \n     accessibility under the preceding provisions of this \n     paragraph with respect to an additional language that was not \n     included in the voting system of the State or locality before \n     the date of enactment of this Act may meet the requirements \n     of this paragraph with respect to such additional language by \n     providing alternative language accessibility through the \n     voting systems used to meet the requirement of paragraph \n     (3)(B) if--\n\n       (I) it is not practicable to add the alternative language \n     to the lever voting system or the addition of the language \n     would cause the voting system to become more confusing or \n     difficult to read for other voters;\n       (II) the State or locality has filed a request for a waiver \n     with the Office of Election Administration of the Federal \n     Election Commission or, after the transition date (as defined \n     in section 316(a)(2)), with the Election Administration \n     Commission, that describes the need for the waiver and how \n     the voting system under paragraph (3)(B) would provide \n     alternative language accessibility; and\n       (III) the Office of Election Administration or the Election \n     Administration Commission (as appropriate) has approved the \n     request filed under subclause (II).\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                           amendment no. 2873\n\n(Purpose: To require States and localities to mail a voter registration \nform to individuals who cast provisional ballots that were not counted)\n\n       On page 13, strike line 22, and insert the following: ``is \n     not counted (such notice shall include the State's voter \n     registration form); and''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, these two amendments--both technical in \nnature, and I believe have been agreed to by the Senators from \nConnecticut and Kentucky, the majority and minority managers on this \nbill--deal with two issues. One deals with those States with lever \nissues, which my State of New York has, and what it allows a State or \nlocality with lever machines to do is apply to DOJ for an exemption \nthat will allow it to meet the linguistic accents requirement in title \nI. The exemption allows the State or locality to place any new \nlanguages that it is required to provide under this act under the DREs, \ninstead of on the lever machines, to place them on the new machines if \nthe State or locality shows that it would be impractical to add the new \nlanguage to the lever machine or adding it would cause the voting \nsystem to become more confusing or difficult to read for other voters, \nand DOJ certifies this is the case.\n  The reason is simple. Unlike other machines, the lever machines have \nlimited space. If too many languages were required to be on the \nmachines, it would become confusing and you couldn't really put a \nballot together. This gives anybody who speaks those languages an \nability to vote on the new machines that will be placed in every voting \nplace that is used for the disabled and others without bollixing up the \nlever machine.\n  The second amendment--since we are doing them en bloc, I would like \nto address both--requires that the notice sent to people whose \nprovisional ballots were not counted includes a voter registration \nform, obvious for its purpose. If your ballot was not counted, there is \nprobably something wrong with the way you registered or you were not \nregistered, whatever.\n  By giving these folks a voter registration form, they can reregister \nquickly and easily. I thank the Senator from Connecticut and the \nSenator from Kentucky for helping me refine these amendments and, as I \nmentioned before while they were off the floor, for their fabulous \nleadership on this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New York. He has \nbeen a great help on this bill, generally speaking. These amendments \nnot only will be important for New York but, as he has talked about \nthem, there are other States as well that will appreciate the \ncontribution the Senator from New York has made in these two proposals.\n  I am in favor of both of these amendments. I just mention this to the \nSenator from New York. We are going to be looking at what the cost \neffect is of slipping in that reregistration form. It may not be much \nat all. I know the Senator from New York would probably want to know \nthe answer to that as well.\n  In the meantime, I will accept the amendment and take a look at that. \nI congratulate him on the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I, too, commend the Senator from New York, who has \nbeen a collaborator with several of us on this issue going back over \nthe last year, for his extremely important contribution to this bill \nand thank him for his great work.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my leader collaborator, coconspirators from \nKentucky and Connecticut, and urge adoption of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendments Nos. 2871 and 2873, en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2871 and 2873), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, that will be the business for this evening. \nActually, we completed some work. We had about five amendments adopted \nin the last 4\\1/2\\ hours. I thank, again, the Senator from New York.\n  Tomorrow morning, we may get to the bill around 10:15. I have been \ntold that if we can get some agreement, maybe tomorrow, on final \npassage at a decent hour late tomorrow afternoon, early tomorrow \nevening--I don't know if that is possible or not--it may be possible \nfor us to complete the business of the Senate by tomorrow. That is \nobviously subject to the work of the two leaders. At least there is a \ngood possibility. I know that will be warm news to those who would like \nto get back to their respective States earlier rather than later. I \ncan't help but note the smile of the Presiding Officer with that news.\n  I thank my colleague from Kentucky for his help today in working \nthrough this. There will be a series of other amendments, people coming \nforward with ideas. We want to accommodate everybody we can, realizing \nthat, as we said at the outset, this is new ground we are breaking in \nmany areas. We are very sensitive and conscious of the State and local \ninvolvement in this process. We want to accommodate States and \nlocalities to the maximum extent possible as we try to become a better \npartner in the conduct of elections. We are trying to do work that is \nsometimes a little confusing, but I think we have done a pretty good \njob so far. I am hopeful tomorrow we can resolve these other \namendments.\n  My final plea is to Members: Please, there are more and more \namendments. Some of them, I am told, are just colloquies. Some Members \njust want to offer the amendment and withdraw it and discuss their \nidea. I urge Members, please, if you are interested in doing that, come \nover first thing in the morning so we can get to the amendments that \nmay require votes because we can't resolve them. We will have to just \nleave them up to the Members to decide whether or not they want to \ninclude them in the bill or not. I urge Members to come over.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We have an amendment we would just like to file this \nevening as to the signature forms so that people could take a look at \nit, and signature attestation, I believe, on behalf of myself and \nperhaps the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed to file that amendment \ntonight.\n  Mr. DODD. No problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank a lot of people for their work. I note the presence \nof the Presiding Officer. Cathy Cox, who is Secretary of State of \nGeorgia, I want the Presiding Officer to know, has been incredibly \nhelpful in this process. She is a remarkable person. I know the Senator \nfrom Georgia appreciates that extremely. I want to let him and others \nknow how helpful she has been in helping us see through ideas that \nwould be productive and constructive.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add that I, too, would like to \nsee this bill wrapped up early evening tomorrow. I am hopeful, I say to \nmy friend from Connecticut, that we will get the cooperation on this \nside of the aisle to achieve that goal.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to support my amendment \nspecifying that Election Reform Incentive Grant Program funds may go to \nStates wishing to establish toll-free telephone hotlines to be used by \nvoters reporting possible voting fraud and voting rights abuses.\n  The election of 2000 reminded us that elections can be close and that \npublic confidence in the outcome of elections depends on the accuracy, \nfairness, and legality of election procedures. Obtaining accurate \nresults requires ensuring that fraudulent votes not dilute the votes \ncast by eligible voters and that all eligible citizens have poll \naccess.\n  Officials from a State's or locality's relevant investigating and \nenforcing\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nagencies may not have the resources to oversee every polling location. \nCitizens who witness voting fraud or voting rights abuses may not know \nwhere to report a possible violation of law. A toll-free hotline would \ngive citizens a means to help prevent voting fraud and voting rights \nabuses and would give States the information they need to prosecute \nviolations and implement procedures to prevent further violations.\n  The Indiana Bipartisan Task Force on Election Integrity recently \nissued a report developed through months of research and with the input \nof election officials, voter advocates, and citizens of the State. \nWhile the State of Indiana already has implemented many measures that \nwill enhance the integrity of elections, the Task Force recommended \nadditional reforms for that purpose, including the development of a \ntoll-free telephone hotline to be used by voters who believe they have \nwitnessed a voting irregularity or voting rights abuse.\n  I believe that other States may wish to establish such hotlines, and \nI believe the hotlines could be an important tool in improving election \naccuracy, fairness, and legality. For these reasons, I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/13/senate-section/article/S729-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, Willie Morris was one of the great under-\nrecognized American writers of the 20th century. He grew up in Yazoo \nCity, MS--population 12,000--where he learned to tell stories by \nlistening to old Black men who sat in the shade and whittled. He said \ntheir eye for detail helped him to see things he otherwise would have \nmissed. At 34, Willie Morris became the youngest-ever editor of \nAmerica's oldest magazine, ``Harper's Weekly.'' He wrote candidly about \nrace long before most other white writers.\n  Three years ago, Willie Morris died at the age of 64, leaving behind \n19 books, many of them best-sellers. Like all great writers, a part of \nWillie Morris continues to live on in his words. But there is another \npart of him that lives on as well. You see, before he died, Willie \nMorris decided to donate his eyes in order to give someone else a \nchance to see. As it turned out, his corneas went to two different men, \nneither of whom he had ever met. One was black, one was white. His \nfriends say he would have loved the irony of his gift: that a man who \nhelped us see the world a little more clearly during his life is still \nhelping people see after his death.\n  America has changed since Willie Morris was a boy listening to the \nstories of those old men. We no longer accept legal discrimination. We \nno longer permit poll taxes to bar African-Americans from voting. We no \nlonger tolerate ``separate but equal'' schools or water fountains or \nlunch counters. We have made considerable progress--due, in large part, \nto courageous African-American leaders including Martin Luther King, \nRosa Parks, Thurgood Marshall, and John Lewis. During Black History \nMonth, we honor those leaders and all of the other \nextraordinary African-Americans who have contributed so greatly to our \nnation--heroes like Crispus Attucks, who died at the Boston Massacre; \nSalem Poor, who fought at Bunker Hill and survived that brutal winter \nat Valley Forge; Harriet Tubman, the Underground Railroad ``conductor'' \nwho rescued hundreds of people from slavery, served during the Civil \nWar as a Union cook, spy, scout and nurse and was buried with full \nmilitary honors.\n\n  We honor the Tuskegee Airmen, the first African-Americans ever to fly \ncombat aircraft and one of the most decorated fighter squadrons in our \nnation's history, who fought Nazism in Europe--and racism when they \nreturned home; and Secretary of State Colin Powell, the first African-\nAmerican to serve as Chairman of America's Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  We honor great scientists, including George Washington Carver and \nBenjamin Banneker, the mathematician and astronomer and the first \nAfrican-American to receive a Presidential appointment--from Thomas \nJefferson. We also honor great orators and champions of human rights, \nincluding Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth and Barbara Jordan; great \neducators, such as Mary McLeod Bethune and Booker T. Washington; and \ngreat artists, including Marian Anderson, the first African-American \nsoloist to sing with the Metropolitan Opera in New York, Zora Neale \nHurston, the novelist and Langston Hughes, ``the poet laureate of \nHarlem.''\n  This month, as the world watches the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, \nwe also honor extraordinary earlier Olympians like Jesse Owens, who \nshattered the myth of Aryan supremacy by winning four gold medals at \nthe 1936 Olympics in Berlin; and Wilma Rudolph, the first African-\nAmerican woman to win three Olympic gold medals, in 1960. We also honor \nother great athletes including Jackie Robinson, the first African-\nAmerican to play Major League baseball; and Arthur Ashe, champion of \ntennis and human rights.\n  We remember exceptional leaders such as W.E.B. DuBois, one of the \nfounders of the NAACP; A. Philip Randolph, the former vice president of \nthe AFL-CIO and founder of the first African-American trade union; and \nRalph Bunche, diplomat, Under Secretary General of the U.N., and the \nfirst Black person from any nation ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize. \nAnd we honor the countless other African-Americans who changed our \nnation for the better simply by having the courage to say no to \nindignity and injustice in their own lives.\n\n  The stories of African Americans are the missing chapter in America's \nhistory books. If we don't know them, we cannot truly know ourselves.\n  But it's not enough just to celebrate their work. Especially this \nyear, we must continue their work.\n  To the terrorists who attacked us on September 11, the America Martin \nLuther King described--an America built on equality, justice, freedom \nand human dignity for every person--is not a dream. It is a nightmare. \nBy attacking us, the terrorists thought they could destroy our dream. \nBut they were wrong. Instead of turning on each other in the wake of \nthe attacks, as the terrorists had expected, Americans turned to each \nother. We came together in ways that most of us had never seen in our \nlifetimes. We were truly one people, indivisible.\n  Those of us who work in this building, and people all over the world \nwho look to this Capitol as a symbol of democracy, are incredibly \nfortunate that another chapter in African-American history was written \nlast fall. Just five days before September 11, former Army Major \nGeneral Al Lenhardt became this Senate's Sergeant at Arms, the first \nAfrican-American ever to serve as an elected officer in either the \nHouse or the Senate. I know I speak for all of us when I say how \ngrateful we are to him for seeing us safely through September 11 and \nthe anthrax attack.\n  We are also proud of our men and women in uniform, who are now \nbringing justice to the killers of September 11. What they are doing is \nright and necessary. But it is not the only way we can honor the nearly \n3,000 innocents who died in New York, at the Pentagon and in western \nPennsylvania. We can defy the killers right here at home--by keeping \nMartin Luther King's dream alive, and strengthening the democracy the \nterrorists sought to destroy.\n  We can start this month by strengthening our election system so that \nwe never again experience an election like we did in 2000, when \nmillions of votes went uncounted, especially those of African-\nAmericans. We have an extraordinary opportunity. Senators Dodd, \nMcConnell and Bond have given us a good, truly bipartisan election \nreform bill that requires states to meet uniform, nondiscriminatory \nvoting standards, and provides the resources they need to do so. That \nbill is on the Senate floor now. I hope we will pass it this week with \noverwhelming support. If we are a democracy in fact as well as in name, \nthe right to vote and to have that vote count must not be compromised.\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\n  The income gap between Blacks and whites in America is narrower today \nthan it has ever been. But it is still too wide. We can do better. Last \nweek, we voted to provide an additional 13 weeks of benefits to laid-\noff workers who have exhausted their unemployment benefits.\n  I hope we can still find a way to expand unemployment insurance \ncoverage to part-time workers and recent hires--a disproportionate \nnumber of whom are African-American--and to help all laid-off workers \nmaintain their health benefits.\n  Let's also raise the minimum wage. It's been five years since the \nlast increase. The purchasing power of the minimum wage is now the \nlowest it's been in more than 30 years. And a full-time minimum wage \nincome won't get you over the poverty line. We can do better.\n  Nothing has more power than education to move us from separate to \nequal. Yet today, nearly half-a-century after Brown v. Board of \nEducation, mst minority students still attend schools that are \npredominantly minority. Their class sizes, on average, are larger, \ntheir books are older, their lessons are less challenging and their \nteachers have less training in the subjects they teach. Last year, we \npassed a promising, bipartisan school reform act. This year, let's work \ntogther to make sure that ``Leave No Child Behind'' is a promise kept, \nnot a dream deferred. Our goal should be to make sure that every child \nin America comes to school ready to learn and leaves school ready to \nsucceed.\n  If we learned anything from the terrible ordeal of September 11, it \nis that we cannot tolerate acts of hatred and discrimination. Make no \nmistake about it: Chaining a man to the back of a pickup truck and \ndragging him to his death for no reason other than the color of his \nskin is an act of terrorism. And while James' Byrd's death may be the \nbest-known racially motivated hate crime in recent years, it is not the \nonly such crime. A hate crime scars this country every hour and 10 \nminutes of every day, 365 days a year. In the last Congress, the Senate \npassed a bipartisan bill strengthening federal protections against hate \ncrimes only to see it die in conference with the House. We need to pass \nit again this year. And this time, let's make sure it becomes law. W \ncame together on September 11. If we are to stay together, we must \nstand against every form of bigotry and hatred.\n  Finally, we know that protecting rights in law is only half the \nbattle. We also need a judiciary that protects our rights in court. As \nSenators, we have a special obligation to ensure that the men and women \nwho are nominated for lifetime positions on the federal bench or the \nSupreme Court will protect the basic rights for which so many \nAmericans, from Crispus Attucks on down through the years, have given \ntheir lives. Let us honor that obligation this month and every month we \nare privileged to be here.\n  We don't need Willie Morris' eyes to see how far America has come on \ncivil rights since he was a boy. We also don't need Willie Morris' eyes \nto see that there is still a gap between the America we are and the \nAmerica we can be. We all see those things. Our challenge today is to \nenvision ways to close that gap, and then to transform that vision into \nlaw. In doing that, we will honor African-Americans and every American \nof every race and creed who died on September 11.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/13/senate-section/article/S730-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S730-S731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IMPRESSIVE STEPS TAKEN AGAINST THE WAR ON TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout our war against terrorism and about the recent statements made by \nAdministration officials concerning possible actions toward Iraq.\n  At the outset, I compliment President Bush and the Administration for \nthe very effective steps taken on the war against terrorism. We have \nseen the response to the disastrous, tragic, horrendous events of \nSeptember 11, with the military moving in, doing in Afghanistan what \nthe Soviets could not do, and doing what the British could not do much \nearlier. We are well on our way, having defeated the Taliban and al-\nQaida; very impressive steps taken in the war against terrorism. The \nPresident has done an outstanding job on leadership on this critical \nissue.\n  There have been comments recently about the possibility of action \nagainst Iraq, and that may well be warranted. On this state of the \nrecord, it is my thinking there are quite a number of serious questions \nwhich have to be answered. We need to know, with some greater \nprecision, the threat posed by Saddam Hussein with respect to weapons \nof mass destruction. There is solid evidence about Saddam Hussein \nhaving chemical weapons, substantial evidence on biological weapons, \nand some questions about nuclear weapons. However, there really ought \nto be a comprehensive analysis as to the precise nature of Saddam \nHussein's threat.\n  Iraq is on the record as having supported terrorism, and it seems to \nme there ought to be an elaboration as to the terrorist activities \nwhich are attributable to Iraq. If there is to be military action, we \nought to have a full statement as to Iraq's violations of UN \ninspections. We know that the UN inspectors have been ousted, but here \nagain, this is an issue where more information is necessary for the \nCongress and, in my view, for the American people. There also has to be \nan analysis of what the costs would be, some appraisal in terms of \ncasualties, depending upon the nature of the contemplated action.\n  Then there is the issue as to what happens after Saddam Hussein is \ntoppled. There is no doubt about the desirability of toppling Saddam \nHussein. By twenty-twenty hindsight, perhaps it is regrettable the \nUnited States and its allies did not move on Baghdad in 1991. That, \nobviously, is water over the dam. There were many factors to be \nconsidered including the unwillingness of our allies at that time to \nmove. The U.S. had success against Iraq in 1991, but toppling Saddam \nHussein was an action that was obviously not taken.\n  There have been statements by the President in identifying the axis \nof evil as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. The President has stated if we \ndo not have the cooperation of our allies we will act alone, and I \nthink there is a solid basis for the President to say that and for the \nPresident to give serious consideration to acting alone.\n  We know there were many danger signals as to Osama bin Laden and al-\nQaida. We know that bin Laden was under indictment for murdering \nAmericans in Mogadishu in 1993. He was under indictment for murdering \nAmericans and others in the embassy attacks in 1998. He was implicated \nin the terrorism against the USS Cole. He pledged a worldwide ``jihad'' \nagainst the United States. There was substantial authority under \ninternational law for what had transpired for the United States to act.\n\n  What we have seen in modern times is in effect a non-determination of \nguilt and action against terrorism as a matter of self-defense \nrecognized under international law. When President Reagan acted against \nMuammar Qadhafi in April of 1986, that was in effect a non-\ndetermination of guilt, and we moved in self-defense against Qadhafi. \nWhen President Clinton dispatched missiles to Afghanistan in August of \n1998--again, a non-judicial determination of guilt. There would have \nbeen total justification for the United States moving against al-Qaida \nand Osama bin Laden in advance of September 11. That experience \nsuggests we have to make a careful analysis, a calculated analysis of \nthe risks.\n  It may well be justified as a matter of self-defense to act, and act \nagainst Saddam Hussein and Iraq. As we know by twenty-twenty hindsight, \nthe vision is very clear. We know in twenty-twenty hindsight that it \nwould have been wise to have acted against Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida \nbefore September 11.\n  The statements reported from Secretary Colin Powell yesterday, in \ntestifying before the Senate Budget Committee, are worth noting with \nparticularity. Secretary Powell was quoted as saying: ``With respect to \nIraq, it has long been for several years now a policy of the U.S. \nGovernment that regime change would be in the best interests of the \nregion, the best interests of the Iraqi people.'' Secretary Powell also \nsaid: ``With respect to Iran and with respect to North Korea, there is \nno plan to start a war with these nations.''\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\n  By the grammatical negative pregnant pause, the implication is pretty \nclear that when the Secretary of State says in formal testimony before \nthe Senate committee that there is no plan to ``start a war with these \nnations,'' referring to Iran and North Korea, there is a different plan \nwith respect to Iraq. As I say, it may well be justified.\n  If there is to be a use of force and if there is to be war, under our \nConstitution it is the responsibility and it is the authority of the \nCongress of the United States to make the determination to declare war. \nThat constitutional provision is there for a very good reason. We in \nthe Senate and those in the House of Representatives represent the \nAmerican people, and we speak for the American people. We have seen the \nbitter lesson from Vietnam that we cannot prosecute a war without the \npublic support. If there is to be the authorization for the use of \nforce or declaration of war, that is a matter that ought to come before \nthe Congress.\n  These are views I have held for a very long time. In college I \nstudied political science and international relations and served \nstateside during the period of the Korean war. At that time I wondered \nabout being engaged in a war which was not a matter of congressional \ndetermination. That may be a somewhat personal aspect, having been \ncalled to service, and I was glad to spend twp years in the U.S. Air \nForce. I served stateside. However, the question in my mind at that \ntime, having studied international relations and knowing the \nconstitutional provision, was why a war was not declared.\n  Since coming to the Senate, I have been engaged in debates in this \nChamber on this subject on many occasions. In 1983 when there was \nmilitary action in Lebanon, I had an extensive colloquy with Senator \nPercy, then Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and asked him \nif, in fact, Korea was not a war. He said, ``yes, it was a war.'' I \nasked about Vietnam, ``was it a war?'' ``Yes, it was a war.'' However, \non neither occasion was the declaration determined by the Congress.\n\n  On the hearings for nominees for the Supreme Court, that was a \nquestion I posed with some frequency to nominees, illustrative of which \nwas the confirmation of Justice David Souter. I recalled on Friday \nasking him, ``was Korea a war?'' I wanted to know. I had framed \nlitigation which I took to Senator Baker for determination as to the \nWar Powers Act and constitutionality, thinking there would be an \nappropriate judicial determination on that subject. Not unexpectedly, \nJustice Souter said he had not thought about it. So I said, take some \ntime, and over the weekend we had an adjournment and came back on \nMonday. I said, ``you have had time to think about it. Was Korea a \nwar?'' He said, ``I do not know''--which is not a bad answer. If you do \nnot know, you do not know. There is not much you can say by questioning \nbeyond that. I see Justice Souter from time to time, and that colloquy \nis something about which he comments from time to time.\n  When this body took up the resolution for the use of force in 1991, I \nhave a clear recollection that President Bush did not want the \nresolution put before the Senate and before the House. I think he was \nconcerned whether it would be approved. There was historic debate here \nin January of 1991. The Senate approved the resolution for the use of \nforce by a vote of 52 to 47. The comments at that time went to the \neffect that it was a historic event. However, when President Bush had \nthe resolution by the House and by the Senate, it was a much stronger \napproach.\n  His reluctance to come before Congress is typical of the tension \nwhich exists between the executive and legislative branches, with the \nPresidents traditionally saying they do not need congressional \nauthorization to act because they have the constitutional authority as \nCommander in Chief, and the response institutionally from many in the \nCongress has been, ``no, the Congress has the sole authority to involve \nthe United States in war by our sole constitutional authority.''\n  The history of the War Powers Act is a very significant development. \nThe executive branch, the President, while complying with it, \ntraditionally says it is not constitutional; he is not really bound to \ndo so.\n  We had the issue raised again when President Clinton sent missiles \ninto Baghdad. I took the floor on a number of occasions in 1998 arguing \nthat with the imminence of the likelihood of action by the President on \nmissiles in Baghdad, the House of Representatives and Senate ought to \nstand up and make that determination. Candidly, the Congress is never \nvery anxious to make that determination. It is easier to let the \nPresident make the decision. If he is wrong, he gets the blame. If he \nis right, then the issue passes.\n  We did have the debate on the bombing of Yugoslavia. It passed this \nbody. It came to a tie vote, 213-to-213, in the House of \nRepresentatives. Therefore, Congress had not authorized that attack. It \ntakes, obviously, a resolution on both sides. However, the bombing went \nahead.\n  We are facing a very serious situation with Iraq. Iraq is a real \nmenace. There is no doubt about that. I think there are very strong \nUnited States national interests to topple Saddam Hussein, and I think \nit is very much in the interests of the people of the region that he be \ntoppled and also very much in the interests of the people of Iraq that \nhe be toppled.\n  However, I do believe that, constitutionally, it is a judgment which \nought to come before the Congress of the United States. I believe there \nought to be hearings by the appropriate committees of the Congress to \ntake up these questions as to the specific threats which Saddam Hussein \nposes and Iraq's specific activities on terrorism--a good bit of it, \ndoubtless, might have to be conducted in closed session. However, some \nof it could be conducted in an open session: what the costs would be, \nthe casualties, and what happens afterwards.\n  However, the American people need to know much more of the details, \nand I believe the Congress needs to know much more of the details than \nwhat has been conveyed so far by the Administration. It is my hope that \nthis issue will attract the attention of the Congress of the United \nStates with statements such as this one, with hearings, and with our \ndeliberative process, recognizing the seriousness of the issue and \nrecognizing also our constitutional responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has consumed 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 13, \n1994 in Sioux City, IA. Two gay men were stabbed and beaten by two \nattackers because of the victims' sexual orientation. The assailants, \nCharles Samuel Thomas, 18, and Dennis Evans Smith, 23, were charged \nwith multiple felonies, including two hate crime charges, in connection \nwith the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/13/senate-section/article/S731-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S731-S732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROSS POWERS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

A bill to set forth certain requirements for trials and \nsentencing by military commissions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce, \non behalf of Senator Durbin and myself, legislation entitled the \n``Military Commission Procedures Act of 2002.''\n  The President issued an order establishing generalized procedures for \ntrying members of al-Qaida and the Taliban. It is my view and Senator \nDurbin's view that Congress ought to consider what are the appropriate \nprocedures pursuant to our authority under the Constitution, article I, \nsection 8, which gives to the Congress the responsibility and authority \n``To define and punish . . . Offenses against the Law of Nations.''\n  We have already legislated in part, delegating to the President the \nauthority to establish military tribunals ``by regulations which shall, \nso far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the \nrules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases \nin the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to \nor inconsistent with this chapter.''\n  The President promulgated his order without consultation with \nCongress. This legislation is a starting point for what we believe \nought to be consideration by the Judiciary Committee.\n  In the President's order, there was a provision that there could be \nno appeal from any order of the military tribunal. But that, on its \nface, was inconsistent with the Constitution, which preserves the right \nof habeas corpus unless there is rebellion or invasion, neither of \nwhich had occurred here.\n  The President's order also allowed for conviction of a capital \noffense by a two-thirds vote, but that is inconsistent with the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice, and the law does not allow a regulation to be \ninconsistent with that law.\n  So Senator Durbin and I have provided the modifications that two-\nthirds is acceptable generally. But if the sentence carries 10 years or \nmore, it requires a three-fourths vote. And for the death penalty, it \nwould require a unanimous vote.\n  This legislation further provides for right to counsel consistent \nwith the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which would be either \nmilitary counsel or could be private counsel. But that right is \npreserved.\n  On one provision, we have provided that there would be no ``Miranda'' \nrights for suspects who are interrogated. I candidly concede that in \nabrogating ``Miranda'' rights, that will be a source of some \ncontention, which can be the subject of hearings. But it is our view \nthat we should not give al-Qaida or Taliban prisoners access to counsel \nbefore they are questioned, first, for the safety of the soldiers who \nare doing the questioning, and, second, because of the importance, \npotentially, that eliciting information would stop further terrorist \nattacks.\n  Of course, we could provide no ``Miranda'' warnings in advance but \nnot allow admissions to be used at trial, but it is our view, subject \nto hearings and further consideration, that ``Miranda'' rights ought \nnot to be required.\n  We have provided for an open trial unless there is classified \ninformation; and, if classified information is used, we have \nincorporated the provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996--a \ncompromise worked out by Senator Simon and myself on the floor--which \nprovides for a summary to be given to the defendant and the commission, \nto be reviewed by the commission, to see if it is adequate to protect \nsources and methods of classified information and also adequate to \ninform the defendant of the evidence so that the defendant would have \nsubstantially the same ability to make his defense as he would if the \nclassified information was disclosed.\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\n  We have not provided any restrictions on rules of evidence, since it \nis the custom of Congress not to do so. But we think this legislation \nis an important first step. We now know there is a large contingent of \nthose captive in Guantanamo Bay.\n  I believe the President made a sound decision in saying that al-Qaida \nmembers were not prisoners of war, not subject to the Geneva Convention \nbecause they are terrorists, murdering innocent civilians. The \nPresident did accord Taliban members the protections of the Geneva \nConvention.\n  But these trials will soon start. It is very important that our \ncountry and our Government proceed with accepted norms for criminal \ntrials. To have a death penalty imposed on a two-thirds vote, as is in \nthe Presidential order, would not be consistent with our generalized \nstandards. To provide for no appeal is not consistent with the \nconstitutional provisions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to finish my \nsentence, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We believe this is a starting point. We urge early \nhearings so we can establish the parameters, so when we deal with these \ntreacherous terrorists, we will, in accordance with American standards, \ngive them basic due process--no more, but basic due process.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on November 13, 2001, President Bush \nissued a military order authorizing the use of military commissions to \nprosecute individuals who may be engaged in activities related to the \nsubject of our campaign against terrorism.\n  The initial public reaction to the White House action was one of \nsurprise and skepticism: Surprise that the order was issued without any \nadvance notice, and skepticism as to whether the decision is based on \nsound legal or policy grounds. Many commentators also raised legitimate \nconcerns that the Administration's use of military tribunals could \npotentially undermine our long-held foreign policy of criticizing other \nnations' reliance on such tribunals.\n  My reaction, which, I believe, was echoed by many of my colleagues in \nCongress, was one of disappointment, in addition to the surprise and \nskepticism. I was disappointed that Congress was excluded from \ndeliberating a policy as important as this one before the White House \nannounced the order.\n  I have said repeatedly since September 11 that I fully support the \nPresident in his efforts to combat terrorism both here and abroad. In \nresponse to September 11, Congress worked hand in hand with the \nadministration on a host of items in a truly cooperative and bipartisan \nmanner, from the passage of a joint resolution authorizing the \nPresident to use all necessary force, to the passage of the sweeping \nanti-terrorism bill.\n  Yet on the drafting of this military order, Congress was left \ncompletely in the dark. The Constitution provides executive powers to \nthe President, not exclusive powers. Our Nation remains strong only if \nthe co-equal branches of government work together.\n  Any proceeding that takes place under President Bush's order will \nhave to withstand the test of legal scrutiny for years to come. But \nmore importantly, it will also have to pass the scrutiny of our \ncitizens at home and of our friends and enemies abroad who are watching \nto see how the greatest democracy in history carries out justice.\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing held in early December, Senator \nSpecter and I both questioned the administration's witness to ascertain \nthe precise constitutional authority upon which the administration was \nrelying in creating this tribunal. We did not receive a satisfactory \nanswer.\n  We also wanted to know the precise scope and reach of the order in \nterms of who will be brought before such a tribunal, what procedural \nand evidentiary standards are to be applied, and what due process \nsafeguards, including appeals, will be in place. We did not receive \nmany details here either.\n  Instead, the administration asked us to wait for the regulations \nimplementing the order that the Defense Department was preparing.\n  It has been over 3 months since the President's order was issued, and \nwe have not seen the Defense Department regulations. So I believe it is \nappropriate for Congress to act now to provide the constitutional \nauthority and guidance on procedures before the first military \ncommission is empaneled under the President's order.\n  I am introducing the ``Military Commission Procedures Act of 2002'' \nwith Senator Specter. I believe this bill will provide the executive \nbranch with the legal authority to prosecute potential terrorists \ncaptured in the current military campaign abroad.\n  Our bill is designed to ensure that military commissions are used in \nthe most narrow and necessary circumstances while protecting the basic \nrights of defendants. The bill limits the jurisdiction of military \ncommissions to try defendants only for violations of the law of war, \nand not any domestic laws.\n  The defendants would be entitled to representation by counsel in the \nsame manner as military service members under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice. The prosecution would need to prove its case beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and the death penalty could not be imposed without a \nunanimous vote as to guilt and to the sentence.\n  Furthermore, in order to keep the proceedings as open as possible, \nour bill provides for classified information procedures where the \ndefendant would receive a summary of such evidence while the commission \nconsiders the actual evidence in camera and ex parte. The bill also \nauthorizes convicted defendants to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for \ncertiorari.\n  In short, Senator Specter and I believe this bill includes the \ndetails that the President's military order of November 13 should have \nincluded. More importantly, the bill provides the full force of the \ncongressional and constitutional support behind the President's \ncontinuing efforts to wage a war against terrorism.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. \n        Ensign):\n  S. 1939. A bill to establish the Great Basin National Heritage Area, \nNevada and Utah; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself, Senator Ensign, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Bennett to introduce this bill, which will \nestablish a National Heritage Area in eastern Nevada and western Utah.\n  National Heritage Areas are regions in which residents, businesses, \nas well as local and tribal governments have joined together in \npartnership to conserve and celebrate cultural heritage and special \nlandscapes. For Nevada, these include such nationally significant \nhistoric areas as the Pony Express and Overland Stage Route, Mormon and \nother pioneer settlements, historic mining camps and ghost towns, as \nwell as Native American cultural resources such as the Fremont Culture \narcheological sites.\n  The bill will also highlight some of Nevada's natural riches. The \nGreat Basin contains great natural diversity, including forests of \nbristlecone pine, which are renowned for their ability to survive for \nthousands of years. The Great Basin National Heritage Area includes \nWhite Pine County and the Duckwater Reservation in Nevada and Millard \nCounty, UT. The Heritage Area will also ensure the preservation of key \neducational and inspirational opportunities in perpetuity without \ncompromising traditional local control over--and use of--the landscape. \nFinally, the Great Basin National Heritage Area will provide a \nframework for celebrating Nevada's and Utah's rich historic, \narcheological, cultural, and natural resources for both visitors and \nresidents.\n  The bill will establish a board of directors to manage the area. \nConsisting of local officials from both counties and tribes, the board \nwill have the authority to receive and spend federal funds and develop \na management plan within five years of the bill's passage. The bill \nmandates the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a memorandum of \nunderstanding with the Board of Directors for the management of the \nresources of the heritage area. The bill also authorizes up to $10 \nmillion to carry out the Act but limits Federal\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\nfunding to no more than fifty percent of the project's costs. The bill \nallows the Secretary to provide assistance until September 20, 2020.\n  This bill benefits not just Nevada and Utah, but citizens of all \nStates. It highlights some areas of outstanding cultural and natural \nvalue and brings people together to celebrate values that they can be \nproud of.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1940. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat corporate tax benefits from stock option compensation expenses are \nallowed only to the extent such expenses are included in a \ncorporation's financial statements; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce Ending the \nDouble Standard for Stock Options Act along with my colleagues Senator \nMcCain, Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Durbin.\n  As another lesson learned from the Enron debacle, this bill addresses \na costly and dangerous double standard that allows a company to take a \ntax deduction for stock option compensation as a business expense while \nnot showing it as a business expense on its financial statement.\n  Stock options were a driving force behind management decisions at \nEnron that focused on increasing Enron's stock price rather than the \nsolid growth of the company.\n  Stock options are opportunities given to certain employees, usually \ntop executives, to purchase a company's stock at a set price for a \nspecified period of time, such as 5 or 10 years. When the stock price \nincreases, the potential profit to the executive rises, and the more \nstock options an executive has, the smaller the increase needed to \nrealize significant gain.\n  Stock options are a stealth form of compensation, because they do \nnot, under current accounting rules, have to be shown as an expense on \nthe corporate books. In fact they're the only form of compensation that \ndoesn't have to be treated as an expense at any time. But, like other \nforms of compensation, option expenses are allowed as a tax deduction \nfor a corporation. It doesn't make sense, but that's the way it is. And \nthis long-standing mismatch between U.S. accounting and tax rules was \nexploited by Enron to the hilt. The result was both misleading \nfinancial statements and an incentive to push accounting rules to the \nlimit in order to artificially raise stock prices so as to make the \nstock options more valuable.\n  A New York Times article from last October 21, reports that, ``Since \n1993, studies from Wall Street to Washington have shown that pushing \n[stock option] expenses off the income statement has inflated corporate \nearnings and misled investors about profits, particularly at technology \nconcerns. Options are also a titanic but stealthy transfer of wealth \nfrom shareholders to corporate management.''\n  Let's look at how it worked at Enron. We've all heard about the many \nways that Enron inflated its earnings and hid its debts by keeping \nvarious partnerships off the company books. Well, Enron did the same \nthing with stock options.\n  For five years, from 1996 until the year 2000, Enron told its \nshareholders that it was rolling in revenues. One analysis by Citizens \nfor Tax Justice, using Enron's public filings, reports that Enron \nclaimed a total 5-year income of $1.8 billion. This figure apparently \nincluded, however, a number of accounting gimmicks, one of which was \nEnron's decision to relegate all stock option compensation it had \nprovided to a footnote and to exclude such compensation from its total \nexpenses, even though, according to the same study, the stock option \npay over five years had reached almost $600 million. That $600 million, \nby the way, represented one-third of all the income reported by Enron \nover a 5-year period.\n  Yet all $600 million was, legally, kept off-the-books, away from \nEnron's bottom line. That's because existing U.S. accounting rules \nallow U.S. companies to omit employee stock option compensation as a \ncharge to earnings on their financial statements. That is a unique \nrule. Stock option compensation is the only kind of employee \ncompensation that a U.S. company never has to record on its financial \nstatements at any time as an expense. That means Enron could give its \nexecutives, directors and other employees $600 million in stock options \nand never show one penny of that pay on its books. It could dole out \nstock options like candy and never reduce by one penny its alleged \nincome of $1.8 billion.\n\n  The result was that Enron was able to provide extravagant \ncompensation, without ever having to account for that extravagance on \nits bottom line where stockholders and the public might take notice.\n  But Enron's misleading financial statements are not the end of the \nstory. The backside of the story is that, at the same time Enron was \ntouting its skyrocketing revenues and providing extravagant pay to \ninsiders, it was apparently telling Uncle Sam that its expenses \nexceeded its income and its tax liability was little or nothing. The \nstudy by Citizens for Tax Justice, after reviewing Enron's public \nfilings, has calculated that, despite claiming a 5-year revenue total \nof $1.8 billion, Enron apparently failed to pay any U.S. tax in 4 out \nof the last 5 years. How did a company with $1.8 billion in revenue \napparently pay so little in taxes? The same study calculated that with \na 35 percent corporate tax rate, Enron should have paid about $625 \nmillion over five years. But, apparently, according to the study, the \nprincipal way Enron avoided paying these taxes was by claiming that its \nincome had been wiped out by nearly $600 million in stock option \nexpenses, the same $600 million that Enron chose not to put on its \nfinancial statements as an expense. While these numbers are based on \npublic filings and not based on a review of the actual tax returns, the \nsignificance of Enron's actions is the same, avoiding tax liability \nthrough the use of stock options.\n  As I noted earlier, Enron was not acting illegally here, nor were its \nactions unique. It took advantage of the tax provisions which we hope \nto change in our bill which allow a company to claim a stock option \nexpense on its tax return even if the company never lists that expense \non the company books. These tax provisions incomprehensibly and \nindefensibly allow companies to tell Uncle Sam one thing and their \nstockholders something else.\n  And to add insult to injury, last year the IRS issued Revenue Ruling \n2001-1 which determined that companies whose tax liability was erased \nthrough stock option expenses are not subject to the corporate \nAlternative Minimum Tax. That revenue ruling means that our most \nsuccessful publicly traded companies, if they dole out enough stock \noptions to insiders, can arrange their affairs to escape paying any \ntaxes. That absurd result leaves the average taxpayer feeling like a \nchump for paying his fair share when a company like Enron can use its \nsuccess in the stock market to apparently end up tax free.\n  Now you may have noticed that, in discussing Enron's tax returns, I \nhave been using the words ``appears to'' and ``apparently.'' That is \nbecause, despite a pending request from Senators Baucus and Grassley of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Enron has yet to release its tax returns \nto either Congress or the public.\n  The lack of direct access to Enron's tax returns requires Congress \nand the public to have to continue making educated guesses about \nEnron's tax conduct, without having the actual facts. It is much too \nlate and much too serious for Enron to be asking everyone to play this \nguessing game. Enron is in bankruptcy; it has brought economic loss to \nindividuals and financial institutions across this country; its \nmanagement claims to have done nothing wrong, and the company professes \nto be cooperating with investigators.\n  Enron should immediately release to the public the last five years of \nits tax returns. Then we'll know with certainty if Enron paid no taxes \nin 4 out of the last 5 years and why. Then we'll know with certainty if \nEnron eliminated its taxes primarily through stock option deductions, \nor whether it used other tax provisions to avoid payment of tax such as \ndiverting income through offshore tax havens. The public and the \nCongress have a right to know what really happened at Enron.\n\n  It is also important to realize that most companies treat stock \noptions\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\nthe same way Enron did. A recent USA Today article reports that out of \nthe S 500 companies, only Boeing and Winn-Dixie currently record \nstock option expenses on both their financial statements and tax \nreturns. The other 498 companies apparently do not. The article says \nthat had stock option expense been recognized on their earnings \nstatements, the S 500's revenues would have fallen by 9 percent, \nanother measure of how much off-the-books stock option pay is out \nthere.\n  Even more troubling, and something that needs more investigation and \nattention is the claim in the article that ``half a dozen academic \nstudies have concluded that companies time the release of good or bad \nnews near the date that executives are issued their options, \norchestrating a potential windfall.'' In other words, some believe that \nexecutives are timing the release of company information around the \ndates they are to receive their stock options, thereby artificially \ninflating the value of their options.\n  The future promises more of the same. A February 3rd New York Times \narticle entitled, ``Even Last Year, Option Spigot Was Wide Open,'' \nreports that companies are providing more stock options than ever to \ntheir executives, even in the face of poor company performance and \ndiluted stockholder earnings. ``It's a great time to give options,'' \none expert is quoted as saying. ``They're cheap because they involve no \nchange to earnings, and that's important at a time when profits are \ndown.''\n  Ten years ago, some of us tried to end corporate stock option abuses \nby urging the Board that issues generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB, to \nrequire stock option expenses to be shown on company books. We were not \nsuccessful. Corporate America fought back tooth and nail. Intense \npressure was brought to bear on FASB. Arthur Levitt told the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee last month that he spent 50 percent of \nhis first four months at the SEC talking to corporate executives who \nwanted to keep their stock option pay off the books. On one day during \nthe height of the campaign, 100 CEOs flew into Washington to lobby \nMembers of Congress on this issue. In 1994, in the midst of this \nintense lobbying, the Senate voted 88-9 to recommend against putting \nstock option pay on the books.\n  Arthur Levitt testified before our committee that one of his greatest \nregrets from his days at the SEC was that he didn't work harder to get \nstock options treated as an expense on a company's financial statement. \nSeveral accounting firms, including Andersen and Deloitte, now support \nexpensing options. They are joined by more than 80 percent of U.S. \nfinancial analysts, as reported in a September 2001 survey conducted by \nthe leading financial research organization, the Association for \nInvestment Management and Research.\n  In addition, the newly re-constituted International Accounting \nStandards Board in London, the international equivalent of our FASB, \nhas announced that one of its first projects will be to propose \ninternational standards requiring stock options to be expensed on \ncompany books. But in a repeat of what happened here in the United \nStates, corporate lobbyists are already organizing to oppose this \nproject. An Enron document uncovered by my Subcommittee casts light on \nhow this battle may be fought.\n  The document is an email dated February 23, 2001, from David Duncan, \nthe lead auditor of Enron at Andersen, to several Andersen colleagues, \ndescribing Enron's reaction to a request that it consider donating \nfunds to the new International Accounting Standards Board.\n\n       Today [Enron Chief Accountant] Rick Causey called to say \n     that Paul Volker had called Ken Lay (Enron Chairman) and \n     asked Enron to make a 5 year, 100k per year commitment to \n     fund the Trust Fund of 'the FASB's International equivalent' \n     . . . . While I believe Rick is inclined to do this given \n     Enron's desire to increase their exposure and influence in \n     rulemaking broadly, he is interested in knowing whether these \n     type of commitments will add any formal or informal access to \n     this process (i.e., would these type commitments present \n     opportunities to meet with the Trustees of these groups or \n     other benefits). I think any information along this front or \n     further information on the current strategic importance of \n     supporting these groups for the good of consistent rulemaking \n     would help Enron with its decision to be supportive.\n\n  First, let me be clear that I'm not suggesting in any way that Paul \nVolker's request of Enron for a contribution to FASB's international \nequivalent was in any way improper. It wasn't. That is exactly how \nthese accounting standards boards get funded. And the response by Enron \nis not really suprising, it's something we've all known but we've never \nhad written confirmation of it. Contributions to the accounting \nstandards boards affect the boards' independence, and that's bad news \nfor reliable accounting.\n  No one was mincing any words here. Enron wanted to know whether its \nmoney would buy access and influence at the new accounting standards \nboard, and its auditor didn't bat an eye at this inquiry but asked his \ncolleagues for ``any information along this front.''\n  The bill we are introducing today does not require that stock options \nbe charged to earnings. That is a decision for the accounting standards \nboards to make. And many of us in Congress will be working on \nlegislation to make the accounting standards board more independent and \nless vulnerable to pressures from its contributors. The legislation we \nare offering today would simply state, in essence, that companies can \ntake a tax deduction or tax credit for stock option expenses only to \nthe extent that the company actually recognizes the same stock option \nexpenses in the company books.\n  The bill does not get into the accounting side of the issue. It does \nnot, for example, tell companies that they have to expense stock \noptions. It does not tell them when to take a stock option expense or \nhow to book that expense. It focuses solely on the income tax deduction \nand states, in essence, that any tax deduction must mirror the company \nbooks. If a company declares a stock option expense on its books, then \nthe company can deduct the expense on its tax return. If there is no \nstock option expense on the company books, there can be no expense on \nthe company tax return.\n  That's tax honesty. That will end the stock option double standard.\n  The stock option double standard has been a long festering problem in \ncorporate America. It has been one of the driving engines of stretching \naccounting rules to increase the value of a company's stock. Enron has \nput a face on this faceless problem and shown the cost of off-the-books \nstock option pay. Like other accounting gimmicks, off-the-books stock \noption pay coupled with a large tax deduction doesn't pass the smell \ntest, because we all know that ``off-the-books'' means stealth \ncompensation that is harder to track and easier for insiders to abuse. \nAdd to the stealth factor and the insider abuse factor, a government \npolicy of giving large corporate tax deductions which can completely \neliminate a company's tax liability, and you've set the stage for just \nthe type of stock option results we saw at Enron.\n  It is time to end the stock option double standard, and I urge all of \nmy colleagues to support enactment of this legislation this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record, a bill summary, a \nsection-by-section analysis, and the following materials: ``Less than \nZero Enron's Corporate Income Tax Payments, 1996-2000'' (Citizens for \nTax Justice, January 17, 2002); Duncan email (2/23/01); ``Enron's fall \nfuels push for stock option law'' (USA Today, 2/8/02); ``Even Last \nYear, Option Spigot Was Wide Open'' (New York Times, 2/3/02); ``Stock \nOption Madness'' (Washington Post, 1/30/02); ``Enron's Way: Pay \nPackages Foster Spin, Not Results'' (New York Times, 1/27/02); and \nstock option survey results by Association for Investment Management \nResearch, as posted on the AIMR website on 2/8/02.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From Citizens for Tax Justice, Jan. 17, 2002]\n\n    Less Than Zero: Enron's Corporate Income Tax Payments, 1996-2000\n\n       A January 17, analysis of Enron's financial documents by \n     Citizens for Tax Justice finds that Enron paid no corporate \n     income taxes in four of the last five years--although the \n     company was profitable in each of those years.\n       Over the five-year period from 1996 to 2000, Enron received \n     a net tax rebate of $381 million. This includes a $278 \n     million tax rebate in 2000 alone.\n       Over the same period, the company's profit before federal \n     income taxes totaled $1.785 billion.

According \n     to one recent analysis reported in the New York Times, Enron \n     apparently failed to pay any U.S. tax in four out of last \n     five years, despite skyrocketing revenues and an alleged \n     five-year pre-tax income from 1996 to 2000, of $1.8 billion. \n     To sidestep paying about $625 million in taxes on its $1.8 \n     billion in income, Enron apparently claimed stock option tax \n     deductions totaling almost $600 million. At the same time, \n     Enron never reported this $600 million as an expense on its \n     financial statements--an expense which, had it been reported, \n     would have reduced Enron's income by one-third.\n       Enron was able to employ this stock option double standard, \n     because of accounting rules that allow stock option \n     compensation to be kept off a company's books. Right now, \n     many U.S. companies routinely give their executives large \n     numbers of stock options as part of their compensation. When \n     an executive exercises those options, the company can claim a \n     corresponding compensation expense on its tax return, while \n     at the same time employ accounting rules to omit reporting \n     any expense at all on its books. The company can tell Uncle \n     Sam one thing and its shareholders the opposite. That's just \n     what Enron did--it lowered its tax bill by claiming stock \n     option expenses on its tax returns, while overstating its \n     earnings by leaving stock option expenses off its financial \n     statements.\n       The stock option loophole Enron used makes no sense, but \n     when the Financial Accounting Standards Board--the board that \n     issues accounting standards--tried to change the rules ten \n     years ago, corporations and audit firms fought the Board \n     tooth and nail. They demanded that companies be allowed to \n     continue to keep stock option compensation off the books. In \n     the end, the best the Board could get was a footnote noting \n     the earning charge that should be taken on a company's books. \n     But that stock option footnote--like so many Enron \n     footnotes--doesn't tell the true financial story of a \n     company.\n       It's time to end the stock option double standard. The \n     Levin-McCain-Fitzgerald-Durbin bill would not legislate \n     accounting standards for stock options or directly require \n     companies to expense stock option pay, but it would require \n     companies to treat stock options on their tax returns the \n     exact same way they treat them on their financial statements. \n     In other words, a company's stock option tax deduction would \n     have to mirror the stock option expense shown on the \n     company's books. If there is no stock option expense on the \n     company books, there can be no expense on the company tax \n     return. If a company declares a stock option expense on its \n     books, then the company can deduct exactly the same amount in \n     the same year on its tax return. The bill would require \n     companies to tell Uncle Sam and their stockholders the same \n     thing--whether employee stock options are an expense and, if \n     so, how much of an expense against company earnings. Enron \n     has already shown how much damage, if not corrected, that the \n     existing stock option double standard can inflict on company \n     bookkeeping, investor confidence, and tax fairness.\n       The bill cosponsors are Senators Levin, McCain, Fizgerald \n     and Durbin, and the bill is expected to be referred to the \n     Senate Committee on Finance.\n\n  Section-by-Section Analysis of Ending the Double Standard for Stock \n                              Options Act\n\n       Section 1. Short Title. The short title of the bill is \n     ``Ending the Double Standard for Stock Options Act.''\n       Section 2. Stock Option Deductions and Tax Credits. This \n     section of the bill would amend two Internal Revenue Code \n     sections to address stock options compensation. The first tax \n     code section, 26 U.S.C. 83(h), addresses employer deductions \n     for employee wages paid for by a stock option transfer. The \n     second tax code section, 26 U.S.C. 41(b)(2)(D), addresses \n     employer tax credits for research expenses, including \n     employee wages.\n       Subsection (a) of this section of the bill would add a new \n     paragraph (2) to the end of 26 U.S.C. 83(h) that would \n     restrict the compensation deduction that a company could \n     claim for the exercise of a stock option by limiting the \n     stock option deduction to the amount that the company has \n     claimed as an expense on its financial statement. This \n     section would also make it clear that the deduction may not \n     be taken prior to the year in which the employee declares the \n     stock option income. In addition, a new subparagraph (2)(B) \n     would require the Treasury Secretary to promulgate rules to \n     apply the new restriction to cases where a parent corporation \n     might issue stock options to the employees of a subsidiary \n     corporation or vice versa.\n       Subsection (b) of this section of the bill would add a new \n     clause (iv) to the end of 26 U.S.C. 41(b)(2)(D). This new \n     clause would restrict the research tax credit that a company \n     could claim for employee wages paid for by the transfer of \n     property in connection with a stock option by saying that the \n     amount of the credit shall not exceed the amount of the \n     corresponding stock option deduction allowed under 26 U.S.C. \n     83(h).\n       The purpose of both new statutory provisions is to ensure \n     that any stock option deduction or credit claimed on a \n     taxpayer's return will mirror, and not exceed, the \n     corresponding stock option expense shown on the taxpayer's \n     financial statement. If no stock option expense is shown on \n     the taxpayer's financial records, there can be no expense \n     taken as a deduction or credit on the taxpayer's return. If a \n     taxpayer declares a stock option expense on its financial \n     statement, then the taxpayer is permitted to claim a \n     corresponding deduction or credit on its return in the same \n     taxable year for exactly the same amount of expense.\n       Subsection (c) of the bill provides that the amendments \n     made by the Act apply only to wages and property transferred \n     on or after the date of enactment of the Act.\n                                  ____\n\n     To: Steve M.

Lay is asking Causey if this is something that \n     they should do.\n       While I believe Rick is inclined to do this given Enron's \n     desire to increase their exposure and influence in rulemaking \n     broadly, he is interested in knowing whether these type of \n     commitments will add any formal or informal access to this \n     process (i.e., would these type commitments present \n     opportunities to meet with the Trustees of these groups or \n     other benefits). I think any information along this front or \n     further information on the current strategic importance of \n     supporting these groups for the good of consistent rulemaking \n     would help Enron with its decision to be supportive.\n       Could any of you guys help me out with more information or \n     point me to someone who could? Thanks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From USA Today, Feb. 8, 2002]\n\n              Enron's Fall Fuels Push for Stock Option Law\n\n                      (Matt Krantz and Del Jones)\n\n       The Enron implosion has breathed life into legislation that \n     business leaders thought they had killed in the mid-1990s.\n       In a highly controversial move, at least three senators \n     want to end the legal tax deductions companies take for stock \n     options they issue to executives and workers unless they \n     subtract the same expense from their earnings.\n       As it is, almost every company takes a tax deduction for \n     options, but ignores them when it comes to reporting their \n     profits. Among the S 500, only Boeing and Winn-Dixie follow \n     the advice of the Financial Accounting Standards Board in \n     recording the cost of options on both ledgers, says David \n     Zion, analyst with Bear Stearns. The rest are like Enron, \n     which took a $625 million tax deduction for options from 1996 \n     to 2000, yet legally included the $625 million on its \n     earnings.\n       If stock options were treated as an expense, the earnings \n     reported by firms in the S 500 would have been 9% lower in \n     2000, Zion says. Technology companies, more likely to use \n     options for rank-and-file compensation, would be harder hit. \n     Fourteen companies, including Yahoo and Citrix Systems, would \n     have posted losses in 2000, rather than gains. Microsoft and \n     Cisco take large tax deductions for options.\n       Options are contracts that allow the purchase of stock, \n     usually within five years, at today's price. If the stock \n     rises, the stock can be bought at a discount.\n       Conventional wisdom has long held that options align the \n     goals of executives and workers with those of the \n     shareholders. Enron has given pause to that thinking because \n     its executives artificially boosted the stock price at the \n     risk of shareholders.\n       Outright frauds is rare, but at least a half-dozen academic \n     studies have concluded that\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\n     companies time the release of good or bad news near the date \n     that executives are issued their options, orchestrating a \n     potential windfall.\n       Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., John McCain, R-Ariz., and Peter \n     Fitzgerald, R-Ill., are dusting off the tax-deduction \n     proposal that was defeated by a vote of 88-9 in 1994. At the \n     time, Home Depot founder and CEO Bernard Marcus said he had \n     ``never been more strongly opposed to anything.''\n       Citigroup CEO Sanford Weill was quick out of the chute \n     Thursday, warning on CNBC's Squawk Box not to get into an \n     Enron frenzy and hurry through bad legislation.\n       But Matt Ward, CEO of WestWard Pay Strategies, an options \n     consulting firm in San Francisco, says he fears the \n     legislation stands a better chance of passing this time \n     because of what he calls the ``Enron thieves'' and because \n     technology companies have been weakened by the economy and \n     don't have the resources or energy to influence Washington.\n       Ward says a law change would result only in rank-and-file \n     employees losing their stock options. CEOs would continue to \n     get theirs, he says.\n       ``Noises are coming from Washington because some oil \n     company guys have been greedy,'' Ward says.\n       David Yermack, associate professor of finance at New York \n     University's Stern School of Business, says he doubts if \n     stock options could have pushed Enron executives into hiding \n     millions of dollars of losses in off-book partnerships. That \n     said, there is no reason options should not count against \n     earnings jut as cash compensation does.\n       ``If Enron has made them reconsider this horrible position, \n     there is silver lining to this debacle,'' Yermack says.\n       More than 80% of financial analysts and portfolio managers \n     agree with Yermack, according to a survey by the Association \n     for Investment Management and Research.\n       ``I'm dissatisfied with using fuzzy numbers in doing \n     accounting,'' says Dick Wagner, president of the Strategic \n     Compensation Research Associates.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 3, 2002]\n\n              Even Last Year, Option Spigot Was Wide Open\n\n                          (By Stephanie Strom)\n\n       Surprise, surprise. Early reports suggest that top \n     executives across America got a bigger dollop of stock \n     options last year as part of their pay.\n       As corporate earnings and cash flow have ebbed and stock \n     prices have fallen, boards have been doling out options as a \n     cheap, balance-sheet-friendly way of compensating mangers. \n     The annual proxy season, when companies reveal compensation, \n     is just starting. If the disclosures show the trend toward \n     larger option grants holding after a year that most companies \n     would lie to forget, it would seem to make a mockery of the \n     concept of pay for performance. That was the reason options \n     grew so popular in the first place. Yet while some companies \n     are trying to make options better reflect their fortunes, \n     most other simply contend that options are primarily a \n     motivational tool and have never been a reward for \n     performance.\n       With stock prices stalled, options may not seem attractive \n     now. But executives who receive them can usually count on \n     rich rewards eventually, even if a company does only \n     marginally better. The increase in options, however imposes \n     additional costs on shareholders; the more options granted, \n     the lower the return for investors, since their holdings are, \n     one way or the other, diluted.\n       But the options keep coming. Chief executives who received \n     more of them last year, even as their companies suffered, \n     include Daniel A. Carp of Eastman Kodak, John T. Chambers of \n     Cisco Systems, Scott G. McNealy of Sun Microsystems and \n     Harvey R. Blau of Aeroflex\n       And Henry B. Schacht, returning to the helm of troubled \n     Lucent, received annual options grants almost five times the \n     size of those his predecessor received--and more than 17 \n     times the size of the last grant he received the year he \n     retired. ``Fiscal 2001 was rather challenging for Lucent, so \n     the grants were made to ensure Henry had management stability \n     through the turnaround,'' said Mary Lou Ambrus, a Lucent \n     spokeswoman, in explanation.\n       Changes are, many chief executives received bigger options \n     awards, as proxy statements, filed each March and April by \n     most companies, are expected to show, experts say. Some were \n     no doubt issued to make up for previous grants that had been \n     rendered worthless by tumbling stock prices.\n       At the same time, the market's recovery has revived hopes \n     that old option grants will not be worthless. ``Options \n     typically run for 10 years, and already many of the ones \n     issued in the last year are back in the money,'' said John N. \n     Lauer, chief executive of Oglebay Norton, a shipping company. \n     ``If the economy recovers, those issued in previous years \n     will also regain value.''\n       Mr. Lauer has gained notoriety in corporate circles for his \n     insistence on being paid entirely in options priced well \n     above Oglebay's stock price. Though Oglebay's performance \n     has improved somewhat, options he received five years ago \n     are still worth nothing.\n       ``In a social setting where I'm in a room with other \n     C.E.O.'s, someone will teasingly suggest that they pass the \n     hat for me because I'm not making any money,'' he said. ``I \n     think they figure I'm loony or something.''\n       Mr. Lauer is not the only executive to have high \n     performance goals, but it is safe to say that most executives \n     keep drawing large salaries, plus more and more options. \n     According to a survey done in the third quarter of last year \n     by Pearl Meyer & Partners, a human resources consulting firm \n     in New York, the number of options granted by 50 major \n     companies that will report their 2001 compensation this \n     spring was up an average of 12 percent from 2000.\n       Consultants expect that trend to continue as companies \n     report 2001 compensation practices this spring. ``It's a \n     great time to give options,'' said Pearl Meyer, president of \n     the firm. ``They're cheap because they involve no charge to \n     earnings, and that's important at a time when profits are \n     down and boards are trying to make up for the fact that \n     salaries and bonuses are both down.''\n       But Ms. Meyer and many others in the field--as well as, \n     they say, the members of corporate compensation committees--\n     are not happy to see the increase in options grants. Their \n     expressions of concern are striking because of compensation \n     consultants have been among the biggest champions of the use \n     of options as performance incentives.\n       The consultants are worried, in part, about the option \n     ``overhang''--options outstanding, plus those shares that \n     investors have authorized but that have yet to be granted. \n     More fundamentally, they suggest that the links between a \n     manager's pay and a company's performance--as measured by, \n     say, profitability, market-share growth and smart acquisition \n     strageties--have become more tenuous.\n       Ms. Meyer suggests that the at-risk components of executive \n     pay be viewed as the legs of a stool; the legs reflecting \n     stock performance has grown longer and longer, while those \n     reflecting business and financial performance have become \n     shorter.\n       ``We have overdosed on options and the stock market,'' she \n     said. ``We're dependent on the stock market for executive \n     compensation, pension payments, directors' compensation, \n     401(k) plans--our whole economy, practically, is dependent on \n     the market's performance.''\n       That reliance has produced an overhang that dangles like a \n     sword of Damocles over investors. Eventually, their stakes \n     will be diluted--either when companies issue vast quantities \n     of new shares to make good on options grants, or when they \n     undertake share-repurchase programs that eat up cash they \n     might use for operations.\n       According to a study by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a human \n     resource consulting company, the average options overhang of \n     the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was \n     14.6 percent of outstanding shares in 2000, up from 13 \n     percent a year earlier.\n       This spring's numbers will probably show another rise. The \n     overhang ``is definitely going to be up'' by a percentage \n     point or more in 2001, said Ira T. Kay, a consultant at \n     Watson Wyatt Worldwide, ``because people aren't exercising \n     their options the way they were when the stock market was \n     booming.''\n       Mr. Kay predicted that the slowdown in the exercising of \n     options would work to curb the issuing of new ones this year \n     and next, although he anticipates a slow increase over the \n     long term. ``I've been in meetings of five boards that were \n     very reluctant to go to shareholders to ask for more shares \n     to underwrite options grants,'' he said, ``They don't \n     think they can justify it.''\n       Companies are losing out on another salutary benefit of \n     options compensation as well--their ability to reduce \n     corporate taxes. Employers get a deduction when employees \n     exercise options, but as Mr. Kay and other compensation \n     consultants note, these days few are cashing them in.\n       Oddly, shareholder advocates and institutional investors, \n     who stand to lose the most from an option glut, seem sanguine \n     thus far. Some note that while option awards have increased, \n     the value of the awards has collapsed. Pearl Meyer's research \n     shows that the value of option grants fell 7 percent in the \n     first eight months of 2001 after rising steadily for several \n     years.\n       Some shareholder advocates say that will also help curb \n     future grants, as long as stocks are sluggish.\n       ``We've had a 20 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's \n     index,'' said Patrick S. McGurn, of Institutional Shareholder \n     Services, a consulting business in Rockville, MD. ``And the \n     standard valuation method for options would tell that you'd \n     have to double or triple grants just to get to the level \n     where you were the previous year. Most boards are going to \n     balk at those numbers, particularly when corporate \n     performance has been so poor.''\n       But that may be wishful thinking. Last year, Eastman Kodak \n     took $659 million in restructing charges that, combined with \n     falling sales and market share, pushed its earning down 95 \n     percent. In November it awarded its chief executive, Mr. \n     Carp, options for 250,000 shares at an exercise price of \n     $29.31, Kodak's stock price at the time. All Mr. Carp must do \n     to gain is keep Kodak's stock level.\n       That grant came on top of the 100,000 options he received \n     in January 2001 at a strike price of $40.97. So Mr. Carp \n     received three and a half times as many options in 2001 as he \n     did in 2000--at markedly lower strike prices. Sandra R. Feil, \n     director for worldwide total compensation at Kodak, said Mr. \n     Carp received two awards last year because the company had \n     changed the time of its grants, to November from January.\n       As for the increase, Ms. Feil said Kodak had worked with \n     Frederic W. Cook & Company, a compensation consultant, which\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\n     found that Mr. Carp was in the lowest 25 percent of \n     executives receiving options. ``What we've done,'' she said, \n     ``is taken a step, and even a conservative step at that, in \n     getting him out of the lowest quartile.''\n       But what about Kodak's dismal performance last year? ``We \n     look at stock options as a long-term incentive that's \n     forward-looking,'' Ms. Feil said. ``We don't look at them as \n     a reward for past performance.\n       To understand just how easy it is to get richer and richer \n     on options, consider the case of Lawrence J. Ellison, \n     chairman, chief executive and co-founder of the Oracle \n     Compensation, the software maker. In January, with Oracle's \n     stock trading just above $30, near its yearly high of $34, \n     Ellison exercised option grants for about 23 million shares \n     at an average price of 23 cents, for a paper profit of more \n     than $700 million.\n       It was the biggest options bonanza on record--and Mr. \n     Ellison holds options to buy an additional 47.9 million \n     shares. ``He could end up taking $3 billion out of the \n     company,'' said Judith Fischer, managing director of \n     Executive Compensation Advisory Services, a consulting firm.\n       Investors are often forgiving of founders like Mr. Ellison, \n     many of whom staked personal assets and invested buckets of \n     sweat equity to get companies off the ground. His paper \n     profit has shrunk to $378 million as Oracle's stock has \n     sagged.\n       But investors were still piqued by Mr. Ellison's timing. He \n     exercised his options a month before Oracle issued an \n     earnings warning. The options expired on Aug. 1; he was under \n     no pressure to sell them in January.\n       To protect shareholders from dilutions from options, Oracle \n     routinely buys shares in the market. Other big corporate \n     users of options, like Microsoft and Dell Computer, do, too, \n     contending that it not only protects shareholders, but offers \n     them tax advantages.\n       But repurchase programs can also have a huge impact on a \n     company's cash flow. Oracle started the fiscal year that \n     began June 1, 2000, with $7.4 billion in cash, then spent \n     $4.3 billion to repurchase shares largely for use in its \n     options program.\n       At the end of the fiscal year, the company's overhang stood \n     at 28 percent of total outstanding shares. Microsoft has a \n     similarly large overhang, but it also has more cash.\n       For years, shareholders have pushed companies to make chief \n     executives earn their keep, and they initially applauded the \n     use of options to accomplish that goal. But companies found \n     ways to make sure the options were worth something regardless \n     of performance, by repricing worthless options or replacing \n     them with fistfulls of new ones.\n       The outcry over those practices, however, may be pushing \n     some companies to make changes.\n       In the spring of 1999, the Longview Collective Investment \n     Fund, which manages some A.F.L.-C.I.O. pension money, \n     submitted a shareholder proposal to the Chubb Corporation, \n     the insurer, asking it to grant options that would more \n     closely align compensation with performance.\n       The proposal was defeated. But when Beth W. Young, an \n     independent consultant who advises the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and \n     other pension fund managers, called Chubb the next spring to \n     resubmit the proposal, she was told that Chubb had already \n     incorporated into its incentive plan options that could be \n     exercised only if the stock price rose significantly.\n       Roughly half the options handed out to Chubb's senior \n     management in 2000 and 2001 have an exercise price 25 percent \n     higher than the stock price on the day they wre granted. But \n     only 2 percent to 4 percent of large companies use such \n     ``premium priced'' options, consultants say.\n       ``The executives who were granted these options will, at \n     least in theory, have a much stronger incentive to take steps \n     to increase the stock price,'' said Donald B. Lawson, the \n     Chubb senior vice president who manages compensation and \n     benefits.\n       Chubb also uses ``performance shares,'' which can typically \n     be redeemed only after three years and only if the company \n     clears specific hurdles. In 2000, for example, the \n     performance shares it handed out in 1998 were worthless \n     because the company did not hit those targets.\n       For Dean R. O'Hare, Chubb's chief executive, that meant his \n     total compensation fell by $448,508 from the previous year. \n     he did get more options, but those largely replaced \n     restricted shares--those that cannot be sold right away--\n     after the company decided not to use them to reward \n     executives, Mr. Lawson said.\n       Performance shares held by C. Michael Armstrong, the chief \n     executive of AT, have proved to be worthless for three \n     years as the company has fallen short of the board's goals \n     for increases in total return to shareholders.\n       An options award for 419,200 shares granted to Mr. \n     Armstrong at the end of 2000 was also tied to better \n     performance. The options can be exercised only if AT \n     produces a $145 billion pretax gain for shareholders in the \n     year that started March 31. On the other hand, another twist \n     on options accelerates the vesting period if a company's \n     shares reach a certain target. In 2000, the Williams \n     Companies granted options with the condition that if, on \n     certain days, the stock traded at 1.4 times the price at the \n     beginning of the year, the options could be exercised \n     immediately rather than over three years.\n       Other companies are working to get more plain-vanilla \n     stock, not options, into executives' hands--stock they must \n     buy. When Beazer Homes USA, a home builder, went public in \n     1994, it adopted a management stock purchase program to \n     increase managers' stakes. At the beginning of each year, \n     some 80 executives can choose to give up a percentage of \n     their bonuses to buy stock at a 20 percent discount on the \n     year-end closing price. The stock cannot be sold for three \n     years.\n       Executives now own roughly 8 percent of the company, said \n     David S. Weiss, Beazer's chief financial officer. ``We think \n     it's a good idea to have them put real money at risk, as \n     opposed to just receiving a reward,'' he said. ``Options feel \n     like a gift from the company that the market, through its \n     whims, will reward or not. Shares reflect the company's \n     performance, whether good or bad.''\n       Mr. Kay, at Watson Wyatt, said such pure stock subsidies \n     were gaining popularity. More companies, he said, plan to use \n     contingent options like those at Chubb and AT, which try to \n     reflect financial and business performance.\n       Investors expect the BellSouth Corporation and the Eaton \n     Corporation, for example, to disclose such adjustments in \n     their new proxy statements. A spokesman for Eaton said he was \n     unaware of such a move, and a spokesman for BellSouth \n     declined to comment until the proxy is released in March.\n       But other boards are already finding ways to limit the \n     risks that performance shares, premium-priced options, \n     performance-accelerated options and other performance-linked \n     tools pose.\n       Until last April, Archie W. Dunham, chief executive of \n     Conoco, had options giving him the right to buy 700,000 \n     shares. But he could exercise them only if Conoco's shares \n     traded about $35 on each of the five days before Aug. 17 of \n     this year.\n       Before Conoco bought Gulf Canada Resources in July, \n     however, its board granted a two-year extension to Mr. Dunham \n     and at least six other executives holding those options. \n     ``The board thought the climate was right this year for some \n     kind of an acquisition but that it could have an adverse \n     effect on the stock price,'' John McLemore, a Conoco \n     spokesman, said. ``They thought it wouldn't be really fair \n     for those people who held these options to be punished for \n     something that might make it harder for them to meet the \n     conditions.''\n       That means the board rewarded Mr. Dunham and his colleagues \n     for an acquisition that it knew was likely to hurt Conoco's \n     shares, at least temporarily--a courtesy not extended to \n     shareholders.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 30, 2002]\n\n                          Stock Option Madness\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       As the Enron scandal broadens, we may miss the forest for \n     the trees. The multiplying investigations have created a \n     massive whodunit. Who destroyed documents? Who misled \n     investors? Who twisted or broke accounting rules? The answers \n     may explain what happened at Enron but necessarily why. We \n     need to search for deeper causes, beginning with stock \n     options. Here's a good idea gone bad--stock options foster a \n     corrosive climate that tempts many executives, and not just \n     those at Enron, to play fast and loose when reporting \n     profits.\n       As everyone knows, stock options exploded in the lasted \n     1980s and the 1990s. The theory was simple. If you made top \n     executives and managers into owners, they would act in \n     shareholders' interests. Executives' pay packages became \n     increasingly skewed toward options. In 2000, the typical \n     chief executive officer of one of the country's 350 major \n     companies earned about $5.2 million, with almost half of that \n     reflecting stock options, according to William M. Mercer \n     Inc., a consulting firm. About half of those companies also \n     had stock-option programs for at least half their employees. \n     Up to a point, the theory worked. Twenty years ago, America's \n     corporate managers were widely criticized. Japanese and \n     German companies seemed on a roll. By contrast, their \n     American rivals seemed stodgy, complacent and bureaucratic. \n     Stock options, were one tool in a managerial upheaval that \n     refocused attention away from corporate empire-building and \n     toward improved profitability and efficiency.\n       All this contributed to the 1990s' economic revival. By \n     holding down costs, companies restrained inflation. By \n     aggressively promoting new products and technologies, \n     companies boosted production and employment. But slowly, \n     stock options became corrupted by carelessness, overuse and \n     greed. As more executives developed big personal stakes in \n     options, the task of keeping the stock price rising became \n     separate from improving the business and its profitability. \n     This is what seems to have happened at Enron.\n       The company adored stock options. About 60 percent of \n     employees received an annual award of options, equal to 5 \n     percent of their base salary. Executives and top managers got \n     more. At year-end 2000, all Enron managers and workers had \n     options, that could be exercised for nearly 47 million \n     shares. Under a typical plan, a recipient gets an options to \n     buy a given number of shares at the market price on the day \n     the option is issued. This is called ``the strike price.'' \n     But the option usually cannot be exercised for a few years. \n     If the stock's price rises in that time, the option can yield \n     a tidy profit. The lucky recipient buys at the strike price \n     and sells at the market price. On the 47 million Enron \n     options, the average ``strike price was about\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\n     $30 and at the end of 2000, the market price was $83. The \n     potential profit was nearly $2.5 billion.\n       Given the huge reward, it would have been astonishing if \n     Enron's managers had not become obsessed with the company's \n     stock price and--to the extent possible--tried to influence \n     it. And while Enron's stock soared, why would anyone complain \n     about accounting shenanigans? Whatever the resulting abuses, \n     the pressures are not unique to Enron. It takes a naive view \n     of human nature to think that many executives won't strive to \n     maximize their personal wealth.\n       This is an invitation to abuse. To influence stock prices, \n     executives can issue optimistic profit projections. They can \n     delay some spending, such as research and development (this \n     temporarily helps profits). They can engage in stock buybacks \n     (these raise per-share earnings, because fewer shares are \n     outstanding). And, of course, they can exploit accounting \n     rules. Even temporary blips in stock prices can create \n     opportunities to unload profitable options.\n       The point is that the growth of stock options has created \n     huge conflicts of interest that executives will be hard-\n     pressed to avoid. Indeed, many executives will coax as many \n     options as possible from their compensation committees, \n     typically composed of ``outside'' directors. But because \n     `'directors are [manipulated] by management, sympathetic to \n     them, or simply ineffectual,'' the amounts may well be \n     excessive, argue Harvard law professors Lucian Arye Bebchuk \n     and Jesse Fried and attorney David Walker in a recent study.\n       Stock options are not evil, but unless we curb the present \n     madness, we are courting continual trouble. Here are three \n     ways to check the overuse of options:\n       (1) Change the accounting--count options as a cost. \n     Amazingly, when companies issue stock options, they do not \n     have to make a deduction to profits. This encourages \n     companies to create new options. By one common accounting \n     technique, Enron's options would have required deductions of \n     almost $2.4 billion from 1998 through 2000. That would have \n     virtually eliminated the company's profits.\n       (2) Index stock options to the market. If a company's \n     shares rise in tandem with the overall stock market, the \n     gains don't reflect any management contribution--and yet, \n     most options still increase in value. Executives get a \n     windfall. Options should reward only for gains above the \n     market.\n       (3) Don't reprice options if the stock falls. Some \n     corporate boards of directors issue new options at lower \n     prices if the company's stock falls. What's the point? \n     Options are supposed to prod executives to improve the \n     company's profits and stock price. Why protect them if they \n     fail?\n       Within limits, stock options represent a useful reward for \n     management. But we lost those limits, and options became a \n     kind of free money sprinkled about by uncritical corporate \n     directors. The unintended result was a morally lax, get-rich-\n     quick mentality. Unless companies restore limits--prodded, if \n     need be, by new government regulations--one large lesson of \n     the Enron scandal will have been lost.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 27, 2002]\n\n   Economic View; Enron's Way: Pay Packages Foster Spin, Not Results\n\n                          (By David Leonhardt)\n\n       As the stock plummeted, investors and employees alike were \n     left with big losses. But one group of shareholders came out \n     ahead--management. Many board members and top executives \n     managed to sell millions of dollars of shares before the big \n     fall and still have something to show for the stock's once-\n     lofty price.\n       This is the story of Enron, of course, but it hardly ends \n     there. Over the last two years, as the stock market has \n     fallen about 30 percent from its peak, the description fits \n     dozens of other companies as well. For example, Roger G. \n     Ackerman, the former chairman of Corning, sold $14 million of \n     the company's stock last year, mostly when it was trading at \n     about $57 a share, or seven times its current price. Donald \n     R. Scifres, the co-chairman of JDS Uniphase, made $23 million \n     selling company shares last year; the stock has lost nearly \n     90 percent of its value since January 2001. David R. Alvarez \n     sold $14 million worth of stock in Providian Financial, where \n     he is vice chairman, last year before the company \n     acknowledged that its balance sheet wasn't quite what it was \n     cracked up to be. The stock, which traded at $60 a share last \n     summer, now trades at around $4.\n       Some of the biggest paydays have come at obscure companies \n     that were once market darlings, John J. Moores, better known \n     as the owner of the San Diego Padres baseball team, made $101 \n     million last year selling shares of Peregrine Systems, on \n     whose board he serves, before its shares fell by more than \n     two-thirds. Richard Aube, a director at Capstone Turbine, \n     made $51 million selling its stock last year, according to \n     Thomson Financial. If you bought when we sold at around $30 a \n     share, your investment would be showing an 80 percent loss \n     now.\n       The contrast is obviously cringe-inducing. But it is more \n     than that. Even when executives simply fail to live up to \n     their own predictions--rather than break the law, as some \n     people suspect that Enron managers did--the big insider \n     paydays offer a good lesson in how economic incentives are \n     askew in corporate America.\n       Corporate spin aside, executives do not always prosper most \n     by making their companies great. They can often profit more \n     from creating unrealistic expectations than from delivering \n     consistently impressive results.\n       Consider two companies. One has a stock price that has \n     appreciated slowly, starting at $20 five years ago and \n     gaining $2 a year, to $30 today. The second company's stock \n     also started at $20 five years ago, then zoomed to $100 after \n     a few years but has since fallen back to $20.\n       By any reasonable measure, the leaders of the first company \n     have done a better job. Their share price has grown 50 \n     percent, and they have avoided making gradiose predictions \n     that cause Wall Street analysts to set silly targets. The \n     second company has a stock that has underperformed a \n     savings account over the long run, and scores of workers \n     and investors have been burned by false hopes.\n       Yet if the top executives of both companies had received \n     similar amounts of stock and both sold their shares on a \n     regular schedule, the executives of the second company would \n     actually be ahead. They would have made so much money selling \n     the stock when it was trading near $100 that they would be \n     multimillionaires despite the humbling decline.\n       This is the Enron model of pay for performance, and it has \n     become common. Executives receive enormous grants of stock or \n     options, saying they are simply aligning their own interests \n     with those of their shareholders. But the packages are so \n     generous that even a temporary rise in the share price, \n     accompanied by the sale of a portion of an executive's stock, \n     can leave him set for life. The appeal of overly aggressive \n     accounting methods and manipulated earnings becomes obvious.\n       ``You're providing C.E.O.'s with a perverse incentive,'' \n     said Nell Minow, the editor of the Corporate Library, a \n     research firm in Washington. ``You're rewarding them for a \n     goal that is not in the interest of long-term shareholders.''\n       The executives who have made millions of dollars selling \n     once-expensive shares say they have done nothing wrong. They \n     simply followed a regular, legal schedule of selling stock, \n     they say, and would be far richer if the stock price had not \n     dropped.\n       All of that is usually true. But it is also true that when \n     an economic system richly rewards certain behavior, no one \n     should be surprised when that behavior becomes the norm. If \n     you want to change it, you have to change the incentives. The \n     Enron mess has the potential to focus people's attention on \n     the complicated task of doing precisely that.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From AIMR Exchange, Jan.-Feb. 2002]\n\nEmployee Stock Options Should Be Expensed on Income Statements, Survey \n                                 Shows\n\n       In September 2001, AIMR surveyed more than 18,000 members \n     to gauge their responses to a proposed agenda topic of the \n     International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that could \n     require companies to report the fair value of stock options \n     granted--including those to employees--as an expense on the \n     income statement, reducing earnings.

Total response: Yes, 83%; no, 17%.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenators Levin, Fitzgerald, and Durbin, entitled Ending the Double \nStandard for Stock Options Act. This legislation requires companies to \ntreat stock options for employees as an expense for bookkeeping \npurposes if they want to claim this expense as a deduction for tax \npurposes. We introduced similar legislation in 1997 during the 105h \nCongress but unfortunately, the special interest with a vested stake in \nthe status quo prevented this legislation from seeing the light of day.\n  Currently, corporations can hide these multimillion-dollar \ncompensation plans from their stockholders or other investors because \nthese plans are not counted as an expense when calculating company \nearnings. Even the Federal Accounting Standards Board, FASB, recognized \nthat stock options\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\nshould be treated as an expense for accounting purposes. Accounting \ndisclosure rules issued by FASB require that companies include in their \nannual reports a footnote disclosing what the company's net earnings \nwould have been if stock option plans were treated as an expense.\n  The latest scandals involving the collapse of Enron highlight the \nproblem of misleading annual statements and financial statements. \nAccording to a recent analysis, from 1996 to 2000, Enron issued nearly \n$600 million in stock options, collecting tax deductions which allowed \nthe corporation to severely reduce their payment in taxes. Whether or \nnot Enron took advantage of current disclosure rules to hide their \nfinancial problems remains a question. The fact remains that current \nrules allow companies such as Enron to discuss as little as possible. \nAnd this prevents investors, Wall Street analyst, corporate executives, \nand auditors from properly understanding the bottom line of \ncorporations.\n  One might reasonably ask how an arcane accounting rule could have \nsuch a large impact on the bottom line of corporations. The answer lies \nin the growth and value of stock options as a means of executive \ncompensation.\n  We have heard the reports of executives making multimillion-dollar \nsalaries, while average worker salaries stagnate or fall. According to \none recent report, almost half of the earnings of the typical chief \nexecutive officer of a top company reflects stock options. Why \nshouldn't the value of this compensation package be included in \ncalculating a company's earnings? How can stockowners evaluate the true \nvalue of employee compensation if the value is just buried in a \nfootnote somewhere the annual report?\n  No other type of compensation gets treated as an expense for tax \npurposes, without also being treated as an expense on the company \nbooks. This double standard is exactly the kind of inequitable \ncorporate benefit that makes the American people irate and must be \neliminated. If companies do not want to fully disclose on their books \nhow much they are compensating their employees, then they should not be \nable to claim a tax benefit for it.\n  This legislation does not require a particular accounting treatment; \nthe accounting decision is left to the company. This legislation simply \nrequires companies to treat stock options the same way for both \naccounting and tax purposes.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation that will end the double standard for stock option \ncompensation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1941. A bill to authorize the President to establish military \ntribunals to try the terrorists responsible for the September 11, 2001 \nattacks against the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on November 13, 2001, President Bush signed \na military order authorizing the use of military commissions to try \nsuspected terrorists. This order stimulated an important national \ndebate and led to a series of Judiciary Committee hearings with the \nAttorney General and others to discuss the many legal, constitutional, \nand policy questions raised by the use of such tribunals. Our hearings, \nand the continued public discourse, helped to clarify the scope of the \nPresident's order and better define the terms of the debate.\n  For example, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on November 28, \n2001, at which several legal experts challenged the validity of the \nmilitary order. Philip Heymann of Harvard Law School, a former Deputy \nAttorney General, testified that the order was so broad that it \namounted to a dangerous claim of executive power. In his view, the \norder improperly bypassed congressional review, undermined confidence \nin our civil justice system, and jeopardized relationships with our \nallies abroad. Retired Air Force Colonel Scott Silliman who is now at \nDuke Law School, questioned the President's authority to use military \ncommissions with respect to the September 11 attacks absent authorizing \nlegislation by Congress. Professor Silliman also echoed the comments of \nProfessor Heymann, arguing that tribunals convened under the order \ncould adversely impact our international credibility as a Nation under \nthe rule of law.\n  On December 4, 2001, Senator Schumer chaired another important \nhearing on the issue of military commissions. Harvard Law Professor \nLaurence Tribe testified at that hearing that ``Congress alone can \navoid the constitutional infirmities that plague the Military Tribunal \nOrder of November 13.'' Professor Tribe argued for the establishment of \nprocedural guidelines to ensure the protection of defendants' due \nprocess rights, and called for Congress to set limits in consultation \nwith the President. He cautioned that if the Administration acted on \nits own--under authority that Professor Tribe believed was \nconstitutionally infirm, any convictions could later be overturned by \nthe courts, with the result that dangerous individuals could be set \nfree. By contrast, convictions obtained by military tribunals \nconstituted under the authority of the Congress and the President \nacting together would more likely be shielded from constitutional \nchallenge on appeal.\n  At the same December 4 hearing, Cass Sunstein of the University of \nChicago Law School testified that ``from the standpoint of both \nconstitutional law and democratic legitimacy, it is far better if the \nPresident and Congress act in concert,'' adding that ``the executive \nbranch stands on the firmest ground if it acts pursuant to clear \ncongressional authorization.'' Professor Sunstein suggested that \nCongress limit the scope of military tribunals by allowing the use of \nmilitary tribunals ``only on certain essential occasions.''\n  Finally, on December 6, the Judiciary Committee heard from Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft on military commissions and a number of other \nunilateral actions taken by the Administration last fall. I believe \nthat we had a constructive conversation that day, despite our \ndisagreements on substantive points. The Attorney General took issue \nwith anyone who dared question the thinking of the executive branch on \nsuch topics, charging them with ``fearmongering'' and aiding the \nterrorists. I would note, however, that several members of the \nCommittee, including some of my colleagues from the other side of the \naisle, suggested to the Attorney General that if military tribunals \nwere used, they should provide a number of basic due process \nguarantees. Suggestions like these, coming from both Republicans and \nDemocrats, are not intended to bait the Administration. Rather, \nconstructive criticism can be, should be and has been useful in \ndeveloping sound policy that can better protect Americans and American \nsoldiers, particularly when they are serving abroad.\n\n  The Attorney General testified at our hearing on December 6 that the \nPresident does not need the sanction of Congress to convene military \ncommission, but I disagree. Military tribunals may be appropriate under \ncertain circumstances, but only if they are backed by specific \ncongressional authorization. At a minimum, as the distinguished senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania stated on this floor on November 15, ``the \nexecutive will be immeasurably strengthened if the Congress backs the \nPresident,'' Clearly, our government is at its strongest when the \nexecutive and legislative branches of government act in concert.\n  We demonstrated this unified strength in negotiating the USA Patriot \nAct last fall. The Congress, the White House and the Department of \nJustice worked intensively for seven weeks to craft a bill that \nprovided law enforcement agencies with the tools they said were needed \nto fight terrorism while preserving American values and democratic \nprinciples.\n  In that same spirit, and with my friend, the senior Senator from \nIllinois, I am today introducing the Military Tribunal Authorization \nAct. This legislation would provide the executive branch with the \nspecific authorization it now lacks to use extraordinary tribunals to \ntry members of the al Qaeda terrorist network and those who cooperated \nwith them.\n  Specifically, this legislation authorizes the use of ``extraordinary \ntribunals'' for al Qaeda members, and for persons aiding and abetting \nal Qaeda in terrorist activities against the United States, who are \napprehended in, or fleeing from, Afghanistan. It also authorizes the \nuse of tribunals for those al Qaeda members and abettors who are \ncaptured in any other place where\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\nthere is armed conflict involving the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Like the November 13 order, the Military Tribunal Authorization Act \nexempts U.S. citizens from the jurisdiction of the tribunals, as well \nas those individuals determined to be prisoners of war under the Geneva \nConvention. The bill also exempts individuals arrested while present in \nthe United States, since our civilian court system is well-equipped to \nhandle such cases. These exemptions are consistent with the \nAdministration's treatment of Zacharias Moussaoui, the suspected 20th \nhijacker in the September 11 attacks, who is awaiting trial in Federal \ndistrict court. A second terrorist suspect, Richard Reid, the so-called \n``shoe bomber,'' is also being tried in Federal district court. In \nfact, one of the nine charges against Reid, ``attempted wrecking of a \nmass transportation vehicle,'' is a new anti-terrorism offense that was \ncreated by the USA Patriot Act. Finally, the Administration has decided \nto bring Federal criminal charges against John Walker Lindh, who \nallegedly took up arms against Americans to fight with al Qaeda and the \nTaliban in Afghanistan.\n\n  A significant question raised about the November 13 order is that it \nvests the President with plenary and unreviewable discretion to \ndetermine who is subject to trial by military tribunal. The President's \norder also implied that those who were arrested under its terms could \nbe held indefinitely. Detainees were to receive a ``full and fair \ntrial,'' but no explanation of the terms ``full'' and ``fair'' is \noffered. While the Administration has deferred providing any \nexplanation to the development of regulations by the Secretary of \nDefense, requests for an opportunity to review and be consulted about \nthe draft regulations have been denied. This leaves introduction of \nlegislation showing how military tribunals may be constituted to \ncomport with constitutional mandates and values as one of the few \navenues to inform the process in development of regulations.\n  The Military Tribunal Authorization act defines the jurisdiction and \nprocedure of tribunals in a way that ensures a ``full and fair'' trial \nfor anyone detained. Under the bill, the Secretary of Defense is \ncharged with elaborating on the procedures that the tribunals must \nfollow and publishing any draft regulations in the Federal Register.\n  First, the bill makes clear that tribunals may adjudicate violations \nof the law of war, including international laws of armed conflict and \ncrimes against humanity, targeted against U.S. persons. Wars have \nrules, as defined by the Geneva Conventions and other international \nagreements. These rules protect civilians from harm and define how \ncaptured soldiers must be treated Under the bill, individuals who \nviolated those rules by targeting innocent American civilians can face \ntrial in a military tribunal. In addition, individuals who committed \ncrimes against humanity, such as murder, torture, or other inhumane \nacts, may face charges in a tribunal.\n  Second, on the length of detention, the bill authorizes detention of \nindividuals subject to military tribunals for as long as the President \ncertifies that the United States is in armed conflict with al Qaeda or \nTaliban forces in Afghanistan or elsewhere, or that an investigation, \nprosecution or post-trial proceeding against the detainee is ongoing. \nThe certification must be made every six months.\n  Third, on the conditions of confinement, the bill requires that \ndetainees be ``treated humanely,'' which is consistent with the Body of \nPrinciples for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of \nDetention or Imprisonment, a resolution adopted by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly in 1988. this includes adequate food, water, shelter, \nclothing and medical treatment, hygienic conditions, the necessary \nmeans of personal hygiene, and the free exercise of religion. Detention \ndeterminations and the conditions of detention are subject to review by \nthe Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n  Fourth, the bill incorporates basic due process guarantees, including \nthe right to independent counsel. In imposing this requirement, I am \nnot suggesting that suspected terrorists deserve special treatment. \nRather, the bill follows well-established standards for indigent \ndefense. In the first of its ``Ten Commandments'' of public defense \nprograms, the Department of Justice calls for full independence of \ndefense counsel and judicial functions. The department's ``Ten \nCommandments'' also require that counsel's ability, training, and \nexperience must be matched to the complexity of the case. Providing \nindependent counsel and judicial review is critical to ensuring that \nany convictions are free from political influence. An independent \nprocess with experienced counsel will also safeguard against otherwise \nvalid convictions being overturned for violations of due process or \nincompetent counsel.\n\n  Under the terms of this bill, tribunals would be required to apply \nreasonable rules of evidence to ensure that material admitted at trial \nwas of probative value. Defendants would be presumed innocent until \nproven guilty, and proof of guilt must be established beyond a \nreasonable doubt. Defendants may not be compelled to testify against \nthemselves. Finally, defendants could appeal their convictions and \nsentences to a higher tribunal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed \nForces.\n  These procedures do not, as some have claimed, provide greater \nprotections to suspected terrorists than we offer our own soldiers. \nThese are, rather, the very basic guarantees provided under various \nsources of international law, including the Geneva Conventions, the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, and the Statute of the International \nCriminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, among others. Several of the \nprocedural protections are also drawn from the U.S. Rules of Courts-\nMartial and the Military Rules of Evidence. In addition, the trial \nprocedure statute of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which is \ncited in the President's military order, recommends that the President \napply to military commissions the principles of law and rules of \nevidence that are generally recognized by the federal district courts.\n  I submit for the record a list the international conventions that \nserve as sources for the eighteen procedural protections included in my \nbill. As the ABA resolution urges, in establishing military tribunals, \nwe should ``give full consideration to the impact . . . as precedents \nin . . . the use of international legal norms in shaping other nations' \nresponses to future acts of terrorism.'' Respecting those international \nlegal norms, will redound to the benefit of Americans.\n  It is important to note that last week the President reevaluated his \nposition on a related issue. He decided to apply the Geneva Conventions \nto Taliban captives. This decision sends a signal to the world that the \nUnited States respects the Geneva Conventions and expects them to be \napplied to American soldiers captured overseas. I commend Secretary \nPowell, who supported this application of the Geneva Conventions. I \nalso commend Secretary Rumsfeld, whose draft rules on military \ncommissions contained a number of important procedural protections. \nBoth Secretaries Powell and Rumsfeld have worked to bring the original \nmilitary order and subsequent decisions over detention within the \nframework of international law. I urge the Administration to follow \nthis example of flexibility and inclusiveness by working with Congress \nto establish tribunals that are authorized by statute and consistent \nwith international law.\n  Finally, the bill comes down squarely on the side of transparency in \ngovernment by providing that tribunal proceedings should be open and \npublic, and include public availability of the transcripts of the trial \nand the pronouncement of judgment. The only exceptions are for \ndemonstrable reasons of national security or the necessity to secure \nthe safety of observers, witnesses, tribunal judges, counsel or other \npersons.\n  In sum, the Military Tribunal Authorization Act establishes a legal \nframework for proceedings that are truly ``full and fair.'' The \nprovisions of this bill track very closely with recommendations arrived \nat independently by the American Bar Association and issued on February \n4, 2002. The ABA calls on the executive branch to provide due process \nguarantees similar to those used in courts-martial, including a number \nof rights included in this\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\nbill. It also urged the Administration to work with Congress in \ndefining the rules for military commissions.\n  Passage of authorizing legislation would ensure the constitutionality \nof military tribunals and protect any convictions they might yield, \nwhile at the same time showing the world that we will fight terrorists \nwithout sacrificing our principles. We can also show by example how we \nexpect our soldiers and nationals to be treated if they are swept into \nforeign courts or tribunals.\n  Our government is at its strongest when its executive and legislative \nbranches act in concert. I provided earlier drafts of this legislation \nto the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense, but received no \nresponse. With the introduction of this bill, I again invite the \nAdministration's cooperation and comment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the sectional \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1941\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Tribunal \n     Authorization Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The al Qaeda terrorist organization and its leaders \n     have committed unlawful attacks against the United States, \n     including the August 7, 1998 bombings of the United States \n     embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the \n     October 12, 2000 attack on the USS Cole and the September 11, \n     2001 attacks on the United States.\n       (2) The al Qaeda terrorist organization and its leaders \n     have threatened renewed attacks on the United States and have \n     threatened the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (3) In violation of the resolutions of the United Nations, \n     the Taliban of Afghanistan provided a safe haven to the al \n     Quaeda terrorist organization and its leaders and allowed the \n     territory of that country to be used as a base from which to \n     sponsor international terrorist operations.\n       (4) The United Nations Security Council, in Resolution \n     1267, declared in 1999 that the actions of the Taliban \n     constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n       (5) The United Nations Security Council, in Resolutions \n     1368 and 1373, declared in September 2001 that the September \n     11 attacks against the United States constitute a threat to \n     international peace and security.\n       (6) The United States is justified in exercising its right \n     of self-defense pursuant to international law and the United \n     Nations Charter.\n       (7) Congress authorized the President on September 18, \n     2001, to use all necessary and appropriate force against \n     those nations, organizations, or persons that he determines \n     to have planned, authorized, committed, or aided the \n     September 11 terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations \n     or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of \n     international terrorism against the United States, within the \n     meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution.\n       (8) The United States and its allies are engaged in armed \n     conflict with al Qaeda and the Taliban.\n       (9) Military trials of the terrorists may be appropriate to \n     protect the safety of the public and those involved in the \n     investigation and prosecution, to facilitate the use of \n     classified information as evidence without compromising \n     intelligence or military efforts, and otherwise to protect \n     national security interests.\n       (10) Military trials that provide basic procedural \n     guarantees of fairness, consistent with the international law \n     of armed conflict and the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights (opened for signature December 16, 1966), \n     would garner the support of the community of nations.\n       (11) Article I, section 8, of the Constitution provides \n     that the Congress, not the President, has the power to \n     ``constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court; . . . \n     define and punish . . . Offenses against the Law of Nations; \n     . . . make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water; . . . \n     make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \n     carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other \n     Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the \n     United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.''.\n       (12) Congressional authorization is necessary for the \n     establishment of extraordinary tribunals to adjudicate and \n     punish offenses arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks \n     against the United States and to provide a clear and \n     unambiguous legal foundation for such trials.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should seek \n     the cooperation of United States allies and other nations in \n     conducting the investigations and prosecutions, including \n     extraditions, of the persons who are responsible for the \n     September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, and use to \n     the fullest extent possible multilateral institutions and \n     mechanisms for carrying out such investigations and \n     prosecutions.\n\n     SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) September 11, 2001 attacks on the united states.--The \n     term ``September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States'' \n     means the attacks on the Pentagon in the metropolitan area of \n     Washington, District of Columbia, and the World Trade Center, \n     New York, New York, on September 11, 2001, and includes the \n     hijackings of American Airlines flights 77 and 11 and United \n     Airlines flights 175 and 93 on that date.\n       (2) United states person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' has the meaning given that term in section 101(i) of \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. \n     1801(i)).\n\n     SEC. 8. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.\n\n       The authority under this Act shall terminate at the end of \n     December 31, 2005.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Military Tribunal Authorization Act of 2002--Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Military Tribunal Authorization \n     Act of 2002.\n       Sec. 2. Findings. This section outlines twelve findings, \n     including that the al Qaeda terrorist organization and its \n     leaders committed unlawful acts against the United States on \n     September 11, 2001 and on prior occasions; the U.S. is \n     justified in exercising its right to self-defense under \n     international law and the U.N. Charter; the Congress \n     authorized the President to use all necessary force against \n     those who committed, aided or abetted the September 11 \n     attacks in order to prevent future attacks, within the \n     meaning of the War Powers Resolution; military trials may be \n     appropriate to protect public safety, to protect classified \n     information used as evidence, and to protect national \n     security interests; Article I, section 8 of the Constitution \n     provides that the Congress, not the President, has the power \n     to constitute tribunals and to define and punish offenses \n     against the law of nations; and congressional authority is \n     necessary to establish extraordinary tribunals to adjudicate \n     offenses arising from the September 11 attacks.\n       Sec 3. Establishment of Extraordinary Tribunals. The \n     President is authorized to establish tribunals to try non-\n     U.S. persons who are al Qaeda member (and persons aiding and \n     abetting al Qaeda in terrorist activities against the United \n     States); are apprehended in Afghanistan, apprehended fleeing \n     from Afghanistan, or apprehended in or fleeing from any other \n     place where there is armed conflict involving the U.S. Armed \n     Forces; and are not prisoners of war, as defined by the \n     Geneva Conventions. Tribunals may adjudicate violations of \n     the laws of war targeted against U.S. persons. The Secretary \n     of Defense is charged with promulgating rules of evidence and \n     procedure for the tribunals.\n       Sec. 4. Procedural Requirements. Rules for tribunals shall \n     require (1) an independent and impartial proceeding; (2) that \n     the accused be informed of the charges against him; (3) that \n     proceedings be conducted with simultaneous translation for \n     non-English speakers; (4) that the accused be shown the \n     evidence against him; (5) that the accused be present at \n     trial if he so chooses; (6) that the accused have the right \n     to be represented by counsel; (7) that the accused have the \n     right to respond to the evidence, and to obtain exculpatory \n     evidence from the prosecution; (8) that the accused have the \n     right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and to \n     offer witnesses; (9) an expeditious trial and disposition; \n     (10) that the rules of evidence admit only reliable \n     information of probative value; (11) that the accused be \n     afforded all necessary means of defense; (12) that \n     convictions be based only upon proof of individual \n     responsibility; (13) that a conviction may not be based on an \n     act, offense, or omission that was not an offense under law \n     when committed; (14) that the penalty for conviction not be \n     greater than it was when the offense was committed; (15) that \n     the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and \n     that proof of guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt; \n     (16) that the accused may not be compelled to confess guilt \n     or testify against himself; (17) that trials to be open and \n     public and include public access to transcripts and \n     pronouncement of judgment, with the exceptions described \n     below; and (18) that convicted persons be informed of \n     available remedies and appeals. The bill follows the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice in requiring a unanimous \n     vote for imposition of the death penalty.\n       Trial proceedings will generally be accessible to the \n     public with limited exceptions for demonstrable public safety \n     concerns. The bill allows for evidence to be kept secret from \n     the public where disclosure may compromise national security \n     or intelligence sources.\n       Convictions may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Armed Forces. Any decisions of that court regarding \n     proceedings of tribunals are subject to review by the U.S. \n     Supreme Court by writ of certiorari.\n       Sec. 5. Detention. This section authorizes detention of \n     individuals who are subject to a tribunal under section 3. In \n     order to detain an individual under the authority of this \n     section, the President must certify that the U.S. is in armed \n     conflict with al Qaeda or Taliban forces in Afghanistan or \n     elsewhere, or that an investigation, prosecution or post-\n     trial proceeding against the detainee is ongoing. This \n     certification must be made every 6 months.\n       Evidence that may establish that an accused is not subject \n     to detention under this section shall be disclosed to the \n     accused, except that a summary of such evidence will be \n     provided if the Attorney General certifies that disclosure \n     would cause certain identifiable harms. Detentions under this \n     section may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     D.C. Circuit.\n       This section also defines the conditions of detention, \n     requiring that detainees be treated humanely. Humane \n     treatment includes adequate food, water, shelter, clothing \n     and medical treatment, hygienic conditions, the necessary \n     means of personal hygiene, and the free exercise of religion. \n     Detention determinations and the conditions of detention are \n     subject to review by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit.\n       Sec. 6. Sense of the Congress. This section calls for the \n     President to seek the cooperation of U.S. allies and other \n     nations in the investigations and prosecutions of those \n     responsible for the September 11 attacks. It also calls for \n     the President to use multilateral institutions to the fullest \n     extent possible in carrying out such investigations and \n     prosecutions.\n       Sec. 7. Definitions. This section defines the terms, \n     ``September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S.,'' and ``U.S. \n     person.'' The latter takes its meaning from the definition of \n     the term ``U.S. person'' in the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978, and includes a citizen of the \n     United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent \n     residence.\n       Sec. 8. Termination of Authority. Authority under the act \n     terminates on December 31, 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1944. A bill to revise the boundary of the Black Canyon of the \nGunnison\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\nNational Park and Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area in the \nState of Colorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Black Canyon of \nthe Gunnison National Park and Gunnison Gorge National Conservation \nArea Boundary Revision Act of 2002. This bill improves upon my earlier \nefforts designating the initial park and conservation area.\n  The Black Canyon of the Gunnison Gorge is a national treasure to be \nenjoyed by all. The park's combination of geological wonders and \ndiverse wildlife make it one of the most unique natural areas in North \nAmerica.\n  The first person to survey the canyon, Abraham Lincoln Fellows, noted \nin 1901, ``our surroundings were of the wildest possible description. \nThe roar of the water . . . was constantly in our ears, and the walls \nof the canyon, towering half mile in height about us, were seemingly \nvertical.'' Similarly, today, visitors can enjoy hiking the deep gorge \nto the Gunnison River raging below, or look overhead to marvel at \neagles and peregrine falcons soaring in the sky.\n  This bill modifies the legislative boundary of the Gunnison Gorge \nNational Conservation Area allowing even greater access to the park's \nmany recreational opportunities including boating, fishing, and hiking.\n  This important legislation would expand the National Park by 2,725 \nacres, for a total of 33,025 acres. The Conservation area will be \nincreased by 5,700 acres, for a total of 63,425 acres. In total this \nbill adds 7,296 acres to provide habitat for several listed, \nthreatened, endangered and BLM sensitive species including, the Bald \nEagle, the River Otter, Delta Lomation, Clay-Loving Buckwheat.\n  This legislation helps preserve a unique national resource and a \nsource of national pride.\n  I urge quick passage of this important bill. I ask that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Black Canyon of the Gunnison \n     National Park and Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area \n     Boundary Revision Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 208\n\n       Whereas the students who have participated in the United \n     States Senate Youth Program (referred to in this resolution \n     as the ``Senate Youth Program'') over the past 40 years were \n     chosen for their exceptional merit and interest in the \n     political process;\n       Whereas the students demonstrated outstanding leadership \n     abilities and a strong commitment to community service and \n     have ranked academically in the top 1 percent of their \n     States;\n       Whereas the Senate Youth Program alumni have continued to \n     achieve unparalleled success in their education and careers \n     and have demonstrated a strong commitment to public service \n     on the local, State, national, and global levels;\n       Whereas the Senate Youth Program alumni have reflected \n     excellent qualities of citizenship and have contributed to \n     the Nation's constitutional democracy, be it in either \n     professional or volunteer capacities, and have made an \n     indelible impression on their communities;\n       Whereas the chief State school officers, on behalf of the \n     State Departments of Education, have selected outstanding \n     participants for the Senate Youth Program;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense, Department of State, and \n     other Federal Departments, as well as Congress, have offered \n     support and provided top level speakers who have inspired and \n     educated the students of the Senate Youth Program; and\n       Whereas the directors of the William Randolph Hearst \n     Foundation have continually made the Senate Youth Program \n     available for outstanding young students and exposed them to \n     the varied aspects of public service: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates, honors, and pays \n     tribute to the more than 4,000 exemplary students who have \n     been selected, on their merit, to participate in the United \n     States Senate Youth Program between 1962 and 2002.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to \ncommemorate the 40th anniversary of the\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst U.S. Senate Youth Program. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Breaux, who serves with me as a co-chair of the 40th \nanniversary program, as well as Senators Hutchison, Domenici, Lugar, \nand Levin, who all serve on the advisory committee. As the first \ngraduate of the program to become a U.S. Senator, I can honestly say \nthat the week I spent in Washington in 1971, as one of two delegates \nfrom Maine, profoundly influenced my life and career.\n  Even though my family has a long and proud tradition of public \nservice, my great grandfather, my grandfather and my father all served \nin the State legislature, and both of my parents served as mayor of \nCaribou, ME, it was the week I spent in Washington with the Senate \nYouth Program that caused me to seriously consider a career in the \npublic sector.\n  For the past 40 years, the Senate Youth Program has selected two of \nthe brightest and most active students in each of the 50 States, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the Department of Defense schools abroad to \nspend a week learning about our Nation's government first-hand. Over \nthe years, over 4,000 such students have participated in the program \nand gone on to serve our Nation in various capacities, having seen \nfirst-hand what it means to serve in what has been called the world's \ngreatest deliberative body.\n  The continued generosity of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation \nenables students to come to the District of Columbia and see a side of \ngovernment that few Americans see in their lifetime. Each year the \ndelegates meet with top members of the legislative, executive, and \njudicial branches.\n  I remember how fascinated I was as a delegate to listen to Senators \nByrd and Thurmond speak to us about the history of the Senate and the \nissues of the day.\n  But the highlight of my week was the time I spent talking with my \nhome State Senator, Margaret Chase Smith. I went to Senator Smith's \noffice hoping to shake her hand; instead, she took me into her private \noffice and spent 2 hours talking with me about the importance of public \nservice and the difference one person can make. When I left her office, \nI remember feeling so proud that she was my Senator and that I could do \nanything I set my mind to.\n  So, today it is my pleasure to sponsor this resolution paying tribute \nto the more than 4,000 delegates who have participated in the Senate \nYouth Program over the past 40 years, some of whom we may see here in \nthe Congress, at the Supreme Court, or even in the White House in years \nto come. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/13/senate-section/article/S746-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 209--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                  PRENATAL CARE FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hutchinson, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Brownback, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Ensign) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Finance:\n\n                              S.
