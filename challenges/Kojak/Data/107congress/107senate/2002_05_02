Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate and the American people one of the great challenges this country \nis facing again, and the failure of the Bush administration to respond \nto this challenge, and that is the cost of higher education. I don't \nthink there is anyone or any family who is watching the U.S. Senate \nthis morning who isn't concerned about what the cost is for higher \neducation--for their children, who are in college at the present time, \nor parents whose children have gone to college and endured the debt.\n  It is absolutely extraordinary to me, at this time of real crisis, in \nterms of availability of college for working, middle-income families \nthat the Bush administration has now suggested a way that will make the \ncost of college education even higher and the debts even deeper. I draw \nagain to the attention of the Senate this AP story from last week, \nwhere the White House suggested $5.2 billion in savings from Federal \nstudent loans.\n  White House Budget Director Mitch Daniels proposed savings to House \nSpeaker Dennis Hastert. Among Daniels' proposed savings is to require \ncollege students and graduates who wish to consolidate their \nGovernment-backed education to use variable interest rates. That means \nthat the Bush administration is saying to college students, rather than \nbeing able to take advantage of the low-interest rates at the present \ntime, they will have to take their chances on the variable interest \nrates.\n  What is that going to cost for the average student and the average \nfamily? The average family in this country who borrows ends up with a \n$17,000 debt. In my State, it is about $23,000 or $24,000. The best \nestimate is that it is going to cost that family at least $3,000; if it \nis going to be over a 30-year period, it will be an additional $10,000. \nDo families understand this proposal of the Bush administration?\n  Now, we are, as Democrats, extraordinarily concerned. We have sent a \nletter to the administration. Our committee, the Education Committee, \nhas invited Mr. Daniels to testify on this particular issue, so that we \ncan better understand what the reasons and the rationale are--other \nthan that the Federal Government can effectively take back that money \nfrom the students and use it for the tax cut for the wealthiest \nindividuals. This is a tax increase on working families that are going \nto school.\n  Now what has been the administration's response? The Democrats are \nvirtually unanimous. There are 46 of our Democratic colleagues who have \nsaid they will stand in the way and will not permit it. We will have a \nlegislative fix, and we will not permit it. We are telling the \nadministration that.\n  What has been the reaction of the administration? If we look at the \nreaction of the administration, according to Deputy Education Secretary \nWilliam Hansen, they yesterday dismissed the Democratic criticism as \nincredibly disingenuous.\n  It is not the Democrats who are disingenuous. It is the Bush \nadministration's proposal to raise the cost of going to higher \neducation.\n  Is this something that we say is the cost of higher education? I \nrefer again to a story that is in the New York Times--and there is a \nsimilar story in the Washington Post this morning--``Greater Share of \nIncome is Committed to Education.''\n\n       Poor and middle class families have had to use a steadily \n     larger portion of their income to attend the Nation's public \n     universities over the last 2 decades as State spending for \n     higher education has lagged behind. All of these trends are \n     unhealthy for the future of educational opportunity in this \n     country, says Patrick Callan, President of the National \n     Center for Higher Education.\n\n  That is not a Democratic Senator. This is the president of the \nNational Center for Higher Education in San Jose, CA, which \ncommissioned the study with the support of the Ford Foundation and the \nPew Charitable Trust. These are independent studies. These are \nindependent studies, and still the administration stays the course and \nsays, well, even in spite of this fact, we are going to even make it \nmore difficult and more complex.\n  We reject that at the outset. I bring to the attention of the Members \na response that Ari Fleischer had yesterday from the White House when \nhe was asked about fixed versus variable rates. Mr. Fleischer's \nresponse:\n\n       Well, we are just going to continue to work with Congress \n     to find a solution. The idea was always a voluntary one, \n     never a mandatory one.\n\n  Mr. Fleischer better understand what this whole proposal is about \nbecause this is poppycock. What is mandatory, according to the \nadministration, is they get the variable rate. What they are taking \naway from the student is the opportunity to take advantage of the low \nrate. It is still a live consideration, and I do not know who Mr. \nFleischer is talking to in the Congress to find a solution.\n  He also makes reference to the fact about what the administration is \ndoing in funding and education. I, again, remind the Senate about where \nthe administration is on its budget now and in the future on education. \nThis year the President is requesting $50 billion in discretionary \nappropriations for the Department of Education, an increase of $1.4 \nbillion, or 2.8 percent. That is what the administration is suggesting.\n  If we look at last year's budget conference report, on page 51, they \noutline the baseline estimates which do not reflect any specific policy \nexcept for defense. President Bush's budget authority for the year \n2002--this report assumes that discretionary function levels grow by \ninflation.\n  What is that saying? That over the next 9 years, this is the Bush \nproposal on funding education: zero. This is what they say.\n  Now, we are shortchanging the children in this country. If we look \nback at this last year, primarily at the behest of the Democrats, we \nsaw an increase in the elementary and secondary education. The proposal \nof the Bush administration is zero in the outyears and is now \nattempting to tamper with the interest rates to make it more costly. \nNow, that is an intolerable position for the Bush administration to \nhave.\n\n  There is a failure to fund the elementary and secondary education \nadequately, and they are putting an additional tax on every family in \nthis country sending their children to school. Sixty-three percent of \nthe students who attend higher education are borrowing at this time. \nThe average cost across the Nation is $17,000. Every family, if their \nproposal goes forward, is going to pay at least $3,000 more.\n  We are not going to tolerate it. It is difficult for many of us, who \nthought we were going to see a strong commitment in the area of \neducation, to understand in a budget of over $2 trillion why the \nadministration has to target working families and middle-income \nfamilies. I do not understand that.\n  They say education is important. They have over a $2 trillion budget \nand they cannot find the funding in the areas of education. I want to \nlet our colleagues know we are going to do everything in resisting this \nproposal. From an educational point of view, it makes no sense. From a \nnational interest point of view, investing in education and our \nchildren is investing in our future.\n  I see my colleague and friend, the Senator from Michigan, who is \ndoing such an outstanding job on bringing to the attention of the \nSenate the importance of prescription drugs. I commend her for her \neloquence, persistence, and leadership in this area. I tell her that on \nbehalf of all the people of Massachusetts. We are enormously grateful \nto her for bringing these facts to the attention of the membership. I \nhope she will address the proposal we had from the House Republicans \nyesterday on the issue of prescription drugs. I think myself it is more \nof a series of platitudes rather than a core program. They\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nrefuse to commit the resources which are necessary. It seems to me that \na bus ticket to Canada will probably save seniors more than the \nRepublican proposal. I am going to be interested in her reaction to \nthat, and her statements about the importance of assuring our senior \ncitizens that a prescription drug program be a part of our Medicare \nsystem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MILLER). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts for his continued advocacy on behalf of all \nof the issues that directly affect our families every day. Speaking \nfirst to the issue of education as the mother of a 26-year-old who has \ncompleted college--I feel as if I own a part of one of the buildings at \nthat great university, the University of Michigan--and my daughter who \nis now in college, I completely understand and share the deep concerns \nSenator Kennedy has about the proposals that will essentially put \nanother $10,000 of tax on middle- and low-income families over the \ncourse of taking out student loans to put their children through \ncollege.\n  It seems to me, as we are talking about the national interest, the \nimportance of national security, that a critical piece is an educated \nworkforce and an educated citizenry. I cannot imagine who was thinking \nup this proposal at the White House, but I hope they understand we are \ngoing to stand together to stop any effort that will add costs to \nfamilies who are working to put their children through college.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3793-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3793-S3795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak specifically to another \nproposal on principles that was released yesterday in the House of \nRepresentatives. We have been urging now, since I came to the Senate \nover a year ago, and certainly before that time, that our colleagues \nfrom the other side of the aisle join with us to act to get action in \ntwo areas related to critical health care and prescription drugs: One, \na comprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit. Modernize Medicare, \nupdate it. Everyone knows that it was written in 1965 and covers the \nway health care was provided in 1965. It needs to be updated to cover \nprescription drugs, the primary way that we provide health care today.\n  Second, we know there are important actions we can take right now to \nlower the cost of prescription drugs for every family, not only for our \nseniors who use the majority of prescriptions--on average 18 different \nprescriptions a year--but also for those families who have a disabled \nchild or another family member who is ill. We need to lower the costs \nnow. We need to lower them for small businesses. We need to lower them \nfor larger businesses. Our farmers are struggling with higher costs. We \ncan do that.\n  Certainly we appreciate that our colleagues have come together with \nfanfare to talk about four principles: One is lowering the cost of \nprescription drugs now. I suggest that putting those words on paper \ndoes not lower the cost of one pill. It does not make one more \nprescription available to our seniors.\n  I welcome the words, but our seniors and our families have had enough \nwords. They are interested in action. We have to be working in a \nbipartisan way. We come as Democrats to say: Work with us; let's get \nbeyond the words, beyond the principles and get something done.\n  We are interested in lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and we \nhave numerous proposals. I will speak to those for a moment before \nspeaking about Medicare prescription drug coverage.\n  We know, for instance, if we allow the normal course of patents to \nrun out and for the process to work where lower cost generic drugs can \nbe used, we can dramatically cut costs immediately. We have \ncolleagues--Senator Schumer and Senator McCain--who are putting forward \nan important bill to close loopholes that the drug companies have used \nto block generic drugs from going on the market and to block the \nlowering of the cost of drugs. We can pass that bill right now and drop \nthe cost. We can open our borders to Canada. Senator Dorgan, of North \nDakota, has introduced a bill; he is in the Chamber, and I am sure he \nwill speak to that shortly. I am pleased to join him.\n  This is an effort in which I have been involved since being in the \nU.S. House of Representatives. I have taken two bus trips to Canada \nwith our seniors to demonstrate that by working through the Canadian \nMedical Society we can lower the cost of prescription drugs. It is \nastounding. These are American-made drugs. I am proud they are made in \nAmerica. I am proud we have invested in the research and technology--\ntaxpayers, private companies, biotech companies, biomedical companies, \ndrug companies. But when all is said and done, if no one can afford to \nget the medicine, what have we done?\n  We now find ourselves in a situation where we subsidize and pay for \nthe research from which the world benefits; yet our borders are closed \nand our own people cannot go across the border to get the same drug at \nhalf the price.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be honored to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator aware that under the House Republican \nplan, senior citizens would have to spend $670 before they received a \ndime of benefits? This is the cost of the premiums of $420, and the \ndeductible which is $250. That comes to $670 before they get a dime of \nbenefit.\n  Is the Senator familiar with the fact that the average senior \ncitizen's income is only $15,000, and the average prescription drug \nneed is $2,200?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We all want to find common ground and work together. \nRequiring the seniors to pay $670 before they get a dime of benefits \ndoes not seem to me to fulfill the commitment this country made to our \nseniors when we passed Medicare and said: Pay in, and we are going to \nhelp relieve the anxiety you have about quality health care. I am \ninterested in whatever comment the Senator wishes to make.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator. As the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas indicated, the Medicare proposal that we believe is coming--again, \nwe only have principles. We do not have the specifics. We are piecing \ntogether from news stories and other sources what it appears to be. In \nfact, going beyond what the Senator from Massachusetts has said, not \nonly are we talking about the premium, the deductible, the copays--and \nthere are two different levels of copays--but nothing is covered once \nyou reach $2,000 until you have spent $5,000. So there is a huge gap in \nthe middle.\n  If we take the example of a senior who is spending $300 a month on \nprescription drugs--and that is not unusual. It might be a breast \ncancer patient who is purchasing tamoxifen, which in Michigan is $136 a \nmonth. If you add to that blood pressure medication or cholesterol \nmedication or another drug, the amount could easily come to $300 a \nmonth. If you add that up and look at all that it appears from that \nproposal, Mr. President, of the $3,600 a year that one would be paying \nout of pocket, one would still spend $2,914.\n  If someone is paying $300 a month now in prescription drug costs, \nless than 20 percent of that would be covered under the Republican \nproposal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield for another \nquestion? Does not the Senator think then we have to deal with the \nsubstance and the reality rather than the cliches and the slogans?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am sure we are going to hear from the other side: We \nhave a prescription drug proposal. Does the Senator agree with me that \nis really a misrepresentation? If we accept that as a concept, it will \ndo people in my State little good.\n  I understand the Senator is a strong supporter, and I see in the \nchair the Senator from Georgia who has worked very closely with the \nSenator from Florida on an excellent program, and I commend him for it.\n  Does the Senator agree if we are going to do something, let's help \nour seniors and not misrepresent what we are trying to do for them?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. I add also, one of my deep concerns is that \nin order to pay for this, they are talking about Medicare ``reforms.'' \nUnfortunately, the reforms we are hearing about are proposals such as \nadding the cost of home health care, requiring a\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\ncopay for home health care. Our seniors who are now struggling to live \nat home, families who are struggling to make sure someone can live in \ndignity in their home as long as possible, have home health care. Part \nof that is their prescription drugs, and to pay less than 20 percent of \nthe cost of prescription drugs, one of the things they are talking \nabout is a copay for home health care. So they will be adding other \ncosts to this process as well.\n  I suggest: Beware of what is coming. It is very clear when the only \npeople who are advocating for the proposal put forward by the House \nRepublicans are the drug companies, that should tell us something. When \nthey have fought every proposal for comprehensive prescription drug \ncoverage, every proposal to lower the cost of prescription drugs, \nwhether it is expanding generic drugs, opening the borders, lowering \nadvertising costs--every single effort to get some control and \naccountability in this system so that our seniors can afford \nprescription drugs they have opposed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield one more time and give me her \nreaction?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator aware that the Bush budget allocates only \n$190 billion over the next 10 years for prescription drugs and Medicare \nreform, and the House Republican budget allocates $350 billion, but the \ncost of drugs for senior citizens during this same period will be $1.8 \ntrillion--$1.8 trillion? Does the Senator conclude from that, this is \ngoing to be a very inadequate response to a major health challenge for \nour seniors?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I absolutely agree. With all due respect to our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, the math does not add up. It \nis time to get beyond principles and rhetoric and say to those watching \nthis morning sitting at their kitchen table, seniors who are sitting \ndown right now deciding, Do I eat today or take my medicine, that we \nare going to step up to the plate, do what is right, and do what is \nlong overdue.\n  I see my colleague from North Dakota. I would very much like to yield \nto him. He has been such a leader on this issue. We share, as border \nStates, the frustration of citizens from our States who can easily go \non a short trip across the border and pay lower prices for American-\nmade drugs.\n  The Senator has been a real leader in this effort.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. May I be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the conversation about the prescription drug \nissue. It is important. There are two pieces to it. One is coverage for \nthose who do not have access or the resources to get the prescription \ndrugs they need. These are lifesaving medicines that can only save \nlives if you have access and can afford them.\n  The second issue is price. That is an important issue. If we talk \nonly of coverage, and not price, we break the bank. Connecting the hose \nbetween the prescription drug and the Federal tank means we will suck \nmoney out of the tank forever. We will break the bank if we do not do \nsomething about prices.\n  Last year, the cost of prescription drugs increased 17 percent in \nthis country. Year after, the cost increases have been double digit. \nThere has been both utilization and price inflation, double-digit \nincreases in the cost of prescription drugs for 5 years in a row. It \nwill continue into the future unless we do something.\n  We have to deal with coverage. We also have to be concerned about \nprice: What kinds of approaches can we implement that put downward \npressure on prices?\n  I ask unanimous consent to show bottles on the floor of the Senate \nthat have contained prescription drugs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have introduced a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation supported by Republicans and Democrats that allows \npharmacists, licensed distributors, and wholesalers in our country to \naccess prescription drugs in Canada--same drug, in the same bottles, \nmade by the same company, sold in Canada and North Dakota, with \nradically different prices.\n  This is a drug called Celebrex, which is used for arthritis. It is \nsold in identical bottles, except one cap is blue and one is white--\nsame pill, put in the same bottle, made by the same company, sold in \nCanada and the United States. The Canadian pays 79 cents per tablet, \nand the American pays $2.20 per tablet--same drug, same company, same \npill bottle, but a huge difference in prices.\n  Here are two additional examples. Most everyone knows that Lipitor \nlowers cholesterol. But we have two different prices for the same pill, \nput in the same bottle, and made by the same company. It is $1.01 \nwholesale in Canada and $1.86 per tablet to the United States consumer.\n  One more example is Paxil which is used to treat depression. Paxil is \npackaged in a bottle that is identical whether you get it in Canada or \nin the United States. The only difference with Paxil is the difference \nin price--as in the case of most drugs. It costs 97 cents per tablet \nfor the Canadian, $2.20 per tablet for the American consumer. The U.S. \nconsumer pays the highest prices in the world for the prescription \ndrugs. It is the same pill, made by the same company, put in the same \nbottle, for which there is a radical difference in cost.\n  I use one other example without a bottle. It is called tamoxifen, \nwhich is used to treat breast cancer. For every 10 cents charged to a \nCanadian, $1 is charged to an American consumer. If you are buying \ntamoxifen, you can buy it in Canada for one-tenth the price charged in \nthis country.\n\n  With respect to these prices, there is a little town in North Dakota \ncalled Michigan, not so far from the Canadian border. At the end of a \nmeeting one night, a woman, perhaps in her late seventies, came to me \nand said: Mr. Senator, can you help me? I said: What is the problem? \nHer eyes began to well with tears, and her chin began to quiver. She \nsaid: I have heart disease and diabetes; my doctor prescribes a great \ndeal of medicine I must take, and I don't have the money to purchase \nthe drugs. The doctor says I must have these drugs in order to continue \nto live a good life.\n  That is the problem. We need prescription drug coverage. We also need \nrestraint on pricing. The two, together, can help the American people \naccess lifesaving drugs. Miracle drugs can only provide miracles if \npeople can afford them. That is why we are fighting to make some sense \nof this policy.\n  What I have tried to do, on a bipartisan basis, with Republicans and \nDemocrats supporting this reimportation bill that we have now \nintroduced, is to allow pharmacists and distributors to access those \nsame drugs that are sold at much lower prices in our neighboring \ncountry of Canada.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his eloquent \nexposition.\n  We are working on the same track. The Senator from North Dakota has a \nbill to lower prices by allowing reimportation. Senator McCain and I \nhave a bill to extend generic drugs. We have to deal with both: Getting \nprescription drugs as part of Medicare, but also lowering the cost. As \nthe Senator from North Dakota has said over and over again, we are not \ngoing to get the one without the other.\n  I bring to his attention and ask if the Senator saw an article in the \nWall Street Journal on the front page, another way the drug companies \nare going way overboard. They are getting lists from pharmacists of \npeople who have a prescription for a certain drug and then are writing \nthose people and saying: Why don't you switch to this drug? Do you know \nwhy they ask them to switch? The generic drug is coming on board for \ntheir original drug, and now they are trying to manipulate the generic \ndrug law.\n  The drug company is extending the dosage, going for a weekly pill \nrather than a daily pill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes, and I \nyield to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The drug company's applying for a new patent because the \ndaily pill--same medicine--expires.\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\n  The drug industry has some good arguments. I don't disagree with \ntheir argument that they need money for research. And these new pills \nhave helped people. But faced with all of these blockbuster drugs that \nare going off patent, and the companies being so used to the high rate \nof return they have had--higher than any other American industry--they \nare pushing the envelope way too far in terms of trying to keep that \nlevel of profitability.\n  They ought to understand--and I ask my colleague from North Dakota to \ncomment on this--their job is to go back into the laboratories, come up \nwith real new drugs, and work on those--not extend the patent--or, in \nthe case of what the Senator from North Dakota has discussed, make the \nU.S. price above all the other prices. This involves lots of work and \nlots of focus.\n  Every time I read one of these articles, it makes my blood boil. When \nI came here, I was not regarded as a hardliner on this issue. I have a \ngreat deal of respect for companies that research and produce these \ndrugs. However, the limits they are going to, with the advertising on \ntelevision--and I know my colleague from Michigan is working on this--\nwith the huge price differential where the United States consumer pays \nfor all the research, yet around the world the costs are much lower--I \nknow my colleague from North Dakota is looking into this--to the \nmanipulation of the generic drug law, which Senator McCain and I are \nlooking at, something is rotten in Denmark.\n  I thank my colleague his remarks and his persistent leadership on \nthis issue and ask him what he thinks of what is going on, and has he \nseen this change over the years?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I chaired a hearing recently at which \nSenator Schumer testified and Senator McCain, as the ranking member, \nattended. Generic drugs are a very important issue.\n  I push for price restraint because I think it is very important with \nrespect to what is happening to price increases of prescription drugs. \nHowever, I bear no ill will toward this industry. I think the drug \nindustry is a remarkable industry. It does some remarkable things. We \nshould compliment them for some of the programs they have initiated in \nrecent weeks, for the low income senior citizens. That is a good step. \nThey do some awfully good work. Tamoxifen costs one-tenth the price in \nCanada; you pay 10 times more if you are an American, that drug \nresulted from public funding and public research at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  So I worry very much that what is happening is that the public is \npaying for research in some areas and, when the drugs are privatizing, \na price is affixed to them that is way out of bounds.\n  I bear no ill will towards this industry. I want them to do well and \nto continue to search for lifesaving drugs. But I think it is important \nto point out that, when we talk about miracle drugs, Americans who need \nthem will get their lifesaving benefits only if they can have access to \nthem, and can afford them. There are so many Americans who cannot chase \ndouble-digit price increases every year. That is why we deal with this \nissue. The issue I have been concerned about is reimportation from \nCanada. Not because I want anybody to have to go to Canada to buy \nprescription drugs, that is not my goal. My goal, of course, is the \nrepricing of those drugs in this country because, if distributors and \npharmacies can go to Canada and access the same drugs, it will force a \nrepricing of those drugs here.\n  I want to have a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program \nbut I don't want to break the bank. If we do that and do nothing about \nprice restraint and downward pressure on prices we will break the bank \nof this Government. We must address both issues, coverage and price.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield for a moment? I just wanted, as \nwe conclude this time, to thank my colleagues for their continued \nleadership and to, once again, call upon our colleagues across the \nbuilding, in the other Chamber, the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and his colleagues, to go beyond the principles that \nwere put out yesterday and join with us in the concrete proposals that \nwe have.\n  We have the ability to act now. We could do it this month if they are \nwilling to join with us. We ask them to get beyond the words and let's \nget together and let's do the right thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from North Dakota \nwho organized the preceding discussion with respect to the high price \nof drugs and unavailability of prescription drugs. I asked the General \nAccounting Office to do a study of coverage of prescription drugs in my \nhome State of Montana. The conclusions were for those seniors in our \nState who are not covered by health insurance, those seniors pay more \nfor prescription drugs than do seniors anyplace else on the face of \nthis Earth. That is more than any other part of the United States and \ncertainly more than people overseas, as has been demonstrated ably by \nthe Senator from North Dakota. The same drug by the same company is \nless expensive to someone overseas as compared with the United States.\n  This is a critical issue. I thank my friend from North Dakota as well \nas the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, and others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3795-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 3009, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       An act (H.R. 3009) to extend the Andean Trade Preference \n     Act, to grant additional trade benefits under that Act, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Daschle amendment No. 3386, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 3387 (to amendment No. 3386), to \n     ensure transparency of investor protection dispute resolution \n     tribunals under the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate began debate on the \nTrade Act of 2002. This legislation includes three bills reported by \nthe Senate Finance Committee last year: No. 1, an extension of fast \ntrack negotiating authority--also known as trade promotion authority; \nNo. 2, an expansion and improvement of the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram and No. 3, the Finance Committee's version of the Andean Trade \nPreferences Act, or ATPA. As the debate moves forward, I suspect other \ninternational trade matters may also appropriately be attached to this \nbill.\n  The Trade Act of 2002 will be the first major rewrite of \ninternational trade legislation in 14 years. If passed, it will be, as \nthe National Journal has said, ``a historic breakthrough.''\n  Why are we taking up a trade bill? What does this bill--and the \nexpanded trade that will follow--mean for this country? Trade means \njobs. Twelve million Americans--one out of every ten workers--depend on \nexports for their jobs. These are jobs that pay more--thousands of \ndollars more per year--than jobs unrelated to trade. Trade supports \njobs in all sectors. We often think of trade as helping big multi-\nnational companies. In fact, firms with fewer than 20 workers represent \ntwo-thirds of American exporters; and U.S. agriculture exports support \nmore than 750,000 jobs. Trade also means choice. It means more \naffordable products and more variety for American families. It means \nthat hard-earned paychecks go further.\n  In many ways, new trade agreements are like a tax cut for working \nfamilies. Studies have suggested that the average family of four sees \nannual benefits of between $1,300 and $2,000 because of the agreements \nwe negotiated in the last decade. And according to a recent University \nof Michigan study, if we complete the next round of negotiations under \nthe World Trade Organization, it could increase that benefit by as much \nas $2,500--per family, per year.\n  But trade is about more than simple economics. When we trade with \ncountries, we do not just export corn and cars, we export our ideas, we \nexport our values. We export freedom, in a\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nsense. Trade between nations creates opportunities for both parties--it \ncan help lift countries out of poverty, while strengthening our \nrelationships around the world.\n\n  I think Adlai Stevenson probably said it best 50 years ago:\n\n       It is not possible for this nation to be at once \n     politically internationalist and economically isolationist.\n\n  Look at our agreement with Jordan as one example. It has a relatively \nsmall effect on our economy--our trade with Jordan is only about $600 \nmillion per year. But it has an important impact on Jordan's economy--\nand it has cemented our relationship with a key Middle East ally.\n  Similarly, part of this legislation provides trades benefits to \nAndean countries. The main benefit of this legislation will be to help \nmove workers out of the illegal drug business, and into legitimate \nlines of work. It is not going to solve the problem entirely, but it \nwill help. But to do that, they need more access to our market.\n  So that is what's at stake in this debate. Let me turn to the bill \nitself.\n  The most talked-about provision of this legislation, of course, is \nthe extension of fast track trade negotiating authority to the \nPresident. At its core, the fast track grant in this legislation is \nvery similar to the legislation that first granted fast track to \nPresident Ford in 1974.\n  I am often asked why we need fast track--and why now? In essence, \nfast track is a contract between Congress and the administration. It \nallows the President to negotiate trade agreements with foreign trading \npartners with a guarantee that Congress will consider agreement as a \nsingle package--no amendments and a guarantee of an up-or-down vote by \na date certain.\n  In return, the president must pursue a number of negotiating \nobjectives that Congress has outlined in the legislation. And he must \nmake Congress a full partner in these negotiations, fully consulting \nwith Members as the talks proceed.\n  Now make no mistake, fast track is a significant grant of \ncongressional power to the President. But it is excruciatingly \ndifficult to negotiate the best possible multilateral trade agreements \nunless our trading partners know that Congress will vote on the \nagreement negotiated.\n  Indeed, it was our experience in the 1970s--when the Europeans \nrefused to negotiate with us after Congress failed to implement an \nagreement--that led to the creation of fast track. Without fast track, \nour trading partners learned that they could anticipate one round of \nnegotiations with the President and a second with Congress.\n  The reverse is not true. Other countries, because of their \nparliamentary forms of government, have a single legislative body where \nthe majority of the legislative body is also the government, so we did \nnot have that problem with them.\n  Fast track also demonstrates that the President and Congress go into \nnegotiations with clearly defined and unified objectives. Again, that \nis critical. If our trading partners are uncertain that the deal will \nstick, they won't put their best deal on the table.\n\n  Is it possible to negotiate some agreements without fast track? It is \ncertainly possible with simple bilateral agreements, as was the case \nwith Jordan. But, while Jordan is a landmark agreement in many areas, \nit has to be put in context when talking about fast track procedure.\n  The Jordan Agreement, as I noted earlier, was a relatively easy \nagreement. It involved only two countries and affects a very small \namount of trade--roughly $600 million.\n  Major multilateral agreements can affect many more countries and \nbillions in trade. The FTAA is an agreement involving 34 countries; the \nWTO involves nearly 150. For these agreements, fast track remains a \nnecessity.\n  Even bilateral agreements will go much more smoothly with fast track. \nIn the case of Chile, for example, we are still talking about a much \nmore complex agreement than Jordan. It will affect approximately $6 \nbillion in trade, ten times more than the Jordan Agreement. And \nimproving the chances of agreements like Chile is vital to our economy.\n  Let me give you one example. Canada has already signed free trade \nagreements with several countries, including Chile. That has an impact \non U.S. competitiveness. As a result of the Canada-Chile agreement, \nChile eliminated its tariffs on Canadian wheat. U.S. wheat exports to \nChile, on the other hand, still face tariffs as high as 30 percent, \nmaking Canadian wheat much more attractive to Chilean buyers. We must \nnegotiate these agreements if we are going to compete, and fast track \nwill make it easier.\n  People often note that we don't have fast track for treaties, such as \nnuclear arms treaties. That is true. And while these treaties are \nimportant, they are often less complex in the sense that they don't \ninvolve literally thousands of interrelating trade-offs and concessions \nas trade agreements do.\n  I remember the last arms treaty that came before the Senate. There \nwere two or three annexes in it but not all of the host of other \ncomplications involved in trade agreements.\n  But let me turn to the bill itself, and specifically to the \nnegotiating objectives on a number of topics.\n  With regard to agriculture, a topic near and dear to many in this \nbody, and certainly one of my highest priorities--the legislation \ndirects the President to seek new markets for American agricultural \nproducts and to continue to work to lower the trade-distorting \nsubsidies of our trading partners. That is vitally important for \nAmerican agriculture.\n  On a more traditional topic, the legislation also directs the \nPresident to continue to negotiate the reduction and elimination of \ntariffs, while recognizing the sensitivity of tariffs in a few sectors. \nThe United States has already lowered its average tariff rate to about \n3 percent. Generally, tariffs are similarly low in major developed \ncountries. In a few important cases, however, such as Japanese tariffs \non wood products, and Europe's tariffs on semiconductors, tariffs \nremain a significant trade barrier. And in many developing countries, \ntariffs remain at levels that stifle trade, in some cases 100 percent \nor more.\n  The bill also directs the President to address some of the new \nissues, such as e-commerce. By acting to negotiate agreements now, \nbefore protectionism has taken root, hopefully trade in e-commerce can \nremain relatively free.\n  Each of these objectives is critically important. However, most of \nthe debate in the other body and in the press has focused not on the \nimportant issues I have listed, but on three trouble spots in trade \nnegotiations: No. 1, labor rights and environmental issues in trade \nagreements; No. 2, protection of the right of the U.S. to promulgate \nenvironmental and other regulations in connection with so-called \ninvestor-state dispute settlement provisions, commonly know as \n``Chapter 11'' provisions; and, No. 3, the integrity of US trade laws.\n  Let me turn to those difficult issues now.\n  First, labor rights and environmental protection issues: These issues \nhave now firmly and irreversibly made their way on to the trade \nnegotiating agenda. They are here. The world has changed. Those who \ncontinue to ignore that reality are simply burying their heads in the \nsand.\n  The appropriate manner to address those issues, however, is not \nobvious, and it has been the subject of heated debate for more than a \ndecade. The dispute over this issue has kept the Congress deadlocked on \nfast track for nearly a decade.\n  Fortunately, U.S. trade negotiators have made some important \nprogress. In negotiating a free trade agreement with Jordan, the United \nStates brought labor rights and environmental protection into the core \nof the trade agreement.\n  Two central approaches were taken on these issues. First, both \nparties agreed to strive for the labor standards articulated by the \nInternational Labor Organization, and for similar improvement in \nenvironmental protection. Second, both countries agreed to faithfully \nenforce their existing environmental and labor laws and not waive them \nto gain a trade advantage. That is in the agreement.\n  In addition, both parties to the Jordan Agreement agreed to pursue a \nnumber of cooperative efforts to improve labor rights and environmental \nprotection. In my opinion, these provisions of the Jordan Agreement \nprovide a concrete demonstration of the way to\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\nbreak the deadlock on labor rights and the environment.\n  Last year, I encouraged some of my colleagues in the other body to \npursue Jordan-like provisions as the basic model for a fast track bill. \nIn drafting the fast track legislation, the House New Democrats and \nRepublicans wisely agreed to use those provisions as a model for the \nlanguage in the fast track legislation.\n  In the Senate bill, we accepted the legislation on this topic and \nmade clear in the report that the legislation fully adopts the Jordan \nstandard on labor and environment matters.\n  Unfortunately, some in the House opposed this language as not going \nfar enough and urged legislation to force compliance with ILO labor \nstandards. I support the ILO, and I believe the Jordan-based approach \nmoves the trading regime in the right direction; that is, looking to \nthe ILO for guidance on appropriate labor standards.\n  With due respect, however, I believe that those who advanced this \nproposal and those who may later advance it in the Senate debate are \nsimply going too far. The ILO standards are a starting point, but they \nwere not meant to be used in this manner.\n  It may be that through experimentation we can strengthen the linkages \nbetween trade agreements and the ILO. Indeed, that is the ultimate goal \nof this legislation. But trying to accomplish this in one fell swoop \nwill only set back both agreements and the ILO.\n  Quite frankly, whatever the intentions of the authors, proposals like \nthis are likely to be fatal both to fast track and future trade \nnegotiations.\n  Another environment-related issue that has arisen in recent months \npertains to investor-state dispute settlement, also known as ``Chapter \n11,'' in reference to the provisions of this topic in NAFTA.\n  The genesis of Chapter 11 is the legitimate concern of some U.S. \ninvestors that other countries often do not provide adequate \nprotections of their investments. Investors have had many experiences \nof being poorly treated and having little recourse to air their \nlegitimate concerns.\n  NAFTA's Chapter 11, and similar provisions in other agreements, are \ndesigned to address this problem. They define a basic set of investor \nrights under international law. The concepts are comparable to basic \nrights under U.S. law. They include the right to just compensation when \nthe government takes your property, and the right to be treated fairly \nand equitably by the government.\n  Significantly, Chapter 11 provides an alternative to local courts for \nthe adjudication of complaints about a government's actions. Investors \nare allowed to challenge such actions before special arbitration \npanels. It is appropriate to pursue such provisions in trade \nagreements. But investor rights are not the only concern. \nUnfortunately, some of the complaints brought under chapter 11 have \nclearly been aimed at stifling legitimate regulations. The challenge by \nthe Canadian company Methanex against a legitimate California \nregulation on a gasoline additive is the most visible case in point.\n  Defenders of Chapter 11 note that most of these cases have not \nresulted in panel rulings against regulatory authorities. This is \ncorrect. But it is also part of the problem.\n  Chapter 11 panels have demonstrated no ability to rapidly dismiss \nfrivolous cases. This results in extended litigation on claims that \nshould simply be thrown out, such as the Methanex case.\n  These legitimate concerns must also be addressed. The bill before us \ntoday attempts to balance the needs of U.S. investors with the \nlegitimate needs of regulatory agencies, and the concerns of \nenvironmental and public interest groups.\n  The bill directs trade negotiators to seek provisions that keep \nChapter 11-type standards in line with the standards articulated by \nU.S. courts on similar matters. It urges the creation of a mechanism to \nrapidly dispose of and deter frivolous cases. And it urges the creation \nof a unified appellate body to correct legal errors and ensure \nconsistent interpretation of key provisions.\n  I know some would like to go further in striking a new balance on \ninvestor-state issues. As the debate proceeds, I look forward to \nworking with them on the issue. But I urge my colleagues to keep in \nmind there are several legitimate interests that need to be balanced; \nthat if we go too far in one direction, it is going to upset the \nbalance in another. But I very much want to work with Senators who have \nother amendments on this issue.\n\n  The second difficult issue within fast track is how we ensure fair \ntrade. After being involved in international trade policy for more than \ntwo decades, I am struck by how often the issues that shape \ncongressional thinking on trade are not trade negotiations but rather \nare the administration's effort to enforce trade laws.\n  Although the point is often lost, the United States is the most open \nmarket in the world. That has to be remembered. Our tariffs are quite \nlow, and there are very few nontariff barriers to trade in the United \nStates. There are some, but they are few. We do not wear white hats. We \nare not totally pure. Other countries do not wear dark hats. They are \nnot Darth Vaders. But it is true the shade of gray of our hat is a lot \nlighter than the shade of gray of other countries; that is, we are more \nopen compared to other countries.\n  Despite complaints from some of our trading partners, the U.S. market \nis clearly far more open than that of our major trading partners, such \nas Japan and Europe--both of which cast stones at the United States \nfrom behind titanic barriers of their own to agricultural trade.\n  To keep the playing field relatively equal and battle foreign \nprotectionism in the form of subsidies and dumping--selling at cut-\nthroat prices--the United States and most other developed countries \nmaintain antidumping and countervailing duty laws.\n  Another critical U.S. law is section 201. It aims to give industries \nthat are seriously injured by import surges time to adapt. Section 201 \nwas recently employed to good effect to provide the steel industry with \nthat breathing room, but it has previously been used on a range of \nother products, from lamb meat to motorcycles. Indeed, that is why \nHarley-Davidson is doing well today. They were given a breather.\n  Although the exact percentages can vary from year to year, over the \nlast two decades, these laws collectively have applied duties to less \nthan 1 percent of total imports; that is, our trade laws, when \nenforced, when in action, have applied duties to less than 1 percent of \ntotal imports. And they are completely consistent with U.S. obligations \nunder the WTO--a point that must be remembered by all Americans who are \na little concerned about some of these actions our Government, I think \nin most cases, legitimately takes to protect the United States of \nAmerica because other countries' trade laws and barriers are so heinous \nby comparison and so unfair to Americans.\n  Yet somehow the United States has lost the public relations war on \nthis topic. Somehow our trading partners and importers have convinced \nsome editorial writers that these laws are protectionist. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. They are not protectionist.\n  Antidumping and countervailing duty laws combat trading practices \nthat have been condemned for a century. Subsidies and dumping are too \nfrequently used by foreign countries and companies to devastate U.S. \nindustries. Consider the U.S. semiconductor industry in the mid-1980s \nand the U.S. lumber industry today. Rather than being protectionist, \nthese laws are the remedy to protectionism. That dumping, those \nsubsidies, are trade barriers. They are trade barriers. They are \nbarriers to free trade. So our trade laws are meant to remedy that \nprotectionism, remedy those trade barriers, by knocking down those \ntrade barriers. That is what our trade laws do. It is a very important \npoint for all of us to remember.\n\n  On a political level, these laws also serve as a guarantee to U.S. \nindustries and U.S. citizens. They say that trade will be fair as well \nas free, and that temporary relief is available if imports rise to \nunexpected levels. Without those critical reassurances, I suspect the \nalready sagging public support for free trade would evaporate and new \ntrade agreements would simply become impossible.\n  Our trade laws help us, not hurt us, and help other countries, too. \nIt keeps them honest and keeps them on their toes.\n  To address this issue, the bill takes two important steps: First, it \nidentifies\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\nseveral recent dispute settlement panels under the WTO that have ruled \nagainst U.S. trade laws and limited their operation in unreasonable \nways. These decisions clearly go beyond the obligations agreed to in \nthe WTO and undermine the credibility of the world trading system. If \nthey are not addressed, I suspect public support for trade will erode \nfurther. That is why our concerns regarding these cases are identified \nat the very outset of the bill as findings and why the administration \nis directed to develop a strategy to counter or reverse these decisions \nor lose fast track.\n  This bill also directs negotiators not to negotiate new trade \nagreements that undermine U.S. trade laws. We cannot do that. I am, \nfrankly, concerned that this administration has already put itself in a \nposition in which U.S. trading partners will push hard to weaken U.S. \ntrade laws in WTO negotiations.\n  We cannot put ourselves in that situation. This issue is serious \nenough that I carefully weighed whether the benefits of new trade \nagreements are worth that risk. I went forward only because I believe \nthere are strong majorities in both Houses of Congress to block efforts \nto weaken U.S. trade laws.\n  I am concerned that additional steps on U.S. trade laws may go too \nfar, but I hope the administration's trade negotiators take careful \nnote of these directions; otherwise, they are headed for conflict with \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. President, that describes the fast-track portions of this bill. \nThey are not perfect. Were it not for the need to address the concerns \nof Senators on the other side of the aisle, I would have gone further \nin several areas. There are also provisions I think are unnecessary. \nThat, after all, is the nature of bipartisan compromise. In the end, \nthough, the Finance Committee reported the fast-track bill by a vote of \n18 to 3, indicating to me that we are close to finding that balance.\n  One final point, especially for my friends on the left. This is the \nmost progressive fast-track bill that Congress has ever moved to pass, \nby far. It is a vast improvement over past grants of fast track on many \nof the issues I have just highlighted. It is not perfect, but it is a \ngood bill. I urge my colleagues not to allow the perfect to become the \nenemy of the good.\n  When I began my remarks, I noted that many people have asked a simple \nquestion: Why a trade bill? Why now? A big part of the reason is that \nwe now have the unique opportunity to expand and approve trade \nadjustment assistance--not TPA, trade promotion authority, but trade \nadjustment assistance. Quite frankly, this would be impossible absent \nfast track. We can only do this in the context of a larger trade bill.\n  So let me turn now to what I view as the most important part of this \nlegislation--and certainly the part I am most proud of--trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  Trade adjustment assistance, sometimes known as TAA, is a program \nwith a simple but admirable objective: to assist workers injured by \nimports to adjust and find new jobs. It is that simple. This is an \nobjective I suspect almost all Americans support.\n  TAA was created back in 1962 as part of an effort to implement the \nresults of the so-called Kennedy round agreement to expand world trade. \nThat is its genesis, 1962.\n  President Kennedy and the Congress agreed there were significant \nbenefits to the country as a whole from expanded trade. They also \nrecognized, however, that workers and firms would inevitably lose out \nto increased import competition.\n  TAA was then created as part of the new social compact that obliged \nthe Nation to attend to the legitimate needs of those who lose from \ntrade as part of the price for enjoying the benefits from increased \ntrade.\n  Unfortunately, we have not always upheld the bargain in pursuing new \ntrade agreements because, over the years, we have failed to provide \nadequate funding for TAA. We have scaled back some benefits. We have \ntightened eligibility requirements. We have neglected to recognize the \nneed for expanded training and health care assistance. We have not kept \nup our part of the deal.\n  This legislation aims to fulfill the bargain struck in 1962. It does \nnot, as some voices have asserted, make TAA more attractive than having \na job. That is just not accurate. I think anybody would rather have a \njob, that is clear. But in the end, TAA recipients must still get by on \nabout $250 per week while receiving retraining for a new job.\n  But it does make several important changes in the TAA program to make \nit more effective. First, it extends the period for which TAA pays out \nincome support from 52 weeks to 74 weeks. It is extended. This allows \nTAA recipients to stay in the program long enough to complete training \nfor new jobs. It also remedies a shortcoming in the current program \nthat many observers, including the General Accounting Office, have \npointed out.\n  Second, this legislation expands eligibility for TAA benefits to so-\ncalled secondary workers. This has been a controversial provision, so I \nwill explain it. Secondary workers are secondary only in the minds of \nsome of the bureaucrats administering TAA. These are workers who have \nlost their jobs due to imports just as surely as those receiving TAA \nbenefits now, but they have the misfortune of working for a company or \na plant that supplies input products to a plant that closed or reduced \nproduction because of trade. They are so-called secondary workers.\n  The shortcomings of current law are demonstrated in this example: If \nan auto plant must close down because of competition from Japanese \nimports, the workers at that plant would be covered by TAA. That is \nclear. The workers down the road, however--those who make windshield \nwipers or tires for the now closed plant--would be secondary workers \nand not covered. This is simply unjust, and it is why so many, \nincluding the GAO and the Trade Deficit Review Commission, which \nincluded two members of the Bush Cabinet, have advocated expanding TAA \nto cover secondary workers.\n\n  When Congress passed the NAFTA in 1994, President Clinton agreed to \nexpand TAA to secondary workers for imports from NAFTA countries. We \nalso agreed to extend TAA when a U.S. manufacturing plant moves abroad \nto one of the NAFTA countries. These limited applications demonstrate \nthat both provision on secondary workers and plant shifts are workable. \nThey have been the law and are working. It was the expectation at the \ntime that we passed NAFTA that these provisions would be expanded to \nall trade. As Mickey Kantor, who was USTR at the time, has said:\n\n       At the time [that NAFTA was passed] it was everyone's \n     expectation that these programs would be extended to non-\n     NAFTA countries.\n       And that makes sense--workers who lose their jobs because \n     of imports from Europe, for example, are just as deserving of \n     assistance as workers who lose their jobs because of imports \n     from Canada. The legislation before the Senate harmonizes \n     these programs. This is long overdue.\n\n  Third, this legislation expands benefits for TAA workers. This \nlegislation authorizes $300 million for training workers receiving \nTAA--nearly tripling the program. The legislation will also extend \nassistance in obtaining healthcare insurance to TAA recipients. Now, \nthe call for extending healthcare insurance assistance has proven the \nmost controversial aspect of this legislation.\n  But it is important for all Senators to understand that this concept \nwas originally advanced by the bipartisan Trade Deficit Review \nCommission--a group that had many prominent Republican members, \nincluding Ambassador Robert Zoellick, Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld, and former USTR Carla Hills. They recommended health \ninsurance benefits for dislocated workers.\n  I would emphasize that the recommendation for transitional health \ninsurance was supported unanimously by the Commission. In our bill, we \nhave tried to find an appropriate middle ground.\n  For workers who are eligible for COBRA, this bill would provide a 73 \npercent tax credit for those payments. For workers not eligible for \nCOBRA, this bill would provide a 73 percent tax credit for the purchase \nof certain State-based group coverage options. The tax credits for both \ncategories of workers would be fully advanceable and refundable. In \naddition, in recognition of the fact that it may take States some time \nto get these group-coverage\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\noptions up and running, we provide interim assistance through the NEG \nprogram.\n  Fourth, this legislation also extends TAA programs specifically \ntargeted to family farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. The legislation \naims to correct some problems in the current legislation that have kept \nfarmers and fishermen--who are typically self-employed--from \nbenefitting from TAA. The provision on farmers is taken from \nlegislation introduced by Senator Conrad and the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Grassley. The provisions on fishermen were \nprepared by Senator Snowe, who has contributed immensely to this \nlegislation.\n\n  Finally, this bill creates what amounts to a pilot program on wage \ninsurance. Wage insurance is essentially an alternative approach to \naddressing worker adjustment. In essence, wage insurance provides a \nGovernment payment to older workers who lose their jobs because of \ntrade and decide to take a lower paying job rather than go through \ntraining. The Government payment would run for up to two years and \nwould make up half of the difference between the new wage and the old \nwage. The concept is that workers may actually be able to adjust more \nquickly if they move back into the workforce and learn new skills on \nthe job. Experience suggests that the workers that do take a lower \npaying job are often able to make up much of the difference between the \nnew wage and the old wage as they gain experience.\n  There are those who would like to abandon traditional TAA entirely in \nfavor of wage insurance. If this experiment succeeds, that may be just \nthe course we decide to take in a few years. At this point, however, \nthere are just too many questions to be answered to turn TAA entirely \ninto a wage insurance program. That would not be right.\n  One final point on cost. I should note--we often talk about the vast \nbenefits of trade: more jobs, higher paying jobs, cheaper products. I \nindicated earlier that the average family of four sees annual benefits \nin the thousands of dollars. Yet I am sure that some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle will complain that TAA costs too much. \nBut the reality is, it would cost the average family of four about $12. \nIt is an inexpensive way to build support for trade.\n  All told, this bill amounts to a major expansion and a historic re-\ntooling of TAA--a step that is long overdue. It attempts to adopt the \npositive experiences we have had with expanding TAA to secondary \nworkers in the NAFTA, adopt the recommendations of the GAO and the \nTrade Deficit Review Commission, adopt good ideas from the academic \nworld, and generally turn TAA into a program that truly works.\n  I suspect when we look back on this legislation in 20 years it will \nbe these provisions on TAA, which attempt to fulfill the promise made \nby President Kennedy nearly 40 years ago, that are found to be truly \nhistorically significant.\n  Finally, this legislation also extends and expands the trade \npreferences given to the Andean countries--Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and \nEduador. The United States had extended these preferences to our \nfriends in Andean America until they expired last year because we \nwanted to provide the citizens of those countries with an alternative \nto the illegal drug trade and to shore up our relationship with \nimportant allies.\n  In the legislation we are considering today, the Finance Committee \nchose to expand ATPA to new products, such as textiles and apparel and \ncanned tuna. I know these expansions are controversial, but they are \ncritical to the beneficiary countries.\n  Fighting the war on drugs is an uphill battle for these countries. It \nis tough. They cannot fight that battle unless legitimate, value-added \nsectors of their economies are encouraged and developed. This bill \nexpands ATPA in a responsible way.\n  The legislation also creates a petition process to give interested \nparties a channel for bringing to the administration's attention issues \nthat may warrant limitation of a country's benefits. That could happen. \nThis will ensure that the United States pays adequate attention to \nother issues in these relationships, such as labor rights and \nenforcement or arbitral awards.\n  Finally, this legislation includes technical changes from the \ncommittee mark, including an exclusion of certain footwear products.\n  Let me end by talking about the importance of trade in my home State \nof Montana. As in most States, trade plays a critical role in Montana's \neconomy.\n  From 1993 to 2000, Montana's exports grew by 126 percent--nearly \ndouble the 68 percent growth in total U.S. exports of goods. We have \nexpanded proportionately faster than has the Nation. According to the \nU.S. Department of Commerce, nearly 6,000 Montana jobs depend on \nexports of manufactured goods. And more than 730 companies, mostly \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses, export from Montana. Farmers and \nranchers are also increasingly dependent on trade and continuing to \nopen foreign markets. One in every three U.S. acres is planted for \nexport--making U.S. farmers 2\\1/2\\ times more reliant on trade than the \nrest of the economy.\n  Unfortunately, barriers to U.S. agriculture products remain extremely \nhigh. Agriculture tariffs average more than 60 percent worldwide. By \ncomparison, average tariffs on industrial goods are less than 5 \npercent. Non-tariff trade barriers, like quotas, have all but vanished \nfrom trade in manufacturing, but these barriers remain common in \nagriculture. U.S. agriculture exports have suffered as a result of \nthese barriers. Indeed, because agriculture is the most distorted \nsector of the global economy, it is also the sector most in need of \ntrade liberalization. Some existing agreements have provided \nsignificant improvements. NAFTA--while far from perfect--has resulted \nin increased agriculture exports to Mexico and Canada.\n  In 1993, the year that NAFTA was passed, Montana's agriculture \nexports to Mexico totaled $1.2 million. In 2000, that number had \nincreased to nearly $4.7 million. Montana's agriculture exports to \nCanada have increased even more dramatically--from roughly $12 million \nin 1993 to $110 million in 2000.\n  The U.S. must make agriculture a priority in future negotiations, and \nin fact, agriculture is the highest priority for new global trade \nnegotiations under the WTO. Countries have agreed to work toward \nphasing out all export subsidies; make improvements in market access; \nand eliminate disguised trade barriers such as in the beef hormones \ndispute with the Europe Union. These negotiations can only help in \nleveling the playing field for American farmers and ranchers and open \nmarkets overseas since 60 percent of the tariffs are in agriculture and \n5 percent are in manufacturing.\n\n  Trade is clearly important for Montana's farmers, ranchers, and \nworkers. Support for Montana ranchers and small businesses is important \nfor our people. Yet support for trade in Montana--as in the rest of the \nNation--I think has faded in recent years. Part of that is because \npeople are more aware of the downside of trade rather than the upside \nof trade.\n  When workers are laid off as a result of imports, that is highly \npublicized and widely noticed. Yet few people realize that trade \nagreements have provided, by some accounts, benefits to families worth \nthousands of dollars annually. We have not done enough in this country \nto help those workers displaced because of trade. That is why a \ncomprehensive bill--one that includes both fast track and TAA is so \nimportant.\n  This legislation is certainly controversial. As I have noted, fast \ntrack alone has proven so divisive that it has been deadlocked in the \nCongress for most of the decade. I know some of my distinguished \ncolleagues--Senators Byrd and Hollings, for example--have both \nsubstantive and procedural concerns. I deeply respect their views, and \nI value their insight. They are very good people. We disagree, however, \nabout trade. But their concerns are heard. I will address their \nconcerns more fully as this debate continues.\n  In the end, though, it can be said that everybody would like to see \nchanges in this bill, in one direction or the other. But I believe \nstrongly that this legislation represents a sound balance on all \nfronts.\n  Forty years ago, President Kennedy asked Congress to grant him new \ntrade negotiating authority. It was a much simpler bill, at a time when \ntrade issues were more narrowly defined. But it was still quite \ncontroversial, for\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\nmany of the same reasons that trade remains controversial today.\n  President Kennedy emphasized the importance of trade for our economy, \nfor our workers, and for American leadership. Yet he recognized even \nthen that trade also creates dislocation and that a new program, trade \nadjustment assistance, was needed to aid workers adversely affected by \ntrade.\n  President John F. Kennedy, urging support for his proposal, said \nthis:\n\n       At rare moments in the life of this Nation, an opportunity \n     comes along to fashion out of the confusion of current events \n     a clear and bold action to show the world what we stand for. \n     Such an opportunity is before us now.\n\n  Congress seized that opportunity and passed the Trade Expansion Act \nof 1962.\n  Today, we too can show the world--and America--what we stand for. \nBuilding not only on the vision of President Kennedy, but on the \nefforts of the Presidents who followed him, we can show the world that \nAmerica can lead the way in building a new consensus on international \ntrade. We, too, must seize this opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have attempted to really get the process \ngoing on trade promotion authority for a week now, with little or no \nsuccess. I think today we moved completely in the wrong direction. I \nam, for the first time, becoming concerned that we may not be \nsuccessful in our effort. I wanted to come to the floor today to talk \nabout it.\n  Had we brought the trade promotion authority bill to the floor of the \nSenate on Tuesday, the bill that was reported on an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan vote--I think 18 to 3 out of committee--and if we could have \nhad an up-or-down vote on it, my guess is that some 70 Members of the \nSenate would have voted for trade promotion authority. And the vote \nought to be 100.\n  If there is anything I think we have learned in the history of \nmankind, it is that trade works, that trade promotes economic growth, \nit promotes better jobs, it expands freedom, it is something that all \nenlightened opinion speaks in favor of; yet it is something that, \nthroughout history, has been under assault. It is hard to understand \ntrade, and it is so easy to argue against it.\n  Every special interest can cloak itself in the American flag and \nargue against trade. It reminds me of the writing of a French \neconomist, who, as individual industries were getting protection from \nforeign competition in France while England was blossoming economically \nthrough free trade--a famous French economist wrote a petition to the \neconomic ministry that was granting all these exceptions for one \nindustry after another, basically arguing that they had to protect \ndairy products because they had so many jobs tied to it--tending the \ncattle, and all of the people who service the industry--and they had to \nprotect this industry to protect that. So this famous economist wrote a \npetition on behalf of candlemakers, arguing that they were \ndisadvantaged in selling their products because of the Sun, which had \nan unfair competitive advantage: It seemed to produce light for \nnothing--in overwhelming quantities.\n  Anyway, to make a long story short, he goes into this elaborate \nargument about how France could become rich from all the people who \nwould be employed in making candles if they would just pass a law \nrequiring people to pull their shutters closed during the day and to \npull down their shades so that they would have to buy more candles. \nWhat was interesting about his petition was that it made exactly as \nmuch sense as all the other petitions that had been granted.\n  The point is that trade doesn't help every individual producer under \nevery individual circumstance, but it helps the whole, it helps \nsociety.\n  We live in a golden age today. We live in an age where consumer \ngoods, relative to our wages, are the cheapest they have ever been in \nthe history of mankind. The other day I put a shovel in a truck, and \nsomeone had gone somewhere in the truck. I needed the shovel, but I had \na limited amount of time. So I went to the hardware store to buy \nanother shovel--complaining about how stupid I had been for leaving it \nin the truck. I should have paid attention. I had only one day to do \nwhat I was going to do. So I went there to buy a shovel, and I bought a \nshovel for $4.52. I submit that never, since man first emerged from the \nGarden of Eden, has any citizen anywhere bought a quality shovel for \nless than I paid for it at the hardware store.\n  Today, we all benefit from world trade. I never will forget, as a \nboy, as an economic student, when the professor explained comparative \nadvantage and the gains from trade. It didn't take me long to figure \nout these were powerful ideas that people didn't understand. It is so \neasy for a Member to stand up and say: We buy products from some \ncountry, but they don't buy that product from us. But I could say that \nI buy groceries from Safeway, but they don't buy anything from me. I \nhave a totally one-way trade with Safeway. I could claim that that was \nunfair trade. I could stop buying groceries from grocery stores since \nthey don't buy anything from me. I could plant my little backyard in \nvegetables. But the price I would pay would be poverty.\n  The point is, there is no issue we have debated in this Congress, or \nany Congress, related to the material well-being of our people--which I \nseparate from things like our political freedom--there is no issue that \nwe have debated that is more important than trade. Trade won the cold \nwar. Trade and the wealth that it created, the wealth machine it \ngenerated rebuilt Japan and Europe after World War II. Trade created \nwealth in Taiwan and Korea where it had never existed. In the process, \nit destroyed the Soviet Union. It gave more freedom to more people than \nany victory in any war in the history of mankind. The first point I am \ntrying to make is, trade is very important and trade promotion \nauthority, giving our President the tools he needs to negotiate and \ncreate more good jobs in America through trade, is something that every \nMember of the Senate ought to be for, and thank goodness, a large \nnumber of our Members are for it.\n\n  If that had been the issue before us, we could have finished our \nbusiness on Tuesday. But for some reason, the majority decided they \nwere unwilling to let the Senate vote on trade promotion authority \nalone and that they were going to add other legislation to it, most \nimportantly, trade adjustment assistance. Whereas the trade promotion \nauthority bill came out of the Finance Committee on a strong bipartisan \nvote, the trade adjustment assistance bill actually passed the \ncommittee after the expiration of the two-hour rule. It was totally a \npartisan procedure, and it is a very contentious bill.\n  I could go into great length about what is in it, but the point I \nwish to make today is that we have been negotiating, I believe, in good \nfaith in trying to come up with an agreement that would let us move \nforward and pass this most important legislation--trade promotion \nauthority.\n  In the midst of these negotiations, yesterday Senator Daschle offered \nthis amendment. The astounding thing is that a huge amount of this \namendment represents material that not only is not in the trade \npromotion authority bill but is not in the trade adjustment assistance \nbill. And there are totally new issues that have not been discussed in \nthe context of fast track before. These represent basically an \nundercutting of the whole process of trying to negotiate a compromise.\n  I understand that to legislate, it requires a compromise. Nobody gets \neverything they want. I do not think it is asking too much to have a \nstraight up-or-down vote on trade promotion authority, something as \nimportant as that, but now we find hidden in this amendment a provision \nwhereby to get trade promotion authority, we are going to have to cover \nlegacy costs for the steel industry.\n  This provision was not part of trade adjustment assistance, but \nsuddenly out of nowhere, if you are part of the legacy cost to the \nsteel industry, you are going to get a brand new entitlement benefit \nunder this program. Never in our negotiations has there been talk about \nwage insurance. Let me explain this concept and let me explain how \ntrade adjustment assistance works.\n  First, under the current law, if I lose my job because lightening \nstrikes the building I am in and destroys the Capitol or a terrorist \nattack destroys the\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\nbusiness, I get unemployment insurance until I can find a new job. But \nif foreign competition can be blamed for me losing my job, I get a \ntotally different set of benefits, far richer, far more valuable.\n  Quite frankly, I never understood why Americans ought to be treated \ndifferently based on why they lose their jobs. If they are Americans \nand they lose their jobs and Government provides programs, it seems to \nme they ought to get the same benefits. I do not understand treating \npeople differently, but I long ago have concluded that my view is \nhopelessly in the minority on that issue.\n  Now we are talking about adding new benefits to the differential, and \nI want to talk about two issues in particular.\n  The first I mentioned is this whole steel legacy issue, and it really \nboils down to the following thing: Sad as it is, painful as it is, the \nAmerican steel industry promised benefits that they never intended to \npay, that they never had the resources to pay, and now, having \nnegotiated all of these gold-plated benefits, principally to their \nretirees, when the bill has come due, these companies, many of them \nstill in business, many of them that have equity values on the New York \nStock Exchange are saying: Look, we cannot pay these benefits; we \nagreed to them, but we cannot pay them, so we want the taxpayers to pay \nthem.\n  Now we have a proposal out of the clear blue sky added to the ransom \nthat we are supposed to pay to get trade promotion authority passed. We \nhave this requirement that these steel legacy costs come under trade \nadjustment assistance. I say to my colleagues, when you are in the \nbusiness we are in, you never say never; you never say that something \nis not going to happen. But let me put it this way: We may adopt a bill \nthat funds steel legacy costs as tribute or bribery or ransom to get \ntrade promotion authority, but it is not going to happen soon and it is \nnot going to happen easily. Within every limit of every rule of the \nSenate, I assure my colleagues, we are going to fight this. And if in \nthe end, God forbid, but if in the end it were a choice between trade \npromotion authority, which we need, which is vitally important and \nwhich I am 100 percent committed to, if I had to choose between trade \npromotion authority and paying steel legacy costs to get it, the answer \nis no, it is not worth it. It is absolutely not worth it.\n  If we were talking from now until Jesus came back, I do not know that \nI would be so quick to make that statement. But we know we are going to \nhave a new Congress next year. We might actually have a Republican \nmajority in that Congress. To simply come in and ask the taxpayers to \npick up all these legacy costs for operating American businesses that \npromised benefits they could not and they never intended to pay, in \nmany cases, is so outrageous it is piracy on such a scale that, in my \nopinion, it is not worth paying, not even for trade promotion \nauthority.\n  Let me talk about wage insurance. I remind everybody that currently \nin our trade promotion authority bill only about one out of every four \nAmericans who lose their jobs where it can in any way be related to \ntrade claim benefits under trade promotion authority. About three-\nfourths of them simply go on about their business and get other jobs, \nbut about one out of every four take trade adjustment assistance \nbenefits.\n  Under this bill, we create a brand new benefit which will guarantee \nthat almost everyone will participate in the program. As a result, the \ncost of the program will skyrocket. This is a brand new entitlement, \nand what it says is, if you earn less than $40,000 a year when you lose \nyour job, when that can be in any way related to trade, the Government \nis going to guarantee your wage, and so you will take a new job and the \nGovernment will come along and pay a portion of the difference between \nthe wage you had in your old job and the wage you have in your new job.\n\n  This is a brand new entitlement program, potentially explosive in its \ncosts.\n  The idea we are suddenly going to start insuring people's wages \nrepresents a step toward Government domination of the marketplace that \nwe have never seen before. This is a provision that cannot be in any \nfinal compromise.\n  I will sum up because I know the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee is present. I know he wants to speak.\n  I do not think we are moving in the right direction. I thought it was \na mistake, I believe it is a mistake, and I believe many of my \ncolleagues will not support tying trade adjustment assistance with all \nof these new entitlement programs to trade promotion authority. Now we \nare having all of these new benefits in the trade adjustment assistance \nbill, benefits the cost of which no one knows.\n  I hear my colleagues say we are running a deficit, we are spending \nthe Social Security trust fund, what an outrage it is, but yet today we \nhave an amendment before us offered by the majority leader that would \ncreate massive new entitlements that, clearly, would end up costing \nbillions, perhaps tens of billions of dollars, and no one seems the \nleast bit concerned. No one seems concerned that we are creating all \nthese new entitlements that will change worker behavior, that will \ninduce people not to move to new jobs, that will disrupt the economy \nand in the process create this incredible situation where people who \nare working have no guarantee of wages but people who are unemployed \ndo; people who are working do not have a guarantee of health insurance \nbut people who are unemployed have a Government guarantee.\n  How can we tax people who are working, who have no wage guarantee and \nwho have no health insurance, how can we justify taxing them to pay \nbenefits to people who are unemployed who are not working? I do not see \nhow such a guarantee can be made.\n  Ultimately, what we are talking about is a European-type system, \nwhere we are going to guarantee health coverage ultimately to \neverybody, where we are going back and bailing out the steel industry \nto simply get the right to vote on trade promotion authority, and where \nwe are beginning to write guaranteed wages into the American economy.\n  The President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce today in the paper said \nit well, I think, that we are reaching the point where the price we are \nbeing asked to pay for trade promotion authority is simply too high; it \nis unacceptable.\n  So I urge my colleagues to--and let me speak to my colleagues on my \nside of the aisle. I am never going to support these provisions. I am \nnever going to support bailing out the steel industry as a price for \ntrade promotion authority. I am not going to support a wage insurance \nprogram. Every country in the world that has such a program, that has \nthe least bit of economic development, is trying to get out of it.\n  Europe has not created a job in 30 years because of their wage \ninsurance program and the inflexibility that produces. So if you ever \nget a job, you are protected, but in Europe people do not get new jobs \nunless somebody dies or retires. That is not what we want in America. \nSo I think this has to be rejected. I do not think this represents any \nkind of good-faith offer. I think this undercuts what we have been \ntrying to do, and I think we are moving in the wrong direction.\n  We are going to hear today from many of my colleagues who have been \ninvolved in this debate. I am for trade promotion authority, and I \nunderstand piracy. I understand that often in the legislative process \none has to do a lot of things they do not want to do to do some good, \nbut the price we are being asked to pay in the Daschle amendment is too \nhigh. Not even trade, as great as it is, is worth the tribute we are \nbeing asked to pay in this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, does the assistant majority leader \nhave a statement he wishes to make?\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator asking. What we are going to do, \nas soon as the Senator completes his statement, we are going to work \nout a time agreement where Senator Dorgan's amendment will be voted on \nat or around 12:30 today. So Members should be aware that is what we \nare working toward. As soon as the Senator completes his statement, we \nwill propound a unanimous consent request. I have checked with the \nSenator and I have\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\nchecked with the manager on our side and that seems to be OK with both \nof them.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, will the Senator yield to me for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  There is not going to be a unanimous consent agreement on the Dorgan \namendment. We are not going to do a time limit on it. We are not going \nto vote on it today.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, there are other ways we can vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is fine. I am saying we are not going to have a \nunanimous consent agreement today on that amendment or any other \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The majority leader yesterday finally brought to the \nSenate legislation that contains trade promotion authority, a second \npart called trade adjustment assistance, and a few other items, all \nvery important but not getting as much attention as those two.\n  I am pleased that the Finance Committee's bipartisan trade promotion \nlegislation is now before the Senate. I believe strongly this \nlegislation, more than any other, will promote America's constructive \nleadership of the international trading system. Nevertheless, my \nenthusiasm for the trade promotion authority component of the majority \nleader's legislation is tempered by the dismay that I have about how \nthis process has been carried on.\n  Even though I believe strongly trade promotion authority is badly \nneeded, and surely it ought to be passed by the Congress and signed \ninto law, I regret we are being forced by the Democrat leadership's \nunnecessary counterproductive, sort of take it or leave it approach--it \nis kind of a partisan attitude in the taking up of trade promotion \nauthority and doing it in this fashion.\n  When we passed trade promotion authority from the committee 4 months \nago, the vote was 18 to 3. We did it in an open, cooperative, \nbipartisan spirit. I was greatly heartened by the bill itself and by \nthe process in which we achieved a result that was good for America. \nBut this bill before us, the one laid down by the Senate majority \nleader, is a much different story. I had hoped after bruising, partisan \nfights on economic stimulus, the Jordan trade bill, judicial \nnominations, and other issues, finally after those other issues that \nare very partisan, because we had an overwhelming vote in committee \nthen in favor of trade promotion authority, that we would be able to \nshow America's farmers, ranchers, agricultural producers, our workers \nin America's families and tens of millions of American consumers who \nbenefit from free trade that we were beyond partisanship, able to do in \na successful and short manner what the Senate has done on trade in the \npast, to be able to give the President the authority in this bill that \nPresidents since President Ford have had.\n\n  I hoped the Senate could put aside partisan differences and we could \nmove forward for the good of the country and this bipartisan spirit \nwould carry over into the consideration of trade promotion authority.\n  Unfortunately, because of the bill laid down last night, I am very \nsad to say I was wrong. Even after the Finance Committee approved trade \npromotion authority 18 to 3, it took 4 months before the Senate \nDemocrat leadership would agree to bring this critically important \nbipartisan bill to the Senate floor. It took 4 months just to get a \nbill which passed out of committee by 18 to 3, to the floor, even \nthough the President said time and again that the lack of trade \nnegotiating authority was hurting his ability to lead at the \nnegotiating table.\n  When we finally seemed to be making progress in getting trade \nauthority legislation to the floor, we were told the only way we could \nhave this debate--a debate that the American people deserve to have, \nparticularly the jobs created by trade--was if we agreed to partisan \ntrade adjustment assistance legislation with which many Members on our \nside of the aisle disagree.\n  I support trade adjustment assistance. I support an enhanced, \nupdated, and fine-tuned trade adjustment assistance program. I have \nsaid that many times. In fact, the trade adjustment assistance \nlegislation I support will more than double overall program spending \nbecause what I support will vastly increase spending on training to \nhelp the dislocated workers. My program adds health care coverage for \nthe first time ever. It will assist so-called secondary workers for the \nfirst time ever.\n  What I find difficult to agree to, and many Members on my side of the \naisle will not agree, is the partisan, ``my way or the highway'' \napproach taken in the bill laid down by the Democrat leadership. The \nbipartisan way is the best way to get things done in Washington. \nSomehow the Democrat leadership is not listening to either the people \non my side of the aisle or the people on his side of the aisle who I \nknow agree that we need a bipartisan approach. Others have been \nignored, even beyond this body, groups representing tens of thousands \nof farmers, ranchers, and hard-working American families, those workers \nwho have jobs related to trade, those jobs that will be created because \nwe pass this bill and have enhanced trade.\n  I briefly quote from a letter to the majority leader printed as a \nfull-page advertisement on April 11 in the Roll Call newspaper. This \nletter to the Senate majority leader was from the Agricultural \nCoalition for the Trade Promotion Authority, representing 80 food and \nagricultural groups dedicated to the passage of TPA.\n  In part, it says:\n\n       The strong bipartisanship that has historically prevailed \n     in the Senate on trade matters must be reestablished to allow \n     rapid action on trade promotion authority. We urge that this \n     bipartisanship extend to work on other trade-related \n     legislation that may need to move in tandem with trade \n     promotion authority so that the U.S. can regain its position \n     as world leader for free and fair trade, and in so doing open \n     a world of opportunity for U.S. agriculture.\n\n  That plea for bipartisanship on trade adjustment assistance is being \nignored. My pleas for bipartisanship are being ignored, and so were \nthose of many other Senators.\n\n  We have a divisive partisan product, laid down last night, a product \ndeliberately designed to emphasize differences, not to build bridges \nbetween Republicans and Democrats, among people of different \nviewpoints. It was meant not to seek common ground, not to restore the \ntraditional nonpartisan approach to international trade and foreign \npolicy that characterized so much of America's history but otherwise \nput down to simply score partisan political points.\n  As disappointed as I am by the process that took place last night, I \nam still hopeful and commit myself to work for a genuine compromise. I \nhappen to think it can still come together. I believe we can compromise \nand come together because America's global leadership is at stake. In \nother words, this is a very important bill.\n  I don't for 1 second believe any Senator would deliberately want to \ndiminish America's standing in the world community. Stakes are very \nhigh. But that is what will happen if we don't restore the President's \ncredibility at the negotiating table. And this bill that came out of \nthe committee does that--not the bill before the Senate. The merits of \nthe Finance Committee bipartisan trade promotion authority bill are so \ncompelling that I believe we will ultimately be able to compromise on \ntrade adjustment assistance.\n  I summarize the need for the Finance Committee TPA bill simply by \nsaying the United States must be in a strong position to pursue our \nNation's interests at the bargaining table. Without trade promotion \nauthority, we are not in a strong position to accomplish that goal, it \nis just that simple.\n  Already the United States has been pushed to the sidelines, pushed to \na point where a great deal of activity on the trade front has taken \nplace bilaterally, it has taken place regionally, and now globally in \nnew trade negotiations underway through the regime of the WTO.\n  There are many examples of how the United States is being left \nbehind. The Andean community and Mercosur, for example, have moved \ncloser to creating a South American free trade zone comprising 310 \nmillion people. Mercosur and the Andean community together have about \n$128 billion in annual exports. If they have a free trade zone, it will \nstrengthen tremendously the economic power of Latin America and be \nnegative towards the United States. If\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\nwe fail to give our President trade promotion authority and progress on \nnegotiations of the free trade area of the Americas slows as a result, \nor comes to a halt as a result--and this is now the case--then major \nU.S. exporters will be at a major disadvantage in these important Latin \nAmerican markets compared to exporters in countries that do have such \ntrade agreements.\n  American suppliers seeking to sell in these Latin American countries \nare going to have a heck of a time to have a market for their goods \nthat come from the United States. They will face other difficulties as \nwell. Just one example from my State of Iowa, the Bandag company, in \nMuscatine, IA, makes and sells retreaded tires. That company is an \nenormously successful company, also in the international market. At one \npoint in time, Bandag products went to Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina \nfrom our country. American workers made those products.\n  However, when the Mercorsur agreement was put into effect between \nBrazil and those other three countries, it became more viable for \nBandag to ship product from a plant that Bandag built in Brazil. Those \njobs and that investment as well did not stay in my State of Iowa or \nsomewhere else in the United States. In fact, out of economic \nnecessity, it went to Brazil. That is what happens if the United States \nis not credible at the negotiating table. That is what happens when the \nUnited States cannot lead in opening new markets and reducing tariffs \noverseas.\n  Without trade promotion authority, it is a story that will be told \nover and over again. This is our challenge, then. If we fail in this \nchallenge, if we do not seize this opportunity to grant the President \ntrade negotiating authority, I believe the process of opening global \nmarkets through bilateral, regional, and especially global \nnegotiations--the process that has been the pattern for the last 50 \nyears--will be set back for years.\n  If that happens, then the future prosperity of millions of Americans \nand the future prosperity of many of this Nation's most competitive \nbusinesses, and our farmers as well, will be put in doubt.\n  Even though this was a flawed process, and regrettably an \nunnecessarily divisive process, laying this bill down last night, it is \nnever too late for us to do the right thing. Let us use the commitment \nto good faith that I believe we all share to reach a genuine and fair \npolitical compromise on trade adjustment assistance and to finally \nresolve the few remaining trade adjustment assistance issues--and maybe \na few other issues--that are out there.\n  We can get this done. Senator Baucus and I have shown 98 other \nSenators that working together we can accomplish a great deal of good. \nHe has been doing that with me. But I think the process last night \ndetracts from it. Maybe it was not meant to hurt what we are trying to \ndo, but I think it has done that.\n  I am glad that I will have the opportunity, regardless of this act, \nto continue to sit down with my colleague and work out differences. \nThat is what I want all the other 98 Senators--or at least hopefully an \noverwhelming number, 70 or so--to do, work with us in this process. I \nthink there are that many people in this body who know trade promotion \nauthority is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I come to the floor this morning to speak \nin behalf of an amendment laid down by my colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan, as it relates to a particularly growing concerning that \nwe have about a provision within the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. Because we are now on the floor of the Senate with trade \nissues that are so important to our country, we thought this the \nappropriate place to offer this amendment.\n  Representing a State such as Idaho, I know the words ``made in \nIdaho'' or ``buy Idaho'' have become a rather important but familiar \nrefrain across my State for the last good number of years. What is \nunique about that is it has now become a refrain around the world, as \nproducts built in my State, as in other States, are now trafficking in \nworld commerce and are a growing part of the Idaho economy. Whether it \nis the potato chip, for which we are well known, or the computer chip, \nwith which we now dominate world markets because of quality and \nefficiency, Idaho's trade has grown phenomenally in the last decade, \nincreasing and improving and diversifying our economy, and at the same \ntime supplying increasing numbers of jobs that are important to all \nIdahoans.\n  So whether it is trade adjustment or whether it is trade promotion \nauthority, all of those become important items that we clearly need to \ndebate. I, like the ranking member of the Finance Committee, am \nextremely frustrated by the process and the character of the process \nthat has been given to us by the majority leader. We cannot look at \nthese different trade issues separately and in a clean fashion and \ndebate them in a way that allows us to focus individually on these \nissues from the importance of displaced worker health care, of course, \nto the importance of our President having the authority to negotiate \ntrade agreements.\n  All of that said, what is most important in any trade agreement is \nthe transparency of the process so all of us can understand what our \nnegotiators are doing and why they are doing it and the advantages \nthose negotiations will bring to us as citizens, as workers, as \nproducers within this economy.\n  The Dorgan amendment does just that for an agreement that is already \nin place, the North American Free Trade Agreement--that I happened to \noppose when it came to the floor some years ago.\n  I had been a supporter of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement \noriginally. But as the Bush administration and then the Clinton \nadministration put the final touches to the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, there clearly were provisions within it that I thought would \nnot only be troublesome to enforce but this country more likely would \nnot enforce, and the Canadian Government, on the other side of the \nborder, would enforce, making it most difficult for commerce to flow \nevenly in both directions, which would create disadvantages for our \nproducers and for our consumers, while creating advantages for the \nproducers of Canada.\n  Guess what. I was right in many instances. Many of my farmers and \nranchers in Idaho today do not agree that the Canadian Free Trade \nAgreement was, in fact, a positive move for our country. This \nadministration, though, has shown its willingness to enforce trade \nremedy law. With the steel agreement of a few months ago, and now a \nsoft wood Canadian timber agreement just penned by the Department of \nCommerce, and being heard by the International Trade Commission as we \nspeak today, we see the willingness on the part of this President to \nuse law, current law, in a way that will not only force but stabilize \nmarkets and create level playing fields for producers and create a fair \ntrade environment that some of my producers do not think exists.\n  While trade is so important to my State, tragically enough some of my \nproducers and workers are beginning to believe that free trade means \nthat it all comes here and is sold in America, displacing our workers \nand changing our economy because we have had administrations in the \npast that were not willing to enforce trade remedy situations and level \nthe playing field and create fair and equitable environments.\n  I know the positive nature of trade and the importance of it. At the \nsame time, chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement does \nsomething that is increasingly important as it relates to what are \ncalled Investor Protection Tribunals. That means when one government \ntakes an action that may cause a dislocation of a product within the \ncommerce of another country under the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, there is a procedure, a process by which it can be \ndetermined whether that was a fair and equitable process.\n  The tragedy of that is the tribunals have been closed and the public \nhas not been allowed to see them. I must tell you, this administration \nrecognizes it, understands its problems. It is important we try to deal \nwith those as rapidly as we can.\n  Last July, our U.S. Trade Representative, Bob Zoellick, together with \nhis Canadian and Mexican trade counterparts, discussed the secretive \nnature of\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\nthese unique dispute tribunals. They recognized that these tribunals \nneeded to be more open and they announced they would take steps to open \nup the deliberations of the tribunals.\n  On July 31, they issued an interpretation of chapter 11 stating that \ntribunals should operate as transparently as possible. That very \nwording, tragically enough, gave those who operate the tribunals an \nopportunity to operate in a less than transparent environment.\n  As a result of that, Senator Dorgan and I have brought this amendment \nto the floor--I am a cosponsor of it--simply saying that this is a \nrequirement, that the President needs to move in this direction, to \ncertify that these tribunals are open, and to respond as quickly as \npossible in a time certain. We believe that is critically important.\n  If we are going to get the American producer, the American worker, \nand the American consumer to understand the international character of \nour commerce and the international character of our economy, they also \nhave to know that on the government side of the process--and there is a \ngovernment side to trade when you move across international borders and \nwhen you move across political jurisdictions--that the government's \nside of it will be aggressive, balanced, fair, and that the proceedings \nof that government be transparent so that the public can understand why \na certain action is taken and why a certain remedy is produced. We \nthink that is all very critical and very necessary.\n  I suggest that the Dorgan amendment is in fact a perfecting amendment \nto the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  We believe it was the intent originally that these dispute tribunals \nbe allowed to be open, and appropriately so. Yet it has not occurred. \nAll of them have been secretive in the past.\n  We had a tribunal against MTBE because of the action of the State \nthat dramatically impacted the producing company in Canada. At the same \ntime, it was the right of the State of California to do what they did.\n  Regulatory activity that changes a market environment needs to be \nunderstood, and the transparency of those tribunals simply allows that \nto happen. That is, in my opinion, the importance of the Dorgan \namendment.\n  The Washington Times has recognized this problem, as have other \npublications, as it relates to, again, the kind of transparency that we \nthink is important.\n  In the character of the tribunal, Bill Moyers--I don't always agree \nwith him and what he says on PBS, but I think in this instance we \nagree--talked about the balance and the importance. Other publications \nhave recognized that this is a growing problem within the North \nAmerican free trade environment--that what we do is not as open and \ntransparent as it ought to be.\n  It is my understanding that we are going to have an opportunity to \nvote on this issue sometime in the immediate future. I hope my \ncolleagues, recognizing that this is a perfecting amendment which \ndirects the President to move in a positive direction to certify the \nopenness and the transparency of these actions within the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement and within the tribunals of jurisdiction, \nwill do so under what we call the chapter 11 tribunal.\n  With those comments, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for 7 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 2446 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe pending amendment offered by my good friend from North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan. It was offered yesterday evening.\n  His amendment calls for greater transparency in dispute settlement \nunder NAFTA chapter 11--that is the so-called investor-State dispute \nsettlement. I think that is a very important objective.\n  I agree that lack of transparency is one of the major flaws in how \nchapter 11 has operated. It is clear that it makes no sense whatsoever \nthat when the United States is negotiating or companies are negotiating \nor trying to resolve a dispute with a Canadian company, the proceedings \nare, in effect, secret, that they are not open to the public. That \nmakes no sense.\n  I might say, too, that the issues in dispute before chapter 11 \ntribunals clearly implicate essential functions of Government, \nincluding protection of the environment. They raise issues concerning \npublic health and safety. I think any body deliberating on such \nimportant questions--it is axiomatic; it is a priority--should be open \nto the public. That is just a given.\n  Moreover, interested parties must be able to convey their views in \nsuch a body, as is the case in our judicial process, where an \ninterested party can file a brief, say, an amicus curiae brief, say, \nwith the Supreme Court.\n  Fortunately, this is a matter under which I think there is a growing \nconsensus. I note that last year the United States, Canada, and Mexico \nadopted an interpretive note that provides for greater transparency in \nchapter 11 proceedings. The parties agreed, ``to make available to the \npublic in a timely manner all documents submitted to, or issued by, a \nChapter eleven tribunal,'' subject to redaction of confidential \nmaterial. The United States, Canada, and Mexico did agree, in an \ninterpretive note, to provide for greater transparency, at least with \nrespect to making public documents more available.\n  I think this interpretive note is a good start, but it is clear it is \nonly a start. We have far more to do in opening up proceedings.\n  I might say, I raised this issue with European negotiators at the \ninfamous Seattle administerial on trade not so long ago, and I was \nsurprised at the resistance I received, particularly from European \nnegotiators. They did not seem to be automatically agreeing that, yes, \nthat is good for the process. To me, it indicates we are going to have \nto move further and work a little more aggressively to help accomplish \nour objective, and that is transparency. For that reason, the Finance \nCommittee bill currently on the floor included in the TPA bill a \ndetailed negotiating objective precisely on this subject.\n  Let me read it. These are the primary negotiating objectives \ncontained in the bill: provide for ensuring that all requests for \ndispute settlement, and all proceedings, submissions, findings, and \ndecisions in dispute settlement are promptly made public; ensuring that \nall hearings are open to the public; and establishing a mechanism for \nacceptance of amicus curiae briefs from businesses, unions, and \nnongovernmental organizations.\n  It is a huge step, frankly. It is very clear that this is a primary \nnegotiating objective on the part of the U.S. Government.\n  I think we in America sometimes take it for granted that important \ndecisions--that is, judicial decisions, legislative, and executive \ndecisions--are made openly, made in public, with adequate opportunity \nfor all sides to be heard. I think we take that for granted; it is so \ncommon in our country.\n\n  I think the same ought to be true when important Government \nregulations are being considered in international dispute settlements. \nI firmly believe the trade bill makes that objective clear.\n  Having said that, I must say I have some concerns about the amendment \nof my friend from North Dakota. And that is because his amendment would \nmandate that the President pursue negotiations with Canada and Mexico \nand require that the Trade Representative certify that the negotiations \nhave been accomplished within 12 months.\n  There is no mandating language in this bill--for good reason. First, \nit is unconstitutional. The courts will strike it because the \nlegislative branch cannot mandate the executive branch what to do in \nnegotiating agreements. It is unconstitutional. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, even if it were constitutional, if we mandate in one area, we \nnecessarily give up significantly in other areas. One other area would \nbe the agricultural provisions. We are trying to get Canada, for \nexample, to dismantle\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\nits trading commission, the Wheat Board. It is an unfair trade barrier \nand hurts our American farmers. If you mandate transparency, what will \nhappen?\n  First, the Canadians will say, if you want us to do that, we will ask \nyou to give up someplace else or we will not be as amenable to your \nsuggestion that we give up on the Canadian Wheat Board. It does not \nmake good sense in trying to get good, solid trade agreements.\n  We have avoided using mandates in the bill. Rather, in the tradition \nof these kinds of measures, we laid out negotiated objectives and \nagreed to consider implementing legislation under special rules; that \nis, if the President makes progress in achieving these objectives.\n  I think it should give all Senators some concern that this mandate \nalso requires the President to, in 1 year, certify that the USTR has \nfulfilled the requirements set forth in this section. I don't know how \nin the world the President of the United States in 1 year will be able \nto certify that the mandate called for in this amendment is fully \nimplemented; that is, full transparency. It is just not going to \nhappen. It is unconstitutional anyway because the legislative branch, \nunder the Constitution, cannot mandate to the executive branch what to \ndo in negotiating agreements with other countries. That is an \nunconstitutional provision.\n\n  I very much hope my friend from North Dakota will work to modify the \namendment. I strongly agree with the intent and the import of what he \nis trying to do. This puts me in a very difficult position because I do \nagree with what he is trying to do. But the goal here is to be \neffective. The goal here is to get the job done.\n  Frankly, I would like to ask the Senator from North Dakota if he \nwould yield for a question; that is, if there is some way we can modify \nthis amendment to make it effective, because the current draft is \nunconstitutional and also because of the flaws of the mandating \napproach and the impracticality of getting this accomplished within 1 \nyear. I ask my good friend from North Dakota if he is willing to modify \ngiven those flaws?\n  Mr. DORGAN. In response to the Senator from Montana, I certainly \nrespect his view, but I don't share his view that this amendment would \nin any way be unconstitutional. I believe the amendment, if I modify \nit, would be less likely to achieve its purpose. If I don't modify it, \nI think it is a stronger initiative that says to the administration, \nthis is what the Congress aspires to achieve with respect to changing \nthe secrecy by which dispute tribunals in NAFTA are now conducted. I \nwould prefer we not modify it in order that it be a stronger \ninitiative.\n  I do not see this as in any way being unconstitutional. It is in \nperfect concert with our constitutional responsibilities.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my good friend, but it is just a matter of \njudgment. It clearly is unconstitutional because Congress cannot \nmandate to the President telling the President what he must do in \nnegotiating agreements with other countries. That is clearly an \nunconstitutional mandate of authority. I must say, I doubt this \nprovision will survive in conference for those reasons.\n  I fully understand the Senator. The goal here is to be as effective \nas we possibly can because the Senator and I agree with the same \nobjective. The objective is full transparency in these proceedings. \nThat is clearly going to be in the public interest. It is going to help \nAmericans and help people all around the world.\n  I thank my good friend and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my colleague, Senator Craig from Idaho, \nspoke in support of the amendment. It is an amendment we offered \njointly. I ask unanimous consent that others in the Senate who have \nasked this morning be added as cosponsors: Senators Byrd, Dayton, and \nDurbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me describe again what it is we are attempting to \nachieve. We have now, under NAFTA, dispute tribunals or tribunals that \nare created for the purposes of resolving disputes. Regrettably, those \ntribunals are conducted in secret. They are secret tribunals. The \nAmerican people are excluded from knowing what they have done, what \nthey are doing, what they are going to do, how they reached a decision. \nWe are not entitled to review any of the information they have or the \ninformation they might have used to reach a decision. They lock the \ndoor, and behind locked closed doors, they discuss this country's \nfuture with respect to international trade disputes.\n  We ought not be a party to that. That is not what we signed up for. \nThat is not what the U.S. Government is about--secrecy, closed, locked \ndoors in some foreign land. That is not what we ought to be about. This \namendment says: Let's stop that. Let's not have the dispute tribunals \nbe secret.\n  Let me give an example of why this is important: what is happening \nwith respect to NAFTA and a fuel additive called MTBE. This is all \nunder something called chapter 11. You might think chapter 11 has to do \nwith bankruptcy. It does not. Chapter 11 was put in NAFTA at the \nrequest of negotiators thinking that U.S. investors in Mexico might \nhave their assets seized by the Mexican Government or Mexican \nregulators and the Mexican legal system probably wouldn't provide \nsufficient protection. So U.S. negotiators actually asked to have \nchapter 11 included in NAFTA. It was. It was designed to create \ntribunals that would consider claims from foreign investors that they \nhad property taken by Government regulation.\n  By design, these tribunals were given leeway to operate in secrecy. \nThey were bound only by international arbitration rules. That allowed \nthe tribunals to act however they saw fit. If any of the parties to the \nclaim wanted to keep the proceedings secret, the briefs would not be \ndisclosed and the hearings would be closed. And that is exactly what \nhas happened.\n  Let me describe what has happened here with respect to chapter 11 and \nthe tribunals and what this Government, what the United States of \nAmerica, is part of. It involves Methanex, a Canadian company that \nmakes MTBE, a fuel additive. We have been talking about MTBE recently \nin the debate over the energy bill so most Members are familiar with \nthis fuel additive.\n  In 1999, California decided to ban MTBE because they began to find it \nin their ground water and drinking water. All of a sudden they began to \nmeasure this fuel additive, which is harmful to human health in their \nwater system. They decided they better ban MTBE. And so California did \nthat. Fourteen other States are considering limitations to the use of \nMTBE. It was 1990, in fact, when California first discovered traces of \nMTBE in the drinking water.\n  In 1995, 71 percent of Santa Monica's drinking water was shut down. \nTheir supply was shut down due to the presence of MTBE. In 1996, MTBE \nwas discovered in Lake Tahoe. In 1998, an EPA blue-ribbon panel called \nfor substantial reduction in the usage of MTBE.\n  Then California decided, in 1999, they were going to ban MTBE \naltogether. A Canadian corporation that makes it called Methanex heard \nabout the California decision, and they realized they stood to lose a \nlot of money. If California bans MTBE, this corporation stands to lose \nmoney. So Methanex filed a chapter 11 claim against the United States \nfor $970 million. Think of this. Methanex, a Canadian corporation, \nfiles a $970 million claim against the United States of America because \nCalifornia decided to ban MTBE because it was discovering it was \nshowing up in drinking water and ground water and that it is harmful to \nhuman health. So a foreign corporation sues our country because we are \ntaking action to protect human health in this country.\n\n  This claim has had an incredibly chilling effect on environmental \nregulatory activity. If a State wants to keep poisons out of its rivers \nand streams, it now has to worry about a chapter 11 complaint being \nfiled. The producers of that poison will file a chapter 11 claim and \nclaim a billion dollars in injury against the United States. But, then, \nthat claim, when considered under a tribunal in chapter 11, will be \nresolved in secret.\n  Let me restate this so people will understand it. A State finds a \npoison in its drinking water and in its ground\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\nwater. It takes action to ban the use of that fuel additive that \ncreates it and which has allowed it to show up in the drinking water; \nand a foreign company that produces it sues us for almost $1 billion \nbecause that is the injury that will exist to that company. By the way, \nthey would sue us and go to chapter 11, and they will have an advantage \nin a three-person tribunal under chapter 11 of having secret \nproceedings. The American people are told it is none of your business. \nIt is none of our business when we take action to stop poisons from \nfinding their way to our drinking water? That is none of our business?\n  Well, I am using one example--MTBE. This amendment says it shall not \nbe secret any longer, that the dispute resolution under chapter 11--the \ntribunals, their behavior, actions and their considerations--shall not \nbe secret. You cannot keep that information from the American people. \nWe will not allow it. Our amendment says the President shall negotiate \na change with Canada and Mexico to the conditions under which these \ntribunals meet and shall report back to Congress within 1 year; that \nthese tribunals shall be held in the open; that the secrecy has ended, \nand that transparency will exist. That is our amendment.\n  My colleague from Montana said the amendment is unconstitutional. If \nI might, without providing a lecture on the Constitution, I will put up \na chart. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution says the Congress \nshall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. It \ndoesn't say Ambassador Zoellick shall have the power, or President \nClinton or President Bush shall have the power; it says the Congress \nshall have the power.\n  We have a lot of people here who have forgotten that or have decided \nto ignore it. But that is what the Constitution of the United States \nsays--Congress shall have the power. Fifty-five people wrote that over \n200 years ago. This Congress, well over two centuries later, has \napparently decided that it wishes to consider giving the President the \nauthority on trade with something called fast track. So it is \napparently not unconstitutional in the minds of some to give the \nPresident this authority, despite the fact that the Constitution says \nit is the Congress's authority. They would say it is not \nunconstitutional to give the President the authority to do this, but it \nis unconstitutional to direct the President to end secrecy in the \ntribunals. I don't understand that. That doesn't make any sense to me. \nOf course, we have a right to direct our trade negotiators to direct \nthis administration to negotiate an end to the secrecy in \nthese tribunals. Of course, we have a right to do that. Are we kidding? \nThe Constitution says we have the right.\n\n  This isn't some idle piece of paper. It is the Constitution of the \nUnited States. I don't want to hear that we don't have the authority to \ndo this. Of course we do.\n  The question for the Senate is this: In the future, both in this case \nand the next one, when one of our States, or our Government, takes \naction to protect our citizens against someone poisoning our water or \npolluting our air, and somebody files a large claim against the United \nStates for protecting its citizens, saying, by the way, you have \nviolated our trade laws and injured us; do you want the consideration \nof that dispute to be resolved in deep secrecy, behind closed doors, \nperhaps in a foreign land, with three people who will not tell you what \nthey are doing, what they have done, or why they have done it? Is that \nwhat you want for this country? I don't think so.\n  If you believe in open government, and in democracy, and in fair \ntrade, and in the Constitution, then you have to believe in this \namendment. This is not rocket science. This is common sense. Often, \ncommon sense finds a difficult road here in the Congress because it \nattracts comments by people who say, well, I know it sounds good, but \nit is not as easy as it sounds. This is as easy as it sounds, believe \nme. It is as easy as it sounds. All this country has to do, with \nrespect to Canada and Mexico, is to say with respect to our trade \nagreement that we will not be involved in secret tribunals. That is not \nthe American way and not something Congress will any longer support.\n  Why do we have to do this in this legislation? Because we have had \nour Trade Representative, Mr. Zoellick, already tell us that he would \nlike to end the secrecy.\n  Trade ministers from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico last year tried to \nimpose greater openness on a procedure under NAFTA that allows \ncompanies to sue governments for millions in monetary damages, but the \neffort has so far failed.\n  That is according to the Washington Times last month.\n  Charges of secrecy have dogged the chapter 11 process since its \ninception. Many NAFTA supporters now concede that the closed tribunals \nhave contributed to public distrust of the agreement, and advocate \ngreater openness for the procedure.\n  Our Trade Representative, Mr. Zoellick, has spoken on this issue. He \nwants more openness. But the fact is, these tribunals ignore it. The \nopenness doesn't now exist. There is still a veil of secrecy. That dis-\nserves the interests of this country. That is why this amendment is \nnecessary, and that is why the amendment is necessary now. No, it is \nnot unconstitutional--not at all.\n  This Congress has every right to speak on this subject. In fact, this \nCongress has a responsibility to speak on this subject. We know it is \nwrong to have a foreign corporation suing our Government because our \nGovernment is taking action to protect our consumers against poison in \nthe water. And then to throw that into a tribunal and tell the American \npeople, by the way, it is none of their business; they can't see it, \nhear it, or be a part of it, we know that is wrong. Everybody in this \nChamber knows that is wrong.\n  So we are going to vote on this amendment. As I said when I started, \nit is a bipartisan amendment. I have been joined by Senator Craig from \nIdaho, from the other party. I appreciate his cosponsorship and his \nwork with me on it. I think he believes, as I do--in fact, he expressed \nthat a few minutes ago on this floor--that we must take action to end \nthis secrecy. This is the place to do it and this is the time to do it. \nWe are now considering international trade. We are considering fast-\ntrack trade authority. This is the place and time to add this \namendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to table the Dorgan amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nTorricelli) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), and the Senator from \nUtah (Mr. Bennett) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no'' and the Senator from Kentucky \n(Mr. Bunning) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 29, nays 67, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 101 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--29\n\n     Allen\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Nickles\n     Santorum\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--67\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\n\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bennett\n     Bunning\n     Helms\n     Torricelli\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been informed by staff--I hope I \nhave been informed wrongly--that we are now not going to be allowed to \nvote on the underlying amendment, the Dorgan amendment.\n  Normally what happens here is that when a motion to table is defeated \nand the amendment is there, and it is such an overwhelming vote, it is \njust adopted by voice. But I have been told the minority will not allow \nus to do this.\n  I am troubled for a number of reasons, not the least of which is what \nhappened when the majority leader had breakfast with the President \nyesterday. I believe it was yesterday. It could have been the day \nbefore, but I am almost certain it was yesterday. At that breakfast, \nthe President told the majority leader and those other people assembled \nthat his No. 1 priority was this trade bill.\n  On the first amendment we offered, there is a filibuster.\n  If there is something in this bill that someone doesn't like, let him \nmove to strike that portion of the bill. There are all kinds of things \nthat can be done. But for us to be told that we cannot vote on this \nsays there is a filibuster taking place. I suggest--certainly the \ndecision is not mine, but I think the majority leader would have to \nstrongly consider filing a motion to invoke cloture. Certainly, when \nthe motion is defeated by such an overwhelming margin and we are now \ntold we cannot adopt the measure, it seems it is totally unfair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota, for a question, \nwithout losing the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I inquire whether the Senator has been \ninformed of the delay here being a delay because someone needs more \ntime to speak on this amendment. That is certainly reasonable.\n  I spoke on the amendment yesterday. I spoke on it this morning. \nOthers spoke on it this morning. Senator Craig, who is a cosponsor, \nspoke on it.\n  Unless there are others who wish to speak on the amendment--certainly \nthat is reasonable. But if that is not the reason, we have had plenty \nof time on this amendment. I thought we had. Then there was a tabling \nmotion. We should be ready to adopt the amendment. After all, 67 people \nvoted against tabling. One would expect there would be a pretty strong \nexpression here with respect to this amendment.\n  Was the Senator informed about the manner of the delay? Is it because \nthere needs to be more discussion on the underlying amendment or is \nthere some other reason?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota in answer to his \nquestion, we have just been through 6 or 7 weeks on the energy bill. On \nthat bill, we had a series of amendments pending. I think we got up to \nmaybe 15 or 16 amendments pending where people would offer amendments \nand then there would be no resolution of that amendment. It made it \nvery difficult to work through that bill.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, who had the wisdom and \nforesight to offer this amendment, that it appears clear we have an \neffort to stop the bill. I commented as the Senator from Texas was \ngiving his statement this morning, I have great respect for him. He \nobviously was a great professor. We know he has a Ph.D. in economics. \nHis statement was one that gave me the desire to listen to what he had \nto say.\n  As I was going through this, I said to myself: If I were on the other \nside and I didn't like this, I would simply move to strike part of it. \nBut the Senator has made his decision, and I respect that. As a result \nof that--I think it is too bad--I say to my friend from North Dakota, I \nthink the majority leader this afternoon should strongly consider \ninvoking cloture on this bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3389 to Amendment No. 3387\n\n  Madam President, while I have the floor, on behalf of Senator \nLieberman I call up an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Lieberman, for \n     himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Ms. Collins, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. Warner, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n     Corzine, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Graham, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Harkin, \n     Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Nelson of \n     Florida, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3389 to amendment No. 3387.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express solidarity with Israel in its fight against \n                               terrorism)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __. EXPRESSING SOLIDARTIY WITH ISRAEL IN ITS FIGHT \n                   AGAINST TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Israel are now engaged in a \n     common struggle against terrorism and are on the frontlines \n     of a conflict thrust upon them against their will.\n       (2) President George W. Bush declared on November 21, 2001, \n     ``We fight the terrorists and we fight all of those who give \n     them aid. America has a message for the nations of the world: \n     If you harbor terrorists, you are terrorists. If you train or \n     arm a terrorist, you are a terrorist. If you feed a terrorist \n     or fund a terrorist, you are a terrorist, and you will be \n     held accountable by the United States and our friends.''.\n       (3) The United States has committed to provide resources to \n     states on the frontline in the war against terrorism.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress--\n       (1) stands in solidarity with Israel, a frontline state in \n     the war against terrorism, as it takes necessary steps to \n     provide security to its people by dismantling the terrorist \n     infrastructure in the Palestinian areas;\n       (2) remains committed to Israel's right to self-defense;\n       (3) will continue to assist Israel in strengthening its \n     homeland defenses;\n       (4) condemns Palestinian suicide bombings;\n       (5) demands that the Palestinian Authority fulfill its \n     commitment to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in the \n     Palestinian areas;\n       (6) urges all Arab states, particularly the United States \n     allies, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to declare their unqualified \n     opposition to all forms of terrorism, particularly suicide \n     bombing, and to act in concert with the United States to stop \n     the violence; and\n       (7) urges all parties in the region to pursue vigorously \n     efforts to establish a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace \n     in the Middle East.\n\n  Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to the Senator from Connecticut \nfor the work he has done on this amendment.\n  During the time we have served together in the Senate, we have become \nfriends. But from my own perspective, I have come to rely on the \nSenator from Connecticut as someone who never does anything in a hurry. \nHe is very deliberate, thoughtful, and this amendment is in the style \nof Lieberman. So I want him to understand how much I appreciate--and I \nthink I speak for the whole Senate--the work he has done on this very \ndifficult matter that is going to be brought before the Senate. I hope \nwe can have some debate and vote very quickly.\n  I think the people of our country are expecting a good strong vote on \nthis issue, and they will get a good strong vote. There are a lot of \nreasons, not the least of which is the work done by the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nNevada, whose words were unexpected. They are unnecessary. But they are \ndeeply appreciated--in general and on the specific thanks for his \nsupport of this resolution.\n  I am proud to stand and urge adoption of this amendment, which \nembodies a resolution expressing solidarity with Israel in its fight \nagainst terrorism.\n  This amendment is a statement of fundamental principles. It is \ncosponsored by Senator Smith of Oregon, with\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\nwhom it has been a pleasure to work. The underlying resolution is also \ncosponsored by the majority leader, Senator Daschle, and the Republican \nleader, Senator Lott. At last count, we had well over a majority of \nMembers of the Senate cosponsoring the resolution which has now become \nthis amendment and, notably and encouragingly, with just about equal \nsupport from both Democrats and Republicans.\n  It is a fundamental principle of our foreign policy that terrorism is \nevil. It is not an acceptable form of political expression. It is also \na fundamental tenet of our policy that a government, a society, should \nand must protect itself against violent terrorism. Those policies \nunderlay most of recent memory, since the ugly head of terrorism reared \nitself in our history.\n  We have felt it with a particular intensity, pain and resolve, since \nSeptember 11 when we in America were brutally attacked by terrorists \nand lost the lives of more than 3,000 of our fellow Americans and \nfamily members in that attack.\n  After that attack, President Bush came before Congress with a very \nstirring, strong, and principled speech. Among other things, he \nenunciated a series of principles which have come to be known as ``The \nBush Doctrine.''\n  To state it as simply as I can, as I recall those words, the \nPresident spoke to the Joint Session of Congress in September. He said \nto the nations of the world:\n\n       Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\n\n  Then on November 22, 2001, the President said:\n\n       We fight the terrorists, and we fight all those who give \n     them aid. America has a message for the nations of the world. \n     If you harbor terrorists, you are terrorists. If you train or \n     arm a terrorist, you are a terrorist. If you feed a \n     terrorist, or fund a terrorist, you are a terrorist, and you \n     will be held accountable by the United States and our \n     friends.\n\n  The intention of this amendment, which Senator Smith, I, and others \nhave worked on--and which we have tried to fashion in a way to \nencourage the broadest statement by this Senate representing the \nAmerican people--is to embody and express those last words that I \nquoted from President Bush: If you support a terrorist in any way, you \nwill be held accountable by the United States and by our friends.\n  Israel is and has been a great friend of the United States. The \nUnited States has been a great friend to Israel. Our two nations are \ntied together by common values, by a common political system--\ndemocracy--by common strategic interests, and by the closest of \nrelationships between our military and intelligence systems.\n  Our friend, Israel, has been under siege from a systematic and \ndeliberate campaign of suicide and homicide attacks by terrorists. \nTheir essence is identical to the attacks on our country on September \n11. Those suicide bombers striking innocent Israelis in supermarkets, \nbuses, public squares, pizza restaurants, schools, and religious \nobservances are cut from the same cloth of evil as the terrorists who \nturned airplanes into weapons and struck the United States on September \n11.\n  So our country is engaged now with Israel and other allies in a \ncommon struggle against terrorism. But Israel, in particular, among our \nallies has found itself now on the front lines of a conflict thrust \nupon it against its will. In the absence of action by the Palestinian \nAuthority to suppress these acts of terrorism--in particular the \nabhorrent and inhumane practice of suicide and homicide bombings--the \nIsraeli Government has acted to protect its homeland, just as we have \nacted in so many ways, so courageously, so proudly, and so effectively \nsince September 11, to protect our homeland and our people in America.\n  The intention of this amendment is to put the Senate of the United \nStates on record in support of Israel's right to self-defense.\n  To state it in words that are direct, Congress stands in solidarity \nwith Israel--a front-line state in the war against terrorism--as it \ntakes necessary steps to provide security to its people, by dismantling \nthe terrorist infrastructure in the Palestinian areas, and remain \ncommitted to Israel's right to self-defense.\n  I welcome the easing of a recent standoff between Israel and the \nPalestinians achieved in the last few days, thanks in good measure to \neffective diplomacy by the Bush administration.\n\n  It is my fervent hope now that Chairman Arafat and Palestinian \nleaders will use this opportunity, as this amendment states, to \n``dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in the Palestinian areas and \nto pursue vigorously efforts to establish a just, lasting and \ncomprehensive peace.''\n  That is what the majority of Israelis want. I continue to hope and \nbelieve that is what the majority of Palestinians want--that the \nestablished leadership of the majority of the Palestinian people, whose \nlives have been so difficult, will take back the legitimate cause of \nPalestinian statehood from the suicide bombers and terrorists who have \nhijacked it.\n  A just, lasting, and comprehensive peace is also clearly what we in \nAmerica want. It has been our national policy for years now--certainly \nsince the Declaration of Principles that originated in Oslo and which \nwas signed on the White House lawn in September of 1993. The hope of \nour policy has been that we could be pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian, \nbut united together against terrorism. That is the thrust of this \namendment.\n  I also call on other friends in the region--in the Arab world \nparticularly--to work with us, to use all their best efforts to help \nbring about an end to the violence and a dismantling of the \ninfrastructure of terror, not only in the Palestinian territories but \nalso the elements in their own countries that have aided and abetted \nterrorists, or that give militant, extremist, hateful ideas legitimacy.\n  America will never countenance terrorism. We stand with those who \noppose terrorism and against those who support it in any form. That is \nthe message of this amendment--a message which I hope will have the \noverwhelming support of the Members of this body.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am privileged to stand on the \nSenate floor today with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, as a cosponsor of this amendment. He and I stand here \nagainst the wishes of the administration that we--the Congress, and \nspecifically the Senate--would involve ourselves at this delicate time. \nAnd we are not here to be indelicate. We are here because the Founders \nof this country set up a framework in which the Congress--the Senate \nspecifically--has responsibilities when it comes to foreign affairs.\n  I remember during the Clinton administration we would often do this, \nand it would upset their apple cart.\n  I am proud as a Republican to be here to do this and upset the apple \ncart of the Bush administration--not with any malignancy but because of \na principle I feel very personally and deeply about; that is, we as \nelected Members of this body have a right, and indeed an obligation, to \nstand up and be counted right now at this critical hour no matter what \napple cart is overturned in the process.\n  Most of us who serve in this body are of an age when our earliest \nmemories of life are of a black and white television set with \nflickering pictures. I recall as a little boy seeing accounts of the \n20th century--my century. I was born in this meridian. I remember the \npictures indelibly impressed on my mind of the Holocaust that occurred \nin Europe.\n  I remember seeing the pictures of the bodies of the children of \nIsrael being bulldozed into mass graves. And I remember, at an early \nage, as somebody who has always been interested in public life, feeling \npride that my country stood by as an ally to the children of Israel as \nthey sought to establish a homeland in their ancestral land.\n  Many people can differ on interpretations of Scripture. I remember in \nthe Presidential election, Joe Lieberman was once asked a question. I \nloved his answer. He was asked: Senator, if you could interview anybody \nin history, who would it be? And he said: I would interview Moses, and \nI would interview Jesus. And he as a Jew and I as a Christian, I think, \nwould answer the same way. I would like to interview Moses. I would \nlike to interview Jesus to better understand this great conflict that \nhas the whole world consumed by it.\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\n  I am pleased to stand in this Chamber in support of this amendment \nbecause we need to be on record as a nation, as a Senate, as a body \nhere, in unity with Israel at this critical hour.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article by George Will in this morning's Washington Post. It is \nentitled `` `Final Solution,' Phase 2.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 2, 2002]\n\n                      ``Final Solution,'' Phase 2\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Such is the richness of European culture, even its \n     decadence is creative. Since 1945 it has produced the truly \n     remarkable phenomenon of anti-Semitism without Jews. How does \n     Europe do that?\n       Now it offers Christian anti-Semitism without the \n     Christianity. An example of this is the recent cartoon in La \n     Stampa--a liberal Italian newspaper--depicting the infant \n     Jesus in a manger, menaced by an Israeli tank and saying \n     ``Don't tell me they want to kill me again.'' This reprise of \n     that hardy perennial, Jews as Christ-killers, clearly still \n     strikes a chord in contemporary Italy, where the culture is \n     as secular as a supermarket.\n       In Britain the climate created by much of the \n     intelligentsia, including the elite press, is so toxic that \n     the Sun, a tabloid with more readers than any other British \n     newspaper, recently was moved to offer a contrapuntal \n     editorial headlined ``The Jewish faith is not an evil \n     religion.'' Contrary to what Europeans are encouraged to \n     think. And Ron Rosenbaum, author of the brilliant book \n     ``Explaining Hitler,'' acidly notes the scandal of European \n     leaders supporting the Palestinians' ``right of return''--the \n     right to inundate and eliminate the state created in response \n     to European genocide--``when so many Europeans are still \n     living in homes stolen from Jews they helped murder.''\n       It is time to face a sickening fact that is much more \n     obvious today than it was 11 years ago, when Ruth R. Wisse \n     asserted it. In a dark and brilliant essay in Commentary \n     magazine, she argued that anti-Semitism has proved to be \n     ``the most durable and successful'' ideology of the ideology-\n     besotted 20th century.\n       Successful? Did not Hitler, the foremost avatar of anti-\n     Semitism, fail? No, he did not. Yes, his 1,000-year Reich \n     fell 988 years short. But its primary work was mostly done. \n     Hitler's primary objective, as he made clear in words and \n     deeds, was the destruction of European Jewry.\n       Wisse, who in 1991 was a professor of Yiddish literature at \n     McGill University and who now is at Harvard, noted that many \n     fighting faiths, including socialism and communism, had \n     arisen in the 19th century to ``explain and to rectify the \n     problems'' of modern society. Fascism soon followed. But \n     communism is a cold intellectual corpse. Socialism, born and \n     raised in France, is unpersuasive even to the promiscuously \n     persuadable French: The socialist presidential candidate has \n     suffered the condign humiliation of failing to qualify for \n     this Sunday's runoff, having been defeated by an anti-Semitic \n     ``populist'' preaching watery fascism.\n       Meanwhile, anti-Semitism is a stronger force in world \n     affairs than it has been since it went into a remarkably \n     brief eclipse after the liberation of the Nazi extermination \n     camps in 1945. The United Nations, supposedly an embodiment \n     of lessons learned from the war that ended in 1945, is not \n     the instrument for lending spurious legitimacy to the anti-\n     Semites' war against the Jewish state founded by survivors of \n     that war.\n       Anti-Semitism's malignant strength derives from its \n     simplicity--its stupidity, actually. It is a primitivism \n     which, Wisse wrote, makes up in vigor what it lacks in \n     philosophic heft, and does so precisely because it ``has no \n     prescription for the improvement of society beyond the \n     elimination of part of society.'' This howl of negation has \n     no more affirmative content than did the scream of the \n     airliner tearing down the Hudson, heading for the World Trade \n     Center.\n       Today many people say that the Arabs and their European \n     echoes would be mollified if Israel would change its \n     behavior. People who say that do not understand the \n     centrality of anti-Semitism in the current crisis. This \n     crisis has become the second--and final?--phase of the \n     struggle for a ``final solution to the Jewish question.'' As \n     Wisse said 11 years ago, and as cannot be said too often, \n     anti-Semitism is not directed against the behavior of the \n     Jews but against the existence of the Jews.\n       If the percentage of the world's population that was Jewish \n     in the era of the Roman Empire were Jewish today, there would \n     be 200 million Jews. There are 13 million. Five million are \n     clustered in an embattled salient on the eastern shore of the \n     Mediterranean, facing hundreds of millions of enemies. Ron \n     Rosenbaum writes, ``The concentration of so many Jews in one \n     place--and I use the word `concentration' advisedly--gives \n     the world a chance to kill the Jews en masse again.''\n       Israel holds just one one-thousandth of the world's \n     population, but holds all the hopes for the continuation of \n     the Jewish experience as a portion of the human narrative. \n     Will Israel be more durable than anti-Semitism? Few things \n     have been.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I would like to read briefly a couple of \nparagraphs from his article because I think they encapsulate why it is \nso important that America not waiver at this critical hour. Writes Mr. \nWill:\n\n       Today many people say that the Arabs and their European \n     echoes would be mollified if Israel would change its \n     behavior. People who say that do not understand the \n     centrality of anti-Semitism in the current crisis. This \n     crisis has become the second--and final?--phase of the \n     struggle for a ``final solution to the Jewish question.'' As \n     [Ruth] Wisse said 11 years ago, and as cannot be said too \n     often, anti-Semitism is not directed against the behavior of \n     Jews but against the existence of the Jews.\n       If the percentage of the world's population that was Jewish \n     in the era of the Roman Empire were Jewish today, there would \n     be 200 million Jews [in the world]. There are [only] 13 \n     million. Five million are clustered in an embattled salient \n     on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, facing hundreds of \n     millions of enemies. Ron Rosenbaum writes, ``The \n     concentration of so many Jews in one place--and I use the \n     word 'concentration' advisedly--gives the world a chance to \n     kill the Jews en masse again.''\n\n  I say, Mr. President, that the pride I felt as a young boy in Harry \nTruman's defense of Israel in its infancy is pride that I feel as an \nAmerican today. And I call upon our Government not to waiver but to \nmake sure that since the Holocaust, on America's watch, when America is \na leader in the world, we never stand idly by and see the children of \nIsrael subjected to another Holocaust.\n  Joe Lieberman and I have crafted an amendment that I think fairly \ncalls upon all the parties to produce a just and lasting peace. But it \ndoes state, without equivocation, we stand with Israel on the front \nline in the war against terrorism, and we support it in taking \n``necessary steps to provide security to its people by dismantling the \nterrorist infrastructure in the Palestinian areas. . . .''\n  We would do no less if terrorists came into our country, into our \nshopping malls, into our schools, and murdered our children. And we \nshould demand nothing less of Israel's Government.\n  Yes, we do condemn the Palestinian suicide bombers. But we call upon \nboth sides to pursue efforts to establish a just and lasting peace in \nthe Middle East. But America must stand firmly, and we must be unique \namong the nations of the world in rejecting anti-Semitism and standing \nby the ancestral home of the children of Judah.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to come and vote for this \namendment, and with conviction, so that when the Prime Minister of \nIsrael comes here next week, he will know that he has friends in high \nplaces in this Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nOregon for the work we have done together on this amendment, but \nreally, for the moment, for the statement he has just made, which is a \nstatement of moral clarity and principles that are consistent with the \nhighest ideals of our country.\n  That is exactly what this amendment is about: The moral clarity of \nour own war against terrorism, and the understanding that gives us of \nthe right of self-defense that the Israelis have, but the universalist \nprinciples that have been at the foundation of the American experience \nfrom the very beginning in the Declaration of Independence, when those \nrights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were declared as \nself-evident truths, from where endowed were not from the Founders, not \nfrom any philosophers of the Enlightenment, but from the Creator. And \nthat unity that flows from that, the humanity that flows from that, the \nprinciples and policies that flow from that are exactly the ones that \nare upheld in this amendment and have been eloquently expressed by my \nfriend from Oregon.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Smith, for bringing this amendment forth. They are serving an \nimportant purpose today to bring clarity back into the debate--a \nclarity\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\nwhich has eluded some pundits and some talking heads and others who \nappear on the news and as result of which confuses the situation at a \ntime when it requires a very clear-eyed approach by the United States.\n  Like it or not, we are in a position where everyone calls upon us to \nhelp solve problems of the world, including this most intractable \nproblem in the Middle East. But as it turns out, we are in a unique \nposition to influence matters in the right way, if we look at the \nsituation clearly.\n  What I appreciate about this amendment being brought to the floor \ntoday is that it brings us back to the first principles. It says, let's \nget back to where we started in our war on terror in analyzing where \nothers are, where they should be.\n  It makes the point that the United States and Israel are on the front \nline in this war on terrorism, that our goals and objectives are the \nsame, and that therefore the United States is not only obligated to \nrecognize Israel's rights for its sake but also for the sake of the war \nwe are conducting.\n  It brings us back to a position of clarity in the way we analyze the \nsituation, which is why the amendment is so important today.\n  I appreciate their bringing it forth and look forward to expressing \nmy support through voting for it as well.\n  I am so disappointed, in talking with some close friends and watching \nthe news to see the kind of confusion that creeps into the debate when \npropagandists, who have their own agenda, and people without a clear \nunderstanding combine to create disinformation and misimpressions about \nwhat really is at stake.\n  When I see talk about a cycle of violence, when I see a great \nemphasis placed on the question of when the Israelis are going to \nwithdraw, to the exclusion of any expressed concern about the horror of \nthe terror that is being visited upon the Israeli people, when I see \nquestions about why we would not allow the United Nations to come in \nand investigate a massacre--an alleged massacre--without any seeming \nconcern for the obvious massacre, which is essentially undenied, that \nhas occurred week after week after week for the last 18 months, there \nseems to be such a distortion of the picture here that it almost \nboggles the mind. It requires an amendment of this sort to bring us \nback to the reality of what is happening. It is almost as if there is a \nclouded lens in front of some people's eyes and an amendment such as \nthis is necessary to remove that cloud so that we can clearly see what \nis happening. And what is happening is that just as the United States \nwas attacked by terrorists, Israel has been attacked by terrorists.\n\n  The President has said whatever grievance one might have, terrorism \nis an illegitimate response which the whole world must rise up to \ndefeat and those who temporize with it, those who rationalize it are \njust as bad as those who support it and harbor it because they allow it \nto continue. They allow a great confusion to exist which makes it more \ndifficult for us to do what has to be done in fighting the war on \nterror.\n  That is why this measure which brings us back to the clarity of \npurpose is so timely and why it is so important.\n  Mr. President, I conclude with this thought: The United States is not \nright in everything, but one reason that most of the world has looked \nup to us most of the time is because of the moral clarity of our \npositions. People will disagree with us, they will be uncomfortable \nwith what that moral clarity requires them to do, they will find \nreasons not to join us in these activities, but at the end of the day, \nif you give people a choice of whether you would like to come to the \nUnited States of America to live, ``What do you think about the moral \npositions of the United States,'' more often than not people would have \nto admit, at least in their heart of hearts, that the United States \npursues its action out of what we fundamentally believe is right for \nthe reasons that do not have so much to do with our own vested \ninterests as they do with the good of humanity, of mankind.\n  When the President commits the United States to conducting this war \non terror, it is not just for the American people, but it is to help \nrid the world of a form of evil which can afflict all people of the \nworld. The President is able to galvanize not only American public \nsupport but support around the world because of the moral clarity of \nthat purpose.\n  Terrorism is evil. It has to be defeated. There is no compromise with \nit. Therefore, at some point in time you have to choose to be with us \nor against us in fighting it. You cannot remain on the sidelines. You \ncannot be neutral about something that is so terrible.\n  Therefore, it is critical for leaders in the United States to keep \nreminding people of the fundamental, clear rationale for American \naction. When we get back to that clear, fundamental rationale of good \nversus evil, then we can see clearly how the principle applies in other \nsituations. The other situation that we are referring to today is the \nsituation in the Middle East in which certain terrorists, who are \nPalestinian by and large, are attacking innocent civilians who, by and \nlarge, are Israeli citizens in a way which is clearly evil: Terrorism \nagainst innocent people.\n  No amount of testimony temporizing or rationalizing or expression of \ngrievance or pointing of fingers or anything else can change that \nfundamental fact. Unless we are able to look at this that clearly, it \nis possible to become confused, to begin to support compromises, to \nbegin to suggest negotiations of fundamental principle. All of those \nthings are a slippery slope which lead to disaster, which do nothing \nbut ultimately demonstrate to terrorists that there is hope for them in \ntheir terror.\n  As was pointed out by former Prime Minister Netanyahu, the key to \nfighting terrorism is to remove the hope that terrorists have that by \nconducting this evil enterprise, they can actually succeed in what they \nare attempting to achieve. Once that hope is removed, then reasonable \npeople can discuss reasonable solutions to the real problems of \nPalestinians and Israelis, a Palestinian State can be created and all \nof the things that right-thinking people in the region hope for can \ncome to pass. But that is not possible as long as a small group of \npeople believe and hope that they can achieve their radical aims \nthrough the means of terror.\n  That hope has to be removed. It will not be removed if leaders of the \nworld temporize and suggest that you can reach accommodations with \nthese people for one reason or another, in one way or another. That \nhope can only be realized if there is a continuing commitment to a \nclear principle that terrorism is wrong; you cannot compromise with it. \nYou have to face up to it. Tough. Deal with it. And if that means that \nthe United States has to support the Government of Israel in rolling \nback the terror that it has been faced with, then so be it. That is our \ngoal as much as it is Israel's goal.\n  This amendment gets back to that first principle and expresses the \nUnited States commitment not only to fight the war on terrorism but to \njoin others who are doing so, such as our good friend and ally, Israel. \nThat is what this amendment brings us back to--moral clarity, as the \nSenator from Connecticut just said.\n  We have to be clear-eyed in our fight here or the rest of the world \nis not going to support us. They will view our effort as unclear, as \ncompromisable, and, therefore, one which is not assured of victory. It \nwill only be assured of victory if we hold this beacon out here that we \nare going to continue to pursue, which is clear, which is unassailable \nfrom its moral perspective. If we remain true to that, then we will be \nvictorious in this war of terror and the good people of Israel will be \nhappy for that future as well.\n  I commend my colleagues for bringing this amendment to the floor, and \nI very much look forward to supporting it with my vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  I want to commend my colleagues, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, for putting together \nthis amendment. I will say first, I want to take my hat off to both of \nthem. There have not been two Senators who have been more stalwart and \nmore farsighted and stronger in their support of what is right in the \nMiddle East. I think it is great that we are considering this \namendment. I think it is timely, and I really do again wish to commend \nboth Senator Lieberman and\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\nSenator Smith not only for this amendment but for their strong, \nunwavering support on this issue.\n  Let me say first that I read the amendment and I said, finally. \nBecause it is almost as if the rest of the world sees the Middle East \nthrough a kaleidescope that changes everything upside down: right \nbecomes wrong, wrong becomes right; defending yourself is worse than \ncommitting the offense; terrorism is explainable, and you sympathize \nwith it. And yet you can justify--and so many do, not just Palestinians \nbut in the rest of world--shooting a 5-year-old girl in her bed, taking \na bomb and bringing it to a discotheque filled with teenagers, filled \nwith life and hope, and it seems the rest of the world is bending \nitself and contorting itself to understand why that has happened \ninstead of looking at the world as it is and saying the beleaguered \nnation here is Israel.\n  That is the bottom line. That is what this amendment talks about in \npart. That is the truth.\n  I was at a department store a few weeks back and two gentlemen came \nover to me and said: Senator Schumer, we like your policies, but we \nreally don't agree with Israel. When we got into it, they said: Why \nwould young people kill themselves unless they were truly aggrieved? I \nsaid to them: Do you believe that about Mr. Atta and the 19 hijackers; \ndo you believe that about Osama bin Laden and all of those he asks to \nkill themselves? Just because somebody will take extreme means does not \nmean they are right. And to some, particularly some of my friends at \nthe far left side of the political spectrum, there is almost a knee-\njerk reaction in that regard. This amendment sets things straight. Let \nme make a couple of points about it.\n\n  First, the war on terrorism is the world's war on terrorism. We \ncannot make an exception. Once we make one exception, there are others.\n  What is terrorism? We all know what it is. It is deliberately killing \ninnocent civilians within a nation's homeland. The bottom line is \nsimple: If you condemn terrorism in Afghanistan, if you condemn \nterrorism in Europe, and if you condemn terrorism in Asia, it is \ninexorable; to be consistent, you must condemn it when it is exacted \nagainst Israel.\n  I do not know why so many--the Arab world and particularly some in \nEurope--seem to have a double standard and seem to believe that \nterrorism is intolerable in the rest of the world and when directed at \nthem, but it is OK to be directed at Israel.\n  My second point is, we have to face a hard truth, I say to my \ncolleagues, and that is this: A vast majority of Israelis want peace \nand want to live side by side in peace--no violence--with the \nPalestinians. Unfortunately, I do not think it is true on the other \nside.\n  A majority of Palestinians--there is a minority who do--do not \nbelieve in the State of Israel. They have been taught by the \nPalestinian Authority and Yasser Arafat that all of Israel is theirs. \nThe Palestinian Authority textbooks show not just Jerusalem, but Tel \nAviv, Ashdod, Ashqeion, cities on the coast, as belonging to the \ngreater Palestine. Add that to the fact they believe terrorism is a \nproper means to achieve their goal, and peace is almost impossible.\n  Unless that attitude is pushed back, as this amendment attempts to \ndo, I do not think you can achieve peace.\n  Third, as this amendment states, Israel has every right to defend \nherself. Who would ask any nation when every day the bombs were going \noff in pizza shops, on buses, in streets, to understand and sit down \nand talk with the very people who, if they did not create the bombings, \nallowed it to occur and were joyous when they did occur--who would ask \nany nation to do that? No. Why are some--thank God not too many in this \ncountry--why are some saying that is OK?\n  This amendment tries to restore some balance. When Israel defended \nherself against these suicide bombings--and thank God thus far it seems \nsuccessful; there are still some, but not every day, not with the same \nhorrible consequences of the earlier ones--she did so in a careful way. \nShe did not bomb from the air. Even in Jenin, the Israeli soldiers \nknocked on doors: Is there anyone here? Please get out; you may be in \ndanger. I do not know of many countries that would do that, and that \ndoes not seem to even get recognized.\n  Another point is the U.N. The U.N. sets itself up as an arbiter of \npeace when it wants to and then resumes its one-sided actions. We have \none Israel and one United States and just about no one else in the \nUnited Nations understanding the fairness and balance that need to be \ndone. But when Israel says she does not want the United Nations to set \nitself up as an impartial arbiter, who can blame Israel? I know Mr. \nKofi Annan, but I have been terribly disappointed in his failure to be \nevenhanded as he proceeds.\n  I have one criticism of this amendment. I am fully supportive of it. \nI am a cosponsor. But I think the amendment is missing six letters--A-\nR-A-F-A-T. We should be naming Yasser Arafat in this amendment because \nthe bottom line is, Yasser Arafat, as everyone admits, as our own \nPresident has spoken, is not an implement to peace; he is an obstacle \nto peace.\n\n  Dennis Ross, President Clinton's previous adviser who labored so hard \nto produce a peaceful solution, afterward said--and he said it \nrepeatedly and now has said it publicly--that their biggest mistake was \nrelying on Yasser Arafat.\n  Yasser Arafat is in charge of the Al Aqsa brigade which our country \nhas branded a terrorist organization. Yasser Arafat cheers the homicide \nbombers who blow themselves up and take innocent people with them. \nYasser Arafat had to be told by our Secretary of State to say the same \nthing in Arabic and English. If that is not saying you speak with \nduplicity and forked tongue, what is?\n  He has to be asked to step up to the plate, and I hope that as this \namendment wends its way through the process, we will explicitly mention \nhim by name because, at the very minimum, he is like the Taliban, and \nprobably he is more like al-Qaida itself. We cannot let him slip away \nfrom this inexorable equation that terrorism is bad and if you are not \nagainst it, you are not on our side. With Arafat it is even worse, \nbecause he is for it and uses it as an instrument to policy.\n  This is a fine amendment, and I am proud to support it. As I say, I \nwish it had explicitly mentioned Yasser Arafat who has been an obstacle \nto peace. But the beauty of this amendment, the strength of this \namendment is it does restore some right to what every fairminded person \nsees as going on in the world. I thank my colleagues for doing it.\n  I have one final point. This backward vision of so many is \nconfounding. When I read in the newspaper that there was an attempt to \ntake the Nobel Peace Prize away from Shimon Peres but not Yasser Arafat \nfrom some on the Nobel committee, I had to scratch my head and wonder: \nWhat is going on in so much of the world and why isn't even a bit of \ntruth seen?\n  This amendment I hope will be read not only by our colleagues and \nAmerican citizens but by citizens throughout the world because it does \nrestore some fairness and balance, particularly at a time when \nbeleaguered people, the Israelis, are trying to defend themselves \nagainst the evil force of terrorism.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, quite often we are not together on \nlegislation. In this case, we are. It was my wish we would have a \nstronger amendment. There was one in the House that mentioned Yasser \nArafat. I think we should be mentioning Yasser Arafat.\n  We are in a war on terrorism. He is a terrorist. Sometimes we forget \nthat in 1973 he gunned down three of our diplomats, including our U.S. \nAmbassador. He fits every description, every definition of a terrorist. \nAll of us need to rise up and fight our battles, including Israel. This \namendment is not strong enough, but I do support it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. It is a fine amendment. I wish it \nmentioned Yasser Arafat, but I am fully in support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join other colleagues in commending our \ndistinguished junior Senator from the State of Connecticut, with whom I \nam privileged to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, for his\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\nleadership, and my colleague from Oregon for his service on the Foreign \nRelations Committee and for taking this initiative.\n  This is done in a true spirit of bipartisan leadership in our \nwonderful Senate. It comes at a timely moment. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor because I firmly believe the portions of this amendment that \nrelate to this conflict are well stated and should be studied and read \nby all.\n  I am grateful that the leadership of the Senate, in my understanding, \nworking with the executive branch, has decided it is timely for the \nSenate to act on this particular amendment. As I have often noted, the \nexecutive branch proposes, but the Congress disposes. In matters of \nforeign policy, however, the President has a principal role in guiding \nthe affairs of the United States, and the Congress should follow his \nlead, wherever possible. Timely, informed debate about matters, such as \nthe one before us, that include divergent views and new ideas are \nintended to assist the executive branch as they perform their \nchallenging, often daunting responsibilities.\n  I rise today to express my profound and growing concern about the \nconflict between Israel and the Palestinian people, and to express my \nsupport for the amendment before the Senate, which recognizes that \nIsrael is engaged in an all-out war against terrorism in its homeland.\n  Implicitly, the amendment recognizes the loss of life and the human \nsuffering of both sides of this conflict. I feel strongly that this \ncurrent conflict is of such gravity as to demand the attention of \nCongress and, most specifically, the Senate, and also demands our most \nvalued resources and our best possible effort.\n  There is an ill wind blowing out of the Middle East that we have not \nexperienced before. We have seen conflict, indeed, for centuries. But \nthis one is different. It is a force that could fan the flames of \nconflict out of control, unless we act soon to stop this unending \nviolence and human suffering.\n  All of us have listened for years as this problem has erupted from \ntime to time. We have discussed it and debated it. The unfortunate end \nof much of this discussion is a grim resignation by some that this is \nan insoluble problem. I do not believe it is insoluble. We cannot \naccept that as an answer, and I join those who refuse to recognize it \nas unsolvable. But it is solvable only if we work together for a common \nsolution--only if we put forward our own ideas, which may not be \nconsistent, or expressed, or affirmed by others. That is basically what \nI am about to do.\n  I commend our President, the Secretary of State Colin Powell, and \nSecretary Rumsfeld, with whom a group of us met yesterday, for the \npersistence this administration has shown and for its leadership role. \nUnderstandably, there is a legitimate debate as to whether certain \nactions they have taken, or not taken, were timely or done in a manner \nthat fully reflects the need to stop this terrible conflict. But I \nthink we can examine the past at another time. It seems to me that, \njust by keeping both sides talking, our President and the \nadministration are renewing hope in a region that is virtually devoid \nof any optimism. Hope is important in the near term, but hope is not a \nmethod for a long-term solution. Bold ideas are needed, and they are \nneeded now.\n\n  Something has changed in this chapter of the long history of conflict \nin the Middle East, and it is time we recognize it and face up to it \nand give our best judgment as to how to end it. The anti-Israeli and \nanti-United States sentiments in the Arab world are stronger than they \nhave ever been before. I have had the opportunity to associate with \nthat part of the world ever since I was Under Secretary of the Navy and \nfirst visited there early in 1970-71. Thereafter, I have been back many \ntimes. At that time, our Navy put an installation in Bahrain, and I \nworked on other military installations in the region. I have been back \na number of times, as have others.\n  Unfortunately, certain negative sentiments are growing as young, \nfrustrated Arabs, with few prospects for ever enjoying happiness or \nopportunities--such as we enjoy in this country or are enjoyed \nelsewhere in the world--believe all is lost. They have a distorted \nimage and understanding of the Israeli people and the need for the \nIsraeli people to live safely within the safe, recognized borders.\n  The recent suicide bombings are something that I personally have \ndifficulty comprehending. Only once before in history can I recall this \nscale of suicide, and that was in the closing months of World War II. I \nwas a young sailor in a training command and we witnessed from afar the \ntragic suicide operations in the Battle of Okinawa, where Japanese \npilots were strapped into their aircraft and their aircraft were used \nas missiles, devouring them and their lives. That was a tragic chapter \nin the war in the Pacific. It was shortly thereafter that President \nTruman made the decision to end that war as quickly as possible, \nutilizing means that we all recognize now.\n  Unfortunately, the negative sentiments in the Arab world that foment \nirrational suicides and other radical actions are growing and we have \nto do everything we can to reverse it. If we do not act to preserve the \nwill of the vast majority of peoples in the Middle East, the radical \nminorities may well gain further advantage, and that we cannot allow. \nThe result would be increased killing, and, indeed, it threatens to \nundermine the position of the United States in that part of the world--\na position that many administrations have worked hard on, and that many \nindividuals have conscientiously worked on over the years. We cannot \nallow that to be further eroded. Our position in the Middle East and \nour ability to successfully wage war against terrorism globally is at \nstake. I share these thoughts with my colleagues.\n  There has been no shortage of experts and observers offering opinions \nand ideas for ending the violence and solving--or at least mitigating--\nthis crisis. I add my voice with this idea: First and foremost, we must \nfoster in every way possible a cease-fire. Clearly, this has been \nelusive in the past, and other cease-fires have lasted only for brief \nperiods. But this one must take on a permanence. The Israelis want the \nacknowledged right to exist in the region within safe and secure \nborders. The Palestinians want an independent state. The Bush \nadministration has stated its support for both goals. I commend our \nPresident. This must be the basis of any cease-fire.\n  At the time of the cease-fire, of course, the parties must attempt, \nin good faith, to reconcile the many differences that exist. That will \ntake time and careful, conscientious negotiations. During that period \nof negotiation, there must be stability in that region. By stability, I \nmean stopping the suicide bombings, stopping the incursion of armored \nvehicles into the areas where the Palestinians live. That must be \nmaintained, for an indefinite period, while the negotiations take \nplace. To guarantee that this cease-fire is effective, it is my hope \nthat there will be a recognition by both the Palestinians and the \nIsraelis of the need to have an outside, independent, objective force--\ncall them peacekeepers--come in and establish a cessation of the \nconflict, such that conscientious negotiations can take place--\nestablish a cessation of the conflict so one cannot resume the conflict \nin order to gain some point or points in the course of the \nnegotiations. It must remain absolutely static until the negotiations \nhave run their course--hopefully successfully--with the conclusion that \nwill be accepted by both sides in the form of a peace agreement, or \ntreaty, or whatever the case may be.\n\n  Those are the two fundamentals--a cease-fire and a willingness by \nboth sides to recognize that an independent, impartial force must come \nin for peacekeeping purposes. It must be at the invitation of both \nsides. You cannot thrust such a military force upon either side. It has \nto be jointly accepted.\n  Now, who should undertake that? Others have their views, and I have \nmine. I feel very strongly--and this is not a well-received thought at \nthe moment, but it should be considered--that the NATO forces are the \nlogical, best force to come in at this time, following the cease-fire \nand the willingness of both parties to accept outside military forces.\n  They are the best choice because, No. 1, they are trained and they \nare ready to go on short notice. They are trained in peacekeeping--\nBosnia and Kosovo being examples.\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\n  It represents 19 nations, so the coalition is in place. Any other \npeacekeeping option would require building a political coalition, which \nwould require considerable time. We have to act promptly. We have to \nmove with trained forces, and we have to move with a coalition that has \nbeen in place and has the internal structure, command, and control to \ntake on this serious and very difficult mission.\n  NATO troops, as I said, are ready to roll. NATO is an established \ncoalition, as I mentioned, with a proven record of success.\n  Then there is the added advantage--and again this is my own thought--\nthere is a perception that the United States has a bias towards only \nthe Israeli perspective in this conflict, and I am not going to try and \nreconcile that now. Indeed, we value a strong relationship with the \nState of Israel and we have done so for a very long period of time, and \nwe will continue, in my judgment, to do that.\n  On the other side, there is a perception that the European nations \nhave a bias in favor of the Palestinian interests. I am not here to \ndebate that.\n  To me, there is an advantage to bringing the United States and our \nNATO partners in Europe together to assume responsibility, with their \nmilitary forces, for the peacekeeping mission. To me, that would lessen \nsome of the debate on which side has a perception that the other side \nis not looking at this conflict in a manner that truly will resolve it, \nresolve it such that both parties can accept eventually a peace \nagreement.\n  In April of 1999, at its 50th anniversary summit in Washington, DC, \nNATO adopted a new strategic concept which expanded NATO's \nresponsibilities in overall global security issues. I will read from \nit. This is found in part 1, paragraph 10 of the strategic concept \nadopted roughly 23-24 April 1999. I remember it well. I was not \nentirely in favor and so expressed my concerns about NATO moving beyond \nwhat I felt was the parameters of the original charter. The strategic \nconcept identifies the ``fundamental security tasks'' of NATO and \nincludes in those tasks to do the following: `` . . . to stand ready to \ncontribute to effective conflict prevention and to engage actively in \ncrisis management, including crisis response operations.'' I read \ndirectly from the document.\n  The current situation, in my judgment, demands immediate concern and \nsupport for all those who want a civilized, peaceful future in the \nMiddle East. Decisive action is now called upon. This is a concept that \nshould be carefully considered in the course of the days and weeks to \ncome as we work to achieve a cease-fire and then in working for a \npeaceful solution.\n  I also will read from two articles that appeared in the press. One on \nWednesday, April 17, Wall Street Journal, by Eliot Cohen, ``Keepers of \nWhat Peace?'' he states a position contrary to mine:\n\n       As an alternative, there is more and more talk of sending \n     American troops, possibly as part of an international \n     operation, to separate the two sides and keep the peace. Such \n     notions have been bruited about before, most notably on the \n     Golan Heights, but never in this context. It is an \n     appallingly bad idea.\n       Peacekeeping works best under one of two situations: When \n     both sides want the peacekeepers to ratify a cease fire line \n     or boundary that both can live with almost indefinitely as, \n     for example, Cyprus, or once one side has been decisively \n     beaten, as in today's Yugoslavia. Peacekeeping is not like \n     normal military activities.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 17, 2002]\n\n                         Keepers of What Peace?\n\n                            (By Eliot Cohen)\n\n       The viciousness of the Israeli-Palestinian war that erupted \n     a year and a half ago following the collapse of a decade of \n     assiduous mediation by the United States and others has given \n     birth to a number of bad ideas for restoring peace. Most of \n     these involve invocations of the Tenet and Mitchell plans, \n     whose texts few have read, but which are premised upon some \n     degree of Israeli-Palestinian trust. Such confidence does \n     not, and cannot exist in the near-term.\n       As an alternative, there is more and more talk of sending \n     American troops, possibly as part of an international \n     operation, to separate the two sides and keep the peace. Such \n     notions have been bruited about before (most notably on the \n     Golan Heights), but never in this context. It is an \n     appallingly bad idea.\n       Peacekeeping works best under one of two situations: When \n     both sides want the peacekeepers to ratify a cease-fire line \n     or boundary that both can live with almost indefinitely (as, \n     for example, in Cyprus), or once one side has been decisively \n     beaten (as in today's Yugoslavia). Peacekeeping is not like \n     normal military activity. Soldiers preparing to fight try to \n     be stealthy, collect intelligence clandestinely, and devise \n     ways to surprise an enemy with sudden and effective violence. \n     Peacekeepers must be visible, have communications that are \n     largely transparent to both sides, and avoid surprise while \n     using minimum violence.\n       It is, despite what some say, a job for soldiers, but a job \n     for specially trained soldiers and one which often interferes \n     with their preparation for combat. It is a draining effort, \n     as well: the rule of thumb has it that for every peacekeeper, \n     another two soldiers are tied up, either preparing to deploy \n     or recovering from deployment. When one takes into account \n     the various forms of support needed for peacekeepers in the \n     field a more realistic ratio is five to one.\n       To be sure, what we now call peacekeeping is a necessary \n     military function at some times--it is important today in \n     Afghanistan and Yugoslavia, as it was half a century ago in \n     Germany and Japan. But no one should doubt the level of \n     effort it would require--an increase in military end strength \n     of 100,000 or more troops would not be an unrealistic \n     estimate of what it would take. More importantly, though, \n     Israel and the Palestinian territories are profoundly unripe \n     for such a venture.\n       Between Israel and the Palestinian Authority there is no \n     trust, no agreed demarcations of a cease-fire line, let alone \n     a boundary. The threat to security comes not, on the \n     Palestinian side, from a regular armed force with which one \n     can have conventional liaison relationships, but from several \n     shadowy organizations, several of which operate independently \n     of the Palestinian Authority.\n       One conundrum of the current war is Yasser Arafat's degree \n     of control of terror in areas controlled by the Palestinian \n     Authority. If he has control, it is obvious that he has \n     approved and supported the repeated attacks on Israeli \n     civilians over the past year and a half (a view which \n     captured documents and other intelligence seems to confirm). \n     If he does not have control, the peacekeepers would have to \n     establish it themselves.\n       To do that, if they were serious, would involve doing just \n     what the Israelis are doing now on the West Bank, but with \n     fewer resources, less local knowledge, and infinitely less \n     will-power. The more likely alternative is not to be \n     serious--that is, not to intercept or preempt terrorists.\n       Thus arises the ultimate problem with any of the solutions \n     floated by the European Union, in particular: what to do if \n     one side simply does not play along. What happens if \n     terrorist attacks on Israel were to continue, which they \n     almost certainly would? Would the external powers expect the \n     Israelis to absorb them? Would they permit retaliation, and, \n     if so, of what kind? Until those who propose such plans can \n     come up with a realistic proposal for what would happen in \n     the face of an aggressive campaign of terror waged despite \n     the presence of an international peacekeeping force, they \n     cannot be taken seriously.\n       Nor should the technical problems be brushed off. Israel is \n     a small place, about the size of New Jersey, but the \n     intercommunal boundary with Palestine is hundreds of \n     kilometers long. The inability of even the Israeli Defense \n     Forces--a manpower-rich force that draws on universal male \n     and female conscription, plus a sophisticated reserve \n     system--to prevent Palestinian infiltration is sobering. Tens \n     of thousands of troops would be required to make it all work, \n     and even then only by imposing an obtrusive presence that \n     would attract, in the end, its own resentments and hostility \n     from the local population. One should note, of course, that \n     the extreme hostility expressed by most Palestinians towards \n     the United States, and the political interest of groups like \n     Hamas and Islamic Jihad give them every reason to target \n     American peacekeepers for violence.\n       We have been here once before. The place was called Beirut, \n     the year was 1983, and it took 241 dead Marines to teach us \n     the lesson that peacekeeping in the midst of a shooting war \n     waged by terrorist groups using suicide bombers is folly. We \n     would be better advised to recognize war for what it is, and \n     to understand that, however terrible it may be, there are \n     times when the logic of war has a hold which even the best of \n     intentions cannot break. Indeed, hard as it may be to accept, \n     there are times when well-intentioned measures can only make \n     matters worse.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Another view that was expressed in the New York Times on \nApril 3 by Thomas Friedman states as follows:\n\n       President Bush needs to be careful that America does not \n     get sucked into something very dangerous here. Mr. Bush has \n     rightly condemned Palestinian suicide bombing as beyond the \n     pale, but he is not making clear that Israel's war against \n     this terrorism has to be accompanied by a real plan for \n     getting out of the territories. Why? Because President Bush, \n     like all other key players, does not want to face the central \n     dilemma in this conflict, which is that while Israel must get \n     out of the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinians cannot at \n     this moment be trusted to run those territories on their own, \n     without making them a base of future operations against \n     Israel. That means some outside power has\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\n     to come in to secure the borders, and the only trusted powers \n     would be the U.S. or NATO.\n\n  Of course, the United States would be a vital complement of NATO.\n\n       The only solution is a new U.N. mandate for U.S. and NATO \n     troops to supervise the gradual emergence of a Palestinian \n     state, after a phased Israeli withdrawal, and then to control \n     its borders, says the Middle East expert Stephen P. Cohen.\n       People say that U.S. troops there would be shot at like \n     U.S. troops in Beirut. I disagree. U.S. troops that are the \n     midwife of a Palestinian state and supervise a return of \n     Muslim sovereignty over the holy mosques in Jerusalem would \n     be the key to solving all the contradictions of U.S. policy \n     in the Middle East, not new targets.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the entire article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 3, 2002]\n\n                             The Hard Truth\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       A terrible disaster is in the making in the Middle East. \n     What Osama bin Laden failed to achieve on Sept. 11 is now \n     being unleashed by the Israeli-Palestinian war in the West \n     Bank: a clash of civilizations.\n       In the wake of repeated suicide bombings, it is no surprise \n     that the Israeli Army has gone on the offensive in the West \n     Bank. Any other nation would have done the same. But Ariel \n     Sharon's operation will succeed only if it is designed to \n     make the Israeli-occupied territories safe for Israel to \n     leave as soon as possible. Israel's goal must be a withdrawal \n     from these areas captured in the 1967 war; otherwise it will \n     never know a day's peace, and it will undermine every \n     legitimate U.S. effort to fight terrorism around the globe.\n       What I fear, though, is that Mr. Sharon wants to get rid of \n     Mr. Arafat in order to keep Israeli West Bank settlements, \n     not to create the conditions for them to be withdrawn.\n       President Bush needs to be careful that America doesn't get \n     sucked into something very dangerous here. Mr. Bush has \n     rightly condemned Palestinian suicide bombing as beyond the \n     pale, but he is not making clear that Israel's war against \n     this terrorism has to be accompanied by a real plan for \n     getting out of the territories.\n       Why? Because President Bush, like all the other key \n     players, doesn't want to face the central dilemma in this \n     conflict--which is that while Israel must get out of the West \n     Bank and Gaza, the Palestinians cannot, at this moment, be \n     trusted to run those territories on their own, without making \n     them a base of future operations against Israel. That means \n     some outside power has to come in to secure the borders, and \n     the only trusted powers would be the U.S. or NATO.\n       Palestinians who use suicide bombers to blow up Israelis at \n     a Passover meal and then declare ``Just end the occupation \n     and everything will be fine'' are not believable. No Israeli \n     in his right mind would trust Yasir Arafat, who has used \n     suicide bombers when it suited his purposes, not to do the \n     same thing if he got the West Bank back and some of his \n     people started demanding Tel Aviv.\n       ``The only solution is a new U.N. mandate for U.S. and NATO \n     troops to supervise the gradual emergence of a Palestinian \n     State--after a phased Israel withdrawal--and then to control \n     its borders,'' says the Middle East expert Stephen P. Cohen.\n       People say that U.S. troops there would be shot at like \n     U.S. troops in Beirut. I disagree. U.S. troops that are the \n     midwife of a Palestinian state and supervise a return of \n     Muslim sovereignty over the holy mosques in Jerusalem would \n     be the key to solving all the contradictions of U.S. policy \n     in the Middle East, not new targets.\n       The Arab leaders don't want to face this hard fact either, \n     because most are illegitimate, unelected autocrats who are \n     afraid of ever speaking the truth in public to the \n     Palestinians. The Arab leaders are as disingenuous as Mr. \n     Sharon; he says ending ``terrorism'' alone will bring peace \n     to the occupied territories, and the Arab leaders say ending \n     ``the occupation'' alone will end all terrorism.\n       Like Mr. Sharon, the Arab leaders need to face facts--that \n     while the occupation needs to end, they independently need to \n     address issues like suicide terrorism in the name of Islam. \n     As Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, courageously \n     just declared about suicide bombing: ``Bitter and angry \n     though we may be, we must demonstrate to the world that \n     Muslims are rational people when fighting for our rights, and \n     do not resort to acts of terror.''\n       If Arab leaders have only the moral courage to draw lines \n     around Israel's behavior, but no moral courage to decry the \n     utterly corrupt and inept Palestinian leadership, or the \n     depravity of suicide bombers in the name of Islam, then we're \n     going nowhere.\n       The other people who have not wanted to face facts are the \n     feckless American Jewish leaders, fundamentalist Christians \n     and neoconservatives who together have helped make it \n     impossible for anyone in the U.S. administration to talk \n     seriously about halting Israeli settlement-building without \n     being accused of being anti-Israel. Their collaboration has \n     helped prolong a colonial Israeli occupation that now \n     threatens the entire Zionist enterprise.\n       So there you have it. Either leaders of good will get \n     together and acknowledge that Israel can't stay in the \n     territories but can't just pick up and leave, without a U.S.-\n     NATO force helping Palestinians oversee their state, or Osama \n     wins--and the war of civilizations will be coming to a \n     theater near your.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. What I propose today is the idea of one Senator, shared \nby some and disagreed by others, but I do hope it is worthy of \nconsideration by those who will undertake to resolve this conflict. \nAgain, I thank the sponsors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment being \noffered by Senator Lieberman and Senator Smith of Oregon and so many \nothers on a bipartisan basis. This is an important amendment, and it is \na timely amendment, dealing with the Middle East. It is brief, but it \ngets to the point in a hurry. It says clearly what our principles of \nconduct should be and establishes standards and values which I believe \nthe vast majority of Americans would agree.\n  I commend those who authored this very thoughtful and prudent \namendment. It is presented to us in words and terms that are not \ninflammatory. We are doing our best at this level to express our \nsolidarity with Israel, without in any way jeopardizing the efforts of \nthe Bush administration or others to try to find peace in the Middle \nEast.\n  It is important that our voice be heard, that the Senate pass this \namendment, and the people across America and around the world who would \ntake note of it understand why we are doing this.\n  In the morning hours of September 11, America was awakened to the \nreality of terrorism. The calm and safety of our great Nation was \nbroken by explosion, bloodshed, and death. Our lives were changed \nforever on that day by the senseless violence. Our hearts were broken \nby the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans. You can still see, to \nthis day, the full page of the New York Times every single day, since \nSeptember 11, with the photographs and biographies of the victims. Our \nNation was united, though, by this event. We were united to protect our \npeople and to stop the threat of terrorism.\n  September 11, 2001, is a day in our history that America will never, \never forget. In Israel, each dawn seems to bring September 11--\nanother horror, another tragedy, to a nation which bears its grief as a \nlifetime burden.\n\n  A city bus in Jerusalem was lifted 2 feet off the street by a \npowerful bomb, killing and maiming innocent passengers. A bar mitzvah \nin Tel Aviv, a seder in Netanay, was ripped by explosions, leaving a \ntrail. This last weekend in Adora, 5-year-old Danielle Shefi was gunned \ndown in her home, in her bed, in front of her mother by a Palestinian \ngunman.\n  Today we gather as Americans, as Senators, as survivors of September \n11 to consider this important amendment, and with it to tell our \nfriends in Israel: You will not grieve alone; you will not stand alone; \nyou will not fight terrorism alone. From the moment Israel became a \nsovereign nation, the United States of America has stood by its side. \nAnd from that same moment, Israel has stood by the side of the United \nStates. We are allies. We are friends. We are brothers and sisters in \nthis battle for peace and an end to terrorism.\n  Our Nation believes the people of Palestine should have a safe and \nsovereign land but not at the expense of the safety and sovereignty of \nIsrael. We believe the Palestinians deserve a voice in deciding their \ndestiny, but that voice cannot be the roar of a suicide bomb killing \ninnocent children. We believe the Palestinians deserve real leadership.\n  Recall for just a moment the brief history leading up to the current \nstate of events when President Clinton, in his closing days in office, \nbrought then-Prime Minister Barak to Camp David, along with Chairman \nArafat, in a desperate last-minute effort in his administration to try \nto finally forge peace in the Middle East. They debated back and forth. \nThey bargained for days at a time. They left and went back to the \nMiddle East, those two leaders, and in Taba had a follow-up meeting to \ntalk about details. When it was all done, when it was finished, 97 \npercent of the\n\n[[Page S3815]]\n\ndisputed territory between the Palestinians and the Israelis had been \nresolved after 50 years of fighting, 50 years of an impasse and that \nmuch progress was made.\n  What happened? Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority rejected \nthat peace offering, rejected that peace agreement. And they didn't \nanswer it with a strong letter. They answered it with violence in the \nstreet, the beginning of terrorism against the people of Israel. They \nrejected the peace agreement propounded by President Clinton and Prime \nMinister Barak and answered it with violence.\n  There were doubts in the minds of some as to whether the Israeli \npeople would have even agreed to this, it was so broad, so sweeping, \nwith 97 percent of the territory resolved. Yet Prime Minister Barak had \nthe courage to come forward and say: I am prepared to put my political \nfuture on the line and offer it to the Israeli people. And he was \nrejected by the Palestinian side. And they answered with violence.\n  The ensuing election is now a matter of history. Mr. Barak lost to \nMr. Sharon with the most overwhelming majority in the history of \nIsrael. So if Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority want to \npoint a finger of blame at Ariel Sharon, they should be ready to \nacknowledge that they brought him to power. They did it with their \nresponse to this offering, this overture of peace.\n  I was in Israel this last January and had an opportunity to meet with \nmany of the leaders before I came to Israel. While I was there, people \nfrom our Embassy and intelligence sources told me about the shipment of \nthe Karine A. This was a ship intercepted by the Israelis carrying 50 \ntons of military armaments to the Palestinian Authority, with new \nrockets that made the whole nation of Israel vulnerable for the first \ntime to rocket attack and 2,000 kilograms of C-4 plastic explosives, \nthe weapon of choice of suicide and homicide bombers.\n\n  It was because of that shipment that I made a conscious decision not \nto meet with Chairman Arafat while I was there. I could not believe \nthat as an American I could stand with President Bush in condemning \nterrorism and those who harbor terrorists and then turn a blind eye to \nthis armed shipment.\n  So we stand today with a violent situation in the Middle East, one \nthat needs to be resolved in peace. Let the violence and terrorism come \nto an end immediately. Let all innocent victims, whether they are \nIsraelis or Palestinians, know that tomorrow is a safer day. Let the \nUnited States show the leadership needed to make certain we move toward \npeace in the Middle East. But never should we turn our back on the fact \nthat poor Israeli citizens have been victimized by the same type of \ncareless terrorism and violence we saw on September 11 in this Nation.\n  I sincerely hope the leadership will come forward to make this \nhappen. We believe today as we have from the moment the nation of \nIsrael came into existence that the Jewish people have a right to a \nhomeland, that Israel and its people have a right to be safe and \nsecure, that Israel and the United States are bound together in a \ncommitment to democracy, freedom, tolerance, and peace. I hope this \namendment and this debate will move toward negotiations and lasting \npeace.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a brief statement. It has to do with part of this \namendment that I think is so crucial. I thank my friend for offering it \nso carefully. It calls on Arab States to condemn the suicide bombing.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to ask a question in about 15 seconds, if my \nfriend allows me to pose it.\n  I am stunned that we have heard few voices from the Arab States. I \nask my friend this, as he voted, as did all my colleagues in the \nSenate, for a resolution expressing our horror at the women suicide \nbombers. I wonder if the Senator is struck by this deafening silence \nand how he felt when Mrs. Arafat said if she had a son, in fact, it \nwould be an honor for that son to die. It is a stunning statement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder if the Senator feels the same?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will answer briefly because the Senator from \nPennsylvania has been waiting patiently.\n  I have to say to the Senator from California that I am taken aback by \nthe fact that people have not come forward to condemn the violence and \nterrorism on both sides.\n  When I was in Egypt and faced the press, they looked at me \nincredulously when I described to them that we saw happening in the \nMiddle East as the same kind of violence as September 11. They could \nnot understand the connection. I think Americans understand that \nconnection.\n  I hope with this amendment we can move toward a peaceful outcome in \nthis sad and bloody chapter of the violence in the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I called for regular order for those who might be \nwatching because it is the practice of the Senate to arrive and wait a \nturn. I conferred with the principal sponsor, Senator Lieberman, and \nwas queued up behind Senator Durbin.\n  It is not an uncommon practice for Senators, under the guise of a \nquestion, to make speeches. While the Senate permits a question to \ninterrupt a speaker, or when I have sought recognition, the rules of \nthe Senate do not permit speeches. I think we had a speech and that is \nwhy I twice asked for regular order in accordance with the decorum of \nthe Senate to take a turn.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a request I want to make to \nbe allowed to follow the Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to follow the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, I do not want to object. I \nhave a committee hearing on homeland security to begin at 2:30, and I \nbelieve the Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor; does he not?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. I had hoped to speak before that hearing. I don't think I \nwill be able to because the Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor and \nthe distinguished Senator from Minnesota wishes to speak. I don't want \nto be late for my own committee hearing. I have say to the Senate, the \nMembers of the Senate, I want to speak on this Resolution before it \npasses. So the Senate is on notice of that fact. My speech won't be \nlong, but I have a few things I want to say. I thank the Senator for \nallowing me to proceed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Lieberman, and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, for bringing \nforward this amendment because it is important that there be a unified \nfight against terrorism. The suicide bombers who have threatened Israel \nare identical to the suicide bombers who struck the United States on \nSeptember 11, 2001. The only difference is that the suicide bombers on \nSeptember 11th were a little more sophisticated. They hijacked planes \nand they flew them into the World Trade Center Towers. One, I think, \nwas headed for the Capitol of the United States, the one which went \ndown in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. One was headed for the White \nHouse, the one which struck the Pentagon.\n  The situation today in Israel is one of abject terror, and I can \ntestify to that personally because I was in Israel in late March. In \nfact, I was there on March 26, 2002, and visited Chairman Arafat in his \ncompound on the evening of March 26, leaving there close to midnight. \nThe next day there was the suicide bombing at the Passover seder in \nNetanya.\n  Being in Israel is a terrifying experience, simply stated. There are \nsuicide bombings in buses, suicide bombings in restaurants, suicide \nbombings at checkpoints, and suicide bombings on the streets. There is \nan undeniable right of self-defense under those circumstances. That is \nthe essence of\n\n[[Page S3816]]\n\nwhat the Lieberman-Smith amendment calls for.\n  People talk about the cycle of violence. I do not think it is a cycle \nbecause that suggests there is some sort of mutuality. The suicide \nbombers provide the violence. The Israeli response is a matter of self-\ndefense.\n  We face an imminent threat in the United States. We get alerts from \ntime to time. I think President Bush's statement, which is cited in \nthis amendment, is worth repeating. He said, on November 21, 2001:\n\n       We fight the terrorists and we fight all of those who give \n     them aid. America has a message for the nations of the world. \n     If you harbor terrorists, you are terrorists. If you train or \n     arm a terrorist, you are a terrorist. If you feed a terrorist \n     or fund a terrorist, you are a terrorist and you will be held \n     accountable by the United States and our friends.\n\n  What the Senate is saying in this amendment is that we are going to \nhold the terrorists accountable and we are going to stand with Israel \nin its fight against terrorism.\n  I know Senator Byrd wishes to make a presentation in advance of his \nhearing and Senator Wellstone has asked for recognition, so I am going \nto limit my comments to these 4 minutes and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania before he \nleaves, Senator Byrd has now gone to the hearing. If my colleague needs \nto continue, I will wait. Senator Byrd has actually now gone to \ncommittee. I am pleased to speak now but I want my colleague to be \nclear on the situation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I \nthought Senator Byrd was going to speak and therefore, I limited my \ncomments.\n  I would make one additional observation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The additional observation is that the amendment is \nsanguine in calling for assistance from Saudi Arabia. It is my hope \nthat the Saudis will pursue their initiative in normalizing relations \nwith Israel. That is a real breakthrough. I was pleased to see that \nSyria followed the Saudi lead.\n  I had a chance on my trip to the Mideast to talk to Bashar Asad, the \nnew President of Syria. It is very important to set the stage for \nnormalized relations. When there has been agreement on a Palestinian \nState, which is the principle of Oslo, and when Prime Minister Sharon \nhas agreed on a Palestinian State, it is my hope that the principles of \nthe plans advanced by CIA Director Tenet and former Senator George \nMitchell can be carried through and that there can be a discussion of \nthe Palestinian State to provide a framework for hope for the \nPalestinians.\n  However, the critical ingredient is normalizing relations. I \ncompliment the President and Crown Prince Abdallah of Saudi Arabia for \ntheir meeting--candidly, providing that the Saudis follow through. We \nshould not lose sight of the fact that 15 of the 19 terrorists who \nstruck the United States on September 11th were Saudis, and that Saudi \nArabia has also given us Osama bin Laden. The Saudis appear to have \nbeen financing some of the terrorists by paying money to their \nfamilies. In statements on the Sunday news talk shows, representatives \nof Saudi Arabia did not deny that. In a circuitous way, they said what \nmight be considered to be an admission. So let us hope that the Saudis \nwill provide leadership. Chairman Arafat cannot be relied upon. He \nwrites in disappearing ink.\n  If there is to be an agreement, it is going to have to be enforced by \nthe moderate Arab States, by Egypt, by Saudi Arabia, by King Hussein of \nJordan, and by King Mohamed of Morocco.\n  This amendment that Senator Lieberman and Senator Gordon Smith \noffered is a very important statement. It is tempered and I think it \nwill not adversely affect what President Bush and his administration \nseek to do. So I, again, commend my colleague Senator Lieberman and my \ncolleague Senator Gordon Smith, and hope that this will produce a very \nresounding vote in the affirmative.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to speak briefly about this \namendment. I will vote for this amendment because I believe Israel has \na right to address the concerns of its citizens. As Camus once said:\n\n       Murder is never legitimate.\n\n  When men and women are murdered at a seder meal, or there is the \ndeliberate targeting of teenagers at pizza parlors, it is not at all \nsurprising that Israel, the Government of Israel, wants to protect its \nown citizens and will respond.\n  I support this amendment because I believe it is about Israel's need \nand right to protect its citizens against terrorism. The amendment also \nstates that many of the Arab States have been silent in the face of \nthis unacceptable violence. I believe they must unequivocally declare \ntheir opposition to all forms of terrorism, particularly the suicide \nbombing, and work with the Palestinians, in concert with the United \nStates, to stop this violence.\n  I wish also to say something more personal to my colleague from \nConnecticut. I am, if you will, a son of Israel. I am a first-\ngeneration American. My father, a Jewish immigrant, fled persecution. \nHe was born in Odessa, and his family moved to Russia to stay ahead of \nthe pogroms. I remember, as a little boy, watching my parents watch TV, \nand they would weep when Israel was at war. I never really understood \nthe strong feeling that they had for Israel. I do now.\n\n  While the amendment before us affirms Israel's right and freedom to \nprotect its people against terror, I do not read this amendment as an \nexplicit or implicit endorsement of every action that the Government of \nIsrael and its forces have taken in the occupied territory over the \nlast several weeks.\n  There is a distinction in my mind between affirming my solidarity \nwith Israel and not equating that with support of every policy of the \nSharon administration.\n  I also want to talk briefly about the role of our government. I \nbelieve the real test ahead will be whether or not the Bush \nadministration stays engaged in the Middle East.\n  Over and over again, I have pointed out that I believe Secretary \nPowell's efforts have been extremely important--that the administration \nhas finally left the sidelines and is on the playing field of Middle \nEast diplomacy. It must stay in the game. Israeli officials say the \nconditions could worsen in the days to come. We may see more suicide \nbombings.\n  But if the Bush administration, facing such an escalation of violence \nin the region, withdraws, as it has before, history will judge it \nharshly.\n  We have to stay engaged. I believe we must pursue a courageous \napproach which seeks to meet both the critical needs of the Israeli \npeople to be free from terrorism and violence, and acknowledges the \nlegitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for their own state, a \nstate which is economically and politically viable.\n  Even in this horrific time, we should not lose sight of what should \nbe our ultimate goal--Israel and a new Palestinian State living side by \nside with peace and with secure borders. There is no question in my \nmind--and I could go on for hours about this--about the need to end the \nculture of violence and the culture of incitement in Palestinian and \nArab media, in the schools, and elsewhere. It has gone on for too long.\n  But I also think it is terribly important that Israel shows respect \nfor and concern about the human rights and dignity of the Palestinian \npeople who are now and will continue to be their neighbors.\n  It is critically important--I believe this amendment embraces this, \nand maybe my colleague from Connecticut would like to respond--to \ndistinguish between the terrorists, who must be confronted, and \nordinary, innocent Palestinians who are trying to provide for their \nfamilies and live an otherwise normal existence.\n  This is a critical distinction. We don't want to see Palestinians \nsubjected to daily and humiliating reminders that they lack basic \nfreedoms and control over their lives.\n  I have had certain discussions with people, which have been quite \npainful. I have had people come into my office who have been very \ncritical of what Israel is doing. I listen to them. They\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\nmake the distinction between defending against terrorists, and harming \ninnocent civilians--a distinction I agree with--and say repeatedly, \nwhat about the innocent Palestinians? I say it is a Jewish thing for me \nto be concerned about the loss of all innocent lives. But then I say to \nthem, I want you to also talk to me about the loss of innocent Israeli \nlife. I want you to talk to me about the Jews that were murdered at \ntheir seder meal.\n  These are people who feel strongly, and who condemn Israel's actions. \nWhen I meet with them, they don't say anything about the murder of \nIsraelis. My God. I wonder why.\n  I have also met with other people who never utter a word about the \nloss of innocent Palestinians. This is not an argument about moral \nequivalency--I know the difference between innocent civilians who are \ndeliberately targeted and murdered, as is the case with suicide \nbombings, and when they are not deliberately targeted or not \ndeliberately harmed. But if my mother and father were alive, they would \nbe weeping for the loss of innocent Israelis, and they would also be \nweeping for the loss of innocent life everywhere. They would say: Paul, \nwe want you as our son to express your solidarity for Israel. We love \nIsrael. You are a son of Israel. But we also, Paul, want you to be \nclear on the floor of the Senate that supporting this amendment--which \nI do--does not mean it should be viewed as an endorsement of every \nsingle, specific policy or action by the Sharon administration.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis very principled and impassioned statement.\n  I wish to briefly respond, and in particular say, as a personal \nstatement, that it seems to me it is self-evident and compelling that \nthe only way peace will be established between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians is when each side recognizes the right of the other to \nhave a homeland there and to live in peace.\n  That is a personal statement. But it also seems to me that has been \nat least an implicit, if not an explicit, part of American foreign \npolicy, certainly since the Oslo Declaration of Principles was signed \non the White House lawn in September of 1993. It remains to this day a \nfundamental objective.\n  As to the claims on both sides and the death on both sides, I think \nit is so critical, as I believe the Senator was saying, that neither \nside--this is difficult sometimes in the heat of violence and fear and \nanger--can be allowed to come to a point where they deny or forget the \nhumanity of everybody on the other side.\n  There is a famous statement made by Golda Meir, the former Prime \nMinister of Israel. I will paraphrase it because I don't remember it \nexactly. She said at one point: We Israelis will someday forgive the \nArabs for killing our children. What will be more difficult for us is \nto forgive the Arabs for forcing our children to kill their children.\n  That spirit, so eloquently expressed, really should guide our \ndeliberations.\n  I consider this amendment to be a statement of American principles, a \nstatement of solidarity with our ally, Israel, and a statement that is \nconsistent with the war on terrorism and the doctrine that President \nBush has articulated. It is intentionally not in any sense anti-\nPalestinian. It is antiterrorist. It is intentionally drafted that way \nwith the hope that it will draw the broadest possible support and be an \nexpression of solidarity and an expression of support for Israel's \nright centrally, fundamentally to defend itself against terrorism.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his statement. \nI think it is a supremely important statement.\n  As an example of my definition of hope--I had a chance to talk about \nthis at Temple Israel in Minneapolis--is the story of the Israeli man \nwho was one of the Israelis murdered at the bombing of the seder. His \norgans were donated to save the life of a Palestinian woman. His \nchildren said: Our father would be very proud.\n  I believe this is hope. I say to my colleague from Connecticut and \nSouth Carolina, that is the hope. I do not believe I am being naive \nwhen I say there are a lot of people--a majority of the people--who \nunderstand that we have to get from where we are now to where we all \nknow we need to be. The terrorists will not get us there.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Minnesota. I could not agree \nwith him more. I think what is at issue now is whether we can create a \ncircumstance where the Palestinian leadership will seize the initiative \nfrom the suicide bombers, from the terrorists, who have captured it, \nwho have, in that sense, hijacked, as I said earlier in this debate, \nthe legitimate cause of Palestinian statehood. When that happens, I am \nconfident they will meet with an overall majority of the Israeli people \nwho want nothing more than to live in peace and security with their \nneighbors.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota--South Carolina. \nExcuse me.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I will probably be from South Dakota \nafter I make a few comments because I think the amendment is ill-timed \nand not in the best interests of the United States and not in the best \ninterests of Israel.\n  I say not in the best interests of Israel--I agree, with the various \nitems listed in the ``Sense of Congress''--and you can go through (1) \nthrough (7)--``(1) stands in solidarity with Israel . . . ''--there is \nno question about that--``(2) remains committed to Israel's right to \nself-defense''--and on down the particular seven points.\n  I do not have to explain it. I have a 35-year voting record for \nIsrael. But as to what the amendment does not say--it is not what it \nsays; it is what is not said that bothers me.\n  The distinguished colleague from Connecticut talks about the \nhumanity. Well, where is the humanity on the Palestinian side here? \nThat is what we are looking for. Five years from now, 10 years from \nnow, 50 years from now, there is bound to be an Israel. I think there \nis going to be a Palestine. The task is to get these folks as neighbors \nliving together.\n  Where is the humanity? This comes at a particularly tenuous time. We \njust got the President engaged. I say that advisedly. It was an \naffirmative action plan that we are not going to fool with Israel. All \nthese other Presidents did. Let them do what they are going to do. But \nwe got him engaged.\n  Now we have Crown Prince Abdullah from Saudi Arabia engaged and \nvisiting. And he is offering, categorically, recognition of the Israeli \nstate. He says Syria and the rest of them--including Egypt and Jordan--\nwill all go along. They all will join in. Some say that is propaganda. \nDon't give me that propaganda stuff. Let's try it.\n  We have Secretary Powell making his visits, and then along comes this \npolitical amendment. I have been up here a long time, and it would be \neasier for me to just walk to the desk, vote aye, go home, and not have \nto answer the phone.\n  I know because I made a comment in the earlier part of the year that \nI thought Ariel Sharon was the Bull Conner of Israel. As for Arafat--I \nthink he wants to be a martyr, he wants to be killed, he cannot be \ntrusted.\n  In any event, I know what it is to be critical. I finally found some \nsolace the other day for saying anything at all.\n  Here is a column by Richard Cohen, from the day before yesterday in \nthe Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent the article in its \nentirety be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 30, 2002]\n\n                          Who's Anti-Semitic?\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       If I weren't a Jew, I might be called an anti-Semite. I \n     have occasionally been critical of Israel. I have \n     occasionally taken the Palestinians' side. I have always \n     maintained that the occupation of the West Bank is wrong and \n     while I am, to my marrow, a supporter of Israel, I insist \n     that the Palestinian cause--although sullied by terrorism--is \n     a worthy one.\n       In Israel itself, these positions would hardly be \n     considered remarkable. People with similar views serve in \n     parliament. They write columns for the newspapers. And while \n     they are sometimes vehemently criticized--\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\n     such is the rambunctious nature of Israel's democratic din--\n     they are not called either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews.\n       I cannot say the same about America. Here, criticism of \n     Israel, particularly anti-Zionism, is equated with anti-\n     Semitism. The Anti-Defamation League, one of the most \n     important American Jewish organizations, comes right out and \n     says so. ``Anti-Zionism is showing its true colors as deep-\n     rooted anti-Semitism,'' the organization says in a full-page \n     ad that I have seen in the New Republic as well as other \n     magazines. ``No longer are the Arab nations camouflaging \n     their hatred of Jews in the guise of attacking Israel.''\n       I feel compelled to pause here and assert my credentials. \n     Few people have written more often about Arab anti-Semitism \n     than I. I have come at this subject time and time again, so \n     often that I have feared becoming a bore. Arab anti-Semitism \n     not only exists, it is often either state-sponsored or state-\n     condoned, and it is only getting worse. It makes the Arabs \n     look like fools. How can anyone take seriously a person who \n     believes that Jews engage in ritual murder?\n       But that hardly means that anti-Zionism--hating, opposing, \n     fighting Israel--is the same as anti-Semitism, hating Jews \n     anywhere on account of supposedly inherently characteristics. \n     If I were a Palestinian living in a refugee camp, I might \n     very well hate Israel for my plight--never mind its actual \n     cause--and I even might not like Jews in general.\n       After all, Israel proclaims itself the Jewish state. It \n     officially celebrates Jewish holidays, including the Sabbath \n     on Saturday. It allows the orthodox rabbinate to control \n     secular matters, such as marriage, and, of course, it offers \n     citizenship to any person who can reasonably claim to be \n     Jewish. This so-called right of return permits such a person \n     to ``return'' to a place where he or she has never been. \n     Palestinians must find this simply astonishing.\n       To equate anti-Zionists or critics of Israel in general \n     with anti-Semites is to liken them to the Nazis or the \n     rampaging mobs of the pogroms. It says that their hatred is \n     unreasonable, unfathomable, based on some crackpot racial \n     theory or some misguided religious zealotry. It dismisses all \n     criticism, no matter how legitimate, as rooted in prejudice \n     and therefore without any validity.\n       No doubt there has been an upsurge of anti-Semitic \n     incidents in Europe. But there has also been an upsurge of \n     legitimate criticism of Israel that is not in the least anti-\n     Semitic. When Israel recently jailed and then deported four \n     pro-Palestinian Swedes, two of whom are physicians, under the \n     misguided policy of seeing all the Palestinians' sympathizers \n     as enemies of the state, it was an action that ought to be \n     condemned--and the Swedes who have done so ought not be \n     considered anti-Semites.\n       When the same thing happens to a Japanese physician, that \n     too ought to be condemned--and it was, as it happens, in the \n     Israeli newspaper Haaretz. A column by Gideon Levy made the \n     point that Israel cannot reject and rebut all criticism by \n     reciting the mantra: ``The whole world is against us.''\n       The same holds for American Jews. To turn a deaf ear to the \n     demands of Palestinians, to dehumanize them all as bigots, \n     only exacerbates the hatred on both sides. The Palestinians \n     do have a case. Their methods are sometimes--maybe often--\n     execrable, but that does not change the fact that they are a \n     people without a state. As long as that persists so too will \n     their struggle.\n       The only way out of the current mess is for each side to \n     listen to what the other is saying. To protest living \n     conditions on the West Bank is not anti-Semitism. To condemn \n     the increasing encroachment of Jewish settlements is not \n     anti-Semitism. To protest the cuffing that the Israelis \n     sometimes give the international press is not anti-Semitism \n     either.\n       To suggest, finally, that Ariel Sharon is a rejectionist \n     who provocatively egged on the Palestinians is not anti-\n     Semitism. It is a criticism no more steeped in bigotry than \n     the assertion that Yasser Arafat is a liar who cannot be \n     trusted. That does not make me anti-Arab--just a realist who \n     is sick and tired of lazy labels.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. He says, in concluding:\n\n       ``The only way out of the current mess is for each side to \n     listen. . . .\n\n  Nobody in America believes we are not for Israel. It is perfectly \nobvious. We have given them all the equipment. We have given them the \neconomic aid. We will give them what is necessary. We admire that \nlittle country right in the middle of the Mideast, the progress she is \nmaking. Yitzhak Rabin could see it. But his own folks killed him. And \nAnwar Sadat could see the progress Egypt was making, and his own folks \nkilled him.\n  We talk about the Palestinian Authority in one breath and in the next \nbreath say: Who has the authority? The Palestinians? No. The Israelis \nhave the authority. This is a very complex issue.\n  I remember back in World War II, in the occupation, where the French \nwould take out a German soldier on the corner, and then the Germans \nwould retaliate and then just wipe out the block. We all know about \nthat.\n  Several years ago, I was in Kosovo. And some Albanians would get \nfeeling good, and they would take out a Serb policeman on the corner, \nand along would come the Serbian army and they would clean out the \nblock. Now along comes Sharon, and he must learn the lessons of the \npast. He is making more terrorists than he is getting rid of.\n  He sounds formal--``I am getting rid of the infrastructure''--like \nthere is a structure. There is no structure to this mess. Anybody who \nthinks Arafat is in charge, to the extent that he is in charge because \nwe have a deal with somebody. He is in charge, but Hamas, Hezbollah, \nand all, they use him. This is a tricky part of the world.\n  And we are looking for friends in the war on terrorism. And they have \nbeen going along with us. Now we could come along and start losing \nfriends with this kind of leadership and the categorical one-sided \nendorsement of it.\n  I was not prepared to talk about this, but I did not know this was \ngoing to come up today. But in conscience, I cannot support it.\n  Let me cite what Richard Cohen says:\n\n       The only way out of the current mess is for each side to \n     listen. . . .\n\n  Don't you think it would be good for Congress, as the President asked \nover on the House side--that this is not the right time for us to vote \non this resolution. I heard earlier today that the White House is not \ntaking a position, but we know they do not support it. Can't we help \nthe President in this tenuous situation?\n  Quoting Richard Cohen again:\n\n       The only way out of the current mess is for each side to \n     listen to what the other is saying. To protest living \n     conditions on the West Bank is not anti-Semitism. To condemn \n     the increasing encroachment of Jewish settlements is not \n     anti-Semitism. To protest the cuffing that the Israelis \n     sometimes give the international press is not anti-Semitism \n     either.\n       To suggest, finally, that Ariel Sharon is a rejectionist \n     who provocatively egged on the Palestinians is not anti-\n     Semitism.\n       It is a criticism no more steeped in bigotry than the \n     assertion that Yasser Arafat is a liar who cannot be trusted. \n     That does not make me anti-Arab--just a realist who is sick \n     and tired of lazy labels.\n\n  Let's go in the resolution to the labels and the whereas. How can you \nlive with that? We fight the terrorists and we fight all those who give \nthem aid. America has a message for the nations of the world: If you \nharbor terrorists, you are terrorists. If you train or arm a terrorist, \nyou are a terrorist. If you feed a terrorist or fund a terrorist, you \nare a terrorist, and you will be held accountable by the United States \nand our friends.\n\n  Crown Prince Abdullah just left Crawford, TX. The Saudis are funding \nterrorism, I can tell you that. Go to the religious schools in \nPakistan. As we saw on TV, the Saudis have been funding them for a long \ntime. But we can't say that about the Saudis, we have to get oil. In \nany event, who is the terrorist here with respect to the situation? Do \nthe Saudis qualify as terrorists under this resolution?\n  Madam President, the situation in the Middle East is such that you \nhave the creation of more terrorists under this approach. The Arabs, by \nthe way, think we are terrorists. In fact, that is what they call us. \nIn the U.N., they have brought resolutions against the United States in \nthe past. The U.N. passed resolutions to send weapons inspectors into \nIraq. We condemned Saddam for not letting them in. Now the U.N. formed \na team to investigate the incursion into Jenin. Sharon refuses to let \nthe U.N. investigate, so in a way he's acting like Saddam Hussein.\n  Max Rodenbeck, in an article on April 17 in the New York Times, \nwrote:\n\n       While other Arabs have always taken the Palestinians' side, \n     the violent images are increasing the sense of personal \n     interest in the conflict. When half a million Moroccans \n     marched in a recent protest against Israel, many carried \n     placards saying: We are all Palestinians.\n\n  So according to this amendment, everybody in Morocco is a terrorist. \nAny Palestinian you see defending his house, as we have been watching \non TV--even if he had no connection whatsoever to any of these \nindividuals with the explosives or the suicidal terrorists, or even if \nhe doesn't like Arafat--is a terrorist.\n  Incidentally, there have been five attempts that someone just told me \nabout on Arafat's life--not by Israelis,\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\nbut by Arabs, by Palestinians. So if I am in my home, defending my \nhome, and I see a soldier come shooting his way in, and I shoot him, \nall of a sudden I am a terrorist. If you don't have uniforms, I guess \nyou are terrorists. If you have uniforms, then you are soldiers.\n  How do you deal with Arafat if you are going to call him a terrorist \nin one breath and the Palestinian leader in the next breath? This is \ntoo simplistic. We have had enough blood on both sides. Now we are \ngetting to where the administration is taking charge--and I commend \nthem for it. We are making some progress, and they have freed Arafat. \nBut section No. 5 calls on the Palestinian Authority, actually it \ndemands that the Palestinian Authority fulfill its commitment to \ndismantle the terrorist infrastructure in the Palestinian areas. And \nthe Palestinian Authority--that is what we call an oxymoron. Let's not \nkid ourselves, this isn't any authority, but it's the best term we \nhave.\n  Sharon--and I am quoting Andy Rooney, who said the other night on \n``60 Minutes'':\n\n       Sharon is not our friend and President Bush should stop \n     pussy-footing and say so.\n\n  Both sides are coming in and calling names, and that is what this \namendment does. It doesn't help anybody but us Washington politicians.\n  This is the London Economist, of April 20. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the London Economist, Apr. 20, 2002]\n\n                             Friendly Fire\n\n       Thanks mainly to his comportment since September 11th, \n     George Bush stands tall in American opinion. America's \n     standing in the world is another matter. As the sympathy that \n     followed the destruction of the twin towers fades, the \n     admiration Mr. Bush earned for victory in Afghanistan is \n     being pushed aside by complaints about the rest of the ``war \n     against terrorism''. In the Muslim world, of course, but also \n     in much of Europe, the uneven battles on the West Bank have \n     encouraged demonstrators to burn the American flag on the \n     streets, alongside the flag of Israel. But even before those \n     battles, European politicians were lining up to denounce Mr. \n     Bush's ``simplistic'' foreign policy and deplore America's \n     preponderance in the world. The loyalty to Mr. Bush shown by \n     Britian's prime minister, Tony Blair, had begun to alienate \n     not only Britian's EU partners but also his own Labour Party.\n\n\n                          Guilt by Association\n\n       This rift was visible before Ariel Sharon invaded the West \n     Bank. But Mr. Sharon has made the rift suddenly deeper. \n     America is not responsible for the fighting, still less for \n     its grisly climax in what may turn out to have been a war \n     crime in Jenin (see next leader). But as the provider of \n     Israel's sword and furnisher of its diplomatic shield, \n     America is being held responsible in most of the world, but \n     not America, picture of the bulldozer refugee camp plaster \n     the front pages. To an extent that Americans do not realize \n     being blamed for Israel's actions is ripping up the coalition \n     Mr. Bush took such pains to knit together last September. How \n     can he patch it back together?\n       From Europe, the answer looks simple. To save his \n     coalition, Mr. Bush needs to put the squeeze on Mr. Sharon. \n     Only thus, it is argued, can Israel be persuaded to make the \n     compromises necessary for peace. And even if squeezing Mr. \n     Sharon does not lead to peace, being seen by the Arab street \n     to squeeze him is the only way to persuade fragile Arab \n     regimes to stay on America's side in the larger war against \n     terrorism. Instead, Mr. Bush appeared, first, to give \n     Israel's invasion of the West Bank a green light; and then \n     not to mean what he said when he called a fortnight ago for \n     Israel to withdraw ``immediately''. At best, Europeans say, \n     this makes America look ineffectual. At worst, it plays into \n     the hands of Osama bin Laden and his associates, who accuse \n     ``the Jews and the Americans'' of waging war against Islam. \n     Europe cannot understand America's failure to see this.\n       What Europeans fail to see is that, precisely because of \n     his steadfastness in the war against terrorism, Mr. Bush is \n     widely admired in America. When he is criticized there, it is \n     not for arming and shielding Israel but for sending Colin \n     Powell, his secretary of state, to talk to Yasser Arafat, \n     terrorist recidivist, and for suggesting that Israel might \n     curtail its own was against terrorism. This, say the critics, \n     smudges his previous ``moral clarity''. September 11th gave \n     Americans at large--not just Jews, and not just politicians \n     influenced by the Israel lobby--special reason to shudder at \n     the onslaught on Israel by Muslim suicide bombers determined \n     to kill as many civilians as possible. Long before then, \n     Americans learnt to identify more with the beleaguered \n     Israelis than the thwarted Palestinians. Above all, Americans \n     cannot understand why some Europeans dignify terrorism as \n     legitimate ``resistance'' to an occupation which, but for \n     Palestinian intransigence, Israel's previous government would \n     have ended anyway.\n       You do not have to resolve the merits of these two views of \n     the conflict to see the danger that this cross-Atlantic \n     incomprehension poses to the post-September coalition. \n     European leaders were squeamish enough before Mr. Sharon's \n     war about Mr. Bush's plans to take his campaign on to Iraq \n     and other members of the ``axis of evil''. The accelerated \n     killing gives them every reason to say that this must not \n     happen while the West Bank is on fire, lest it unleashes the \n     pan-Islamic rage Mr. bin Laden was aiming to provoke. \n     America's Arab friends say so too--though they made it clear \n     at the Beirut summit that ended before Mr. Sharon's re-\n     invasion that they were not up for another swipe against \n     Saddam anyways. In a funny way, Palestine gets Mr. Bush's \n     reluctant allies off the hook. While Mr. Sharon is on the \n     rampage, they are less likely to be roped into unwanted \n     American adventures further afield.\n       How does Mr. Bush proposed to end this rift? Not by selling \n     Israel down the river: Mr. Powell flew home with Israeli \n     tanks still in the West Bank and Mr. Arafat still stewing \n     under siege in Ramallah. Nor, probably, by resuming the \n     aloofness that characterized his initial handling of the \n     Middle East. For all their criticism of American zigzagging, \n     Mr. Bush's European critics need to recognize that this is a \n     president improvising responses to a baffling crisis. It \n     would be wrong to confuse his immediate plan to achieve \n     quiet--by piling pressure on Mr. Arafat to call off the \n     intifada--with his longer-term thinking. Mr. Bush has, after \n     all, spent the past weeks stating more plainly than any \n     predecessor that America wants an independent Palestine and \n     Israel back more or less to its 1967 border.\n\n\n                           Timing The squeeze\n\n       Empty words? At some point, it is true, getting an Israel \n     under a Mr. Sharon to accept such terms will require Mr. Bush \n     to apply that squeeze. With the domestic political capital he \n     has collected since September 11th, he could certainly do so, \n     especially if it seemed that supporting Israel was beginning \n     to damage America's own security. But remember ``moral \n     clarity'': the Europeans should not expect Mr. Bush to \n     pressurize Israel in circumstances that seemed to appease \n     terrorism. In other words, Mr. Arafat must accept--in good \n     faith, this time--the principle underpinning the Oslo \n     accords, which is that negotiating peace is not compatible \n     with a terrorist war.\n       If they were serious about helping the Palestinians to \n     statehood, Europeans would explain this to the Palestinians \n     morning and night, instead of hailing the intrifada, as many \n     do, as ``resistance''. The intifada it was that helped Mr. \n     Sharon to power, destroyed Israel's peace camp and turned \n     Americans off the Palestinian cause. After September 11th, \n     Americans feel that they too are at risk, and at war. \n     Europeans do not.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It says:\n\n       But as the provider of Israel's sword and furnisher of its \n     diplomatic shield, America is being held responsible. In most \n     of the world, but not America, pictures of the bulldozed \n     refugee camps plaster the front pages. To an extent that \n     Americans do not realize, being blamed for Israel's actions \n     is ripping up the coalition Mr. Bush took such pains to knit \n     together last September. How can he patch it back together?\n\n  Well, he is trying, and this amendment doesn't help him. It doesn't \nhelp him a bit. We know that. Since September 11, times are different. \nYes, there is a war on terrorism, and how do we succeed in that war? We \ncannot do it alone, as the President says. We need the assistance of \neveryone--particularly in the Mideast which, in a general sense, has \nthe majority, I would say, of terrorism and terrorists. So we have to \ngo about it in a very careful fashion.\n  For this Senator's interest, I think we can go after Saddam Hussein, \nbut first let's stabilize our friend Israel. You have to have first \nthings first. We found in the artillery in World War II, no matter how \nwell the gun was aimed, if the recoil would kill the gun crew, you \ndon't fire. So before we start firing on countries, let's take care of \nthe countries that are being fired upon. Let's take care of Israel. \nLet's give solidarity to Israel--solidarity of support.\n  In my judgment, it was wrong for Ariel Sharon to go to the Temple \nMount with in-your-face kind of politics and leadership; to bulldoze \nthe camps; and to extend settlements, all condemned by the United \nStates. Then along comes this one-sided amendment like there is no \ncognizance or awareness of the complexity of this situation.\n  Our credibility is at stake and everybody should pay particular \nattention. Now we are working with Pakistan, who we were formerly \nagainst, in the war on terrorism. We got their help. We are going to \nJordan and getting their help. We are going to Egypt, but Mubarak is in \na tenuous position that he had to cut off contacts with Israel.\n  So this is a complicated thing. But to come with this simplistic one-\nsided\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\namendment is not in the interest of Israel and not in the interest of \nthe United States. We ought to do like Richard Cohen says: Let's listen \nawhile, set this aside, and move on and continue our 100-percent \nsolidarity with Israel. This doesn't furnish it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, briefly and respectfully, I reply to \nmy friend from South Carolina. Particularly, I want to pick up on the \npoint at the end as to whether this is in the interest of the United \nStates and our credibility.\n  It seems to me that our credibility depends, in good measure, on our \nclarity--our moral clarity--and our consistency. That is what this \namendment is about. It states that we, after September 11, are in a war \nagainst terrorism, effectively declared by the Congress 2 or 3 days \nafter September 11, that our Nation's policy is now guided by a \ndoctrine that President Bush articulated in his address to a joint \nsession of Congress last September, now known as the Bush doctrine: \nTerrorism is evil; the use of violence to accomplish political ends--\nincluding legitimate political ends, such as in this case, as I have \nsaid earlier in this debate, Palestinian statehood--is unacceptable; \nyou cannot use terrorism to accomplish legitimate ends.\n\n  It is a time of decision: Either you are with us or you are with the \nterrorists.\n  This amendment is a carefully drafted affirmative statement of moral \nclarity for the United States, that we see Israel as now a front-line \nstate in the war against terrorism. Just as this administration has \nsent American soldiers, in fact, to the Philippines, to Yemen, to the \ncountry of Georgia, to assist regimes in their front-line status \nfighting terrorism, so, too, do we at least respect the right of the \nIsraelis to do the same: to defend their people against terrorism.\n  It is not, with all respect, a political amendment. It is, in my \nopinion--and I was involved most deeply with Senator Smith of Oregon in \ndrafting it--a principled amendment. It goes to the principles \narticulated in the Bush doctrine and the moral clarity of our war \nagainst terrorism, which, with all respect, has been not so \nconsistently applied over the last 2 or 3 weeks by this administration: \nOn one day calling for the Israelis to withdraw, and the next day \nexpressing understanding about why they would take military action \nagainst the terrorism.\n  The truth is, no regime, no democracy could do other than they have \ndone. This is not to defend every particular act of every particular \nsoldier. I do not know what every particular soldier did.\n  If we put this in American terms, if we think about young people out \nat night at a cafe getting blown to death by a suicide bomber; working \npeople waiting at a bus stop; people at a religious service; and this \npast weekend a mother with two children in their home, while the father \nis off at synagogue on Sabbath morning, a terrorist comes in disguised \nin an Israeli military uniform and kills a 5-year-old girl, no \ncivilized nation can do anything other than put a stop to that \nbehavior.\n  That is what this amendment says: We respect and stand in solidarity \nwith Israel as it takes the necessary steps to provide security to its \npeople, and we remain committed to Israel's right to self-defense.\n  This is not in any sense an anti-Palestinian statement. It was \ncarefully drafted to make sure it was not. It is an antiterrorism \nstatement.\n  It is in that sense that I hope the great majority of my colleagues \nwill support it today.\n  I note the presence in the Chamber of the Senator from Tennessee. I \nyield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank Senator Lieberman and Senator Gordon Smith \nfor this amendment. It is entirely appropriate for the legislative \nbranch of Government to express itself on something that is so \nimportant to so many Americans.\n  The President has stated this country is not going to abandon Israel. \nI know he means what he says. I do not think there is much doubt in \nterms of the Congress of the United States, but we need to make sure \nthere is none. Quite frankly, I am surprised at some of the misreadings \nthat our friends in Europe and other places have sometimes of our body \nand our intentions.\n  It appears to me that Israel is in a struggle for its very existence. \nI do not think that is an overstatement. We read about skirmishes, and \nwe hear of the historical difficulties we have had in that region. We \ntend to, in my mind, sometimes downplay the significance of what is \ngoing on there, but it is more significant probably than most people \nrealize.\n  No. 1, it is quite apparent that the Israelis believe they are in a \nstruggle for their existence. It is clear to them, as it is to me, that \nthe driving force among the Palestinians--not all Palestinians--is \nintent to drive the Israelis out of their country.\n  If we look at Arafat's map, we will see that it does not have Israel \non it. When those people talk about a Palestinian homeland, they are \ntalking about Tel Aviv, they are not talking about the West Bank.\n  When the Israelis see that and they are subjected to organized, \norchestrated, systematic terrorist activity where their children are \nbeing murdered, they take that very seriously. They are doing right now \nwhat is necessary to protect themselves.\n  I am afraid their enemies in this region are not interested in just a \nPalestinian state, which I think the entire international community now \nis saying has to be a part of any long-term resolution of this problem. \nThey certainly are not interested in a peace process, not at this stage \nof the game anyway.\n  Mr. Arafat was offered what in most people's minds was the best deal \nthat had ever been placed on the table during the prior Israeli \nadministration. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has put a proposition \non the table that the Palestinians have shown no indication they want \nto accept.\n  Is there any doubt that if the violence stopped, the Israelis would \nbe willing to sit down at the table? Of course not. Is there any doubt, \non the other hand, that if the Israelis pull out of Jenin and the other \nplaces in the West Bank, the Palestinians will be willing to sit down \nat the table? The answer to that is no.\n  Why is this the case? I am afraid it is the case because they still \nthink they are winning the battle, they are winning the struggle. How \ncan that be when they undergo tremendous losses? I think it is because \nthe Palestinians believe they are winning the battle in the \ninternational community.\n  It has been absolutely amazing to me to watch this occur. It is \nOrwellian to see person after person--young people--being strapped up \nwith dynamite--with the encouragement of their families who are being \npaid off in many cases by Saddam Hussein and others--to kill innocent \nmen, women, and children in public places in Israel, and to see the \nmassacre and carnage of people who are not military people, who are not \ngovernment leaders, but just kids out having a good time, and then to \nhave this situation twist and turn a few times and come out as outrage \nagainst the Israelis in the world community.\n  Somehow this brutal activity against civilians is equated with \nmilitary operations the Israelis conduct against Palestinian militant \nleaders. I do not understand how that can come about. I am sure it \nboggles the minds of the Israelis, and I am sure it encourages the \nPalestinian leadership that wishes to drive Israel into the sea. That \nis the reason they still believe they have a chance, because our \nEuropean friends are more critical of Israel as they defend themselves \nfrom these massacres than they are of the Palestinians. They believe \nthat because our moderate Arab friends feel the same way about it. They \nbelieve that because the United Nations itself is more intent on \ninvestigating a war zone where people get killed, where the Israelis, \ninstead of dropping bombs the way the United States often does, went \nhouse to house to save innocent lives and get the guilty and get the \npeople who are responsible for so much of this destruction, losing \npeople--they conduct this house-to-house kind of activity and bulldoze \nsome buildings. This is the activity that the leadership of the United \nNations wants to investigate.\n\n  Of course, as it turns out, there was not anything to investigate. \nAll of the\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\ncharges against the Israelis proved false before they even got there. \nAt the same time, the blood is hardly dry in downtown Tel Aviv from \ninnocent children who were murdered by the leadership of the PLO and \nother radicals among that group. As the Senator said, 5-year-old \nchildren are being shot and killed in their bed, but it is a war zone \nthat the United Nations wants to investigate. So that is why I think \nthe PLO and Mr. Arafat and his kind believe they may be winning. They \nare willing to sacrifice any number of their people in order to have \nthe political victory.\n  I think the toughest thing in the world for political leaders to do \nis to acknowledge sometimes that there is nothing that can be done in \nshort order. It does not matter in the end what the Europeans, the \nUnited Nations, the Americans, or the moderate Arabs think. Until these \ntwo parties are willing to sit down and work out a peace arrangement, \nwe are not going to have peace. There is nothing in the world that any \nof us can do to force them to do that.\n  In my opinion, nothing is going to force them to do that until they \nare both either exhausted or they both believe it is in their best \ninterest to sit down. As I said, I am afraid Mr. Arafat and the PLO do \nnot see that in their best interest right now.\n  I suggest to our friends around the world to reassess what they are \ndoing. I think they are contributing to the problem. They are keeping \nhope alive among these people who would drive Israel out of existence \nand into the sea. That is not going to happen. They are endangering the \nentire region because Israel is not going to let that happen. We all \nknow Israel has the capability to keep that from happening. No one \nwants a conflagration in that part of the world, but that will happen \nbefore Israel allows itself to once again be exterminated.\n  By encouraging the kind of activity that has driven Israel to that \npoint, we are prolonging the conflict and making the world a more \ndangerous place. I say to our moderate Arab friends, including our \nfriends the Saudis, with whom we do have an important relationship--\nthey are important to us. We are important to them. It is not one-\nsided. We have worked with each other for a long time. Hopefully, we \ncan work with each other again. But it is no testimonial to friendship \nto not be honest.\n  Part of what our friends there need to remember is, it is their \ncountry who furnished most of the terrorists on September 11 who did so \nmuch damage to us. It was their diplomat ambassador to Great Britain \nwho was quoted as praising these suicide bombers and terrorists. It is \ntheir country and some of their own people who are raising money or \nallowing money to be raised in that country that finds its way to \nterrorists all over the world. It is their people, in many instances, \nwho are raising money for the families who send these children in to \nblow themselves up and kill innocent Israelis. And it is their leaders, \nmany times in their controlled press, who call the United States, along \nwith the Israelis, terrorists. These are the folks we should be worried \nabout, oil or no oil.\n  The United States will not continue to be the United States that we \nall know and love and grew up in if we let these people dictate our \npolicies contrary to our own interests and to the interests of our only \ndemocratic ally in that part of the world. I know that is not going to \nhappen, and our friends, the Saudis, need to understand that is not \ngoing to happen.\n\n  The United Nations, over the years, has had every kind of conceivable \ncondemning resolution against the Israelis, while atrocity after \natrocity has occurred against the Israelis. The United Nations, instead \nof investigating and looking into these places in the world where \npeople are getting butchered by the tens of thousands, are more \ninterested in the supposed human rights violations that the Israelis \nare conducting than anything else. These are supposed to be the \nobjective analyzers of the situation in Jenin and other places.\n  I urge that perhaps they take a look at their own behavior and their \nown attitudes. Our European friends, I hope, would reassess their \nattitudes and their public statements of their leaders at a time when \nanti-Semitism is breaking out once again in key European countries.\n  As we watch the elections, as we watch the synagogues being burned, \nwe are getting condemning lectures from them because we are supporting \nthe only democracy in the Middle East. What in the world are they \nthinking? What kind of reaction do they think that is going to engender \non our part?\n  I think it is very important that we send a strong, clear message, as \nI think the President has done, and that we in this body send a clear \nmessage we will not bow to such wrong-headed public opinion, no matter \nhow universal it is at the present time. We should be the leaders and \nwe should point out the error of their ways. They should change their \nopinions because we are not about to turn our backs on an ally who has \nbeen our ally for so many years; that is a democracy, is not \naggressively pursuing anyone except in self-defense, and who is now \nbeing subjected to a new kind of warfare that is, I believe, designed \nto wipe them off the face of the Earth in the end. Otherwise, we would \nhave had at least a peace process that meant something instead of one \nthat is in name only and is violated as soon as the ink is dry on the \npaper.\n  So I again commend my friends from Connecticut and Oregon for giving \nus an opportunity to vote on this and to add our voices to those who \nare so wishful for a resolution in this troubled part of the world, who \nunderstand that it is in the interest of the United States to have a \nresolution in this part of the world. It is the right thing to do. It \nis the humane thing to do, to engage in that kind of process. It serves \nour interest with regard to our war and fight on terrorism in other \ncountries in that region, but at the same time, realizing that it \ncannot happen, we cannot force it to happen until the parties are \nthere, and one of the parties is not going to be there as long as the \nentire world is encouraging them to conduct continued terrorist \nactivities that, up until this point, would have been universally \ncondemned but for some reason is not being now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I want to thank my friend and \ncolleague from Tennessee for a superb statement. I thank him not only \nfor his support of the amendment that Senator Smith of Oregon and I \nhave put before the Senate today, but for the principled and compelling \nlogic of the additional statements that he made.\n  I was just about to use a term to describe the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, which I was going to say is normally associated with a \ncolleague who sits near him, and that colleague walked into the \nChamber. I was going to say his remarks were definitely straight talk, \nand I appreciate them very much.\n  Does the Senator from Arizona wish to speak?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes. I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Lieberman, and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith. There has been \ndiscussion whether it is appropriate at this time, and whether this \nwould be viewed by some as undercutting the position or weakening the \nposition of the President and the Secretary of State in their efforts \nto obtain peace in the Middle East. Those concerns are legitimate. The \nSenator from Connecticut and the Senator from Oregon considered \nseriously those concerns.\n  We are not entirely totally comfortable moving forward with this \namendment. We ought to return to our constitutional responsibilities as \na coequal branch of government. No one denies that there is a crisis in \nthe Middle East today, that there is the possibility of a wider \nconflict. There is no doubt that you can draw many scenarios in which \nthe national security interests of the United States are threatened. If \nwe accept those premises I articulated, then there does come a time \nwhen the Congress of the United States, as a coequal branch of \ngovernment, exercising particularly in the Senate our responsibilities \nof advise and consent, should speak out.\n  I know there are very strong feelings about what has happened to the \nState\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\nof Israel in the last several months. I hold those strong views. If you \nlook at the strong views we hold compared to the language in this \namendment, one would interpret that as rather mild language.\n  As I read the amendment--and the Senator from Oregon and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut can correct me if I am wrong--there is no criticism of \nthe Palestinians in this amendment, there is no criticism of the \nSaudis, who continue to fund the madrasahs which teach not only the \ndestruction of Israel but the destruction of the West and everything in \nwhich we believe. There is no criticism of the Saudis who are still \npaying money to the families of those who are ``martyrs.'' There is no \ncriticism of the Saudi Ambassador who wrote an ode to the martyrs. \nThere is no criticism of other ``moderate states in the region'' that \nhave failed--utterly, miserably failed--to renounce these suicide \nbombers not as martyrs but as an offense to Islam and an impediment to \nany possibility of peace. The language of this amendment is measured. \nIt is thoughtful. I know each word was carefully examined before it was \nput into this amendment.\n  I say to our Arab friends--and there are many Arab friends in the \nregion--if there is not a condemnation of the kinds of attacks that are \nbeing orchestrated, encouraged, applauded, and in some cases even \ncompensated for, we may see a stronger amendment from the Senate. I \ndon't believe the overwhelming membership of this body is ``pro-\nisrael,'' but I do believe there is a deep and profound recognition \nthat the State of Israel is the only democratically elected government \nin the region. The 22 members of the Arab League are all dictators.\n  There is a basic and fundamental principle of a nation's right to \nexist which is at play. Israel recognizes the right of other nations to \nexist in the region. The Israeli Government and people right now are \nfighting for the simple fundamental right to exist, and not only the \nright to exist but the ability to exist.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Oregon. We \nsupport the President of the United States and his efforts to bring \nabout peace in the region. We support Colin Powell, our distinguished \nand respected Secretary of State. We support Condoleezza Rice and all \nother efforts to bring about peace and all the members of the \nadministration who are working so hard. We applaud their efforts.\n  We also believe we, as a body, the Senate, should go on record as to \nour position and our desire to see this little country survive and our \ncommitment to seeing what we can do to ensure its survival.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Arizona for \nhis strong and principled statement. I could not agree with him more. I \npick up for a moment on what the Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee suggested earlier: This amendment might affect the \nconduct of foreign policy by the President and this administration.\n  I strongly believe adoption of this amendment will be supportive of \nthe policy of this administration and will strengthen the hand of the \nPresident and the Secretary of State, particularly as they proceed in \ntheir diplomacy in the Middle East, and more particularly in the \nIsrael-Palestinian conflict.\n  Why do I say that? Because America is always at its strongest when we \nare true to our principles. The President articulated those principles \npost-September 11 in the Bush doctrine. They say we will stand with \nthose who fight terrorism as we are fighting terrorism ourselves; all \nthe more so when it comes to a fellow democracy, a longtime ally, such \nas the State of Israel.\n  A nation gains strength by being true to its principles but also by \nbeing true to its allies and not compromising longstanding \nrelationships as a result of the pressures of the moment, no matter how \ncompelling those pressures.\n  We are a great nation. We are the mightiest nation in the history of \nthe world. If any nation has the strength to stand by its principles, \nit is, thank God, the United States of America. That is what in simple, \ndirect terms this amendment says.\n  We made a stand after September 11 against terrorism. The Israelis \nare fighting the same enemy as we are now. They are not fighting the \nPalestinians; they are fighting terrorism. In that battle, no matter \nwhat the economic or political or strategic or diplomatic pressures \nthat some may attempt to put upon the United States, we will be true to \nprinciple and we will be true to our alliances. That is what my \ncolleagues have spoken eloquently on. For that, I thank my colleagues.\n  When this Senate adopts this amendment overwhelmingly, it will send a \nmessage to those who may be equivocating, who may be remaining silent. \nRemember that line from Dante: The hottest places in hell are reserved \nfor those who in time of moral crisis maintain their neutrality. Great \npowers in the world are doing that right now.\n  We say as the representatives of the people of the United States in \nthis amendment, for the United States, we are not going to remain \nsilent. We are going to stand by our principles and by our friends. \nThat will strengthen us in our relationship with our friends and with \nour enemies.\n  I am pleased to note the presence in the Chamber of the Senator from \nUtah. I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I compliment both my colleagues to whom I \nhave been listening, Senator McCain from Arizona, a leader on this \nfloor and of course a friend for whom I have tremendous respect, and \nhis Democratic counterpart, Senator Lieberman, a dear, dear friend, \nsomeone with whom I have passed legislation where he has made a great \ndeal of difference and who has spoken eloquently and reasonably and in \na way that should advance the cause of peace in this world.\n  I also rise to address this amendment. I am joined with a large \nnumber of colleagues as cosponsors to do so.\n  This amendment is a reiteration of what Congress has overwhelmingly \nstated through the years, that this body stands in solidarity with \nIsrael.\n  Israel is a front-line state against terrorism. What they do is very \nimportant with regard to the battle against terrorism because it takes \nnecessary steps--to provide and bring about security to its people from \nthese suicide bombers by dismantling the terrorist infrastructure in \nthe Palestinian areas.\n  We have all watched with growing alarm the explosion of suicidal \nviolence that wracked Israel in the last couple of months. I am greatly \nrelieved that, for the time being, those suicide attacks have ceased.\n  But what has happened in the interim to lead to this cessation of \nsuicide bombings?\n  Was it a newfound political will in the offices of the Palestinian \nAuthority that declared unambiguously that terrorism would no longer be \npromoted or tolerated from the territories over which the PA holds \npower?\n  Was it a statement by Chairman Arafat, in Arabic, denouncing suicidal \nmurderers as nihilistic and counter productive to any cause of peace?\n  Was it a deployment of Yasser Arafat's multiple security services to \ndisrupt, capture and imprison the perpetrators of terrorism against \nIsraeli citizens?\n  No, we all know that the cessation of suicide bombings, at least for \nthe time being, was not the result of political will on the part of the \nleaders of the Palestinian Authority. It was the result of a military \ndeployment by the government Israel, a deployment by the Israeli \nDefense Forces that was costly, controversial, and . . . for the moment \n. . . successful.\n  What nation do we believe could exempt itself from the right of self-\ndefense? Isn't such an exemption fundamentally against the natural \nstate of nationhood? Have we ever expected any nation let alone a long-\nstanding friend and ally to exempt itself from its right of self-\ndefense? Of course not.\n  Yet Israel has faced a great deal of criticism for its action in the \nlast month. Certainly Israel is not above criticism--any more than it \nis exempt from the right of self-defense. But I, for one, cannot \ncriticize its right to self-defense, its need to act in its self-\ndefense, and its responsibility to use its professional military to \ndestroy the terrorist infrastructure that is still\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\ndedicated to the military defeat of the only country in the Middle East \nthat fully shares our western values. You're never going to see \ncriticism of that type coming from this Senator.\n  I recognize that there are long-standing, unresolved political issues \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians. I recognize that many Palestinians \nnow have generations of being uprooted, frustrated and impoverished \nfrom which to feed a legitimate sense of injustice.\n  I also recognize, Mr. President, that there have been many Israelis, \nin their government, in their elites, but, more important, throughout \ntheir society, who have desired, sought and worked for a peaceful \nsolution between the two peoples.\n  I was amazed myself with the offer Prime Minister Barak made to \nYasser Arafat and the Palestinians. It went way beyond anything most \npeople I talked with thought that Israel should do. It should have been \nsnapped up by Yasser Arafat, and certainly it should become at least a \nbasis for trying to resolve the conflict between the Palestinians and \nthe Israelis.\n  I have my doubts if Yasser Arafat can be a partner for peace. His \nduplicity is well-known; he talks peace in English on the White House \nlawn and before some aid agencies. He speaks jihad in Arabic before \nyoung Palestinian crowds and in the courts of Arab leaders. The man \nwho, nearly 20 years ago, could not address the United Nations, a body \ndedicated to the resolution of conflicts without violence, without the \nsymbol of a pistol holster on his hip, clearly today continues to \nbelieve that there is a legitimate role for terrorism.\n  The reason there have been no suicide bombings in Israel in the last \nfew days is not because Yasser Arafat has preached the renunciation of \nterror. It is because the IDF went after the terrorists that Arafat's \nPalestinian Authority harbors. It is an old lesson that we dare forget \nat our own peril: Tolerate terrorism and it will grow and multiply, \nfeeding every angry and hateful cause. Negotiate with terrorism and you \nwill legitimize it, creating incentives for more terrorism and the \npromoting the deadly illusion that terrorism is some form of legitimate \npolitical expression.\n  We all recognize that the IDF actions of the past month do not \nguarantee that suicide bombings will cease, and I say this with a sense \nof reality and deep regret. I even recognize that those absolutely \ndedicated to terrorism have most likely not been dissuaded from their \nnihilistic path. I also know that perhaps some of those living in \ndespair in the Palestinian territories may have been made more \ndesperate, and that their desperation may be used by the cynical \nmanipulators behind the suicide attacks.\n  I long for the day when all the peoples of the Middle East are freed \nfrom regimes that harbor hatred rather than promote growth, that plan \nfor war rather than development, that delude their peoples while \ndenying them a future of prosperity.\n  I strongly support the Administration's efforts to help find a just \npolitical solution to this conflict, and to begin talking, at this \nearly stage but generations too late, about economic development that \nwill give the Palestinians outlets to channel their work toward \nbuilding secure and prosperous futures for their families and future \ngenerations. I empathize with the Palestinians who have unemployment \nrates well in excess of 50 percent. No wonder there is unrest and \ndiscord over there. I support, even, calls for immediate reconstruction \nassistance to the Palestinian territories, to be channeled, I would \nhasten to add, by legitimate non-governmental organizations, and not by \nthe Palestinian Authority.\n  I encourage the Administration's efforts to bring the so-called \nmoderate Arab nations into this effort. Those nations will not only \nhave to dedicate their diplomatic efforts toward encouraging the \nleaders of the Palestinian Authority to accepting a political solution. \nThose countries will not only have to dedicate substantial funds for \npromoting economic development that channels the energies of the \nPalestinians into productive and peaceful endeavors. But if those \ncountries are to succeed in their diplomacy and with their assistance, \nthey will have to stop encouraging anti-Semitic and anti-American \nhatred in their own societies. I certainly wish the Administration the \nbest of luck in this very difficult endeavor.\n  We will need to see a political solution before we seen economic \ndevelopment, Mr. President. But to have a political solution, there \nmust be political will, on both sides, to reach an settlement. A \npolitical solution cannot be begun under a wave of terrorist attacks. I \ndon't see how anybody can criticize Israel under the circumstances. \nTerrorism requires a military response. We are finding that is so true.\n\n  While I have always believed this country should support Israel in \nits effort to seek peace, I strongly believe that we must remain \nequally dedicated to Israel's right to self-defense. For this reason, I \nam proud to cosponsor this amendment, and I urge the unanimous support \nof my colleagues with a vote for it.\n  Madam President, I have been talking about Israel and terrorism and \nwhat we have to do about it. But now I want to shift for a minute and \ntalk about the extreme dissatisfaction registered by Senator Grassley, \nthe ranking Republican member of the Finance Committee, Senator Phil \nGramm, and others on our side of the aisle in regard to the trade \npromotion authority and trade adjustment assistance--the Andean Trade \nPreferences Act and trade promotion authority.\n  Trade creates jobs both at home and abroad.\n  Trade can also help promote political stability in many regions of \nthe world.\n  It is in our national interest to foster free trade.\n  Let us look at the facts.\n  Ninety-six percent of the world's consumers live outside our borders.\n  Based on that fact alone, the United States would be foolish not to \npursue a vigorous trade agenda. But let me go on.\n  Exports accounted for about 30 percent of U.S. economic growth over \nthe last decade, representing one of the fastest growing sectors in our \neconomy.\n  Almost 97 percent of exporters are small or medium-sized companies \nand, as my colleagues are aware, small businessmen are the engines of \njob growth.\n  In fact, almost 10 percent of all U.S. jobs--an estimated 12 million \nworkers--now depend on America's ability to export to the rest of the \nworld. Export-related jobs typically pay 13 percent to 18 percent more \nthan the average U.S. wage.\n  And there are many reasons to believe that the best is yet to come in \nthis dynamic sector.\n  Economists predict that there could be a 33 percent reduction in \nworldwide tariffs on agricultural and industrial products in the next \nWTO trade round. This action alone could inject an additional $177.3 \nbillion into the American economy in the next 10 years. That is a lot \nof money.\n  I strongly support Congressional passage of Trade Promotion Authority \nlegislation this year. I was the one who made the motion and got it \npassed out of the Senate Finance Committee upon which I sit.\n  TPA will provide a measure of certainty to our trading partners that \nany agreement reached with USTR will receive timely Congressional \nconsideration and will not die a slow death by amendment.\n  Look, the Finance Committee passed the trade promotion authority \nlegislation by a wide, bipartisan 18 to 3 vote back in December.\n  I agree with Senator Gramm that if we had an up/down vote of this bi-\npartisan bill permitted by the Majority Leader, it would probably pass \nwith over 70 votes.\n  I believe it would pass by an over whelming majority of 70 or more \nvotes.\n  The majority leader knows this. We all know this.\n  Instead, the bill that was laid down last night was a thumb in the \neye of bi-partisanship.\n  It is bad for America.\n  It should not and will not be adopted by the Senate this week, next \nweek, this month, next month, this year, or next year.\n  Members of the Finance Committee know that all last year, I took the \nposition that Congress must pass both trade promotion authority \nlegislation and trade adjustment assistance legislation.\n  If both bills do not pass, neither will pass. That is the truth of \nthe matter.\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\n  That is the political reality.\n  It is also true that there is little we can do in Congress to help \nthe prosperity of American families--and help the prosperity of nations \naround the world--other than TPA.\n  We need trade promotion authority to open up new markets for American \ngoods.\n  We also need trade adjustment assistance to provide retraining and \nother benefits to workers who lose their jobs due to the effects of \ninternational trade.\n  Let me acknowledge that there are some in my caucus who are leery of \nTAA because they are justifiably concerned about expanding yet another \nfederal entitlement program.\n  In my state of Utah, we have felt the effects of the dumping of \nimported steel by the closing of the Geneva Steel production \nfacilities, and the loss of almost 2,000 jobs.\n  I commend the action the President took on steel.\n  I support TAA to help displaced workers, but it must have reasonable \nlimits.\n  The TAA bill that was before the Finance Committee last fall was \nalready too big.\n  I was going to say, the TAA bill that was reported by the Finance \nCommittee, but I am not sure that is an accurate statement.\n  Anyone present that day will tell you that the vote on the bill \nappeared to take place in violation of Senate rules--specifically, the \nrule against conducting Committee meetings for more than two hours \nafter the full Senate was in session was invoked.\n  The gavel went down after time had expired.\n  Let us face it. Unlike the bipartisan trade promotion authority \nlegislation, this TAA bill has had a strange partisan bent to it from \nstart to finish.\n  Last night a bad TAA bill got worse.\n  While I remain hopeful that we can do what we should do, and pass \nboth TPA and TAA.\n  I want my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to know that \nthere is little sentiment on our side for passing TPA at any cost.\n  That is what Senator Grassley and Senator Gramm said earlier today, \nand I agree with them.\n  Let us get this process back on track.\n  I think if we can do that we will find that a strong consensus can \ndevelop on trade issues--both on TPA and TAA.\n  I am mindful that there will be those on both sides of the aisle that \nwill remain inalterably opposed to either trade promotion authority or \ntrade adjustment assistance.\n  For the good of the American people, we cannot afford to let that \noccur.\n  I have a lot of faith in Senator Grassley. He is a good man. He is a \nhard worker. I have trust in the fact that Senator Baucus wants to do \nthe right thing. He is a good man. He works hard on the Finance \nCommittee. I hope they get the chance to help bring us together.\n  My fear is that the bill that was laid down last night may put the \nSenate on a glide path to disaster.\n  Just as there appeared to be a narrowing of the issues of the health \ncare aspects of the TAA bill, a host of new issues were suddenly put on \nthe table for the first time.\n  As I read it, the Majority Leader's bill includes measures that were \nnot included in any of the bills that were reported by the Finance \nCommittee.\n  It is my understanding that never in any of the negotiating meetings \nhas the issue of wage insurance been raised--but it then suddenly \nappears in the majority leader's bill.\n  I do not want to see these important talks over this legislation \nstall, but my colleagues on the other side must be willing to come to \nthe table with reasonable proposals.\n  I believe that there is a way that my Republicans and Democratic \nColleagues can come together and pass both TPA and TAA.\n\n  Frankly the measures that we are discussing today were all reported \nby the Committee separately as free-standing bills.\n  Let me be clear. I would like to see the Senate take up and pass the \nAndean Trade Preference Act, Trade Promotion Authority, and Trade \nAdjustment Assistance this year.\n  Perhaps we would be better off by taking them up one at a time.\n  As I recall, we didn't approve an omnibus trade bill in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  It appears to many that the bill laid down last night was hastily-\ncrafted with apparently a partisan purpose in mind.\n  Just let me give you one example. I ask my colleagues to turn to page \n23 of the bill distributed last night. This section is entitled \n``Action by the Secretary'' and deals with appeals of the TAA \ncertification process.\n  Now turn to page 41 of the bill. You will see this entire section \nrepeated verbatim.\n  One of the reasons for careful consideration of legislation by the \nCommittees of jurisdiction is to avoid these types of embarrassing \ndrafting errors that occur when complex laws are rewritten in the dead \nof night outside the regular order.\n  As the ranking Republican member on the International Trade \nSubcommittee and as a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell \nthe Senate that international trade has long been one of the most \nimportant foreign policy tools of the United States.\n  The Bush administration--led by Commerce Secretary Don Evans and our \nUnited States Trade Representative Bob Zoellick--has helped launch a \nnew round of international trade talks. We all have an interest in \nmaking the next World Trade Organization ministerial succeed.\n  In order to make the next ministerial a success, it is important that \nthe United States signal to the world that we will continue to make \ntrade a very high priority. We can do this best by passing TPA.\n  I will say again that I recognize, in all likelihood, the Senate will \nneed to act on Trade Adjustment Assistance legislation if there is a \nchance of passing the TPA bill.\n  So be it.\n  I am for both TPA and TAA.\n  But let me be clear, I am not for a loaded up TAA bill with \nunrealistic health care provisions.\n  On a related issue, I am deeply disappointed by the health care \nprovisions of the Daschle substitute.\n  As someone who has worked very much in a bipartisan way during my 26 \nyears in the Senate on all health care issues, this has become a \npartisan issue. It shouldn't be.\n  I am a strong advocate of getting Trade Promotion Authority for the \nPresident--but Senator Daschle's amendment includes health care \nprovisions that are just unacceptable to me and other members of the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  Let me take a minute to highlight some of the more egregious health \nprovisions in the Daschle substitute.\n  The Daschle amendment has a 73 percent advanceable, refundable tax \ncredit that may be used for COBRA coverage or other pooled insurance \ncoverage.\n  S. 1209, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act that was rammed through \nthe Finance Committee required the Treasury Secretary to create a \nprogram that would pay 75 percent of the COBRA subsidies. These \nsubsidies could only be used for COBRA benefits.\n  What Senator Daschle is promoting is only a slight improvement over \nwhat was included in S. 1209--hardly a compromise, in my opinion. \nSubsidizing health insurance by 73 percent is just too high.\n  It is my understanding that the discussion between Senators Grassley \nand Baucus were much more constructive on this issue and now the \nmajority leader's substitute goes in the direction away from a \nreasonable compromise.\n  The Daschle substitute also allocates $200 million for National \nEmergency Grants to States in order to provide assistance and support \nservices to eligible workers. This grant money could be used to pay for \nhealth care coverage; however, States may also use this money to \nprovide benefits through the Medicaid program or my CHIP program we \npassed a few years ago.\n  Both the Medicaid and Child Health Insurance programs are programs \nfor the low-income; however, the way I understand the Daschle \nsubstitute, anyone would be eligible to participate in these programs \nno matter how wealthy.\n  While this is an improvement over the TAA legislation approved by the \nFinance Committee, which essentially gave States the option to offer \nMedicaid coverage to uninsured workers, it is still unacceptable.\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\n  In fact, during the Finance Committee's consideration of S. 1209, I \nexpressed my strong opposition to the Medicaid expansions included in \nS. 1209.\n  Those of us who are familiar with the history of the Medicaid program \nknow that State options usually end up becoming permanent fixtures of \nthe Medicare program.\n  While the Daschle substitute doesn't include the blatant Medicaid \nexpansions of S. 1209, I believe it is a backdoor way of expanding both \nthe Medicaid and CHIP programs.\n  And if I had to make a prediction, chances are that these \n``temporary'' provisions--I will put ``temporary'' in quotes--will end \nup becoming permanent. It is as if we are not even listening to our \nState Governors.\n  They keep telling us that the States' budgets are in financial \ndisarray. My State can't even afford to cover children eligible for the \nCHIP program--3,000 more children than the 27,000 who are currently \ncovered.\n  I believe that the Daschle provisions on Medicaid and CHIP could have \nvery serious financial impacts on both the State and Federal budgets, \nespecially when both are experiencing budget shortfalls.\n  What is most troubling to me is that the Daschle substitute provides \nthe uninsured far more generous health benefits than those who have \nexisting health coverage.\n  I don't understand why any Member of the U.S. Congress would want to \npromote a provision that actually acts to encourage individuals to \nremain unemployed because they can get better health coverage.\n  By offering such generous health benefits, this bill encourages \npeople to remain unemployed.\n  Is this the American way?\n  Is this the way to fulfill the American dream?\n  Is this what we in the Congress want--more uninsured Americans?\n  I hope not. In my opinion, this bill contains an unintended incentive \nthat promotes joblessness.\n  And even more disturbing, the drafting of this partisan bill may send \na very clear message--take it or leave it.\n  Is there room for bipartisan discussions here?\n  Can we work together?\n  These are the areas we ought to work together on to bring a consensus \nabout.\n  Can we work out our differences?\n  Can we find a fair compromise?\n  I sure hope so. But, I have my doubts about it because of the way \nthat this debate has started. And that is just not acceptable for the \nAmerican people.\n  Senator Grassley does have the right idea--there are health care \nprovisions that can be included in TAA in order to get trade promotion \nauthority approved by the Senate.\n  I, for one, would be willing to support tax credits for the purchase \nof COBRA, pooled insurance, or individual insurance, so long as the \nindividual has a choice of coverage, not a take-it-or-leave it \nrequirement set right here in Washington.\n  In addition, I believe it makes sense to provide funds to States in \norder to create and operate insurance pooling arrangements.\n  I also support providing funds for National Emergency Grants so \nStates can subsidize health insurance for TAA eligibles.\n  In my view, we are not that far apart that we cannot come together.\n  I think we can if we just have some good-faith effort here on the \nfloor and behind the scenes.\n  I only hope that we do not let this opportunity to pass both trade \npromotion authority and provide reasonable health insurance subsidies \nto uninsured Americans slip away.\n  I am committed to working with my Senate colleagues, for as long as \nit takes, to get this job done. So, I urge my colleagues: let's quit \nthe partisan bickering, let's roll up our sleeves, and let's get the \njob done.\n  In closing, I urge passage of both the trade promotion authority \nlegislation and the trade adjustment assistance bill. But let's make \nsure these bills are bills we can live with, bills that are bipartisan \nin nature, bills where we have worked out the kinks and the \ndifficulties, bills that are not a partisan benefit to one side or the \nother, bills that will do the best for our individual citizens in this \ncountry who need this help.\n\n  I hope we can get this job done before Memorial Day.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the presence of the two main \nsponsors of the amendment in the Chamber. We have had a number of \nspeakers. I wonder if it would be Senator Lieberman's intention to have \na vote on this amendment fairly soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield to Senator Lieberman for purposes of \na colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, responding to my good friend from Arizona, it \ncertainly is our intention to have a vote on this amendment this \nafternoon. I think it is important to do so. And it is my understanding \nthat that is also the intention of the leadership of the Senate. I \ngather some conversations may be going on with the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, who was in the Chamber earlier, before going to a \nhearing, who said he had a statement to make of limited duration. I \nbelieve there is an attempt to have him come to the floor as soon as \npossible. I do not know of any other Senators at this time who wish to \nspeak on this amendment.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped we could encourage any Senators who want \nto speak to come to the floor, but I am not sure there is any really \ncompelling reason to continue to hold up the business of the Senate, \nparticularly since we have other pending issues to address. So I hope \nwe can do that fairly soon. Maybe around 4, in the next 15 or 20 \nminutes, if possible.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk, just for a minute, about this \nimbroglio in which we find ourselves over the Trade Preference Act, the \nAndean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, the trade promotion \nauthority and trade adjustment assistance, and the Generalized System \nof Preferences. I do not intend to take a lot of time, except to note \nthat this is a very serious issue. It is unfortunate that we seem to be \ndiverging rather than converging in our efforts to reach some kind of \nagreement.\n  I would like to say a few words about the Andean Trade Promotion and \nDrug Eradication Act. All of these issues we are trying to address are \nvery important. But I point out, there is an extreme time sensitivity \nassociated with what I will refer to from now on as ATPA, the Andean \nTrade Preference Act.\n  I remind my colleagues that as of the 16th of this month--in 2 \nweeks--if we do not act, then this legislation will expire, customs \nthat are retroactive will be levied on goods that have been brought \ninto the country. And I want to emphasize the serious impact this would \nhave on these four struggling democracies in our hemisphere: Bolivia, \nColombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\n  I remind my colleagues that this ATPA grew out of a commitment that \nthe former President Bush made at the February 1990 Cartegena Drug \nSummit to provide economic benefits to these four Andean countries. The \nreason for it was, it was an effort to reduce illegal drug production \nand trafficking in these countries by promoting legitimate economic \nactivity in these countries. Well, that was in 1990. The legislation \nwas passed in 1991.\n  We have now had 11 years of ATPA. What happened in these four \ncountries? First, the good news is that Bolivia's coca production has \nbeen reduced to practically zero. The bad news is that Colombia is in a \nvery serious situation. As we know, the FARC leaders--who have just \nbeen indicted by the United States of America and controlled a large \ntract of the country--have continued to engage in narcotrafficking, and \nthe overall supply of cocaine into the United States has not been \nreduced. That is actually in spite of the valiant efforts of the \nGovernment and the people of Colombia, with the assistance and help of \nthe United States of America, and other countries, to try to\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nbring about a peaceful resolution to this very serious insurgency \nsituation in Colombia.\n  Have no doubt, the funding for the FARC, to a large degree, has been \nmade possible because of the trafficking in drugs. Peru has gone \nthrough a very difficult time, as we know. The former President was \noverthrown. There was a scandal the likes of which only bad novels are \nmade from, where the former chief of intelligence was videotaped while \nproviding bribes to Members of their Congress and judges. And a former \nPresident is now residing in Japan. There is a new President of Peru, \nwhom I had the opportunity to meet. I think he is doing his very best.\n  Let me say, finally, that in Ecuador they have been dramatically \naffected by the whole situation in Colombia. In summary, because I see \nthe majority leader on the floor, I will just say that the situation, \nas far as ATPA is concerned, is serious. We should consider carving \nthat out from the other trade provisions and perhaps moving that piece \nof legislation on its own. It is time sensitive and critical. We made a \ncommitment a long time ago to these countries. I see no reason to \nrenege on that commitment now to four struggling nations in our own \nhemisphere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. \n3389 offered by Senator Lieberman and Senator Gordon Smith. This \namendment is an important expression of our Nation's solidarity with \nthe Israeli people during these attacks against their people. Civilized \npeoples must come together to fight and defeat terrorism wherever it \noccurs.\n  There can be no negotiations with terrorists. On September 11, the \nAmerican people experienced the depravity of international terrorism. \nThe Israeli people have been subjected to a barrage of terrorist \nattacks that have been specifically targeted at civilians. It is \nincumbent on the United States to send the message throughout the world \nthat these acts will not tolerated.\n  It has been made evident that the Palestinian leadership uses suicide \nbombings as a means to accomplish political goals. This is simply \nunacceptable, and must not be tolerated. We must continue to ensure \nthat Israel has all the necessary resources in order to defend itself. \nWe must make it clear to all nations in the region that there will be \nconsequences for support of terrorism. But most of all, we must send a \nmessage to the world that the United States stands in unity with \nIsrael.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor today's \namendment expressing solidarity with Israel. Like many Americans, I \nhave a very personal connection to the Israeli people and to the State \nof Israel. And it is with a heavy heart that I join my colleagues today \nin mourning the innocent lives lost in the recent terrorist violence in \nIsrael.\n  The U.S.-Israeli relationship is one of the strongest and most \nimportant of all of our bilateral relationships. Within that context, \nit is my sincere hope that this amendment will send a clear signal by \nexpressing the overwhelming sense of the Senate that America is now and \nalways will be firmly committed to a future in which the state of \nIsrael can live in security and peace with all of its neighbors. It is \nmy greatest hope that our ongoing commitment to these principles, and \nthrough them to peace in the region, will demonstrate our country's \nrespect for the dignity and future of the Israeli people, while \nestablishing the basis for a political settlement to the conflict.\n  I also want to state clearly, and for the record, that I supported \nPresident Bush's decision last month to send Secretary Powell to the \nMiddle East to help bring the current crisis to a close and to bring \nIsraelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Intense U.S. \nengagement remains an essential ingredient in the resolution of the \ncrisis, although nothing will be accomplished without the added \nleadership and foresight of the Israeli and Palestinian people. I also \nbelieve that the President was right to call on both the Palestinians \nand the Arab states in the region to take responsibility for ending \nterror and the culture of hatred that threatens peace in the region. \nAnd he has also been justified in calling on Israel to take a number of \nconcrete and compassionate steps to ease the pressure on Palestinian \ncivilians. In the end, only through continued efforts at the highest \nlevel will the United States be in a position to assist our strongest \nally in the region and give the Israeli people an opportunity to seize \na secure future.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \namendment submitted by Senators Lieberman and Smith demonstrating our \ncontinued solidarity with our ally, Israel, in its efforts to defend \nitself against terrorism. Suicide bombings and the taking of lives of \ninnocent civilians are terrorist acts by anyone's definition. No moral \nor political justification exists for the bombing of civilians on buses \nor in restaurants or at religious celebrations. This resolution makes \nit clear that we oppose these acts of terrorism and that we recognize \nand support Israel's right to defend itself against them.\n  Now that Yasser Arafat is no longer confined to his headquarters in \nRamallah, it is imperative that he make every effort possible to stem \nthe tide of Palestinian terrorism and to break up whatever elements \nremain of the terrorist networks. And it is equally important that \nthose Arab states who say they want to work with us in the war on \nterrorism do all that they can to help bring about an end to all forms \nof terrorism. They must make it clear that like us, they too oppose \nsuicide bombings and that they expect the leadership of the Palestinian \nauthority to live up to its responsibility to bring them to a halt.\n  Israel exercised its legitimate right to self-defense when it used \nforce to root out and break up the terrorist networks threatening its \nown civilians. But force alone cannot ensure the security of the Israel \nand its people over the long term. I am convinced that the only way to \ntruly enhance Israel's security is to replace the dynamic of violence \nwith hope and political settlement.\n  This amendment acknowledges that reality. It calls upon all parties \nin the region to pursue vigorously efforts to establish a just and \nlasting comprehensive peace. When I was in the region in January, I met \nwith all the key players. At that time I came away convinced that we \nmust find a way to get back to a peace process. That need is even more \nurgent now.\n  Ultimately the Israelis and Palestinians are going to have to live \nwith each other as neighbors, not enemies. Passions are so high at this \npoint that it is difficult if not impossible for either side to imagine \nthat future. It is our responsibility, as the one country with the \ngreatest influence over both sides, to help them see beyond the current \nimpasse and to move them toward the prospect of reopening political \ndiscussions particularly now that some semblance of calm has been \nestablished. Now that the Administration has finally gotten engaged it \nmust stay engaged. Our role as broker is vital and we must be willing \nto undertake it if we are serious about Israel's long-term security, \npeace in the Middle East and combating terrorism.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as we debate this amendment expressing our \nNation's support for Israel, we must recognize the unique relationship \nthat exists between our two nations.\n  Israel has been the starting point of United States foreign policy in \nthe Middle East since 1948, when the United States under President \nHarry S Truman became the first country to formally recognize the state \nof Israel.\n  Good relations with Israel are of vital importance to the United \nStates' interests in the Middle East. It is the only democracy in the \nregion and a reliable ally of America.\n  This bond is even deeper. Israel is a nation that we mirror--in our \nculture and in our historical values. It is essential that we continue \nto work with Israel on advancement of these commonalities.\n  Our relationship with Israel is reminiscent of the American role in \nthe French Revolution, which at the time many considered a foolish \nposition. Although America was a new and small nation on the other side \nof the Atlantic, we empathized with the French aspirations for liberty \nand equality. To understand our motivation, we should look at the words \nof Thomas Jefferson. ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that \nall men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with \ncertain unalienable rights'' he wrote, enshrining in the Declaration of\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nIndependence the concept of all men being created equal. To Jefferson \nand all the signers of the Constitution, the quest for equality at that \ntime was to be pursued not just within America, but throughout the \nworld.\n  America's role in the French Revolution was an extension of the \nliberty and freedom that we stood for, exercised through our foreign \npolicy. Today, this same concept applies to our foreign policy and \ncontributes to our special relationship with Israel.\n  As an ally and friend of the state of Israel, America provides the \nJewish state $3 billion a year in military and economic support--the \nlargest amount of direct aid provided to any nation by the United \nStates. Israel is also the beneficiary of a preferential trade \nrelationship with the United States.\n  The ability of the people of Israel and the region to lead normal \nlives has been shattered by acts of violence and terrorism. It is \nimpossible to observe the tragic situation that has been dragging on \nover the past 18 months without recognizing that no one--Israelis, \nPalestinians, or any of their neighbors--is interested in continuing to \nlive their lives this way.\n  There is no doubt after September 11 that our Nation has a new \nunderstanding of the plight of our friends in Israel. There can be no \nquestion that the Middle East harbors a significant percentage of the \nworld's terrorists, including many individuals who share the philosophy \nof those who attacked America.\n  This is why we must support this amendment and stand in solidarity \nwith our brothers and sisters in Israel.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will vote for this amendment because I \nagree with its general purpose--to reaffirm unequivocally U.S. support \nfor Israel's right to defend itself against acts of terrorism or other \nforms of aggression. Israel is a friend and ally, and it has faced \nthreats to its survival for over half a century. Since its birth in \n1947, we have provided Israel over $50 billion in aid. There is no \ndoubt about our support.\n  While I will vote for this amendment I am uneasy that we are \nconsidering this matter at just the time when we are finally seeing \nreal progress in defusing the recent crisis. While some wish it \nreflected a more balanced approach, this is the only amendment to be \nconsidered.\n  The amendment expresses support for Israel ``as it takes necessary \nsteps to provide security for its people.'' I fully support that. But \nas so many have said, some of the steps taken by Israel in the past \nweeks and months have been both unnecessary and counterproductive. I \nfear that, in the long run, these steps may have weakened the security \nof the Israeli people because of the bitterness and the desire for \nvengeance that they caused among Palestinian civilians--many of whom \nhad previously shunned violence. And there appears to be far more \nsupport for Yasser Arafat today among average Palestinians than there \nwas just a few months ago.\n  The amendment demands that the Palestinian Authority ``dismantle the \nterrorist infrastructure.'' I fully agree that this needs to happen. I \nalso know, as Secretary of State Powell has said, that Yasser Arafat, \nwhose security apparatus has been largely destroyed by the Israelis, \ncannot do everything himself even if he wanted to, but he can and must \ndo more. I also know there are people in the West Bank and Gaza who \nwill do anything to sabotage progress toward peace.\n  The amendment singles out Egypt and Saudi Arabia to ``act in concert \nwith the United States to stop the violence.'' They should do that, and \ncondemn more forcefully the suicide bombings. These governments have \nmany problems, and certainly the Saudi Government, with all its wealth, \nhas not always played the constructive role it could. But it is \nimportant to recognize the positive things they have done, which this \nresolution fails to do. The Saudi Government has put forward the only \nviable peace proposal in the past 18 months. Not even the U.S. \nadministration has done that. Egypt, according to Secretary Powell, has \nbeen supportive of U.S. policies in the region.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, which addresses a number of issues, is \nsilent on others that need to be addressed. Given the vastly \nconflicting reports of what happened at Jenin, an impartial \ninvestigation should be done. The use of U.S. weapons also needs to be \nlooked at, particularly since the State Department reports of \n``numerous serious human rights abuses perpetrated by Israeli security \nforces during the year.''\n  And most important, there needs to be a recognition of the role of \nthe Israeli settlements in the recent explosion of violence. For this \namendment to not even mention the role that the settlements play \nstrikes me as a serious omission because until that issue is resolved, \nI am afraid the bloodshed will continue.\n  It has been widely recognized for years that the United States is the \nonly country that can play the role of intermediary in the Middle East. \nThe situation has become so polarized, and steeped in hatred, that our \ntask is now infinitely harder.\n  It is time for a more forceful strategy for peace because it is clear \nthat normal diplomatic efforts have failed. Both sides say they want to \nlive in peace, but whatever they have gained or suffered in the past \nfew weeks has, I believe, only made peace more elusive.\n  A two-state solution is the only solution, and that means a \nPalestinian State that is viable, that is worth living for, not a state \nin name only.\n  And for Israelis, it means being able to live free of terror and \nfear. Suicide bombings or other deliberate attacks against civilians \nare acts of terrorism that can never, ever be justified. These bombings \nshould be condemned by everyone, including countries in the Middle East \nthat have either expressly condoned them or tacitly approved them by \ntheir silence.\n  The strategy of the Palestinian leadership has been a disaster for \nIsraelis, for Palestinians, for the entire region. Mr. Arafat has \nrepeatedly deceived his own people. Palestinians are an industrious, \ncompassionate, proud people. They deserve far better. Mr. Arafat has \nsurvived this latest storm, but he needs to act immediately to prove \nthat he wants peace and can be trusted.\n  As long as either side deprives the other of the freedom, the \ndignity, and the security to which all people are entitled, the \nbloodshed will continue. The President was right when he said there has \nbeen a lack of leadership on both sides. That is why, more than ever, \nstronger U.S. leadership is needed--leadership that receives the \nsupport of both sides.\n  I hope this amendment encourages that leadership.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today and join my \ncolleagues in expressing solidarity with Israel.\n  The Senate includes members of different faiths, ethnic backgrounds, \nand political ideologies. But despite our differences, we have shown \nour ability to come together at important moments and unite around \ncommon principles.\n  We rallied together, Democrats and Republicans, to support the war on \nterrorism after our country was attacked.\n  And we have worked together in a bipartisan manner not only to meet \nAmerica's national security and homeland security needs, but also on \nissues such as education reform.\n  I am pleased that so many of my colleagues--Democrats and \nRepublicans--are joining me to express solidarity with Israel.\n  We stand with Israel because Israel has been a friend and partner of \nthe United States.\n  We stand with Israel because Israel is a democracy and shares our \nvalues.\n  We stand with Israel because we have an obligation to secure the \ncontinuance of a Jewish state. We have seen--and must not forget--the \nhorrors of the Holocaust when too many people, leaders and governments \nfailed to intervene.\n  ``Never Again'' will the world fail to see, or hear, or speak, or act \nwhen the Jewish people are being persecuted and murdered.\n  It is important for the people of Israel to know that we continue to \nstand with them, and it is important for Israel's enemies to know that \nAmerica will not abandon her. Furthermore, our continued support of \nIsrael sends a powerful and unequivocal message to terrorists \neverywhere that the United States will not retreat in our war against \nterror.\n  This is a critical moment for Israel and for the prospects of peace \nin the Middle East.\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\n  For far too long, that region has been plagued by war and bloodshed.\n  Israelis have suffered violent attacks against them since the state \nof Israel was born more than 50 years ago. Israel is a small country, \nand really a small community where it seems everyone knows each other, \nso when tragedy strikes, the loss is felt intensely by all.\n  Israelis have somehow learned to endure attack after attack, and \nalmost to view terrorism as a normal part of life. Certainly, deadly \nattacks have occurred frequently, but for them to be seen as normal is \nitself a tragedy.\n  We stand with Israel because we too mourn the loss of innocent lives.\n  In the past 18 months, the violence has escalated to an unprecedented \nand completely unacceptable level.\n  During the Jewish festival of Passover, 28 Israelis who gathered for \na Seder were butchered; 28 innocent victims including children, \nmothers, fathers, grandparents.\n  This past week, on the Jewish Sabbath, more innocent Israeli \ncivilians--including a 5-year-old girl inside her home, and a husband \nand wife lying in bed--were killed in cold blood by Palestinian \nterrorists.\n  We recall other incidents like the joyous Bat Mitzvah celebration \nthat suddenly became a killing field, and we think of Israelis \nparticipating in typical activities like stopping for a nosh at the \npizzeria, riding a bus to school or work, enjoying a night at the \ndisco--not realizing that they would instead be killed. But these are \nthe conditions Israelis face.\n  While we admire Israel's bravery and perseverance in the face of \nconstant threats, we must not accept a world in which terrorism is so \ncommonplace.\n  Americans do not want to be victims of terror again, nor can we \nexpect Israel to stand idle while her citizens are being slaughtered. \nOnce we identified those responsible for the attacks on the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon, we sent our troops to Afghanistan to bring the \nterrorists to justice and end their ability to strike again. We vowed \nto stamp out evil and to continue our fight as long as necessary.\n  How then can we--or anyone--reasonably ask Israel to allow the \nterrorists responsible for murdering innocent Israelis to remain free \nand continue to plan more attacks? We cannot.\n  So we reaffirm our commitment to Israel's security and right to self-\ndefense.\n  We stand with Israel because Israel's enemy--terrorism--is also our \nenemy, and the U.S. has no better ally than Israel in our war on \nterrorism.\n  We stand with the people of Israel who want a safe, peaceful and \nprosperous future not only for themselves but also for their neighbors.\n  We all pray and hope for peace so that all the people in the region \ncan live free from danger and without fear.\n  I have in the past called on the administration to be more actively \nengaged in brokering peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n  I believe the President neglected the region and the issue for too \nlong, and as a consequence hostilities increased and more innocent \nlives were lost.\n  But now the administration has become more engaged, recognizing that \nthe United States has important reasons for promoting peace and \nfighting terrorism there as elsewhere around the globe.\n  And we have a unique position of leadership that also comes with a \nresponsibility to be actively involved in efforts to bring about \nlasting peace.\n  So the United States should do all it can to support peace, and reach \nout to Israelis, Palestinians, neighboring Arab states, and all other \ninterested parties willing to work towards a solution.\n  But in doing so, we must be clear in expressing our solidarity with \nthe people of Israel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nbeing accommodating to me and other Senators.\n  I strongly support the Lieberman amendment reaffirming this Nation's \nsolidarity with Israel. It is a timely resolution, and I am proud to be \na cosponsor.\n  I have said many times that the terrorist attacks on our country on \nSeptember 11 brought us closer to Israel. Every American now better \nunderstands the terrifying reality that Israelis have lived with day in \nand day out since Israel was founded 54 years ago.\n  Today we send a message to the people of Israel: We stand with you in \nthis time of great challenge.\n  Each of us recalls the hundreds of letters and resolutions that \npoured into our offices from foreign capitals around the world in the \naftermath of September 11. Their message was clear: The world will not \nallow terrorism to triumph. We are right to send that same message to \nour friends in Israel today.\n  This amendment rightly calls on Chairman Arafat to fulfill his \ncommitment to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in the \nterritories. Without a clear and demonstrable commitment to battle \nterrorists, the world will remain skeptical of his intentions and his \ngoals.\n  As Arafat acts, so must the rest of us. We all have a role to play, \nand this amendment calls on ``all parties in the region to pursue \nvigorously efforts to establish a just, lasting, and comprehensive \npeace.''\n  This land is home to three of the world's greatest faiths. And what \nhappens there affects our common future.\n  That means we all have responsibilities.\n  The Arab States, particularly our key allies, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, \nmust provide the same kind of leadership in the battle against \nPalestinian terrorism that they have demonstrated in our common efforts \nagainst extremism in Afghanistan.\n  Israel, too, must act. At Oslo, at Wye, and again at Camp David, \nIsrael has taken risks for peace. It must be--and I believe it is--\nready to do so again.\n  We must all recognize Israel's right to defend itself against attack. \nThat is a basic right of every nation and this amendment affirms it \nclearly.\n  At the same time, we call on Israel to distinguish between those who \nseek only to provide for their families, and the agents of terror who \nseek Israel's destruction.\n  Lastly, the United States must remain engaged in this vital region. \nWe must remain actively involved in negotiations. More than any other \ncountry in the world, we can help to bring the parties together. We \nmust continue to do so.\n  The President's initiative to deepen United States involvement in the \nregion is right for America, and it is right for Israel.\n  The United States is--and will remain--Israel's best friend. We \nmust--and will--honor our commitment to preserve Israel's military \nsuperiority. And we must continue to make clear--as this resolution \ndoes--that our bonds with Israel are unshakeable.\n  We must also recognize that part of the war on terrorism must be to \nbuild productive societies. Right now, in Afghanistan, we are \nrebuilding that country and showing Afghanistan, and the world, that \nour war is with the Taliban and al Qaeda, and not the Afghan people.\n  We must do the same in the territories--held rebuild the West Bank \nand repair the infrastructure of Palestinian society.\n  In doing so, we will send a message to the Palestinian people and the \nworld: Terrorists destroy, democracies build. And we will build.\n  The names and the details in this resolution are different than those \nmessages we received from around the world in those dark days last \nSeptember. But the fundamental principle is the same: In the battle \nagainst terrorism, the world must be united. We are right to send that \nsame message today to our friends in Israel, and to all of the people \nin the region who long for peace.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Lieberman amendment.\n  Mr. President, there comes a time when, as leader, one has to make \ndecisions about schedule that are not always in keeping with every \nSenator's wishes. But if anybody has looked out the window, they know \nthat the storm which is forecast is virtually upon us. There are \nSenators who wish to catch airplanes prior to the time the airport is \nshut down. I have had numerous requests all afternoon for a vote on the \nLieberman amendment to accommodate those Senators who need to leave.\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\n  So while I fully appreciate the fact that there are some Senators who \nhave yet to speak, given the circumstances we face weather-wise and the \nneed for Senators to accommodate their schedules, I have made the \ndecision that we will have a vote.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nLieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nTorricelli) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), and the Senator from \nUtah (Mr. Bennett), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) would \neach vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 94, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 102 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--94\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Byrd\n     Hollings\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bennett\n     Bunning\n     Helms\n     Torricelli\n  The amendment (No. 3389) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, first let me say, I cannot understand the \nrush to act on this amendment. This is a resolution. It was called up \ntoday as an amendment to the pending legislation. I had hoped to speak \nbefore the vote, not that my speech would have made any difference \ninsofar as other votes are concerned, but I wanted to speak before the \nvote. I sent word to the leadership that I wanted to speak before the \nvote.\n  For several days I have had hearings scheduled in the Appropriations \nCommittee, hearings on homeland security, hearings on the supplemental \nappropriations bill. Those are important hearings. A couple of weeks \nago, the Appropriations Committee conducted hearings on the \nsupplemental and the homeland security request, and we heard from \npeople at the local level, the local responders: The firefighters, the \npolicemen, the health personnel. We had a good hearing.\n  On the day before yesterday, the committee continued its hearings and \nwe had administration witnesses. We again had administration witnesses \ntoday. The distinguished Senator from Washington, who is now presiding \nover this Senate, was there today at those hearings. The hearings were \nset. They were announced in advance. We had important witnesses today--\nSecretary of HHS, Tommy Thompson; we had the Attorney General; we had \nthe head of FEMA. And there was good attendance in the committee. \nSeveral Senators on both sides of the aisle were there to ask \nquestions.\n  All of a sudden, here comes, right out of the blue, this resolution \nexpressing solidarity with Israel in its fight against terrorism. I had \nwanted to speak on that resolution before it passed. I am under no \nillusions as to whether or not my remarks would have made any \ndifference. They would not have. I know that. I know that. The die is \ncast.\n  On this subject, the American people should understand that when this \nsubject is before the Senate, the vote can be predicted--any matter of \nthis nature, where Israel is involved.\n  I am as much a supporter of Israel as any Senator in this body. I \nhave spent my years, in considerable measure, studying about the \nhistory and the creation of that great people, God's chosen people. I \nhave read it in the Book of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, \nJoshua, Judges, Ruth, First and Second Samuel, First and Second Kings, \nFirst and Second Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job--and so on. I \nam a student of the history of this people.\n  If the Bible were as small as the Constitution, I would carry it also \nin my shirt pocket; the Old and the New Testament. So the people of \nIsrael have no greater defender of their national integrity than this \nSenator from the State of West Virginia.\n  But I think it was a mistake to bring this resolution up before this \nSenate at this time. I do not think it is very helpful to the efforts \nthat are being made to bring the two sides together.\n  As the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I know what this \nSenate every year votes by way of appropriations in support of Israel. \nI know that each year, almost without any questions asked, we \nappropriate roughly $3 billion--$3 billion--to the State of Israel. We \nappropriate roughly $2 billion to the Government of Egypt. Those two \ncountries count on these moneys as if they were entitlements. They \ncount on receiving those moneys. Three-billion dollars. That is what \nthe American taxpayers give them.\n\n  I am not sure the American people are fully aware that this \nGovernment, this Congress, appropriates $3 billion every year--every \nyear, as sure as the calendar rolls around--$3 billion for Israel, and \n$2 billion for Egypt.\n  Despite the progress made over the past few days to ease tensions on \nthe West bank and end the standoff over Yasser Arafat's headquarters in \nRamallah, the Middle East remains a tinderbox. It is a tinderbox. Even \nthe slightest spark could ignite another conflagration.\n  Why do we have to come here with this resolution today? Why all the \nrush?\n  I informed the leadership--I will say it again--that I wanted to \nspeak on this resolution before the vote. I will not make too much of \nthat. In the annals of history, that won't even merit an asterisk. But, \nas a Senator who has been a Member of this body and in my 44th year in \nthis body, as a senior Democrat, as the President pro tempore of the \nSenate, as one who has served as majority leader, as minority leader, \nas one who has served as chairman and as ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations, I was denied what I asked for. I asked to \nspeak on the resolution before the vote. That is fairly easy to \ninterpret. That is not difficult language to understand. I was denied \nthat.\n  What is the hurry? Oh, the airport was going to be closed. So what? \nThere is a storm. Senators need to go. OK. Senators have a right to go \nwhen they want to go. I was conducting a hearing. It was my duty as \nchairman to proceed with that hearing. I was told that the need was \ngreat. I sent word that I wanted to speak. Finally, realizing that the \nvote might occur anyway, I asked Senator Leahy to take the gavel in the \nCommittee. And he had to go. I asked Senator Stevens, my Republican \ncounterpart, my colleague, to take the gavel, and continue so I could \ncome to the floor and speak. When I got to my office, they were already \ninto the vote 5, 6, or 7 minutes--I don't know. So I\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\nfound that the vote was already taking place. Well, that was \nunfortunate.\n  This is not a time for chest-thumping rhetoric. This is a time for \nquiet diplomacy, measured speech, and clear direction. This is not the \nmoment for Congress to stir the Mideast pot. Unfortunately, that is \njust what the resolution before us does.\n  I am sure it is a well-intentioned resolution. I know there are many \nMembers of this body who feel passionately about the devastating \nsuicide bombers who have caused so much chaos and heartbreak in Israel. \nI recognize that there are many Senators who are aching to express in \nsome tangible way their support for Israel. I understand their anguish, \nand I sympathize with their frustration. But this is not the time to \nexpress that frustration. It is not the time.\n  According to the news reports I have read, the White House has \nstrongly urged Congress not to inflame passions by staging a vote on \nIsrael. The fear is that even a symbolic vote by Congress in favor of \nIsrael would jeopardize the already precarious role of the United \nStates in the Middle East peace negotiations and could even backfire by \naggravating tensions and possibly provoking more violence in the Middle \nEast.\n  Does anyone actually believe--does anyone, anyone, anywhere actually \nbelieve--that the U.S. Senate needs to manufacture a vote to \ndemonstrate its support of Israel? Do we not have an unblemished record \nof support stretching back to the founding of the State of Israel in \n1948?\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, since 1976 Israel \nhas been the largest--the largest--annual recipient of United States \nforeign assistance and is the largest cumulative recipient since World \nWar II. Since 1985, we have provided about $3 billion a year to Israel \nin foreign assistance. If Israel does not know by now the depth of \nUnited States support and solidarity, it never will.\n  I object not only to the timing of this resolution--and I believe the \ntiming is fraught with peril--I also object to the slant of the \nresolution.\n  Yes. The United States Senate supports the State of Israel and abhors \nthe violence that has been perpetrated against its citizens by \nPalestinian suicide bombers. The United States Senate also supports \npeace in the Middle East. And peace in the Middle East is a two-way \nstreet. Nowhere in this resolution--nowhere in this resolution--is \nIsrael called upon to fulfill its role in working for peace in the \nMiddle East.\n  Why was this resolution written so hurriedly? Why was it incumbent \nupon this Senate to vote today?\n  This resolution condemns Palestinian suicide bombing, demands that \nthe Palestinian Authority dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in \nPalestinian areas, and urges all Arab States to act in concert with the \nUnited States to stop the violence.\n  Where are the demands that Israel withdraw from Palestinian lands and \ncooperate in establishment of a Palestinian State? Where is the \ndenunciation of the destruction of homes and water lines and roads and \nbasic infrastructure in Jenin and Nablus and elsewhere in the West \nBank? Where is the expression of support for humanitarian and \nreconstruction aid to the innocent Palestinian victims of Israel's \nincursions into the West Bank? Where?\n\n  If the Senate is serious about promoting peace in the Middle East--\nand I believe to the depths of my soul that the Senate is serious--then \nwe should leave the grandstanding to others. We should support the real \nwork of peacekeeping. For better or worse, the United States has been \ncast in the role of honest broker in the Middle East. But resolutions \nlike this one do not enhance our ability to perform that role. The \nMiddle East today is balanced on the head of a pin. This is not the \ntime for the U.S. Senate to wade into the fray, waving an ill-timed, \nill-advised, and one-sided resolution.\n  I voted against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I withhold my suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Senate just voted on an amendment \nexpressing solidarity with Israel in its fight against terrorism. I \nvoted for the amendment. But I also thought it necessary to explain my \nviews so my vote and my position on this current Middle East situation \nis fully understood.\n  I strongly agree with the main thrust of the amendment as I \nunderstand it; that is, the United States has a historically unique \nrelationship with Israel; that we condemn violence; that we condemn \nterrorist attacks; that we condemn the loss of innocent lives of \nIsraeli citizens; and we vigorously support efforts to achieve peace in \nthe Middle East.\n  I have a couple of concerns that I want to raise, concerns with the \nlanguage of the amendment. The first concern is that the language \nimplies--or can be read to imply--a blanket support for any and all \nactions that Israel may choose to take in this fight against terrorism.\n  In my view, our President was right when he called upon Ariel Sharon \nto immediately withdraw troops and Israeli forces from Palestinian \nterritories. He first made that demand on April 4 of this year. He \nrepeated the demand that Israeli forces be withdrawn on the 6th of \nApril. Our Secretary of State, Colin Powell, reiterated that position \non behalf of our Government when he visited the Middle East on April 8.\n  In my opinion, this recent occupation of Palestinian territories by \nIsraeli troops is an obstacle--the continued occupation is an \nobstacle--to renewed negotiations for peace between Israel and the \nPalestinians. It is very much in the interest of everyone involved that \nIsrael withdraw those troops.\n  While I understand fully that Israel views the current situation as a \nstruggle for its very survival, a viable peace process requires \ntemperance and compromise on both sides. A blanket statement of support \nfor any U.S. ally causes me concern because there are times--and this \nis one of those times--when the United States needs to disagree with \nthe actions of an ally, whether they are military actions or otherwise. \nIn my view, when we believe our statements will serve the cause of \npeace, we should not be reluctant to state that disagreement.\n  Long term, the only vision of peace that holds out hope for the \nIsraelis and the Palestinians both is for Israel to live in a secure \nIsrael that is not threatened by its neighbors and for the Palestinians \nto live in a secure Palestine. In the short term, the suicide bombings \nand violence against civilians in Israel must stop, and Palestinians \nmust be allowed to rebuild their communities and return to some \nsemblance of normalcy in their lives. The current violence and military \nreaction to that violence has led to a dangerous downward spiral that \nprevents any serious consideration of a negotiated settlement.\n  I also point out one other shortcoming of the amendment that we have \nadopted; that is, that it says nothing about the need to assist the \nPalestinian people to live lives marked by peace and a reasonable \nstandard of living. It is essential that the entire Palestinian people \nnot be allowed to lose hope that some reconciliation between themselves \nand the Israelis can be achieved.\n  While the United States has a unique relationship with Israel, as the \namendment states, as a superpower, we also have a unique responsibility \nto bring the two sides together. We will lose that opportunity if we \nfail to acknowledge our concern and responsibility for the well-being \nof the Palestinian people.\n\n  I hope very much that in the appropriations process which is still \nunfolding this year in Congress, aid will be provided both to Israel \nand to help with the rebuilding of communities in the Palestinian \nterritories. Such aid, hopefully, will assist not only in establishing \na reliable security regime for Israel and for the Palestinian people \nbut also help both societies to rebuild their social and physical \ninfrastructure to provide hope for their children and for future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to speak briefly about trade \nadjustment assistance, which is the subject we have been discussing \nmost of this week, prior to consideration of this amendment related to \nIsrael.\n  I rise today in strong support of the trade adjustment assistance \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\noffered in the Daschle trade amendment. I am extremely pleased that it \nhas come to the floor and I look forward to the debate over the next \nfew weeks. From my perspective, this is legislation that takes a very \nsignificant, positive, and long overdue step forward for American \nworkers, firms, and communities.\n  In 1962, when the Trade Expansion Act was being considered in \nCongress, the Kennedy administration established a basic rule \nconcerning international trade and American workers. When someone loses \ntheir job as a result of trade agreements entered into by the U.S. \nGovernment, we have an obligation to assist these Americans in finding \nnew employment.\n  I think this is a very simple proposition really, one that recognizes \nthat if the U.S. Government supports an open trading system, it is \nultimately responsible for the negative impacts this policy has on its \npeople. It suggests that if the U.S. Government believes that an open \ntrading system provides long-term advantages for the United States, the \nshort-terms costs must be addressed if the policy is to continue and \nthe United States is to remain competitive. It suggests that if there \nis a collective interest that must be pursued by the United States in \nthe international trading system, our individual and community \ninterests must be simultaneously protected for the greater good of our \ncountry.\n  In my view, the proposition makes even more sense now, as we are, \nunfortunately, facing a very different economic climate than we were \njust a few years ago. The way it is now, most people who lose their \njobs cannot simply go across the street and get the same kind of work. \nTheir old jobs are gone, and they need something different to make a \ndecent living. These are people who have been dedicated to their \ncompanies and have played by the rules over the years. They deserve a \nprogram that creates skills, that quickly moves them into better jobs, \nthat provides opportunities for the future, that keeps families and \ncommunities intact. They deserve something more than an apology that \nthis is just the way the market works. They deserve the recognition \nthat they are important, that they matter, and that we need them to \nmake our country strong. There are people who are being hurt by trade \nin every State, and they need our support.\n  My interest in this legislation was reinforced in 1997 in Roswell, \nNew Mexico, when the Levi-Strauss plant closed and I saw first hand how \ntrade adjustment assistance worked. Unfortunately, the importance of \nthe program has only increased over the years. In Las Cruces, in \nAlbuquerque, in Questa, in Alamogordo, in my own hometown of Silver \nCity--time and again we have seen the negative impacts of trade in my \nState. Since 1994, we have had over 10,000 people in New Mexico \ncertified for trade adjustment assistance. The number would be closer \nto 20,000 if we added secondary workers and contract workers.\n  I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have similar \nstories from their States. Many are worse than my own. Department of \nLabor statistics show that since 1994 over a million Americans have \nbeen certified to receive trade adjustment assistance. And these are \nthe people who are actually eligible for trade adjustment assistance \nand have applied. There are literally hundreds of thousands of others \nwho deserve these benefits but are not eligible, or who are eligible \nbut don't know it. They have suffered--they continue to suffer--because \nof the shortcomings of existing law, and we need to change that.\n  To reach our goal of strengthening existing law, we talked to the \npeople in my State and other States who had been laid off and had a \nstory to tell. We talked to the community leaders who had to rebuild \ntheir towns after economic disaster had struck. We talked to the local \norganizations that had to work with their people to get their lives \nback on track. We listened to where the program worked, and where it \nhadn't worked, and where it needed to be improved. We asked the GAO to \nwrite several reports on the program, so we had an objective analysis \nto use as a guideline for reform. Then, and only then, did we begin to \nwrite new legislation.\n\n  What we have here today is the outcome of several years of work. This \ntrade adjustment assistance legislation was not created in a vacuum. It \nis not trade policy in the abstract. Every step along the way we \nconnected real people to specific language in the legislation. Every \nprovision has a story behind it. Every line in this legislation will \nhelp someone make his or her life better in communities in New Mexico \nand across the United States.\n  Trade adjustment assistance is a program that is absolutely \nessential--that much is clear from the comments I have heard from my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle--but it needs to be changed in a \nway that it works more efficiently and effectively. I am convinced the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program should be both solidified and \nexpanded at this time, and we need a stronger and more consistent \nsafety net for American workers and communities. Let me quickly explain \nhow we have improved the program and why we feel it is necessary.\n  Our first objective was to combine existing trade adjustment \nassistance programs and harmonize their various requirements so they \nwould provide more effective and efficient results for individuals who \nneed help. Currently there are substantial differences in coverage \nbetween the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program and the NAFTA Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program, and we make sure those differences are \neliminated in the bill. We have taken the NAFTA Trade Adjustment \nAssistance program as a model and expanded available allowances from 52 \nto 78 weeks. This allows individuals to enroll in the specific kind of \nprogram they need to get a new job.\n  We have also expanded coverage to secondary workers and workers \nimpacted by shifts in production to any country. Currently these \ncategories of workers are only covered under the NAFTA Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program, not the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, and we \nfeel this distinction is both artificial and arbitrary. In an \ninternational economy, there is simply no logical reason that coverage \nshould be limited to individuals dislocated by trade with Mexico and \nCanada alone. Basic fairness and common sense dictates that anyone hurt \nby trade deserves the same treatment as that which is currently \navailable under NAFTA trade adjustment assistance.\n  Our second objective was to address the issue of health care in a way \nthat makes a substantial difference in people's lives. Currently \nindividuals certified for trade adjustment assistance only receive in \nthe range of $250 a week. Then they must make a choice between paying \nfor the range of expenses--health care, rents and mortgages, childcare, \neducation, transportation, and so on--that they face in their daily \nlives. This is especially difficult when they are enrolled in the \ntraining they need to get a new job. Realistically, they must sacrifice \nsomething, and frequently the first thing they sacrifice is their \nhealth care.\n  This can't continue. We have addressed this problem by providing a 73 \npercent advanceable, refundable tax credit towards COBRA coverage, the \npurchase of State-based insurance coverage, or, for those currently \npurchasing individual insurance, coverage through the individual \nmarket.\n  Our third objective was to encourage greater cooperation between \nFederal, regional, and local agencies that handle individuals receiving \ntrade adjustment assistance. Currently, individuals who are receiving \ntrade adjustment assistance obtain counseling from Workforce Investment \nAct one-stop shops in their region, but typically receive no \ninformation other than that related to their allowances and training. \nNo information is given concerning assistance and funds available \nthrough other Federal Departments and agencies. This means most people \nhave no real idea of what options are available to them.\n  To increase coordination between Federal and State agencies and \nincrease the availability of information for trade adjustment \nassistance recipients, we have created an inter-agency working group on \ntrade adjustment assistance and established stronger links between the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program and the Workforce Investment Act \none-stop shops. This way the state-based delivery system remains intact \nbut response times to\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\ntrade adjustment assistance applications will be quicker and more \neffective.\n\n  Our fourth objective was to recognize the direct correlation between \njob dislocation, job training, and economic development, especially in \ncommunities that have been hit hard by trade. Currently, trade \nadjustment assistance focuses specifically on individual retraining, \nbut does not address the possibility that unemployment might be so high \nin a community that jobs are not available once an individual has \ncompleted a training program.\n  To fix this problem, we created a community Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program, based at the Department of Commerce, specifically \ndesigned to provide strategic planning assistance and economic \ndevelopment funding to communities that have suffered substantially \nfrom a trade-related economic downturn. Significantly, this is a \nbottom-up approach, as we emphasized the responsibility of local \nagencies and organizations to create a community-based recovery plan \nthat fits the economic needs of their region.\n  Our fifth objective was to help family farmers and ranchers. At \npresent, trade adjustment assistance is available for employees of \nagricultural firms, but only when they become unemployed. This doesn't \nhelp family farmers and ranchers since they can't lose their job, there \nis no way for them to become eligible for trade adjustment assistance.\n  We fix this problem by offering trade adjustment assistance \nallowances to family farmers and ranchers but allow them to opt out of \nthe training program. This allows them to keep their land and get \nthrough the hard times that come as a result of international trade.\n  The administration has focused their efforts on obtaining fast-track \nauthority, stating that it is necessary for the United States to \ncontinue its leadership role in the international system. I do not \ndisagree with the view that new, more comprehensive trade agreements \nwill help U.S. corporations become more competitive in the \ninternational market. I am prepared to vote for an acceptable fast-\ntrack bill, as I think it is a valuable tool in opening the markets of \nother countries. But I will vote for fast-track only if a strong Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program is part of the package. I think it is \nunacceptable to move forward on new trade agreements if we do not \naddress the problems that American workers and communities face at this \ntime.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration \nto get a meaningful trade package through the Senate and to the \nPresident for signature.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I heard the senior Senator from Utah speak \nthis afternoon. I wanted to respond to what he said, but I didn't have \nthat opportunity because of the intervening events. The Senator from \nUtah and I are good friends. I think the world of Senator Hatch. But I \nthink on this issue regarding trade he is absolutely wrong. I say that \nbecause the trade bill has been laid down. There are a number of \nimportant issues in it. In fact, one of the few things I really support \nis what is being done to try to protect the steelworkers.\n  First of all, what is in this bill is very modest. It covers 1 year \nof retirement for steelworkers. When these people worked in the steel \nmills, they were promised they would have retirement benefits. Those \nretirement benefits are now gone. I bet those bosses who worked at the \nsteel companies have pensions.\n  The people who oppose this legislation, and have a filibuster going \non it now, should do what they have to do. If they don't like that part \nof the bill, move to strike it. Let's debate it on the floor and find \nout who has the most votes. Don't filibuster the bill. This is a bill \nthe President says is a most important bill. I don't necessarily agree \nwith his priorities, but that is what he said.\n  So it seems somewhat unusual to me that members of his own party are \nholding up this legislation. The first amendment is up and we cannot \nvote on it; there is a filibuster. We have all been through the energy \nbill, and we know how long that was held up. We were finally able to \npass that. We want to bring up hate crimes; they will not let us do \nthat.\n  Terrorism insurance, I have spoken on this floor several times about \nthe importance of that terrorism insurance. Realtors, developers, \nbankers, and people in the financial markets say that is extremely \nimportant.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury for the United States testified this \nweek that if that is not passed, it will have at least a 1-percent \neffect on the gross domestic product of this country. Now, my friend, \nthe Presiding Officer, Senator Reed, is chairman of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, which renders reports to the Senate on a frequent basis \nabout the state of the economy of this country. Whether the Secretary \nis right or not, I think it is something we should take into \nconsideration.\n  We on the Democratic side have agreed to have this legislation go \nforward. We have tried everything we can to bring it to the floor. We \nhave even agreed to have four amendments. So I hope everybody \nunderstands that we want this legislation to go forward. There isn't a \nsingle Democrat holding up this legislation.\n  I hope the President and the people who work with him will send a \nmessage to the Republican Senators that this terrorism insurance should \nbe passed. I hope we can get that done as quickly as possible. People \nare awaiting construction projects, some are even talking about \nstopping some of it. We have a large shopping center in Las Vegas, one \nof the largest construction projects; it is in a mall. There are a lot \nof stores there. They are talking about stopping in the middle of \nconstruction because they can't get a continuation of their insurance.\n  So I hope the President will do that during the break we have. We \ndon't need to be involved in a filibuster on the trade legislation. We \nneed to move forward with hate crimes, terrorism insurance, and so many \nother items. I hope we can do that as soon as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3832-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3832-S3833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, momentarily we will take up a unanimous \nconsent request that will accommodate a debate on the farm bill \nconference report. As I understand it, the distinguished Republican \nleader is on his way to the Chamber. Let me comment briefly on a couple \nof scheduling matters.\n  I know the assistant Democratic leader has talked on several \noccasions and has offered unanimous consent agreements on terrorism \ninsurance. We would be prepared, once again, to offer a unanimous \nconsent agreement on terrorism insurance, but I hear our Republican \ncolleagues continue to object. We have said on many occasions we are \nprepared to go to the floor procedurally, have a debate on any one of a \nnumber of questions relating directly or indirectly to terrorism \ninsurance, but for whatever reason, our Republican colleagues continue \nto refuse to allow that debate and that consideration. This has been an \nongoing effort.\n  We have made many attempts to satisfy those certain Senators on the \nother side who proclaim interest and support for terrorism insurance, \nbut we have been unable to satisfy their obstruction--I use that word \nwith full appreciation of its definition--their obstruction when it \ncomes to an important matter such as this. We will continue to try to \ntalk with our colleagues in an effort to come to some conclusion \nprocedurally, but I must say there is growing frustration on our part \nthat we have not been able to proceed.\n  The same could be said for the conference report on the farm bill. I \nhave\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\nattempted to bring the bill up throughout the day. I must say, Senator \nLott deserves commendation in his efforts to work with those who have \nthreatened filibusters on the legislation. We received a letter from \nthe President today urging the Senate to send the bill to the President \nas soon as possible. That was my hope today, that we would have a bill \nto send to the President. But as I now understand it, our Republican \ncolleagues, rather than filibustering the bill, will ask for a \nsubstantial amount of additional time.\n  We will ask unanimous consent they have 6 hours on Tuesday and 6 \nhours on Wednesday to talk about a conference report. So we will \naccommodate that request and we will proceed with that unanimous \nconsent request as soon as the Republican leader comes to the floor.\n  I have been getting calls today from the administration urging us to \ncomplete our work on trade as well. But as my colleagues know, there \nare those Senators on the other side who currently are filibustering \nthe trade bill, the trade package. So we have a filibuster on trade and \ntrade adjustment assistance, a quasi-filibuster on the farm bill, and I \nguess you could call it a filibuster on terrorism insurance--at least \nan unwillingness to proceed to terrorism insurance.\n  These issues are important. We hear oftentimes our colleagues talk \nabout how they wish we could accomplish more on the Senate floor. I \nadvise my colleagues, this is one reason it is difficult to accomplish \nmore, when we don't get any more cooperation than that.\n  I do appreciate the work the Republican leader has invested in \ngetting us at least to this point. I am prepared to entertain the \nunanimous consent request as soon as he comes to the floor.\n  I might say that the schedule next week will include not only this \nelongated debate on a conference report relating to the farm bill but \nthe trade bill. The schedule will include, of course, the debate on \nTuesday for 6 hours. We will then go back to the trade bill. The debate \non the farm conference report will pick up again on Wednesday, \nbeginning at around 9:30. Our expectation would be that we would then \ncomplete debate by Wednesday afternoon with, again, the expectation we \nwould come back to the trade bill and attempt to move and consider \nadditional amendments.\n  Because there are no vote scheduled on Monday, we will be in a pro \nforma session on Monday. There will be no votes, and I would not expect \nany debate on the trade bill on Monday.\n  That is the schedule. My desire is to dual-track other issues as they \nbecome available. I realize the possibility is not very significant, \nbut if we could reach an agreement procedurally on terrorism insurance, \nof course we would bring that up. We have other confirmation questions \nwe would want to raise and certainly would be prepared to have votes on \nthose as well. In addition, as legislation becomes available that does \nnot involve a great deal of controversy, it would be my hope that we \ncould take that up, as well, on a dual track.\n  I remind my colleagues, we do have to make every effort to \naccommodate the May 16 deadline on the Andean Trade Preferences Act. If \nwe fail, obviously all of the conditions involving the trade barriers \nthat existed prior to the enactment of TPA kick back in. We would hate \nto see that. I hope we can avoid that. We will cross that bridge when \nwe come to it.\n  Therefore, it is important we use all of that time available to us \nnext week, outside of this consideration of the farm bill, to continue \nTPA, TAA consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3833-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Byrd, at the U.S. Humane Society, \n                            Washington, D.C.\n\n       From ancient days, before the ink of history, man has held \n     dominion over the animals. Should we be able to peer through \n     the mist of those distant times, we might witness the process \n     by which man turned from gatherer to hunter, and, skill \n     permitting, began to use the flesh of animals as a source of \n     food and survival in a cold world full of danger and a \n     perilous future. Later, the relationship of man and animals \n     began to evolve through so-called domestication, and animals \n     became a more reliable source of food. A partnership of sorts \n     was formed in which animals came to bear the brunt of labor \n     and the title ``Beasts of Burden''.\n       Over this same stretch of time, man developed social \n     compacts from which sprang the seeds of modern civilization, \n     and which led to pursuits of philosophy, and an emphasis on \n     morality. The process was slow in development and uneven in \n     allocation among and within societies. Even today, attitudes \n     and actions persist that run counter to a higher \n     understanding about the value of life and the lives of all \n     things. For better or worse, man is destined to rule this \n     world, and with that charge comes the heavy responsibility of \n     benevolent custody and faithful husbandry to all creatures \n     found within nature. To fail in that duty is to denigrate the \n     sanctity of all life. Choices in our treatment of animals are \n     a good barometer of how well we are carrying out our \n     stewardship of God's beautiful world. Man may choose to rule \n     this world, or attempt to do so, but for all his worry over \n     property rights among his own species, it is well to remember \n     that it is only God who holds title to this planet.\n       Maintaining civilization sometimes seems a process of \n     constant struggle with those who, either because of ignorance \n     or a deliberate scheme, would prefer to stress efficiency and \n     materialism over more elusive concepts. To balance those \n     forces, those of us who hear a different drummer must \n     educate, legislate, and promulgate better understandings and \n     guidelines aimed at bringing mankind into closer harmony with \n     nature. The Congress embodies the collective will of the \n     American people, and those of us who serve there recognize \n     that our duty is to the people in our states. But, we also \n     have a duty to safeguard the spirit of this Nation and all \n     that it represents in terms of philosophy and ideals, as well \n     as law. You honor me this evening for my work in pursuit of \n     these higher objectives, and I am very grateful.\n       Your organization works to enrich the condition of man by \n     improving his relationship with nature, and in particular, \n     his relationship with the animal kingdom. You bring to the \n     public discourse a better understanding of the conditions in \n     which animals exist and, unfortunately in many instances, of \n     the inhumane manner in which they are treated. You remind us \n     all that animals share this planet with us, and that their \n     space, their comfort, and their lives are not without \n     importance. You remind us of man's higher purpose in the \n     larger universe. Public debate is enriched by your \n     participation, and the lives of God's creatures greatly \n     benefit because of your contributions.\n       Animals are man's fellow occupants on this blue-green ball, \n     slowly spinning through eternity, and they enlighten and \n     enliven our lives in many ways. They provide us companionship \n     and friendship. They ward off loneliness. They assist the \n     blind. They protect us. They help maintain the balance of \n     nature. While there are those who object to the practice, \n     they feed us. They benefit us in ways we don't even \n     recognize. In return, it is our duty to ensure that their \n     lives and, in some cases, their deaths, are free from \n     unnecessary discomfort. Animals, deserve our respect because, \n     they, too, are creatures of God. Combating cruelty and apathy \n     towards the welfare of animals is a high and moral calling. I \n     commend you for your altruism, and I am proud to count myself \n     among your number. We cannot correct all the problems \n     overnight, but we can make changes today, and we can make \n     changes tomorrow. We have come a long way towards the goal of \n     fostering more humane treatment for animals, but we still \n     have much to do.\n       This evening, together we pause to reflect on our \n     achievements and to contemplate future strategies. I am \n     humbled by your recognition of my work, your encouragement, \n     and the hope that our efforts may inspire others to a more \n     sublime level of humanity through empathy with the animals \n     with which we share this lovely world.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to join several of my \ndistinguished colleagues in support of S. 2439, the Human Cloning \nProhibition Act of 2002, that will outlaw the reproductive cloning of \nhuman beings, and at the same time promote critical medical research. \nDuring my consideration of the new and emerging areas of regenerative \nmedicine, including nuclear transplantation technologies, two basic \nprinciples have guided my thoughts. First, as someone who has taken a \npro-life stance, I believe that Congress should pursue policies that \nencourage the development of life-saving treatments. Second, nuclear \ntransplantation research, if performed under the strictest\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\nof safeguards, is both moral and ethical.\n  Nuclear transplantation technologies hold enormous promise for the \nfuture of medicine. For example, this research may help those suffering \nfrom defective organs. Scientists may one day have the ability to use a \npatient's own body cells to grow tissues with identical genetic \nmaterial, thereby eliminating the risk of rejection. Regenerative \nmedicine also has the potential to provide treatments for diseases such \nas cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, diabetes, ALS, multiple \nsclerosis, and many others. Experts estimate that over 100 million \nAmericans suffer from diseases that are candidates for regenerative \nmedicine research using nuclear transplantation.\n  While some critics of this research claim that we cannot be sure of \nits benefits, we will certainly not know the answer unless we try. \nScientific discoveries are never predictable, and we must not hamper \nthe abilities of our sharpest minds to explore the universe, down to \nthe tiniest cell. We do not know the full potential of this research. \nThese scientific advances may help us gain insight into how \nundifferentiated stem cells begin to develop into the more than 200 \nspecialized cells and tissues that make up the human body. There are \nuntold benefits to be gained from knowledge of the earliest development \nof these cells. In addition to the advances that may be made in the \ntreatment of common diseases, we may also learn more about human \nhealth, how disease develops, and other conditions ranging from birth \ndefects to genetically-inherited illnesses.\n  All of us know people who have suffered from incurable diseases. I \nbelieve that we must make every effort, within ethical bounds, to help \nthose afflicted with life-threatening illness. While I respect those \nwho disagree with me, I believe that support for regenerative medicine \nis the essence of the pro-life position. We must help those living in \nthe shadow of sickness, whether they are cancer patients receiving \nchemotherapy treatments or diabetics facing the loss of vision or \nkidney failure.\n  Nuclear transplantation research, if performed under strict ethical \nguidelines and with appropriate oversight, is an entirely appropriate \nand morally sound activity. For instance, during nuclear \ntransplantation, an egg is never fertilized by a sperm. Rather, the \ngenetic material from a non-reproductive human cell is placed into an \negg cell. Additionally, the resulting embryo is never implanted into a \nwoman's womb or an artificial womb. The result is that a human being \ncan never be born from this carefully controlled research.\n  I want to assure my colleagues and constituents that I am committed \nto ensuring the safety and morality of scientific research. I feel \nconfident that nuclear transplantation technologies can be performed in \na controlled and regulated environment which will prevent abuse. While \nthe bill as introduced includes stringent ethical guidelines, I am open \nto amending the bill to ensure that the strongest protections are put \nin place. For example, women who donate eggs and those who donate body \ncells must only do so in a voluntary manner. Additionally, the \ndevelopment of the unfertilized embryo in the lab must be restricted. \nTherefore, the embryo will not grow past a certain time threshold. I \nwill also gladly consider any other appropriate and reasonable \nguidelines to ensure the safety of nuclear transplantation \ntechnologies.\n\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation \nthat will ban human reproductive cloning but will promote the \ndevelopment of regenerative medicine. We must make reproductive cloning \nillegal and provide for stiff criminal penalties. This bill \naccomplishes these all-important goals. Also, this legislation allows \ninvaluable scientific research to go forward under strict ethical \nstandards, thereby establishing a policy that both respects human life \nand encourages the advancement of medicine.\n  Regenerative medicine technologies such as nuclear transplantation \nhold out significant hope for those people who suffer from devastating \nand debilitating medical conditions. Cures for horrific diseases may \none day be a reality. We should not allow these promising areas of \nresearch to go untapped, and we should pursue scientific breakthroughs \nthat will improve the quality of life for millions of people. I am \npleased to stand in support of regenerative medicine alongside former \nPresident Ford, former First Lady Nancy Reagan, the American Pediatric \nAssociation, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and 40 American \nNobel Prize winners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3834-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3834-S3835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LT. CMDR. A. JASON BAYER\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I stand before you today with a heavy \nheart. On Thursday, March 28, this country lost one of its prized sons. \nLt. Cmdr. A. Jason Bayer was killed during a search and rescue training \nmission on a rugged Sierra Nevada Ridge.\n  The son of Arthur Bayer of Carson City, NV, and the late Merry Ann \nBayer, Jason's success as a fighter pilot was determined early in life. \nAs his father recalls, the very first word out of his mouth was \n``jet.''\n  Growing up in Carson City, Jason was a star student, an avid athlete, \nand a loyal friend. Jason graduated from Carson City High School in \n1986 and the University of Southern California in 1990. Commissioned to \nthe Navy later the same year, he was accepted to the Naval Aviators \nOfficer Candidate School, from which he was an honor graduate. He \ngraduated first in his class from Intermediate Jet Flight Training, and \nthen first in his class from Advanced Jet Training. Jason was stationed \nin Japan then was a flight instructor at Cecil Field in Florida and \ngraduated from the Navy Test Pilot School in Maryland. Most recently, \nhe was a test pilot in the Naval Weapons Test Squadron at China Lake. \nJason's career was distinguished. He earned the VT 22 Eagle ``Top \nHook'' award, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the Navy and Marine \nCorps Achievement Medal. Each achievement in his career took him closer \nto his ultimate goal of becoming an astronaut. His love for flying and \nthe military and his devotion to God and this country never wavered and \nwas only paralleled by his love for his family and friends. His life-\nlong friend, Dan Bernal, described him as ``a true patriot.''\n  I share these details of Jason's life with you so that his wife Anne, \ntheir one-year-old daughter, Gabriella, and their unborn son, Jason \nChristian, will have one more thing by which to remember him. Anne and \nJason were blessed with 6 years of marriage. Although cut short, they \nwere filled with many wonderful memories. But for Gabriella and her \nbrother, stories and pictures of their father are all that they will \nhave. In speaking to Anne about her husband, I quickly learned what a \nremarkable and strong person she is as well. Jason's legacy and their \nchildren are in wonderful hands.\n  As an F/A-18 Hornet fighter pilot, Jason was prepared to fight for \nhis country no matter what the cost. He was focused on his mission as a \npilot, and he never lost sight of his dream to challenge the sky's \nlimits and be the first man on Mars. With our loss of Jason, I am \nreminded of our loss of seven valiant astronauts on January 28, 1986, \non these space shuttle Challenger. Jason was a senior in high school \nwith a bright future when President Reagan spoke of the astronauts' \nfinal journey in which they ``slipped the surly bonds of earth'' to \n``touch the face of God.''\n  Jason is surely touching the face of God today. His service and \ndedication earn him a place among the outstanding men and women who \nrisked their lives in the name of freedom and in the end made the \nultimate sacrifice. Jason's life was cut tragically short, but his time \nhere is an inspiration to me and an example of a true American hero for \nus all.\n  God bless Lt. Cmdr. Jason Bayer, and God bless his family.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague from Nevada for his \nheartfelt remarks concerning the tragic death of Lt. Cmdr. A. Jason \nBayer. I rise today to honor this outstanding individual, a patriot, \nand I agree that this country, and more importantly Nevada, has lost \none of its cherished sons.\n  It is with deep sorrow that I make this statement to you today on the \nSenate floor. Anne, please accept my sincerest condolences for the loss \nof your husband.\n  Jason made the ultimate sacrifice while conducting a search and \nrescue training mission in the rugged Sierra\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\nNevada Mountains. He truly is an American hero. You should be extremely \nproud of your husband, and I want you to know that citizens in Nevada \nand across this great nation appreciate his selfless service. Your \ndaughter Gabriella and your unborn son, Jason Christian, will forever \nknow the dedication and patriotism of their father.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud of Jason's patriotism and devotion to \nduty. I am also extremely grateful for his exemplary service to our \ncountry. I know all Nevadans feel the same way. My thoughts and prayers \nare with you and your family throughout these difficult times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3835-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE UNTOLD STORY OF MURDER-SUICIDE IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, according to a report on murder-suicides \nreleased last month by the Violence Policy Center, a firearm is the \nweapon most frequently used to murder the victims, with the offenders \nthen taking their own lives. The study notes that easy access to a gun \nwas the decisive component for almost all of the murder-suicides. Of \nthe 54 murder-suicides reviewed in this study, 52 were firearm-related. \nIf these people had not had access to a firearm, some of these deaths \nmay not have occurred.\n  There is a piece of legislation in the Senate I believe would help \nprevent easy access to firearms by felons, those determined to be \nmentally ill by a court, those individuals with domestic violence \nmisdemeanors and restraining orders, and others prohibited by law from \nowning a firearm. In April of last year, Senator Jack Reed introduced \nthe Gun Show Background Check Act. The Reed bill, which is supported by \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police, extends the Brady \nbill background check requirement to all sellers of firearms at gun \nshows. I cosponsored that bill because I believe it is critical that we \ndo all we can to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.\n  Mr. President, I believe this piece of legislation would be one of \nmany things we can do to address the problem of easy access to guns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3835-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE HOME HEALTH MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today, as an original cosponsor \nof the Home Health Modernization Act of 2002, to express my strong \nsupport for a clarification of the definition of ``homebound'' with \nrespect to eligibility for home health services under the Medicare \nprogram.\n  I want to tell you about Ms. Pamela Wolfenbarger of Fayettevelle, AR. \nMs. Wolfenbarger is a quadriplegic as the result of an accident and has \ndevoted the last twenty years to raising her son. Now that her son is \ngrown, she would like to return to school so that she might become more \nself-sufficient financially. Due the current Medicare homebound policy, \nMs. Wolfenbarger is unable to do so, nor can she leave her home to go \nclothes or food shopping, despite offers of assistance from a \ntremendous support group in her community. Ms. Wolfenbarger needs the \nservices of a home health nurse to assist her in personal care, \ndressing, and transferring from her bed to her wheelchair.\n  The current Medicare statute states: ``While an individual does not \nhave to be bedridden to be considered to be confined to the home, the \ncondition of the individual should be such that there exists a normal \ninability to leave home, that leaving home requires a considerable and \ntaxing effort by the individual, and that absences from the home are \ninfrequent or of relatively short duration, or are attributable to the \nneed to receive medical treatment''.\n  Problems have arisen because the terms ``infrequently'' and for \nperiods of ``relatively short duration'' are comparative terms with no \npoint of comparison, which has led the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services to interpret the statutory coverage criteria for home \nhealth as requiring patients to remain in their homes virtually at all \ntimes, except those times specifically excluded in the statute, in \norder to remain eligible for coverage of home health services. As a \nconsequence, many beneficiaries who are dependent upon Medicare home \nservices and medical equipment for survival, including Ms. \nWolfenbarger, are being unnecessarily restricted to their homes out of \nfear that they will lose their home health benefits.\n  I believe we need to correct this problem for people like Ms. \nWolfenbarger, and that is why I have joined Senators Collins, Bond and \nCleland in introducing S. 2085, to clarify the homebound definition. \nUnder this important legislation, the current requirement that \nbeneficiaries be allowed ``only infrequent absences of short duration'' \nwould be eliminated. By doing so, reasonable absences from the home \nwill be allowed and we will bring the home health benefit into the 21st \ncentury. I urge my Senate colleagues to support the Home Health \nModernization Act of 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3835-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on May 19, \n2001 in Fargo, ND. Two black men were assaulted late at night outside \nof their apartment. Just prior to the assault, the assailants used \nracial epithets directed at the victims. Angela Schussler, Thomas \nSchussler, and Robert Schussler were arrested in connection with the \nincident, which police described as being ``racially motivated.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3835-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3835-S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EARLY MILLER: BIRTH OF A PLAYWRIGHT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to commend to my colleagues \nan article from the New York Times reviewing a new production of Arthur \nMiller's play, ``The Man Who Had All the Luck.''\n  Produced by the Williamstown Theater Festival last summer, this \nrevival has earned acclaim for its extraordinary adaptation of this \nwork by one of America's finest playwrights.\n  The critic has offered special praise for the lead actors, Chris \nO'Donnell and Samantha Mathis as well as Sam Robards.\n  The Williamstown Theater Festival is a tremendous organization which \nbrings great drama to the Berkshires every summer, with some of the \nmost talented performers and directors in the country. This production \nis now brilliantly staged on Broadway and I know that audiences will \nenjoy this timeless and poignant American story.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 2, 2002]\n\n                  Early Miller: Birth of a Playwright\n\n                            (By Bruce Weber)\n\n       Unthreateningly handsome, with cornfed brawn, a polite-to-\n     old-ladies manner and an earnest bleat in the voice, the \n     young actor Chris O'Donnell certainly has the traditional \n     mien of the All-American boy. He's a natural for the lead \n     role in ``The Man Who Had All the Luck,'' Arthur Miller's \n     1940 play, subtitled ``A Fable,'' about America and the \n     burdens of unmitigated good fortune, which opened in a \n     stirring and rich revival last night on Broadway at the \n     American Airlines Theater. I mean, he's really a natural. \n     Known for playing sidekicks in popular films--he was Robin in \n     two of the ``Batman'' movies, and he starred with Al Pacino \n     in ``Scent of a Woman''--Mr. O'Donnell had never appeared \n     onstage before. ``The Man Who Had All the Luck'' was produced \n     last summer at the Williamstown Theater Festival.\n       Mr. O'Donnell played the title character, David Beeves, a \n     young Midwesterner who, with seemingly unearned fate, gets \n     the girl, the business, the land and the legacy, while all of \n     those around him fall victim to life's vicissitudes and \n     suffer enormous disappointments. His performance then made it \n     clear that some gifts--like effortless charisma and\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\n     physical certainty--do indeed descend on some people as if \n     ordained.\n       And now, as he leads a splendid cast in a production \n     directed by Scott Ellis that the Roundabout Theater has \n     imported largely intact from Williamstown, Mr. O'Donnell \n     appears, if anything, more in control of a character who is \n     blessed (and cursed) with being preternaturally in control. \n     It's a remarkably complex and counterintuitive performance. \n     You can't be naive and play naivete so well; nor can you be \n     conscience stricken and play ambivalence with such \n     conviction.\n       The play, written by Mr. Miller when he was 25, was his \n     first to appear on Broadway, where, in 1944, it closed after \n     four performances. And from the current production you can \n     understand why producers would take a chance on a youthful \n     playwright and why audiences and critics were not so eager \n     to join them. It is a serious, ambitious work by a \n     precocious and perhaps over-reaching young writer, \n     populated by characters with blunt purpose; a little slow \n     moving, particularly in the opening act; and a little \n     pedantic, particularly in the third (and closing) act. \n     Reviewing the original production in The New York Times, \n     Lewis Nichols said, with a yawn: `` `The Man Who Had All \n     the Luck' lacks either the final care or the luck to make \n     it a good play. But it has tried, and that is something.''\n       What no one could have known of course is what Mr. Miller \n     would go on to accomplish (``Death of a Salesman'' was only \n     five years away) and I can think of no other revival that is \n     so enriched by retrospective knowledge. Anyone interested in \n     Mr. Miller's career, which has had an extraordinary \n     reconsideration in recent seasons, will be fascinated by the \n     strong roots he planted in this early play.\n       Indeed, those who have seen any of the fine revivals of \n     recent vintage on Broadway--including ``Salesman,'' ``The \n     Price,'' ``A View From the Bridge,'' ``The Ride Down Mount \n     Morgan'' and ``The Crucible,'' which is currently at the \n     Virginia Theater--are likely to find their appreciation of \n     those plays enhanced by a viewing of this one. Here are the \n     issues of brotherly competition and fatherly betrayal that \n     Mr. Miller explored again and again. (The scene in \n     ``Salesman'' in which Willy Loman's egregious betrayal of his \n     family is revealed to his elder son, Biff, has a clear \n     antecedent here.)\n       Here are the admonitions against succumbing wholeheartedly \n     to the lures of capitalism and against the sanctimony of \n     ugly-Americanism. Here is the pained ambivalence of Mr. \n     Miller toward the so-called American dream and the agony of a \n     citizen playwright over a wayward national conscience.\n       All of these things were excitingly evident when I saw the \n     production last summer, but a couple of other contextual \n     elements weren't. One is the recent opening, 10 blocks north, \n     of ``Oklahoma!,'' the revived 1943 musical in which Rodgers \n     and Hammerstein presented a far different picture of American \n     than Arthur Miller ever has. The director of that show, \n     Trevor Nunn (who is British) and the choreographer, Susan \n     Stroman, have uncovered in it the more ominous underpinnings \n     of the national character. But even so, ``Oklahoma!'' ends \n     with a frontier trial that explicitly vindicates our hero, \n     the symbolic and joyous triump of expanding democracy.\n       Contrarily, at the conclusion of ``The Man Who Had All the \n     Luck,'' David Beeves, a man who has made a great life the way \n     the founding fathers made a great nation, simply by landing \n     in the right place and seizing the awesome opportunity, \n     remains a self-doubter. He has just dodged one more bullet, \n     and future prosperity, embodied by his newborn son, seems \n     assured to everyone except himself.\n       In the aftermath of Sept. 11, David's uncertainty seems \n     especially poignant and prescient, and especially opposed to \n     the bullheaded optimism of ``Oklahoma!,'' whose most comic \n     character is a lovable peddler (American enterprise at work!) \n     who happens to be from the Middle East.\n       In other words, this production of ``Luck'' has a fair \n     amount of luck itself, at least in its remarkable timeliness. \n     The rest of its appeal can be attributed to skill.\n       To begin with, the play is presented on Allen Moyer's \n     handsome sets--the garage that houses David's auto-repair \n     business and the home he takes over with his new wife after \n     the death of her father--that share a vaulting back wall that \n     suggests the unadorned roominess of the American plains. (The \n     props include a magnificent automobile, a 1930 Marmont.)\n       And the play itself evinces the staunchness that has always \n     characterized the construction of Mr. Miller's work. This is \n     a drama with a fully thought-through dramatic arc and nine \n     large roles, even though, like an apprentice carpenter, Mr. \n     Miller banged in a few crooked nails. When the villainous \n     father of David's fiancee is run over by a car, even the \n     man's daughter shrugs and moves on without a sign. And the \n     play's structure is long on fundamental theme-fulfilling and \n     short on subtlety.\n       Several characters, for example, exist to make a single \n     point, that most people succumb to a fateful flaw: J.B. \n     Feller (Richard Riehle), a successful local businessman who \n     invests in David's future, undermines his wish for a son with \n     his drinking. Shory (Dan Moran), a wheelchair-bound veteran, \n     curtailed his own sowing of wild oats with his penchant for \n     whoremongering. Dan Dibble (Mason Adams), an elderly farmer \n     who made a fortune raising mink, foreshadows his own personal \n     calamity with a speech about the necessity of looking after \n     your interests with unremitting vigilance.\n       All the actors are fine, and they've been welded into a \n     nifty down-home-feeling ensemble by Mr. Ellis. Mr. Adams is \n     marvelously crotchety and self-absorbed in the part, never \n     more so than when he delivers this speech, which defends the \n     principles of capitalism and mink farming. It's a set piece, \n     much like the scene in which a baseball scout, played with \n     the blunt and entertaining elan of caricature by David Wohl, \n     explains his search for the source of a ballplayer's \n     incurable flaw. It's a grand character turn, and a fine use \n     of the sport as a metaphor for the American soul.\n       Sam Robards, who plays Gustav Eberson, an Austrian \n     immigrant whose expertise and dreams become subservient to \n     David's naturally endowed privileges, hits just the right \n     notes of modesty and gratitude of someone who has bought into \n     the fabled promise of our country. The early scene in which \n     he enters David's garage and helps him repair the Marmont is \n     a finely, sweetly evoked illustration of the forging of a \n     lifelong bond.\n       The one new cast member is Samantha Mathis, who plays \n     Hester Falk, David's fiancee and then wife. This is the \n     play's only significant female role, which tells us \n     something, I think, about the playwright's youth. Wisely, Ms. \n     Mathis plays the part with the undemonstrative but cheering \n     support of midcentury wifeliness, and as a couple she and Mr. \n     O'Donnell are the image of a small town's favorite \n     sweethearts.\n       The two of them, like the play itself, evoke another era \n     altogether. As David's persistent fortune makes him ever more \n     paranoid--he's convinced it's only a matter of time until \n     fate cruelly catches up with him--she grows desperately \n     helpless. In the middle of the 20th century it was crazy to \n     think that a good-looking young American didn't deserve a \n     golden existence, or that America was living under the sword \n     of Damocles.\n       Wasn't it?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3836-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CLERGY HOUSING ALLOWANCE CLARIFICATION ACT\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Winwood, Deputy Commissioner of the United States Customs \nService, will retire after a very distinguished 30-year career.\n  Mr. Winwood served as Acting Commissioner from January to September \n2001. During that time he continued his longstanding and persuasive \nadvocacy of the need to modernize Customs automated systems through the \ncreation of the Automated Commercial Environment, often referred to as \nACE. I share his strong view that ACE is critical to enforcement and \ntrade facilitation needs. Therefore, I was especially pleased almost \none year ago when Mr. Winwood announced the selection of the contractor \nteam that will make ACE a reality.\n  While he was Acting Commissioner, Mr. Winwood also had the difficult \ntask of managing Customs through the critical days immediately \nfollowing the attacks of last September 11th. He immediately put the \nagency on Level One Alert and set the course for the commendable job \nthat Customs is doing today on anti-terrorism and homeland security \nefforts.\n  Mr. Winwood is a graduate of Indiana University of Pennsylvania and \nearned\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\na master's in management and public administration from Florida \nInternational University. He began his Customs career in 1972 after \nserving his country for 2 years in the U.S. Army, including a combat \ntour of duty in Vietnam. After service in a number of important \nmanagement roles, Charles Winwood was chosen as Deputy Commissioner on \nJune 5, 2000.\n  Customs was formed in 1789 and is our Nation's oldest law enforcement \nagency. Mr. Winwood's dedication to duty has added yet another chapter \nto the agency's long, proud history. As he ends his service to our \nNation, I ask the Senate to join me in thanking Mr. Winwood and wishing \nhim a long, happy and satisfying retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3837-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATIONS TO TECO COAL\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend Tom and \nSally Fegley, owners and operators of the award-winning Tom and Sally's \nHandmade Chocolates. For over a decade, Tom and Sally have been making \nworld-class chocolates at their Brattleboro, VT, facility.\n  Leaving corporate positions in New York, the Fegleys started anew in \nVermont with the dream of making high quality chocolate. Starting in \n1989, with little knowledge of the chocolate business, the Fegleys \nvolunteered their time as apprentices with a Jersey City chocolatier. \nAfter learning the trade, the Fegleys remodeled a vacant warehouse in \ndowntown Brattleboro to house their new business. Through trial and \nerror over the years, the Fegleys have developed and perfected their \nsuperb technique for making fine chocolates. Their diligence, passion, \nand entrepreneurial spirit have been richly rewarded.\n  Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates is a true Vermont company. While \nbuilding their business, the Fegleys have remained involved in their \ncommunity, allowing school groups and tourists alike to visit their \nfacility and learn about the chocolate-making business. Moreover, their \nefforts are incredibly innovative, incorporating traditional techniques \nfor making fine chocolates with novelty packaging and light-hearted \nhumor. No doubt, their success can be attributed as much to their \ncreativity as to their business savvy. And with their long commitment \nto producing the best chocolate possible, they've brought their \nchocolates to the world through the Internet at www.tomandsallys.com.\n  Thirteen national awards and 1.5 million chocolate cow pies later, \nthe Fegleys continue to make their amazing hand-crafted chocolate in \nBrattleboro. I am proud that my home State of Vermont has attracted and \nproduced such outstanding entrepreneurs as the Fegleys.\n  I ask that a December article from the Rutland Herald be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Dec. 23, 2001]\n\n                         Chocolates and Laughs\n\n\n    at tom and sally's handmade, the sweets are sprinkled with humor\n\n                            (By Ellen Ogden)\n\n       Most people will eat sweets any time of the year; but in \n     the high spirit of the holidays, it would be tempting, if \n     only it were big enough, to dive into a box of chocolates. \n     Especially the handmade kind: hand-dipped and decorated with \n     crystallized violets or fancy fillings, packaged as if each \n     bite were a piece of gold. A joy to the eyes as well as the \n     taste buds.\n       Chocolate is such a treat, you would think anyone who makes \n     it for a living would have fun. ``Truth is,'' says Sally \n     Fegley, co-owner with her husband Tom of Tom and Sally's \n     Handmade Chocolates, ``many fancy chocolatiers take \n     themselves way too seriously.'' Making world class chocolate \n     involves more than just a devotion to the art. It requires \n     expensive packaging and a marketing plan to match. But the \n     Fegleys have learned how to play up the pleasurable side of \n     making chocolate.\n       Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates are the best in their \n     class--they've won 13 national awards--but many of their \n     products are packaged in silly ways. For example, their best \n     selling item is a chocolate cow pie, a loosely formed plop of \n     rich Belgian chocolate mixed with a handful of nuts. The idea \n     came to Tom one morning while shaving and they've sold over \n     1.5 million of these pies, expanding on the line to include a \n     range of over 50 other animals. There are moose pies with \n     almonds, sheep pies with hazelnuts and elephant pies with \n     peanuts.\n       The irony is that Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates set \n     out in 1989 to make serious chocolate. ``We left high paying \n     corporate jobs to move to Vermont and make chocolate,'' \n     explains Sally. Dressed in a floppy white chef hat, blonde \n     hair curling out from around the sides and large gold hoop \n     earrings, Sally Fegley laughs easily. Her buoyancy seems \n     consistent with the delightful chocolate aroma that fills the \n     air of their 11,000-square-foot warehouse. She and Tom are \n     wearing matching outfits, white chef top with a chocolate \n     brown apron, each with their names spelled out in big \n     letters.\n       At age 42, they were too young for retirement, but they \n     knew they wanted to live in Vermont. It is a classic story of \n     a couple seeking a career change. They knew they would make a \n     good team. They also shared a love of good chocolate. ``We \n     were convinced that there was no one in the U.S. who was \n     making first-rate chocolate and we were determined to be \n     the first,'' says Sally. While still holding their \n     corporate jobs, they devoted a year to market research. \n     They read, consumed and visited every chocolate venue \n     around New York City.\n       And since they trained in corporate America, they are \n     highly organized and goal oriented. ``From the time we left \n     our jobs and moved to Vermont, we gave ourselves three months \n     to find a building, build the inventory and open the store \n     doors,'' says Sally. Reading and eating chocolate is one \n     thing, but actually making it was something else. They needed \n     hands-on experience before the big move. They offered \n     themselves as volunteers to several chocolate makers around \n     New York to obtain some form of basic training. But they were \n     rejected until they looked beyond the city, and found a \n     three-generation family-run chocolatier in Jersey City who \n     agreed to let them in on some secrets. The both began an \n     apprenticeship to learn about chocolate.\n       Everything was moving along like clockwork. They left Wall \n     Street where she worked at Bank of America and he was at \n     Metropolitan Life. They found a vacant building at 6 Harmony \n     Place in Brattleboro, formerly a bar and electricians' \n     warehouse. ``Right up until the opening day, every batch of \n     chocolate we made failed,'' confesses Sally. It is clear she \n     has told this story many times. Now that they have been in \n     business for over a decade and have won those awards, it is \n     easier to admit to early problems. ``It was still perfectly \n     edible and delicious, but no matter what we did, the \n     chocolate kept coming out gray and streaky.''\n       Before a chocolatier can mold the chocolate, the chocolate \n     must be melted or tempered. This breaks the crystals and the \n     butterfat; but it must be done at an exact temperature that \n     matches the original chocolate. What the Fegleys had learned \n     to make in Jersey City was based on a domestic chocolate, \n     while what they selected for their Brattleboro operation was \n     a premier Belgian brand, Callebaut. This brand has a more \n     finicky tempering habit and wasn't responding to their \n     learned methods.\n       ``To me, having your own business means trying on all the \n     knowledge and all the skills you've learned in your entire \n     life,'' relates Sally, who called upon an eighth grade \n     science class when the couple had to set up an experiment \n     involving an empirical method and deduction. They set up the \n     marble tables with candy-making trays and thermometers and \n     filled each while keeping close tabs on the temperature and \n     the procedure. They finally determined that the thermometers \n     they were using had different calibrations. ``Each batch was \n     off by as little as two degrees, but this made all the \n     difference.''\n       They are now so confident of their method that they offer \n     educational tours of the process to the public every day. \n     Located five miles north of Brattleboro on Rt. 30, Tom and \n     Sally's is a favorite site for school children who arrive by \n     the busload. It is a pristine facility, with an open floor \n     plan and\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\n     overhead signs explaining every step of the production. Large \n     picture windows allow natural light, while a dozen employees \n     are busy at the production and packing stations.\n       A typical tour begins in the back of the room, at the nine \n     vats of melting milk, dark and white chocolate. Each vat \n     holds between 125 pounds and 200 pounds of what many consider \n     to be the finest chocolate in the world. Tom, the master of \n     the production , is stationed at one marble table cutting \n     slabs of caramel and marshmallow that will be combined into a \n     layered candy and then hand dipped in dark chocolate. This, \n     his favorite concoction, is dubbed Miss American Pie.\n       Sally explains that there are basically three methods of \n     making Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates. They begin with \n     shell molds, trays of high-grade plastic with decorative \n     depressions. The molds are filled with liquid chocolate. Each \n     chocolate piece is hand filled and hand painted, then cooled \n     before another step in the process. It is an exceedingly \n     skilled and time-consuming process. ``The molds are imported \n     from Europe,'' says Sally. ``And they cost $22 apiece. We \n     have hundreds of them.'' The molds, as are all of their \n     equipment and inventory items, clearly labeled and neatly \n     stacked according to the design motif. The high-end \n     confections that result from this molding process sell for \n     $34 per pound, about a dollar each.\n       A more mechanized method is done on what Sally loves to \n     call the ``I LOVE LUCY'' machine. It is otherwise known as an \n     enrober, a conveyor belt with a series of ``waterfalls'' \n     allowing a cascade of chocolate during which each piece of \n     fruit, creme or chocolate filling is given a chocolate \n     coating. ``Remember the `I Love Lucy' segment?'' says Sally \n     with a wide smile. ``Where Lucy and Ethel reverse roles with \n     Ricky and Fred? They take a job at a chocolate factory,'' she \n     explains in vivid detail. Unfortunately, the conveyor belt \n     starts running too fast and they have to determine what to do \n     with all the chocolate. ``There is little choice but to fill \n     their mouths, stuff their pockets and hide chocolate in their \n     shirts in a vain attempt to keep up with the output of the \n     enrobing machine,'' says Sally. This skit encapsulates \n     Sally's fondness for the machine--a comedy routine that \n     reflects her own fun with chocolate.\n       Finally there is the funneling method, and this is where \n     the cow pies fit into the story. Using a large metal funnel \n     filled with warm, tempered chocolate and equipped with a \n     wooden stopper, two-ounce globs of chocolate are ``plopped'' \n     onto a marble table. It is cooled and hardened into a solid \n     mound of chocolate, and then packaged in a clear plastic bag \n     with a catchy novelty tag that describes the contents in a \n     whimsical way. The cow pies began outselling the truffles.\n       Each year Tom and Sally do something new to make chocolate \n     lovers laugh. In fact they are so good at the marketing that \n     they've had to trademark everything to prevent other \n     companies from using their ideas. ``We just spent many \n     thousands of dollars protecting our trademark on Chocolate \n     Body Paint,'' says Tom, of a product that originated as a gag \n     present for the president of the local Rotary Club. Packaged \n     with a paint brush, the label on the treat reads ``heat to \n     98.6 and apply liberally.'' It is essentially a delicious \n     chocolate fudge sauce for ice cream, but the name was catchy \n     and it sells the product.\n       While making the best chocolate in the world is still their \n     goal, Sally admits that their typical customer is more \n     interested in the funny packaging. Most of their novelty \n     chocolates are sold wholesale to over 8,000 stores across the \n     United States. ``Our niche in the world of chocolate is that \n     we are creative,'' says Sally. ``The best thing about having \n     our own business is that we have the freedom to be \n     creative,'' she adds. ``Can you imagine trying to get \n     approval to make something like chocolate cow pies in a \n     corporate world?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3838-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MONTANA'S YOUTH OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and commend \nthose who make up our Nation's workforce and who now, more than ever, \nmake a vital contribution to the success of our Nation.\n  This week, from May 6th to the 12th, is Public Service Recognition \nWeek, organized by the Public Employees Roundtable. The Public \nEmployees Roundtable was formed in 1982 as a non-partisan coalition of \nmanagement and professional associations representing approximately 1 \nmillion public employees and retirees. The mission of the Roundtable is \nto educate the American people about the numerous ways public employees \nenrich the quality of life throughout our Nation and advance the \ncountry's national interests around the world.\n  I am indeed proud to join the Public Employees Roundtable in their \nongoing efforts to bring special attention to the dedicated individuals \nwho have chosen public service as a career. This past year has \ndemonstrated the crucial role of our Nation's public employees, and has \nhighlighted the brave men and women who make up the public service \nworkforce. On September 11th, it was the public employees of New York, \nWashington and Pennsylvania who responded to the tragic events of that \nday. And since September 11th, we have seen public employees playing a \nvital role in the fight against terrorism and in protecting our \nnational security. The response of our Nation to the attacks of \nSeptember 11th demonstrates the true value of our public servants.\n  President Kennedy once stated:\n\n       Let the public service be a proud and lively career. And \n     let every man and woman who works in any area of our Nation's \n     government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with \n     pride and honor in future years: ``I served the United States \n     Government in that hour of our Nation's need.''\n\n  September 11th was an hour of our Nation's need and our public \nservants rose to challenge. The first responders on the scene in New \nYork, Washington and Pennsylvania didn't hesitate to put their own \nlives in jeopardy in the hopes of saving others. Many firemen died in \nthe World Trade Center rushing in to help. Postal employees, too, \ncontinued to deliver the mail despite the loss of several of their \nnumber to the anthrax attacks last fall. And as our hour of need \ncontinues, public servants are everyday making our skies safer, \ninvestigating the acts of September 11th, and working to prevent \nfurther terrorist attacks. The remarkable bravery of these public \nservants is a testament to the character of our Nation's public \nworkforce, of whom we can be infinitely proud.\n  The total impact of the work of public employees is impossible to \nmeasure. However, I believe very much that the United States will only \ncontinue to be a first-rate country if we have first-class public \nservants. On September 11th our public servants demonstrated that they \nwere more than first-rate, they were heroic.

The total number of credit union members in Colorado has \ngrown from 350,000 to almost 1.4 million. These are members who, like \nothers nationwide, own and control their credit unions. During this \nsame period, assets in Colorado credit unions have also increased from \n$355 million to more than $7 billion.\n  With great innovation, Mr. Beach has developed a variety of high \nquality, fairly priced programs, products and services over the years \nto meet the needs of credit unions and their members. In 1997 the \nWyoming Credit Union League contracted with the Colorado League for \nmanagement services. Since then, all staff and resources available to \nColorado credit unions are also available to Wyoming credit unions.\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\n  His record of committed service to others and dedication to \ncooperative principles includes the creation of the Volunteer \nInvolvement Program, which meets the needs of credit union volunteers \nthroughout Colorado and promotes credit union principles and \nphilosophy. Mr. Beach has also been a member of the Credit Union \nNational Association (CUNA) board; the CUNA Service Group Boards; \nChairman of the U.S. Central Credit Union; Chairman of the Association \nof Credit Union League Executives (now AACUL); and a member on the \nNational Credit Union Capitalization Commission. The Colorado Credit \nUnion System also participates in many statewide charity organizations \nand is the primary sponsor of the Colorado Credit Union's Courage \nClassic Bicycle Tour to benefit the Children's Hospital in Denver.\n  The international credit union movement has also been important to \nMr. Beach. Over the years, the Colorado League has worked with credit \nunion officials in Macedonia, Romania, Poland and Ecuador in various \nefforts to help build credit unions in those countries.\n  In addition to these many accomplishments, as chairman of Credit \nUnion House, LLC, Carroll Beach gained the cooperation and support of \nall leagues to build Credit Union House, which serves as a gathering \nlocation for credit union representatives as they visit Capitol Hill.\n  I am proud to acknowledge the retirement of this very accomplished \nman, Mr. Carroll Beach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3839-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IN MEMORY OF SENIOR CUSTOMS INSPECTOR THOMAS MICHAEL MURRAY\n\n Mr. BREAUX.

Mr. President, recently, I was made aware of an \nextraordinary eulogy delivered on February 23, 2002, at the memorial \nservices of an old and dear friend, Mr. Hung Wai Ching. It was \ndelivered by a comrade-in-arms, Mr. Ted Tsukiyama. I urge my colleagues \nto read this inspiring eulogy. It describes an important chapter in the \nhistory of Our Nation.\n  I ask that this eulogy be printed in the Record.\n  The eulogy follows:\n\n                        Hung Wai Ching: A Eulogy\n\n       Hung Wai Ching was a true and great hero of the Hawaii \n     homefront during World War II. With his passing last February \n     9, 2002, Hawaii has lost the last survivor of those few \n     wartime leaders who believed in the underlying loyalty of the \n     Japanese in Hawaii, who courageously stood up and spoke up in \n     the face of racial animosity and wartime hysteria to fight \n     and win back for the Nisei the opportunity to demonstrate \n     their loyalty to America.\n       Hawaii was indeed fortunate that Hung Wai Ching was \n     appointed to the key and critical Morale Section of the \n     Military Governor's office which served as liaison between \n     the Military Government and the civil population to maintain \n     and preserve the morale, peace and stability of a community \n     at war. One of the main jobs of the Morale Section was to \n     stabilize and prevent possible explosive race situations. \n     Reprisals against the Japanese people had to be prevented. \n     Roughneck whites and blacks amongst the thousands of defense \n     workers pouring into Hawaii had to be kept in line working in \n     harmony. When news of the ``Bataan Death March'' reached \n     Hawaii, Hung Wai rushed out to the plantations to find the \n     Filipino workers sharpening their cane knives. He told them: \n     ``Hey, you sharp da knife, eh? Good! You be ready. But no use \n     da knife until I give you da signal, OK?'' Hung Wai's ``cane \n     knife army'' had to wait patiently throughout the whole war, \n     because Hung Wai never gave the signal.\n       Hung Wai reported directly to FBI Chief Robert Shivers and \n     to Army Intelligence Col. Kendall J. Fielder, who had \n     unlimited authority to preserve the internal security of \n     Hawaii, and to detain anyone deemed a security risk. There \n     were any number of Japanese in Hawaii who, unbeknownst to \n     them, were released early from detention or were never \n     detained at all, because of Hung Wai's intervention. When \n     General Emmons first arrived in Hawaii, he called in \n     Fielder and asked him, ``Fielder, how many Japs did you \n     take in today?'', but after consultation with Hung Wai, \n     Fielder refused to make blanket quota arrests, even at the \n     risk of court martial and his future military career. The \n     tragic wartime mistake of mass evacuation and internment \n     of Japanese was not repeated by Hawaii's military and \n     intelligence leaders, largely because of calm and reasoned \n     behind-the-scenes consultation from advisors like Hung Wai \n     Ching.\n       The Morale Section concentrated its efforts on the \n     Japanese, because after the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl \n     Harbor, Hung Wai knew that everyone who was of Japanese \n     ancestry, alien or citizen alike, were ``behind the eight \n     ball.'' Pearl Harbor was still in smoking ruins. A Japanese \n     invasion of Hawaii was expected any day. Rumors of Japanese \n     disloyalty was rampant. Nisei soldiers of the 298th Infantry \n     had their guns taken away. The draft status of all Nisei was \n     changed to ``enemy alien'', ineligible for military service. \n     The President of Mutual Telephone Company proposed that all \n     Japanese be evacuated to Molokai. There was widespread fear \n     and distrust against the Japanese in Hawaii and grave \n     questions as to their loyalty to country.\n       But Hung Wai had no question or doubt whatever of these \n     same people he grew up with, his classmates all the way up to \n     the University, those that he lead in the YMCA programs. But \n     he knew that people in Hawaii and the general American public \n     at large would never be convinced of the loyalty of Japanese \n     Americans until they could get back into the armed services, \n     bear arms, fight, and even die for their country. So the most \n     significant contribution Hung Wai Ching made during the war \n     was the direct role he played in helping Japanese Americans \n     regain the opportunity to bear arms and to prove their \n     ultimate loyalty to country. This is that story.\n       On December 7, 1941, the UH ROTC cadets which had been \n     called to duty were converted into the Hawaii Territorial \n     Guard, the HTG, and were assigned to guard vital buildings \n     and installations on Oahu. Six weeks later, on January 19, \n     1942, the War Department had discovered to its horror that \n     ``Honolulu was being guarded by hundreds of Japs in American \n     uniforms,'' all HTG soldiers of Japanese ancestry were \n     discharged. Most of them returned to the University where \n     Hung Wai met, consoled, counseled and inspired a group of \n     confused, bitter and disillusioned Nisei to offer themselves \n     to the Military Governor as a labor battalion. I was one of \n     them, I remember his key pitch was: ``So they don't trust you \n     with rifles, maybe they'll trust you with picks and \n     shovels.'' ``Picks and shovels???'' Here, Hung Wai was asking \n     guys who were trying to get a college education to escape a \n     future of plantation labor to volunteer to go back to manual \n     labor! But considering the desperate situation they were in, \n     Hung Wai made sense. So, in the end, 169 Nisei signed a \n     petition to the Military Governor offering themselves as a \n     labor battalion. Hung Wai took that Petition to Col. \n     Fielder to assure that the Petition would be accepted by \n     the Military Governor. The group was called the ``Varsity \n     Victory Volunteers'' and were assigned to the 34th \n     Construction Engineer Regiment at Schofield Barracks to \n     perform essential defense construction work for the next \n     11 months.\n       As the acknowledged ``Father of the VVV'' Hung Wai took a \n     paternal interest in his VVV boys and showed them off at \n     every chance. In December 1942, Col. Fielder asked Hung Wai \n     to escort the Assistant Secretary of War, John J. McCloy, the \n     most powerful man in the War Department, on a field \n     inspection trip. Hung Wai made sure that McCloy saw the VVV \n     Quarry Gang cracking rocks and operating the quarry up at \n     Kolekole Pass and told him, ``those are all Nisei university \n     boys who gave up their education to do their part for the war \n     effort.'' Could it have been a mere coincidence that five-six \n     weeks later, President Roosevelt announced the formation of \n     an all Nisei combat unit and called for volunteers. This was \n     exactly the ultimate objective of the VVV and the chance they \n     had been working and waiting for, so the VVV voted to disband \n     on January 25, 1943 so that they could volunteer for the \n     442nd. Thus, it was the VVV which had been inspired and \n     initiated by Hung Wai Ching that proved one of the key \n     factors leading to the decision to allow the Nisei to fight \n     for country by the formation of the 442nd Regimental Combat \n     Team, and the rest is well known to history.\n       Hung Wai then adopted the 442nd in place of his disbanded \n     VVV boys, and used his connections with War Department to \n     assure\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\n     that the 442nd be given every opportunity and fair treatment \n     to succeed. When Hawaii's 442nd volunteers sailed out of Pier \n     11 on the Lurline troopship, Hung Wai was one of the few \n     persons allowed on the Pier to see them off. Five days later \n     when the Lurline sailed into San Francisco, there standing on \n     the pier to greet the 442nd boys was Hung Wai Ching. He had \n     flown up to California to meet and request that General \n     DeWitt treat these volunteers with dignity and to withdraw \n     any armed guards along the route because ``these were not \n     Japanese POW's, they were American soldiers.'' Then Hung Wai \n     asked the General if the 442nd could be given overnight \n     passes so that they could eat chop suey in SF Chinatown. The \n     General thought he was crazy. Imagine, Hung Wai was asking \n     the very same man who had ordered 120,000 Japanese to be \n     evacuated from the West Coast and imprisoned into American \n     concentration camps to allow 2,452 ``buddahead soldiers'' to \n     roam around the City of San Francisco. Crazy it was, but it \n     shows how much Hung Wai tried ``to take care of his boys.''\n       When the troop trains bulled into Camp Shelby, Mississippi, \n     the boys were greeted with the comforting sight of Hung Wai \n     standing at the train station. He had just returned from a \n     War Department visit where he tried to get the training \n     site of the 442nd moved out of the South to a more \n     racially tolerant Midwest. Secretary McCloy told him the \n     decision was already made but authorized Hung Wai to \n     travel to Camp Shelby to oversee the organization of the \n     442nd. At that time, the City of Hattiesburg, Mississippi \n     was in uproar over the news, ``Jap regiment to train at \n     Camp Shelby!''. First thing, Hung Wai met with the editor \n     of the Hattiesburg American and the Chief of Police to \n     tell them that ``These were not Japs, these were American \n     soldiers who had volunteered to fight for their country.'' \n     Thereafter, the ``Go Home Japs'' editorials ceased and the \n     ``Japs Not Wanted'' road signs disappeared. Hung Wai saw \n     to it that the 442nd got its own USO and that it was \n     located on the white side of the then still-segregated \n     Hattiesburg. An old-fashioned Southern Baptist minister \n     had been appointed as the first 442nd chaplain but Hung \n     Wai got the Army Chaplain's Corp to replace that chaplain \n     with Hawaii's own Reverends Masao Yamada and Hiro Higuchi. \n     These are some of the reasons why Hung Wai Ching is one of \n     the first to be named an Honorary Member of the 442nd \n     Veterans Club.\n       Earlier, in May, 1942, Col. Fielder had assigned Hung Wai \n     to observe and monitor the formation of the Hawaiian \n     Provisional Infantry Battalion, predecessor to the famed \n     100th Infantry Battalion. Hung Wai was instrumental in \n     assuring that the 100th would be staffed and led into battle \n     by Hawaii-born officers like Col. Turner, Maj. Lovell, \n     Captain Johnson and Captain Kometani. Hung Wai monitored the \n     progress of the 100th through its training, maneuvers and \n     overseas Italian and French battlegrounds, and everywhere he \n     went and spoke, he extolled the exploits and distinguished \n     battle record of ``The Purple Heart Battalion.'' And this is \n     why Hung Wai is named as one of the exclusive Honorary \n     Members of the 100th Infantry Battalion Veterans Club.\n       Back at Camp Shelby, Hung Wai tells us the high brass of \n     the 442nd were going crazy trying to figure out who this \n     ``Bossy Chinaman'' was, always accompanied by ranking \n     officers and who could order all kinds of changes in the \n     442nd organization. Little did they realize that backing up \n     his demands was the authority of General Emmons, Military \n     Governor of Hawaii, Joe Farrington, Hawaii's Delegate to \n     Congress, Secretary McCloy of the War Department, and \n     eventually the White House itself. Early in the War, Hung \n     Wai's influential Quaker friend had introduced him to Eleanor \n     Roosevelt and they quickly became good friends. She gave Hung \n     Wai an open invitation to visit the White House any time. On \n     one of those visits, as Hung Wai was telling Mrs. Roosevelt \n     about the ``Japanese situation in Hawaii,'' she said, ``The \n     President should hear this,'' and took Hung Wai upstairs to \n     talk to President Roosevelt. Hung Wai remembers they talked \n     for 40 minutes but he was so nervous and excited that when \n     the President offered to light his cigarette, he put it in \n     his coat pocket as a souvenir and burnt a hole in his new \n     suit. But he remembers the one thing he told the President \n     was that General Emmons and FBI Chief Shivers were doing a \n     great job, had the situation well in hand, and that there \n     was no necessity for a mass evacuation of Japanese from \n     Hawaii. As we all know, Hawaii never suffered the same \n     tragedy of mass internment of Japanese as happened in the \n     West Coast of America.\n       After returning from Camp Shelby, Hung Wai went on speaking \n     tours to countless business groups and civic organizations \n     praising the military record and achievements of the 100th \n     and 442nd. His constant message and plea was: When the boys \n     come home from the wars, accept and treat them as full \n     American citizens, open up greater job opportunities for \n     them, and help them finish their education and vocational \n     training. And after the war, Hung Wai led the way in helping \n     the returning veterans rehabilitate back to civilian life, to \n     go back to their old jobs or get placed into banks and Big \n     Five jobs previously inaccessible to persons of Japanese \n     ancestry. He headed the Veteran's Memorial Scholarship Fund \n     and obtained scholarship aid to help needy veteran finish \n     their schooling and vocational training.\n       One of Hung Wai's favorite scholarship stories is about a \n     veteran who needed help to go to journalism school, and Hung \n     Wai tapped one of the Big Five businessmen for funds to \n     finance this veteran's schooling. Hung Wai says that donor \n     went to his grave never knowing or realizing that he had \n     helped finance the education of Koji Ariyoshi who was to \n     become publisher and editor of the Honolulu Record, the chief \n     critic and anti-Big Five newspaper in Honolulu. Hung Wai told \n     me of another of his VVV and 442nd boys who was attending \n     Chicago Law School who called and asked Hung Wai if he could \n     get a loan of $300 to finish law school, so Hung Wai sent him \n     the $300. Hung Wai says, ``You know, after that guy came back \n     to Hawaii he not only paid back the $300 but he contributed \n     every year many many times over the $300 so that others could \n     get the same breaks.'' That veteran became the leading labor \n     lawyer in Hawaii and ended up as a Justice of the Hawaii \n     Supreme Court. His name was Edward Nakamura.\n       But one of the most notable persons he helped was not a \n     veteran, but no less than the former FBI Chief Robert Shivers \n     himself. One day Hung Wai got a call from Shivers who said he \n     wanted to retire in Hawaii and asked Hung Wai to help him get \n     the U.S. Collector of Customs job for Hawaii. The local \n     Japanese community raised funds to send Hung Wai to \n     Washington, D.C., to see Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, where he \n     told her how much Shivers had done for the people of Hawaii \n     during the War and was well deserving of the job. Mrs. \n     Roosevelt said, ``All right, I'll go talk to Henry.'' Hung \n     Wai asked, ``Who's Henry?'' ``Henry'' was none other than \n     Henry Morganthau, Secretary of the Treasury and head of the \n     U.S. Customs. A few days later, Mrs. Roosevelt called Hung \n     Wai back and said, ``Tell Mr. Shivers everything is all \n     arranged.'' Then Hung Wai tell me, ``You know, I really \n     wanted that Customs job myself.'' He comes up close and \n     gives me a jab with his bony elbow and says, ``Hey, as \n     Collector of Customs, I could control the opium trade to \n     Hawaii and become a millionaire.'' As we all know, Hung \n     Wai ended his life far from being a millionaire. In fact, \n     it has to be said that Hung Wai never used his wartime \n     position of power nor his high placed contacts to gain \n     benefit or profit for himself. It was always used for the \n     good and benefit of others.\n       Hung Wai Ching's place in Hawaii's wartime history is \n     secure. At the Centennial celebration of Japanese immigration \n     to Hawaii held in 1986, Hung Wai Ching was nominated as one \n     of the 24 non-Japanese and the only one of Chinese ancestry \n     who had made significant contributions and support to welfare \n     and progress of Hawaii's Japanese during their 100 year \n     history. Hung Wai has been recognized as a national \n     historical figure. Hung Wai called me one day not too long \n     ago and said, ``Say, my grandson, Christopher, called me from \n     Los Angeles all excited and telling me, `Grandpa, Grandpa, I \n     saw your picture in a museum.''' So Hung Wai asked me what \n     kind of museum would be showing his picture, and I tell him, \n     it's the National Japanese American Museum in Los Angeles and \n     they have a photo and a story about you in the history of the \n     Japanese American experience during World War II. Go see it \n     when you go to LA. Next time I saw Hung Wai after a trip to \n     Los Angeles, he reported that he did go to the Museum but \n     they wanted him to pay admission to get in. He told them, \n     ``You got my picture in there. I just want to go in to see my \n     picture.'' The lady says, ``Five dollars please.'' So Hung \n     Wai turned around and walked away. So I got after Hung Wai \n     telling him, ``Hung Wai, you tight Pake, you. You don't want \n     to shell out $5.00 to go in and see how much all the Japanese \n     in the United States remember you, honor you, and want to \n     thank you for all you did for them!''\n       And Hung Wai's place in history was revealed directly to \n     his son, King Lit, one day in New York when he was introduced \n     to a mainland-born 442nd Veteran who asked him ``If your name \n     is Ching, do you know Hung Wai Ching?'' King Lit told this \n     story to his father and said, ``When I told him Hung Wai \n     Ching was my father, he really flipped. And as he told me all \n     about you, he cried, Pop, the man cried! It was kind of \n     embarrassing but then I was so proud.'' All of us 442nd \n     veterans know exactly how that veteran felt. He shed tears of \n     gratitude. He cried for all of us.\n       It is time to say ``Goodbye'' to Hung Wai.\n       So on behalf of all of ``his boys,'' I will simply say:\n     ``So long, Hung Wai.''\n     ``You did one helluva job for us.''\n     ``Thanks for everything.''\n     ``Aloha.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3840-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3840-S3841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING JIM McCORD\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Jim McCord \nof Fort Thomas, KY. Yesterday in San Diego, Mr. McCord officially began \nhis 3,000-mile, 6-month journey in an effort to educate the American \npeople about the ill effects of diabetes. On this cross-country jog, \nMr. McCord will run 20 miles a day for the first 2 months, then 25 \nmiles, then 30, resting every third day until he reaches Washington, DC \non October 30.\n  Since the time she was just 9 years old, Maggie McCord, Jim McCord's \ndaughter, has suffered from Type I diabetes. For 11 years now, Maggie \nhas\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\ngiven herself three to five shots a day. Having diabetes also puts \nMaggie at a much higher risk for heart attacks, strokes, vision loss \nand limb amputation. Furthermore, she has a 67 percent chance of dying \nbefore the age of 55. In sharing in these day-to-day battles with his \ndaughter, Jim McCord has learned countless facts about diabetes and has \ncome to realize just how little the American public knows about this \ndeadly disease. Sixteen million Americans are currently suffering from \ndiabetes. Every year, diabetes kills about 68,400 individuals. This \nfigure is slightly higher than the victims of breast cancer and AIDS \ncombined. These and many other numbers are the reason why Jim McCord \nsold his house in Fort Thomas, bought a camper, put his real-estate \ncareer on hold and recruited friends to accompany him on his quest. \nThis journey will not be about raising money for diabetes but raising \npublic awareness. Mr. McCord's mission is to help this Nation \nunderstand diabetes and the effects it has on millions of Americans. If \nhe can first educate the public, he can then empower them with a sense \nof belonging and unite them in his mission.\n  I applaud Mr. McCord for his devotion to family and his devotion to \nthe health of this great Nation. Diabetes is a truly terrible disease \nthat affects households from Kentucky to California. Sometimes, to \nobtain our goals, we must make sacrifices. Jim McCord has sacrificed \nhis home and career, but in the end, he will have made a difference \nfrom coast-to-coast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3841-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE REV.

Dr. McKinney, a native of Passaic, NJ, has lead a remarkable and \nmemorable life with many accomplishments such as serving as the \nyoungest Moderator in the history of the North Jersey District \nMissionary Baptist Association. Additionally, he served from 1996 to \n2000 in an unprecedented tenure as one of the youngest Presidents in \nthe history of the 300,000 member General Baptist Convention of New \nJersey.\n  In addition to his role as Pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church, Rev. \nDr. McKinney has served his community in numerous capacities ranging \nfrom Commissioner of the Housing Authority of the City of Passaic, NJ \nto Executive Board member of the Garfield/Lodi, NJ Branch of the NAACP.\n  Under the leadership of Rev. Dr. McKinney, the Calvary Baptist Church \nhas enjoyed tremendous growth and development in its membership and its \nministry to the community. It is my firm belief that Rev. Dr. McKinney \nwill continue this fine tradition of community service in the years to \ncome, and will serve with distinction as both Pastor to his community \nand father to his three children.\n  I am proud to recognize the many accomplishments and contributions of \nRev. Dr. Calvin McKinney and I am confident that the Calvary Baptist \nChurch will continue to flourish under his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3841-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BRIG.

Barlow, 7th Infantry Division, \nLight, and Fort Carson Assistant Division Commander/Deputy Commanding \nGeneral, Central, Fifth United States Army, who died Wednesday while on \ntemporary duty at Offut Air Force Base, Nebraska.\n  General Barlow, a 1972 West Point graduate, had been stationed at \nFort Carson since August 2000. As Maj. Gen.

He was 51 years old. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with his wife, Sandra, his son First \nLieutenant Christopher Barlow, and daughter, Kelly Barlow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3841-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MARYLAND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COUNCIL 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and \ncongratulate the Maryland Developmental Disabilities Council as it \ncelebrates its 30th anniversary. An organization composed of \nindividuals with developmental disabilities and their families, \nrepresentatives of principle State agencies, and representatives of \nprivate non-profit organizations, the Maryland Developmental \nDisabilities Council has been at the cutting edge of national \ndisability policy.\n  The Council's many achievements stem from an unwavering commitment to \nthe inclusion of all people with developmental disabilities in \ncommunity life. The Council has worked diligently to promote self \ndetermination so that people with disabilities and their families are \nable to make decisions that impact their lives and are fully involved \nin the implementation of services and the support they receive in the \ncommunity. I am pleased that this decade has seen the expansion of \nfamily support, which enables families to stay together and assists in \nmeeting their unique needs. The strong leadership of the Council has \nbrought about more opportunities and greater empowerment for people \nwith disabilities and their families in Maryland.\n  Many Council initiatives and partnerships for the developmentally \ndisabled have proven successful, including efforts to expand \navailability and accessibility of public transportation and \nhomeownership, advocacy for children with developmental disabilities to \nbe educated in the least restrictive environment in their neighborhood \nschools, access to assistive technology, and the creation of \npartnerships between special education personnel, service providers, \nstudents, families, and schools. Supported employment programs assure \nthat people with disabilities have real work of their choice and \nreceive the support they need to succeed. Since it's beginning, the \nCouncil has worked with many other Maryland organizations and \ngovernment agencies to implement successful and innovative initiatives \neffecting systemic change and improved public policies.\n  As the Council celebrates its 30th anniversary, I want to again \nrecognize its dedicated members for their tireless commitment. The \nMaryland Developmental Disabilities Council plays a central role in \nmany critical initiatives and will continue to be at the forefront of \nefforts to encourage community inclusion and support of all \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3841-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3841-S3842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WE THE PEOPLE . . .\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, on may 4-6, 2002 more than 1,200 \nstudents from across the United States will visit Washington, DC to \ncompete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizens \nand the Constitution program, the most extensive education program in \nthe country developed specifically to educate young people about the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. I am proud that a class of 25 \nstudents from John Ehret High School in Marrero will represent the \nState of Louisiana in this national competition after having won first \nplace at the state level. These young scholars from Marrero have worked \ndiligently to reach the national finals, where they will demonstrate a \ndeep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and \nvalues of our constitutional democracy. I applaud their teacher, Mr. \nGeorge W. Allen, Jr., for his leadership and dedication to the program \nand his students.\n  The 3-day long event, modeled after hearing in the U.S. Congress, \nconsists of oral presentations by high school students on \nconstitutional topics followed by a period of questioning by a panel of \nadult judges who probe their depth of understanding and ability to \napply their constitutional knowledge.\n  I wish these constitutional experts the best of luck at the We the \nPeople . . . national finals. It is inspiring to see students at the \nhigh school level successfully master the fundamental ideals and \nprinciples of our government. As competitors on a national level, these \nyoung scholars have proven their ability to achieve lofty goals, \nincluding any they may face in the future. Congratulations and best \nwishes\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\nto the following John Ehret High School students who represent the \nfuture leaders of Louisiana and our nation: Crystal Baum, Jeremy \nBeasley, Keshawn Chopin, Hong Dao, Cara Davis, Heather Deese, Sherryl \nEscondo, Anita George, True Ho, Courtney Joseph, Maher Judeh, Bridgette \nLai, Scott Le, Marquis O'sirio, Matthew Potter, Jason Pryor, Clark \nRegas, Ray Rivarde, Katie Roberts, Ronald Singleton, Danielle Smith, \nTorea Torry, Lisa Tran, Stacy Wing, and Byron Young.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3842-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3842-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3842-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ninsists upon its amendment to the bill (S. 1372) to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank of the United States, and asks a conference with the \nSenate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon; and appoints \nthe following Members as the managers of the conference on the part of \nthe House:\n  From the Committee on Financial Services, for consideration of the \nSenate bill and the House amendment, and modifications committed to \nconference: Mr. Oxley, Mr. Bereuter, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Gary G.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nimprove the administration and enforcement of the immigration laws, to \nenhance the security of the United States, and to establish the Office \nof Children's Services within the Department of Justice, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I'm honored to join Senator Brownback and \nmy other colleagues in introducing the Immigration Reform, \nAccountability, and Security Enhancement Act of 2002, which will \nstrengthen our national security by bringing our immigration system \ninto the 21st century. Recently, the Senate took an important step by \nunanimously passing legislation which strengthens the security of our \nborders, improves our ability to screen foreign nationals, and improves \ncoordination among the several responsible entities. Restructuring the \nINS is the next critical step in establishing an agency that can act \neffectively and fairly to secure our borders and provide better \nservices to immigrants.\n  There is strong bipartisan agreement that the INS must be reformed. \nBut restructuring must be done correctly. The INS handles the \nenforcement of our immigration laws and the adjudication of benefits \nand services. INS's dual missions have long suffered under the current \nstructure.\n  On the enforcement side, September 11 clearly demonstrated that our \nimmigration laws are being applied inconsistently. Some of the \nterrorists were residing here legally, others had overstayed their \nvisas, and the status of others is still unknown. Improving the \nstructure of the INS will help ensure\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\ngreater accountability and the consistent and effective enforcement of \nour immigration laws.\n  The INS service functions have also suffered. Courteous behavior has \ntoo often been the exception, rather than the rule. Application fees \nsteadily increase, yet poor service and long delays have persisted. \nMassive backlogs have forced individuals to languish for years waiting \nfor their naturalization and permanent resident applications to be \nprocessed. Files have been lost. Fingerprints have expired.\n  To address the distinct and at times conflicting responsibilities, \nsuccessful reform must separate the enforcement functions from the \nservice and adjudication functions. The result will be increased \naccountability and efficiency, as well as clarity of purpose.\n  But, meaningful reform must also include a strong central authority \nto coordinate these dual functions. Our legislation requires that one \nhigh-level person take charge of the Nation's immigration laws to \nensure uniform policy determinations and implementation, \naccountability, coordination, and fiscal responsibility. The new \nagency's director, like the FBI director, will have direct access to \nhigh-level officials in the executive branch.\n  I congratulate the House of Representatives for acting quickly and \ndecisively on restructuring legislation. The House bill abolishes the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service and establishes separate bureaus \nfor services and enforcement which would operate as parallel structures \nwith limited coordination. An Associate Attorney General would oversee \nthe two bureaus. The goals of the House bill are very similar to our \nbill, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and \nthe administration to pass effective legislation and put these reforms \ninto law.\n  The overarching difference between our two bills is the power and \nauthority vested in the agency head and the coordination between the \ntwo bureaus. Our bill expands and improves the coordination between the \nbureaus through strong central leadership.\n  The Immigration Reform, Accountability, and Security Enhancement Act \nestablishes a Director of Immigration Affairs, a Deputy Director \nheading the Bureau of Services and Adjudications, and a Deputy Director \nheading the Bureau of Enforcement and Border Affairs. The Director will \nserve as the principal advisor to the Attorney General in developing \nand implementing U.S. immigration law and policy. The Director will be \nthe strong central authority over the two bureaus, and will be able to \nintegrate information systems, policies, and administrative \ninfrastructure.\n  The coordination and harmonization of policy, services and \nenforcement will also be enhanced by the establishment of several \noffices which will assist the two bureaus. The General Counsel, \nappointed by the Attorney General in consultation with the Agency \nDirector, will serve as the chief legal officer for the Agency, \nproviding specialized advice on all legal matters involving U.S. \nimmigration laws. A Chief Financial Officer will direct, supervise, and \ncoordinate all budgetary duties for the Agency. A Chief of Policy and \nStrategy will promote a national immigration policy, identify \npriorities and coordinate policy within the Agency. A Chief of \nCongressional, Intergovernmental, and Public Affairs will be the \ncentral liaison with Congress and other Federal agencies, and the \nmedia.\n  This bill will enhance the accountability of the new Agency and will \nrenew our national commitment to civil rights in the immigration \nprocess. This bill establishes an autonomous Office of the Ombudsman to \nbe located within the Department of Justice. The Ombudsman will be \nappointed by and report directly to the Attorney General. The Ombudsman \nwill identify and report on serious or systematic problems encountered \nby the public and will assist individuals in resolving problems with \nthe Agency. The Ombudsman also will report annually to Congress on the \nsteps taken to correct the problems and propose changes in the \npractices of the Agency to correct such problems.\n  The vital role of statistical information in the modern age is \nrecognized. This bill establishes a Director of Immigration Statistics, \nappointed by the Attorney General, who will report directly to the \nBureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice. Using 21st \ncentury technology, the newly established Office of Immigration \nStatistics will not only record and analyze statistical information, \nbut will also establish standards of reliability and validation and \nwill coordinate with the Service Bureau, the Enforcement Bureau, and \nthe Executive Office for Immigration Review.\n  This legislation also recognizes the need for alternatives to the \ndetention of asylum seekers. The U.S. asylum program is a bipartisan \nsuccess story, it provides new hope and new life for the persecuted and \noppressed and it advances our foreign policy objectives by protecting \nhuman rights and promoting the American dream of opportunity. The \nUnited States is a leader in providing asylum to refugees worldwide. \nStill, we constantly need to strive to improve this very important \nprogram. This bill would require the consideration of specific \nalternatives to detention, including parole with appearance assistance \nprovided by private nonprofit voluntary agencies.\n  Finally, we are including much needed reform to address the treatment \nof unaccompanied minors in INS custody. I commend Senator Feinstein's \nlong-standing commitment to this important issue and am honored to \ninclude her legislation, the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act, \nas part of our proposal to restructure the INS. These provisions will \naddress many of the problems facing unaccompanied minors and will help \nbring U.S. treatment of unaccompanied alien children into line with \ninternational standards. The bill establishes a new Office of \nChildren's Services within the Department of Justice to ensure that \nFederal authorities recognize the special needs and circumstances of \nunaccompanied alien children when making decisions regarding their \ncustody and repatriation and ensures that unaccompanied alien children \nhave access to appoint counsel and guardians ad litem.\n  This bill is needed to ensure that our nation is prepared to meet the \nchallenges that are before us. The Immigration Reform, Accountability, \nand Security Enhancement Act will help remedy many of the problems that \ncurrently plague the Immigration and Naturalization Service and will \nensure that INS's responsibilities are effectively addressed and \ncoordinated, executed with efficiency and courtesy, and uphold our \ngreat tradition of immigration and refugee protection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2444\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Alternatives to detention of asylum seekers.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the attacks of September 11 exposed the \nweaknesses in how we protect our borders. Terrorists exploited the \nshortcomings in our immigration system and the lack of communication \nbetween the respective agencies that might have detected and deterred \nthe events of that horrible day.\n  At the same time, however, September 11 has also brought out the best \nof this great Nation. As a people and as a government, we have united \nand stood firm in support of our freedom and our principles.\n  Significantly, September 11 has reaffirmed our Nation's pride in its \nimmigrant roots. We have not lapsed into xenophobia, nor have we let \nterrorism cloud our judgment about the value of our immigrant neighbors \nor our visitors. We can take great pride in the fact that the Border \nSecurity bill which this body passed just two weeks ago, was \nintelligent and balanced. We were true both to our responsibility to \nprotect our great Nation from those that mean us harm and our \nresponsibility to keep our country open to those who mean us well.\n  We need an agency that is likewise true to both these missions, an \nagency that can effectively enforce the immigration laws and provide \ntimely and competent immigration services. Sadly, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service has failed to perform either mission well, and \nrestructuring INS has long been on the legislative agenda. While I \ndeeply respect the hard work that Commissioner Ziglar has put into \nreforming that agency, the fact is that the INS requires more fixes \nthan can be done administratively. The fundamental problems with the \nINS compel legislative intervention.\n  That is why I am honored to join Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, and \nmy other colleagues in introducing the Immigration Reform, \nAccountability, and Security Enhancement Act of 2002. I would like to \npoint out that, as with the border security bill, we have a bipartisan, \nbalanced, and intelligent bill that will deal effectively with the \nchallenges that face our Nation. I am proud to be a part of it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 2445. A bill to establish a program to promote child literacy by \nmaking books available through early learning, child care, literacy, \nand nutrition programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last year we reauthorized the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, one of the most far reaching education \nreform bills in decades. It was a significant bipartisan achievement, \nbut it isn't enough. We must do more to focus on\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\nthe years leading up to school. Today, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and \nI are reintroducing the Book Stamp Act and looking forward to working \nin a bipartisan manner to improve early learning opportunities for our \nyoungest children.\n  In her statement before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, First Lady Laura Bush called attention to the \nproblems she saw as a teacher. She described children who were having \ndifficulties learning to read because they had not developed the basic \nbuilding blocks of language during their preschool years, the building \nblocks forged through reading, language play, and bedtime stories. In \nher words, ``a failure to learn to read not only leads to failure in \nschool, but portends failure throughout life.''\n  It should come as no surprise that the foundation for learning and \nliteracy is laid long before children arrive at our public schools. We \ncan't ignore the facts. Each year, millions of children enter \nkindergarten unprepared for school. Before the first lessons are \ntaught, they are already behind. Low-income children are particularly \nat risk of school failure. Children in low-income households are less \nlikely than their peers to enter school with the language skills they \nneed.\n  According to the Carnegie Foundation report, ``Ready to Learn: a \nMandate for the Nation,'' 35 percent of children enter kindergarten \nunprepared to learn and most lack the language skills that are the \nprerequisites of literacy acquisition. The research also shows that \nchildren who are placed in remedial reading groups early in school, \noften continue to perform below age expectation. Reading failure in \nschool constitutes a major disability that contributes to school \ndropout, juvenile delinquency, teen pregnancy, and other societal \nproblems.\n\n  In other words, the early childhood years are crucial ones for the \ndevelopment of literacy.\n  There is widespread consensus that reading aloud by parents is the \nsingle most important activity for building the knowledge required for \neventual success in reading. There is a long history of research \nlinking reading aloud by parents with verbal language and literacy \nskills with our children.\n  Regardless of culture or wealth, one of the most important factors in \nthe development of literacy is access to books. Students from homes \nwith an abundance of books and other language activities are \nsubstantially better readers than those with few or no reading \nmaterials.\n  Children living in poverty bear a disproportionate burden of early \nlanguage delay as well as later reading disability. Children from \nfamilies with lower incomes, as a group, receive comparatively little \nstimulation at home. As a group, children from low-income families grow \nup with fewer books in the home, and are exposed to relatively little \nreading aloud.\n  The Book Stamp Act will help remedy this. By providing books to the \nChild Care Resource and Referral Agencies, pediatricians, WIC clinics, \nand child care providers in each community, we can get developmentally \nappropriate books into the hands of low-income families. There are over \n825 Resource and Referral Agencies that will provide free books to \nchildren enrolled in child care programs that serve low income \nfamilies. Each child will receive at least one book every 6 months to \ntake home.\n  However, we can't stop there. It is not enough to just give books to \nthe children. Since young children cannot read to themselves, we must \nmake sure that the adults in their lives understand the importance of \nreading to children as young as six months. Training the parents and \nthe child's caregiver about the importance of reading is just as \ncritical as getting books into homes. Funds set aside by the Book Stamp \nAct will also be used to provide such training for parents and \ncaregivers.\n  Funds will be raised through the sale of a postage stamp similar to \nthe Breast Cancer Stamp. Postal patrons may choose to support this \nprogram by purchasing premium stamps which feature as early learning \ncharacter.\n  We know what works to combat illiteracy. Through the simple act of \ngetting books into the homes of families who might not otherwise be \nable to afford them and by providing simple training for parents and \ncaregivers about the best ways to read to children, we can make an \nenormous difference in a short amount of time. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2445\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure that death penalty defendants have a true \nopportunity to have their cases considered by the courts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation which is designed to have societal rights check law \nenforcement and to protect defendants' rights to fundamental fairness.\n  We are seeing an evolution of a number of problems in the criminal \ncourts, especially applicable to capital cases involving the death \npenalty where I believe we are in danger of losing the death penalty in \nthe United States if\n\n[[Page S3860]]\n\nwe do not act to see to it that there is fairness.\n  For example, there is one case specifically where the Supreme Court \nof the United States had four votes to grant certiorari where the \ndefendant was under the death penalty, and that individual was executed \nwithout the Supreme Court hearing the case because there was not a \nfifth vote to stay the execution.\n  In the past several years, there has been growing evidence that DNA \nmaterials would have exonerated many individuals who have been in jail, \nand among those quite a number of individuals who have been under the \ndeath penalty.\n  And we have also seen very significant problems with the adequacy of \ndefense counsel in capital cases.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will address these issues.\n  During my tenure as district attorney of Philadelphia--from 1966 to \n1974--I became convinced that the death penalty is an effective \ndeterrent. I had come to that conclusion earlier when I was an \nassistant district attorney for 4 years preceding my tenure as \nPhiladelphia's district attorney.\n  I have seen many cases where individuals will decline to carry \nweapons on robberies or burglaries because of fear that a killing might \noccur, and that would be murder in the first degree under the felony \nmurder rule and therefore carry the death penalty.\n  One case is illustrative of many I have seen. There was a case in the \nlate 1950s in Philadelphia with three defendants, Cater, Rivers, and \nWilliams. Those young men were 17, 18, and 19 years old, respectively. \nThey had IQs of less than 100. They set out to rob a merchant in North \nPhiladelphia, and Williams had a gun. Cater and Rivers said: We are not \ngoing to go along on this robbery if you take the gun. They took that \nposition because they were apprehensive that a killing might result and \nthey could face the death penalty under the felony murder rule. That is \na rule which says anyone committing one of five enumerated felonies, \nincluding robbery, would be subject to murder in the first degree and \nthe death penalty if there was a killing in the course of that robbery.\n  Williams put the gun in the drawer, slammed it shut, and, as the \nthree of them walked out, unbeknownst to Cater and Rivers, Williams \ntook the gun with him. They robbed the store. In the course of the \nmelee, the merchant was killed. The three of them faced murder in the \nfirst degree charges and the death penalty.\n  In the course of the investigation, the confessions disclosed the \nessential facts which I have related, and all three got the death \npenalty. Williams, the gunman, was subsequently executed, in the early \n1960s, one of the last people executed in Pennsylvania before ``Furman \nv. Georgia'' set aside all of the death penalty cases.\n  Cater's and Rivers's cases came up later. I was an assistant DA at \nthe time and argued that case in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.\n  Later, when I was district attorney, Cater and Rivers argued for \ncommutation. Representing the Commonwealth, I agreed that they should \nnot face the death penalty but should face life imprisonment because \nthey had tried to dissuade Williams from carrying the gun. Although in \nthe eyes of the law their culpability was the same as a coconspirator, \nit seemed to me that as a matter of fairness they ought not to have the \ndeath penalty.\n  That case is illustrative of many cases which have convinced me that \nthe death penalty is a deterrent. But if we are to retain the \ndeterrent, we have to be very careful how we use the death penalty.\n  When I was district attorney of Philadelphia, we had some 500 \nhomicides a year. I would not permit any of my 160 assistants to ask \nfor the death penalty without my personal review. We asked for the \ndeath penalty in a very limited number of cases--four, or five, or six \na year--really heinous and outrageous cases where it was the conclusion \nthat only the death penalty would suffice.\n  There has recently been a commission in Illinois which has been very \ncritical of the application of the death penalty.\n  The Governor of Illinois has declared a moratorium on the death \npenalty. And with the growing number of DNA cases which are arising, it \nis my view, that unless some action is taken to see to it that there \nare not executions of people whose innocence might be established \nthrough DNA evidence, that we will soon lose the death penalty.\n  So it is a matter of protecting society's interest to maintain the \ndeath penalty that this legislation is being introduced, and, at the \nsame time, with equal force, it is in order to provide fundamental \nfairness to defendants. Where DNA evidence is available, it ought to be \nexamined. And we know it has the capacity, in many, many cases, to rule \nout the defendant.\n  The science of DNA has progressed to the point where tangible \nevidence may specifically exclude a defendant. We have seen many cases \nwhere incarcerated people, including those awaiting the death penalty, \nhave been released when the DNA evidence has established their \ninnocence.\n  There is legislation pending, but none reaches what I consider to be \nthe fundamental question--I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The pending legislation does not reach the critical \nissue; and that is, to establish a right to DNA evidence as a \nconstitutional right.\n  Congress, under section V of the 14th amendment, has the authority to \nlegislate in furtherance of the due process clause. Congress has been \nvery inert on establishing constitutional rights under our legislative \nauthority under section V. We have seen the wave of Supreme Court \ndecisions in the constitutional area--``Mapp v. Ohio,'' where the \nSupreme Court of the United States said it was a constitutional right \nnot be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures, incorporating \nthe search and seizure provisions of the 4th amendment into the due \nprocess clause of the 14th amendment.\n  The Supreme Court, ``Miranda v. Arizona,'' required warnings for \nthose suspects who are in custodial interrogation. And there have been \nmany cases where it has been up to the Court to establish the \nconstitutional right.\n  In the obvious landmark case, perhaps the most important case in \nAmerican constitutional history, ``Brown v. Board of Education of \nTopeka,'' it was up to the Supreme Court to establish desegregation as \na constitutional right. Action should have been taken long before by \nthe Congress, long before by the executive branch, and long before by \nthe State legislatures; but it was up to the Court to establish that \nconstitutional right.\n  There has been one case in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the \n``Godschalk'' case, where Judge Weiner established a constitutional \nright for the defendant to see DNA evidence. And there is a Fourth \nCircuit opinion which addresses the issue but leaves it up to the \nCongress to act. And that is a matter that is taken up in this \nlegislation.\n  On two other items, the bill will first provide for a true \nopportunity for defendants to have their cases considered by the \ncourts. For example, there was a case where the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States had four justices willing to vote to grant certiorari and \nthe defendant was executed because there was not a fifth justice voting \nfor a stay of execution--and I ask unanimous consent that the case be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Alexzene Hamilton, as Natural Mother and Next Friend To James Edward \n Smith v. Texas, No. 89-7838, Supreme Court of the United States, 498 \n      U.S. 908; 111 S. Ct. 281; 112 L.

I \n     write to express my frustration with the Court's failure to \n     avail itself of the ordinary procedural mechanisms that would \n     have permitted us to resolve that issue in this case.\n       It is already a matter of public record that four Members \n     of this Court voted to grant certiorari before petitioner was \n     executed. [*909] See Hamilton v. Texas, 497 U.S. (1990) \n     (Brennan, J., dissenting from denial of application for \n     stay). According to established practice, this fact should \n     have triggered a fifth vote to grant petitioner's application \n     for a stay of [**282] execution. * Indeed, this result flows \n     naturally from the standard by which we evaluate stay \n     applications, a central component of which is ``whether four \n     Justices are likely to vote to grant certiorari.'' Coleman v. \n     Paccar, 424 U.S. 1301, 1302 (1976) (Rehnquist, J., in \n     chambers) (emphasis added); see also Maggio v. Williams, 464 \n     U.S. 46, 48 (1983) (per curiam) (same).\n       *See Autry v. Estelle, 464 U.S. 1, 2 (1983) (per curiam) \n     (``Had applicant convinced four Members of the Court that \n     certiorari would be granted on any of his claims, a stay \n     would issue''); Darden v. Wainwright, 473 U.S. 928, 928-929 \n     (1985) (Powell, J., concurring in granting of stay); Straight \n     v. Wainwright, 476 U.S. 1132, 1333, n. 2 (1986) (Powell J., \n     concurring in denial of stay, joined by Burger, C. J., \n     Rehnquist, and O'Connor, JJ.) (noting that ``the Court has \n     ordinarily stayed executions when four Members have voted to \n     grant certiorari''); id., at 1134-1135 (Brennan, J., \n     dissenting from denial of stay, joined by Marshall and \n     Blackmun, JJ.) (``When four vote to grant certiorari in a \n     capital case, but there is not a fifth vote to stay the \n     scheduled execution, one of the five Justices, who does not \n     believe the case worthy of granting certiorari will \n     nonetheless vote to stay; this is so that the `Rule of Four' \n     will not be rendered meaningless by an execution that occurs \n     before the Court considers the case on the merits'').\n       In my view, the Court's willingness in this case to \n     dispense with the procedures that it ordinarily employs to \n     preserve its jurisdiction only continues the distressing \n     rollback of the legal safeguards traditionally afforded. \n     Compare Boyde v. California, 494 U.S., (1990) (Marshall, J., \n     dissenting) (criticizing diminution in standard used to \n     assess unconstitutional jury instructions in capital cases); \n     Barefoot v.

These questions concern the standards that the Due \n     Process Clause of [*910] the Fourteenth Amendment mandates in \n     a hearing to determine whether a death row inmate is \n     competent to waive his constitutional right to challenge his \n     conviction and sentence and whether he has made a knowing and \n     intelligent waiver of this right.\n       James Edward Smith was convicted of murder and sentenced to \n     death in Harris County, Texas, in 1984. Smith had a \n     substantial history of mental illness, and his mental \n     difficulties prompted a finding by the Texas trial court that \n     he was not competent to represent himself on appeal. Pet. for \n     Cert., Exh. 2, p. 13, Exhs. 4-8, 10-12. After his conviction, \n     Smith vacillated between forceful insistence on prosecuting \n     his own appeal and equally forceful insistence on abandoning \n     any challenge to this conviction or his sentence. Pet. for \n     Cert., Exh. 2, pp. 10-11, p. 2.\n       Petitioner is Smith's natural mother. Proceeding as Smith's \n     ``next friend,'' she attempted to establish her standing to \n     litigate on her son's behalf and to have his execution stayed \n     until his competence was established after a full adversarial \n     hearing. She was unsuccessful. On May 23, 1990, without \n     notice to petitioner, the Texas trial court held a \n     nonadversarial hearing, made a finding that Smith was \n     competent to make a decision regarding his execution, and set \n     his execution for 12:01 A. M. on June 26, 1990.

The legislation further addresses the issue of adequacy \nof counsel.\n  I will now describe the specific provisions of the bill I am offering \ntoday, and the cases and history that shows the manifest need for such \nlegislation.\n  The bill contains three titles. The first Title will ensure that \ndefendants facing the death penalty will not be executed while the \nSupreme Court considers their petitions for certiorari or their cases \non the merits. The second Title will ensure that both federal and state \ndefendants have a meaningful opportunity to present DNA evidence in \ntheir defense. Finally, the third Title will establish minimal \nstandards for defense counsel representing defendants in death penalty \ncases in state court. I am additionally introducing these three Titles \nas three separate bills, as I will explain later. The first is ``Title \nI: Right to Review of the Death Penalty While a Case is Pending Before \nthe Supreme Court.''\n  There have been death penalty cases where, despite the fact that the \nSupreme Court was either considering to grant certiorari or had \nactually granted certiorari and the case was pending, the Court did not \nissue a stay of execution in the interim. In the 1990 case of \n``(Alexzene) Hamilton v. Texas,'' 497 U.S. 1016, the Supreme Court \nfailed to issue a stay of execution while considering a cert. petition, \nand the defendant was executed before the Court ruled on the petition. \nJames Smith was convicted in 1984 of committing murder while \nperpetrating a robbery in 1983. He was sentenced to death. Smith \nappealed his conviction to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, citing \nseven points of errors, ranging from insufficiency of evidence to \nsustain a death sentence to challenges to the jury selection process in \nthe trial. ``Smith v. State,'' 744 S.W.2d 86, Tex. Crim. App. 1987. In \n1987, that court affirmed his conviction and sentence. In April, 1988, \nSmith waived any further appellate review of his case. His mother, \nAlexzene Hamilton, then entered the case, and filed a state habeas \ncorpus petition in the Court of Criminal Appeals, claiming that her son \nwas incompetent. The state responded to the mother's petition, and the \nTexas court denied relief. Ms. Hamilton then brought a petition for \ncertiorari in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted a stay of \nexecution pending disposition of the cert. petition. ``Hamilton v. \nTexas,'' 485 U.S. 1042, 1988. The Court entered an order stating that \nthe ``stay of execution of sentence of death . . . is granted pending \nthe disposition by [the] Court of petition for writ of certiorari. \nShould the petition for a writ of certiorari be denied, this stay \nterminates automatically. In the event the petition . . . is granted, \nthis stay shall continue pending the issuance of the mandate of [the] \nCourt.'' Id. On April 3, 1990, the cert. petition was denied. \n``Hamilton v. Texas,'' 496 U.S. 913, 1990. In May, 1990, the state \ntrial court conducted a hearing and found that Smith still wanted to \nwaive his appellate rights and that he was still competent. The trial \ncourt scheduled his execution for June 26, 1990. Ms. Hamilton again \nbrought a writ of habeas corpus in the state courts on June 20, 1990, \nchallenging the court's finding that Smith was competent. On June 22, \n1990, the state courts denied this petition.\n  Ms. Hamilton then filed a habeas petition in federal district court \non June 23, 1990, which the court denied on June 24th. However, Dr. \nBrown, one of the several doctors that had previously\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\nopined that Smith was competent, stated that he now had some doubts of \nSmith's competency due to his review of some medical records he had not \npreviously seen. The federal district court found that this new opinion \ndid not affect its findings, and denied Ms. Hamilton's request for \nreconsideration. On June 25th, the state trial court had Dr. Brown re-\nexamine Smith, and Dr. Brown then returned to his original opinion that \nSmith was competent. On the same day, the trial court then denied Ms. \nHamilton's habeas corpus petition. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals \nalso dismissed Ms. Hamilton's motion for reconsideration on the same \nday. Additionally, on the same day, the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit affirmed the federal district court's dismissal \nof the habeas petition and denied her motion for a stay of execution. \n``Hamilton v. Collins,'' 905 F.2d 825, 5th Cir. 1990. Ms. Hamilton then \nfiled petitions for certiorari, asking the Supreme Court to review both \nthe state and federal court decisions and for a stay of execution. On \nJune 26, 1990, the originally scheduled execution date, four Supreme \nCourt Justices voted to grant certiorari, but for some unknown \nprocedural reason, the Court did not formally act on the petition. The \nCourt also did not vote to grant a stay of execution. Smith was \nsubsequently executed before the Supreme Court decided on his cert. \npetition. The Supreme Court then denied Smith's petitions of \ncertiorari. ``Hamilton v. Collins,'' 498 U.S. 895, 1990; ``Hamilton v. \nTexas,'' 498 U.S. 908, 1990. In denying the petition from the state \ncourt decision, the Court noted that it was dismissing the petition as \n``moot.'' 498 U.S. 908, Stevens, J., concurring in the dismissal of the \npetition.\n\n  In the 1992 case of ``Herrera v. Collins,'' 502 U.S. 1085, the Court \nactually granted certiorari but failed to issue the stay. Herrera had \nbeen convicted of the 1981 murder of two police officers. Herrera then \npursued two lines of appeals through the Texas state system--direct \nappeal and then collateral proceedings. Herrera then pursued two \nsequential federal habeas corpus proceedings. During these proceedings, \ncertiorari had been denied three times, but on the second federal \nhabeas proceeding, certiorari was granted. Herrera's claim was that he \nwas actually innocent in this proceeding. After granting certiorari, \nthe Supreme Court failed to grant a stay of execution. However, in that \ncase, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted a stay while the case \nwas pending before the Supreme Court. Herrera's claim was ultimately \ndenied by the Supreme Court and he was executed.\n  The reason for this sequence is a procedural twist. By Supreme Court \npractice, it takes only four votes to grant certiorari. Although \ncertiorari is recognized by statute as the procedure for getting a case \nbefore the Court, the statute does not state how many votes are needed. \nThe four vote standard is the practice of the Court. However, to grant \na stay, there must be a majority--five votes--and the standard the \nCourt applies is different from that for granting certiorari. There may \nbe good reasons why the standard is different, and in almost all other \ncases, the failure to grant a stay when certiorari has been granted or \nwhile the Court is still considering whether to grant certiorari does \nnot have the dispositive effect that it does in a capital punishment \ncase. However, in a capital case, the failure to grant a stay while the \nCourt considers whether to even hear the case sends the signal that the \nCourt is, in effect, affirming the decision of a lower court before it \neven decides that the lower court's decision is worthy of affirmation. \nIn a case where the Court has actually granted certiorari and failed to \nissue a stay the Court, in effect, tells the world that a case is \nimportant enough to be heard, but not important enough to postpone an \nexecution.\n  Until relatively recently, the Supreme Court had an ``informal'' \npractice where a fifth Justice would vote to grant a stay when four \njustices had voted to grant certiorari. The late Justice Brennan \narticulated the rationale for this rule:\n\n  A minority of the Justices has the power to grant a petition for \ncertiorari over the objection of five Justices. The reason for this \n``antimajoritarianism'' is evident: in the context of a preliminary 5-4 \nvote to deny, 5 give the 4 an opportunity to change at least one mind. \nAccordingly, when four vote to grant certiorari in a capital case, but \nthere is not a fifth vote to stay the scheduled execution, one of the \nfive Justices who does not believe the case worthy of granting \ncertiorari will nonetheless vote to stay; this is so that the ``Rule of \nFour'' will not be rendered meaningless by an execution that occurs \nbefore the Court considers the case on the merits. ``Straight v. \nWainwright,'' 476 U.S. 1132, 1134-35, 1986, Brennan, J., dissenting. \nJustice Brennan's argument requires no further elaboration.\n\n  Justice Brennan's opinion involved a ``hold'' case, where he was \narguing that a stay should have been granted. The ``hold'' is an \ninformal practice whereby at least three Justices of the Supreme Court \ncan ``hold'' the Court from acting on a petition for certiorari so that \nthe Court does not deny the petition. A ``hold'' is placed on a case \nwhen the Court has another case pending before the Court, the \ndisposition of which may have an affect on the first case.\n  In addition to Justice Brennan's argument, there are other reasons \nwhy a stay should be granted. In my experience as District Attorney in \nPhiladelphia, and conducting oversight of the Justice Department while \nserving in the Senate, one theme is constant concerning our system of \ncriminal justice: It rests on a bedrock that all Americans see the \nsystem as being fair to all. When the average American questions the \nfundamental fairness of any aspect of the criminal justice system, then \nit is in trouble. To the average American, when the Supreme Court has \nnot yet decided whether it should consider a case or, has in fact, \ndecided to consider a case by granting certiorari, but then fails to \nact to ensure that it can in actuality hear the case, that raises \nfundamental questions about fairness, regardless of the procedural \nnuances that legally allow for such a result. If we are to maintain \nconfidence in our criminal justice system, then it has to be seen as \nfair to all.\n  When the Supreme Court takes action like this, in my judgment, it \ndenies the defendant his constitutional right of ``due process'' of law \nwhich, in these circumstances, is colloquially referred to as \n``procedural due process.'' When the government takes action against an \nindividual, the essential core of procedural due process is notice and \nan opportunity to be heard. In the instant case, we are not concerned \nwith the notice aspect because the defendant knows why he was \nconvicted. But when the Supreme Court has a case pending before it-that \nis a motion to stay execution or a petition for certiorari has been \nfiled or the Court has issued a writ of certiorari-and then fails to \ngrant a stay so that it can actually consider the petition or hear the \ncase, it denies the defendant due process of law because the defendant \nis deprived of his right to be heard. A motion for a stay of execution \nshould be treated as a petition for certiorari in these circumstances \nbecause, in effect, the motion is a preliminary petition for \ncertiorari.\n  As I noted earlier, the writ of certiorari is codified in Title 28 of \nthe U.S. Code. No defendant has a constitutional right to have his or \nher case heard by the Supreme Court. But once the defendant files a \npetition, then the defendant has a statutory right to have, at the very \nleast, his petition considered by the court and, if the petition is \ngranted, then the right to have his case considered by the Court. This \nis the method that Congress has created for the consideration of these \ncases, which does not allow a right of direct appeal. As Congress has \ncreated this two step procedural mechanism, Congress has the authority \nto ensure that it is effective. The Court does not have to grant a \npetition, but it must, at the very least, not allow a petition to \nbecome moot before it even makes this very basic decision. The same \nlogic applies if the Court grants the petition.\n\n  The Court cannot consider the petition or the case if the defendant \nis executed before the Court acts. When a defendant is executed in \nthese circumstances, he is being denied his right to be heard on his \npetition or his case and is therefore denied his basic right to \n``procedural due process.''\n  The legislation I propose addresses this issue both at the federal \nand state level. With respect to federal cases, my\n\n[[Page S3863]]\n\nproposed bill would prohibit the Bureau of Prisons or the military from \nexecuting a death row inmate when a defendant has filed a petition for \ncertiorari and when the Supreme Court has granted certiorari. Congress \ncreated the federal death penalty, and Congress can establish the \nconditions when it can or cannot be carried out. With respect to state \ncases, my bill would address this issue in two different ways.\n  First, just as with federal cases, my bill would prohibit the \nexecutive officer of a state from executing a defendant when a cert. \npetition is pending or has been granted. Congress's authority to \nlegislate in this arena is derived from Section V of the 14th Amendment \nwhich reads that ``[t]he Congress shall have power to enforce, by \nappropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.'' Section 1 of \nthat Amendment reads in pertinent part that no ``State [shall] deprive \nany person of life . . . without due process of law. . . .'' As noted \nabove, when a person is executed before the Supreme Court has granted \nor denied certiorari or acted on a case once cert. is granted, that \nperson is deprived of his or her life without due process of law. My \nbill would also require the Court to treat a motion for a stay of \nexecution as a petition for certiorari.\n  Furthermore, this bill would also require all federal judges, to \ninclude Supreme Court justices, to issue a stay whenever a habeas \ncorpus case is pending before the judge or judges and the habeas \npetitioner defendant has been sentenced to death. A case is considered \nto be pending if a defendant has filed a notice of appeal, filed a \nmotion for a stay of execution, filed a petition for certiorari, or \nwhen certiorari has been granted. Most death penalty cases, both \nfederal and state cases, have their final hearings through federal \nhabeas corpus review. Congress has broad authority in the area of \nhabeas corpus legislation. Indeed, Congress enacted a similar provision \nas part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. \n28 U.S. Code Section 2262 requires a federal court to issue a stay of \nexecution in those circumstances where a defense counsel has been \nappointed to an indigent defendant and a state is seeking to fall \nwithin the streamlined habeas corpus procedures contained in the Act.\n  Additionally, my bill would require a lower court to issue a stay if \na higher court did not in these circumstances.\n  Finally, my bill would require that if four Justices vote to grant \ncertiorari in a death penalty case, then certiorari will be granted. \nWhen a person petitions the Supreme Court to hear his or her case, that \nperson expects to have the case heard if four Justices believe it \nshould be heard. This is the expectation of all those seeking Supreme \nCourt review, an expectation resulting from the practices of the Court. \nThe Court already has great discretion not to hear almost all cases it \ndoes not wish to consider. Congress has given the Court this discretion \nby eliminating almost all avenues of appeal by right to the Court and \ninstead giving the Court the power to pick the cases it wants to hear \nthrough the certiorari process. Accordingly, Congress should have the \npower to require the Court to review those cases where four Justices \nvote to hear the case. The procedures for obtaining access to our \ncourts should be as transparent as possible, and it simply defies logic \nand makes a mockery of the phrase ``equal justice'' when four votes in \none set of circumstances can result in Supreme Court review of a case, \nbut not in other circumstances.\n  The second title is ``TITLE II: DNA Testing.''\n  My bill also addresses the issue of DNA testing for prisoners who \nclaim that such testing would exonerate them. This bill would establish \nthe procedures for federal prisoners who seek such review. It would \nalso mandate that states adopt similar procedures. My bill would \nestablish federal procedures that set a middle ground between the two \nDNA bills that are currently pending before the Senate.\n  My bill requires that a person seeking DNA testing not take a \nposition inconsistent with any affirmative defense he may have raised \nat trial. An affirmative defense is one such as self-defense, where a \ndefendant is not denying that he committed one or more of the acts \nconstituting the charged offense, but the defendant is denying criminal \nresponsibility. One of the other pending bills does not have any \nsimilar provision, and another bill requires that the defendant's \ncurrent theory of defense not be inconsistent with a prior theory of \ndefense. However, my bill would allow a defendant who pled guilty to \nrequest DNA testing. Unfortunately, there are instances where due to \ninadequate representation or lack of sophistication on a defendant's \npart, or for a variety of other reasons, a defendant will plead guilty \nto a crime that he did not commit. My bill would allow such a defendant \nto seek DNA testing.\n  Another difference is that my bill has a five year limitation on its \napplication, with one exception regarding newly discovered evidence. \nOne of the other pending bills has no time limitation, and the other \nhas a three year time limitation. The thrust of all the pending DNA \nbills is to allow a prisoner to seek potentially exculpatory DNA \ntesting, even though such a request would otherwise be barred on \nprocedural grounds, such as timeliness requirements.\n  My bill would benefit those defendants currently incarcerated who did \nnot have access to DNA testing at the time of their trials. My bill \ndefines lack of access rather broadly. If 1, the technology was \nactually not available, or 2, it was not generally known that such \ntesting was available at the time of trial, or 3, if the technology was \navailable and the testing was not requested and the applicant shows \nthat the failure to have requested testing is attributable to deficient \nperformance on his counsel's part, then the applicant is deemed not to \nhave had access to the testing. The bill would allow a prisoner to seek \ntesting for up to five years after the enactment of the bill, with the \nexceptions I noted above. Five years would give all defendants \ncurrently incarcerated enough time to bring their claims.\n  I do not propose that there be no time limitation, because I do not \nwant to create an exception that could conceivably swallow the time \nlimitations currently existing in federal law.\n  However, that concern may be misplaced. A track record of five years \ncan tell us if this bill is ripe for abuse. If not, then the bill can \nbe reenacted with no time limit. If, however, there is evidence that is \nbeing abused by prisoners, then the law would expire. Based on my \nexperience as a prosecutor, I am concerned that the three year \nlimitation is not long enough to develop a good track record on the use \nof this testing.\n  There would be an exception for this five year limitation. If a \nprisoner can show that there is newly discovered evidence in his case, \nand such evidence could not have been discovered through due diligence, \nor the failure to discover the evidence is attributable to deficient \nperformance on his counsel's part, then he could bring a claim beyond \nthe five year limit. This exception is consistent with the laws \ncurrently in force concerning newly discovered evidence.\n\n  Some may question the need for these DNA testing procedures in \nfederal cases, as the level of practice and standard of representation \nis considered to be of the highest caliber. Even at that level there \ncan be problems. Even though it did not involve DNA testing, we had the \ncase of Timothy McVeigh when only days before his scheduled execution \nthe FBI announced that it had discovered documents it had failed to \nprovide the defense before trial. This highlights that even at the \nfederal level mistakes can be made. This bill would provide one \nsafeguard against such mistakes.\n  My bill would also mandate that states provide similar procedures to \nstate prisoners in all cases. One of the pending bills has such a \nrequirement, but only in capital cases. DNA evidence is such a powerful \ntool that can exonerate the unjustly convicted that I believe Congress \nhas the authority pursuant to Section V of the 14th Amendment to impose \npost-conviction DNA testing requirements on the states.\n  In 1963, the United States Supreme Court decided the seminal case of \n``Brady v. Maryland,'' 373 U.S. 83, where the Court held that \n``suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused . \n. . violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt \nor punishment . . . .'' The Court also noted that ``[s]ociety wins not \nonly when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\nfair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when any \naccused is treated unfairly.'' Congress has the authority to enact \nlegislation to enforce the protections of the ``due process'' clause \nthrough Section V of the 14th Amendment.\n  DNA evidence is the most powerful evidence that can be ``favorable to \nan accused,'' because it can prove that the accused did not commit the \ncrime. But when DNA evidence remains in the hands of the state \nuntested, we do not know if it is favorable or unfavorable to the \naccused. It really is not ``evidence'' until it is tested, because its \nrelevancy to guilt or innocence cannot be determined without testing. \nWhen a state does not provide a defendant with the opportunity to \ndetermine whether evidence may exculpate him, the state is, in effect, \n``suppressing . . . favorable evidence'' by not allowing a defendant to \ndetermine whether it is favorable or not.\n  DNA evidence has proven to be extremely valuable to the criminal \njustice system. It has aided prosecutions and freed unjustly convicted \npersons. Since 1973, over 100 people have been freed from Death Row, at \nleast 10 due to DNA testing. Additionally, over a total of 100 people \nhave been freed after having been exonerated in both capital cases and \nnon-capital cases due to DNA testing. The FBI has found that since \n1989, DNA testing has cleared about 25% of sexual assault suspects \nwhose samples are sent to the FBI for testing. Indeed, DNA evidence can \nbe a stronger indicator of innocence than guilt. If the defendant's DNA \ndoes not match the DNA evidence, that is conclusive evidence. However, \nwhen a match results, in actuality, it is only a probability, albeit a \nvery high probability, that the defendant was the source of the DNA.\n  In questioning whether the death penalty was being fairly \nadministered in the United States, Supreme Court Justice Sandra \nO'Connor noted the number of Death Row inmates freed due to being \nexonerated, to include by DNA testing. Indeed, she commented that \n``[i]f statistics are any indication, the system may well be allowing \nsome innocent defendants to be executed.'' This concern was made \nmanifest when the Governor of Illinois ordered a moratorium on the \ndeath penalty after 13 Death Row inmates were exonerated. Justice \nO'Connor also noted that the availability of DNA testing in the various \nstates varied widely, with some states affording this post-conviction \nDNA testing and others not providing any at all. Even in those states \nthat offer such testing, there is a wide variation in procedures. My \nbill would require the states to adopt procedures similar to the \nfederal standards and thereby promote consistency among the states.\n\n  Indeed, the recent groundswell of opinion questioning the death \npenalty has been based on doubts about its accuracy. Providing Death \nRow defendants with the opportunity for DNA testing would do much to \nallay those concerns.\n  But the death penalty is not the only reason for enacting this bill. \nMany federal and state prisoners are currently incarcerated for long \nsentences due to mandatory minimums and Sentencing Guidelines. Indeed, \nthe prisoner most recently freed due to DNA testing had served 21 years \nof an 80 year sentence for rape. Additionally, DNA evidence is relevant \nin many types of cases, beyond the classic sex assault cases and \nviolent crimes where there is blood evidence. For example, in a bank \nrobbery case, the FBI was able to connect a suspected robber to the \ncase by recovering some hairs from a woolen cap the robber used as a \nmask. Obviously, such evidence could also be used to exonerate a \ndefendant.\n  However, in order for this DNA testing to be of any use, there must \nbe evidence to test. That is why this bill requires the preservation of \nbiological evidence for the five year period after the enactment of \nthis bill or, if someone requests testing pursuant to this bill, while \nthose proceedings are underway.\n  This bill does more than provide justice to wrongfully convicted \ndefendants. It also protects the public. When a person is wrongfully \nconvicted of murder or rape, that allows the real perpetrator to remain \nat large. And based on my experience as District Attorney, sexual \npredators, especially those who prey on children, have the highest \nlevels of recidivism.\n  As noted above, the authority for enacting this provision is Section \nV of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. When a state fails to \nprovide DNA testing that might bear on the guilt or innocence of a \ndefendant, then the state is depriving the defendant of his life or \nliberty without due process of law. The state's interest in the \nfinality of a conviction is strong. However, when balancing that \ninterest against a prisoner's interest in not being wrongfully \nexecuted, justice cries out for access to DNA testing.\n  The need for Congress to address this issue was highlighted by two \nrecent federal court decisions that addressed giving state prisoners \naccess to DNA testing. In the 2001 case of ``Godschalk v. Montgomery \nCounty District Attorney's Office,'' 177 F.Supp.2d 366, Judge Charles \nR. Weiner of the United States District Court for the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania ruled that a prisoner who sought DNA testing had a \nright to such testing pursuant to the Due Process clause of the 14th \nAmendment because such evidence could be exculpatory evidence as \ndefined by ``Brady v. Maryland'' and its progeny. In 1987, Godschalk \nhad been convicted of two rapes committed in 1986. At the time of \ntrial, DNA testing was not available. At the trial, the prosecution \nintroduced an audiotaped confession by Godschalk that contained details \nof the crimes not known to the public. Godschalk's state appeals of his \nconvictions were denied, as well as his petitions for DNA testing. \nGodschalk then brought an action pursuant to 42 U.S. Code Section 1983 \nseeking DNA testing. The evidence from only one of the rapes was still \nin a condition so that it could be tested, but there was no dispute \nthat the same person committed both rapes. The court ordered the DNA \ntesting, noting that ``[w]hile [Godschalk's] detailed confessions to \nthe rapes are powerful inculpatory evidence, so to any DNA testing that \nwould exclude [Godschalk] as the source of the genetic material taken \nfrom the victims would be powerful exculpatory evidence. . . . Given \nthe well-known powerful exculpatory effect of DNA testing, confidence \nin the jury's finding of [Godschalk's] guilt at his past trial, where \nsuch evidence was not considered, would be undermined.'' 177 F.Supp.2d \nat 370. The evidence was tested, and it did not match Godschalks's DNA, \nand he was subsequently freed.\n\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reached a \ndifferent result in the 2002 case of ``Harvey v. Horan,'' 278 F.3d at \n370. In that case, Harvey had been convicted of rape and forcible \nsodomy. Harvey brought a Section 1983 action to have the evidence in \nthat case tested with a new DNA technology that had not been available \nat the time of his trial. The district court granted his request, but \non appeal the Fourth Circuit found his request to be procedurally \nbarred. The court found that Section 1983 was not the proper path for \nsuch a request and that Harvey's request was, in effect, a petition for \nhabeas corpus, which was statutorily barred as a successive petition. \nThe court specifically noted that Harvey's path of redress was either \nthrough the state courts and legislature or Congress, stating that \n``[f]ederal and state legislatures and state courts are free in ways \nthat [the federal court is] not to set the ground rules by which \nfurther collateral attacks on state convictions such as Harvey's may be \nentertained.'' 278 F.3d at 380. The purpose of my bill is to establish \nthose ``ground rules.''\n  The third title is ``Title III: Counsel Standards.''\n  Finally, my bill would establish minimal standards for defense \ncounsel in state court cases where the defendant is facing the death \npenalty. In 1991, when my distinguished colleague and friend Senator \nBiden chaired the Judiciary Committee, he asked Professor James Liebman \nof Columbia Law School to calculate the frequency of relief in capital \nhabeas corpus cases. This ultimately led Professor Liebman to conduct a \nstudy of the error rates in capital cases. His study found that one of \nthe two most common errors prompting a majority of reversals at the \nstate post-conviction stage was ``egregiously incompetent defense \nlawyers who didn't even look for and demonstrably missed important \nevidence\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\nthat the defendant was innocent or did not deserve to die . . . .'' In \na more recent study released this year, Professor Liebman again cited \nthe poor quality of defense counsel as a contributing factor to \nerroneous results in capital cases. And we all have heard the stories \nof defense counsel sleeping during the course of a capital trial.\n  My bill would establish minimal standards for defense counsel in \ncapital cases who represent indigent defendants. The standards I \npropose are the same that are required in federal courts and establish \nan absolute floor for competence of counsel, both at the trial level \nand the appellate level. Unlike the other two pending bills, my bill \nwould establish and mandate actual standards. If these standards are \ngood enough for the federal courts, they should be good enough for \nstate courts. They are specific enough to ensure that a defendant \nreceives competent representation but also general enough so that they \ncould be applied throughout the United States. Among other \nrequirements, the bill would require that any counsel have several \nyears of felony experience, and that a defendant would have a right to \ntwo defense counsel at trial.\n\n  One of the requirements is that defense counsel be ``learned in the \nlaw applicable to capital cases.'' Concededly, this is a rather general \nrequirement which we can develop and explore at hearings on this bill \nand bring more definition to through legislative history or amending \nthe bill. However, such generic language would allow flexibility \nbetween the different states, where the number of capital cases vary \nwidely. For example, there may be a very experienced felony defense \ncounsel who has never actually tried a capital case, but has attended \nseveral training sessions put on by the ABA or an equivalent \norganization. Why should not such a person be deemed competent to serve \nas defense counsel in a capital case even though he or she may have \nnever defended such a case before? And this ``generic'' requirement \nwill have a strict enforcement mechanism described below that will \nensure it has ``teeth.''\n  In the seminal 1963 case of ``Gideon v. Wainwright,'' 372 U.S. 335, \nthe Supreme Court recognized that indigent defendants have a \nconstitutional right to be represented by counsel in criminal cases. In \nthe 1984 case of ``Strickland v. Washington,'' 466 U.S. 668, the \nSupreme Court held that a defendant has a constitutional right to \neffective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the 6th Amendment to the \nConstitution, and that this requirement applied to the states through \nthe due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Interestingly, \n``Strickland'' was a death penalty case.\n  As these rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and apply to the \nstates through the ``due process'' clause of the 14th Amendment, \nCongress has the authority to enforce these rights through Section V of \nthat Amendment. There is no doubt that there is state action in these \ncircumstances, as the state is responsible for appointing and \ncompensating the counsel representing indigent defendants.\n  My bill, however, also contains an additional enforcement mechanism. \n``Strickland'' identified a two-part analysis in determining whether \nthere was a constitutional violation due to ineffective assistance of \ncounsel. The first prong of that analysis is a determination whether \n``counsel's performance was deficient,'' that is, whether the ``counsel \nmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \n`counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.'' \n``Strickland,'' 466 U.S. at 687. The second prong requires a \ndetermination as to whether the ``counsel's errors were so serious as \nto deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is \nreliable.'' Id. A defendant must establish both prongs to make a \nsuccessful challenge. My bill would, in effect, eliminate the first \nprong of the analysis in a habeas corpus proceeding. If a defendant's \ncounsel did not meet the standards established by my bill, then the \nfirst prong of ``deficient performance'' would be deemed to have been \nmet. The defendant would then only have to satisfy the requirements of \nthe second prong, thus allowing him to challenge the decisions his \ncounsel made that influenced the outcome of the trial, without having \nto fear that the habeas court would deem such decisions to be \n``tactical'' decisions that were within the realm of reasonable \npractice. However, if a state adopted the standards contained in my \nbill, a defendant would have to make both showings, as required by \ncurrent law. A habeas court's review as to whether these standards were \nmet will be ``de novo'' and the State would have the burden of proving \nthat the standards had been met.\n  This overall enforcement provision is analogous to the provision I \nreferred to earlier in the 1996 antiterrorism act, that provided for \nexpedited habeas review if a state adopted certain procedures for \nindigent defendants.\n  The provisions of my bill are all aimed at achieving one goal--\nsecuring for all defendants throughout the criminal justice process all \nthe protections guaranteed by the ``due process'' clause and thereby \nensuring that they receive fair treatment throughout the process, \nregardless of their income level.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill containing these \nthree provisions be printed in the Record.\n  Additionally, in order to facilitate hearings or perhaps legislative \nenactment of these bills, I am introducing the three separately: a \nseparate bill on DNA evidence; a separate bill on staying execution, \nwhere the Supreme Court has granted certiorari; and a separate bill on \nadequacy of counsel, so that, in total, four bills are being \nintroduced, and I ask that these bills also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2446\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve nationwide access to broadband services; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Broadband \nTelecommunications Act of 2002. This legislation is designed to promote \nthe deployment of broadband technology in rural and under-served areas \nof the market.\n  The Internet has unquestionably revolutionized our society, making it \npossible to transmit data and engage in commerce in a manner not \npreviously experienced. However, notwithstanding its enormous benefits, \nthe Internet is still in its building stage, with its greatest capacity \nyet to be reached. An important element in enhancing the Internet's \ncapability is the technology known as ``broadband.'' This refers to the \ntechnologies and facilities that enhance the speed and efficiency by \nwhich voice, video, data communications are transmitted.\n  Many, in fact, believe that broadband is the key to securing the \nInternet as the central medium of interstate and global commerce. Once \nextensively and fully deployed and accepted by consumers and the \nmarketplace, broadband will undoubtedly produce marvelous advantages: \npermitting physicians to consult with each other and share information \ninstantaneously, thus enriching the learning process; allowing \nconsumers to access entertainment including music and movies, as well \nas other products at any given time; and offering workers greater \noptions, as it will facilitate the ability of workers to access from \nhome, electronic files as well as communicate with coworkers by voice \nand video.\n  Before this great vision can be realized, however, several key issues \nwill have to be addressed. These include ensuring that broadband is \ndeployed to all Americans and promoting consumer confidence in the \nInternet, while simultaneously preserving competition in the \ntelecommunications and Internet markets.\n  With respect to broadband deployment, telephone and cable companies \nhave been upgrading their networks, in order to provide broadband \nservice. As it stands today, broadband availability for residential \nInternet users is approximately 85 percent. However, even though this \nnumber is admirable, there are still specific areas where broadband \ncapability has yet to take hold. This predicament mostly involves \nrural, as well as some inner city areas. Ensuring the availability of \nbroadband in these markets is the public policy challenge we face \ntoday. Clearly, Congress' main responsibility is ensuring that the \nright policy is pursued and implemented to accomplish this goal.\n  Reports indicate that small telephone companies, have been diligently \nrolling out broadband service in rural areas. Nevertheless, to achieve \nthe goal of broadband deployment in all rural and underserved areas, \nthe government will need to provide some assistance. In recognition of \nthis need, Senators Rockefeller and Dorgan both members of the \nCommerce Committee, have sponsored bills to support such deployments \nwith options such as low interest loans and tax credits.\n\n  The approach taken by Senators Rockefeller and Dorgan represent a \nconstructive approach to achieving greater broadband deployment. \nFinancial assistance, through measures such as loans, grants, and tax \nincentives, is necessary to help defray the cost of these additional \ndeployments. By providing loans and grants, the bill I introduce today \ntakes a similar approach to achieving broadband deployment.\n  In addition to deployment of broadband facilities, there also is an \nissue concerning broadband speeds. Currently, the broadband facilities \nthat are being deployed to residential consumers provide speeds of up \nto 1.5 megabits per second. However, groups such as TechNet, maintain \nthat in order to realize the real potential of broadband--telemedicine, \ndistance learning, teleworking, and entertainment over the Internet, \ntelecommunications facilities must be able to provide speeds of 50 to \n100 megabits. If this is correct, as policy makers we must, at a \nminimum, determine what is necessary both technologically and \nfinancially to accomplish this goal. Such findings will provide the \nbasis to determine the policies Congress will be compelled to pursue if \na determination is made that speeds of 50 to 100 megabits per second \nare necessary.\n  Even as we discuss broadband speeds of 50-100 megabits, we must \nacknowledge that consumers do not seem seduced by the available \nbroadband speeds of 1.5 megabits. In fact, reports show, that about 10 \npercent actually subscribe to broadband, leading many to believe that \nlow demand is the problem, not slow deployment. If achieving a \nbroadband environment is a priority, in addition to spurring \ndeployment, we must eliminate the impediments that block consumers from \nobtaining the content, services, and applications necessary to make \nbroadband service a useful and productive tool.\n  Another essential issue concerning the promotion of broadband \ninvolves the issue of privacy. Consumers use of the Internet is a \nfundamental first step to promoting interest in broadband. This will \nnot be possible, however, unless consumers are confident that their \nprivacy and personal information are protected and secured. To \naccomplish this goal, sufficient precautions will have to be taken to \nensure that highly sensitive personal data--including financial, \nmedical, social security numbers--cannot be stolen or misused. The \nCommerce Committee has established a substantial record on the issue of \nInternet privacy. That record demonstrates that consumers will use the \nInternet for more personal purposes only when they are confident that \ntheir information is secure. I have introduced separate legislation on \nthis matter.\n  The broadband bill entitled the Broadband Telecommunications Act of\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\n2002, that I introduce today represents a step towards fostering the \ndeployment and adoption of broadband services. It uses monies from the \ntelephone excise tax to fund a number of loan and grant programs. It \nstimulates broadband deployment in rural and underserved areas by \nproviding low interest loans to upgrade facilities including remote \nterminals and fiber between a remote terminal and central office. It \nauthorizes NIST to study how we can facilitate broadband deployment in \nrural and under-served areas. It promotes competition by establishing \npilot projects for wireless and other non-wireline broadband \ntechnologies in rural and underserved areas. The bill begins to help us \nunderstand what is necessary to accomplish broadband with speeds of 50 \nto 100 megabits per second by providing grants to NTIA's Lab, NIST \nLabs, National Science Board and to universities for research. In order \nto address the demand issue, we provide grants to digitize library and \nmuseum collections as well as grants to Universities to conduct \ntechnical research to develop Internet applications useful to \nconsumers. The bill also provides grants to connect under-represented \ncolleges and communities to the Internet.\n\n  Ultimately, if we decide as a nation that a broadband world must be \nachieved, we must move beyond the rhetoric of parity and regulation \nversus deregulation. We must move forward and begin to deal with the \nreal issues that impact broadband deployment and use. These include \nstimulating deployment in unserved and under-served areas, promoting \ncompetition to existing monopolies, ensuring the availability of \ncontent and other Internet applications, preserving the privacy of \nconsumers as they use the Internet, safeguarding cyber security, in \naddition to advancing policies such as e-government, teleworking, \ntelemedicine, and distance learning. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nan open and forthright debate on these issues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. \n        Corzine):\n  S. 2449.

Despite the fact that immigration is a Federal \nresponsibility, medical providers, who have a legal and ethical \nresponsibility to save lives regardless of immigration status, and \nState and local governments bear most of the costs for services \nprovided to immigrants.\n  The bill expressly allows States and health care providers to receive \nMedicaid reimbursement for dialysis and chemotherapy services, prenatal \ncare, and the testing and treatment of communicable diseases provided \nto immigrants; reauthorizes funding, which was provided between fiscal \nyears 1998 and 2001 but expired this year, in the increased amount of \n$50 million annually for fiscal years 2003 to 2007 for unreimbursed \nemergency health services provided to immigrants; and clarifies that \nthe federal government should not limit the ability of state or local \ngovernments to use their own funding to address the health care needs \nof immigrants within their communities.\n  The Constitution of the United States establishes sole authority in \nthe Federal Government to control immigration to this country. Despite \nthat fact, the Federal Government often fails to take financial \nresponsibility for the costs of immigration. Numerous studies also \nindicate that immigrants pay more to the Federal Government in the form \nof taxes than they receive in services, but State government and local \ncommunities and providers bear most of the costs of services provided \nto them.\n  In Luna County, NM, for example, the Columbus Volunteer Fire \nDepartment and Ambulance Service has a contract with the county to \nprovide emergency medical services to the people in Luna County. Luna \nCounty is one of the poorest counties in the Nation with almost one-\nthird of its citizens below poverty and with a per capita income at \njust 49 percent of the national average. Luna County has an extremely \ndifficult time addressing the needs of its own citizens due to a high \nlevel of need and limited resources.\n  And yet, with respect to emergency medical services, Luna County, the \nColumbus Volunteer Fire Department and Ambulance Service, and Mimbres \nMemorial Hospital must also respond to the numerous calls from federal \nofficials at the port-of-entry near Columbus, NM, to treat or transport \nan injured or ill immigrants. The Columbus Volunteer Fire Department \nand Ambulance Service is located just three miles from the Columbus \nport-of-entry and is 32 miles from Mimbres Memorial Hospital in Deming, \nNM.\n  Moreover, the ambulance service is also called in when individuals \nare apprehended after crossing illegally if injury or illness results, \noften while in the custody of the Federal Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, INS. Once treated, the Luna County Sheriff's \nOffice is called to take them back from Deming to the Columbus port-of-\nentry where they are returned across the border to their homes in \nMexico.\n  According to data collected by the United States/Mexico Border \nCounties Coalition through a grant from the Department of Justice, in \n1999, the Columbus Volunteer Fire Department and Ambulance Service \nresponded to 264 calls, of which 56 percent were at the port-of-entry \nand 52 percent were for patients residing outside of the United States. \nOf services billed, 59 percent were for treatment of non-U.S. resident \npatients and the vast majority of those bills went unpaid. In fact, for \nboth the EMS system and the hospital, a large majority of billings sent \nto patients residing outside of the United States are returned as \neither unclaimed or undeliverable much less paid.\n  To help the County and ambulance service, I secured $200,000 last \nyear through the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill for the costs of \nemergency medical services delivered to immigrants in this fiscal year. \nThe funding, however, is just a temporary band-aid to a system that is \npoorly funded and cannot survive without the federal government living \nup to its responsibility to help pay the costs of health services \ndelivered to immigrants. This bill helps address that responsibility.\n  As Ronald Reagan, then Governor of the State of California, testified \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee in 1972, ``the support of citizens \nof other countries shall be a fiscal obligation of the federal \ngovernment.'' He added, ``States should not be required to support \ncitizens of another country, when the state and county governments have \nno effective voice in determining admission standards.''\n  In response to such concerns, the Federal Government has taken two \nimportant steps over the years, providing for federal reimbursement for \nemergency care to low-income immigrants in 1986 and providing \nadditional funding to states for unreimbursed costs delivered to \nimmigrants in emergency situations in 1997. The first needs a technical \nchange and the second, unfortunately, expired in 2001 and needs to be \nreauthorized.\n  The first step that was taken occurred through the leadership of \nSenator Lloyd Bentsen and Representative Henry Waxman in 1986 and was \nsigned into law by President Reagan. It provides for federal \nreimbursement through the Medicaid program to health providers for \nemergency care services provided to low-income immigrants. Services \ndelivered to immigrants who are residents in the country may have the \ncost of their emergency care reimbursed through Medicaid--a joint \nfederal and state program serving low-income and disabled people. \nHowever, in the case of Luna County, the majority of its cases are to \nimmigrants who reside outside of the country, and therefore, do not \nqualify. This legislation clarifies that States may waive the residency \nrequirement for an immigrant who either comes\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\nacross the border under a temporary visa or is paroled into the country \nby INS.\n\n  The bill also clarifies that, since dialysis and chemotherapy are \nlife-threatening conditions, these services qualify as emergency care \nand are eligible for reimbursement by Medicaid. Unfortunately, the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, recently denied \npayment to the State of Arizona for such services and have forced the \nState to pay for such treatment with 100 percent state funding. This \nis, once again, a case of the federal government not fulfilling its \nresponsibility and our bill corrects this problem.\n  The ``Federal Responsibility for Immigrant Health Act of 2002'' would \nalso provide states the option to reimburse providers for the costs of \nprenatal care and the testing and treatment of communicable diseases to \nlow-income immigrants. A January 2000 study in the American Journal of \nObstetrics and Gynecology found that undocumented women with no \nprenatal care were four times more likely to deliver low birthweight \nAmerican citizen infants and seven times more likely to deliver \npremature infants than undocumented women with prenatal care. Moreover, \na child born in the United States of undocumented parents is a United \nStates citizen.\n  Simply stated, if a pregnant women is denied access to prenatal care \ndue to immigration status, it is her child who is denied the \nopportunity to be ``well-born'' and the financial costs associated with \npoor outcomes are high.\n  In addition, States and local governments often seek to ensure that \nall of their residents, including immigrants, are tested and treated \nfor certain communicable diseases. It is in the interest of all \ncitizens to ensure that everybody residing in this country is treated \nfor communicable diseases. As Dr. Richard Brown, Director of UCLA's \nCenter for Health Policy Research says, ``Tuberculosis and other \ncommunicable diseases do not respect distinctions between citizens and \nnon-citizens . . . The key to controlling an outbreak of tuberculosis, \nhepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases, or other communicable \ndiseases is early identification of the source of infection and \nimmediate intervention to treat all infected persons.'' Again, to \naddress these problems, the bill would allow states to reimburse \nproviders for the costs of prenatal care and the testing and treatment \nof communicable diseases to low-income immigrants through the Medicaid \nprogram.\n  Another area where the Federal Government did take an important step \nto assume its responsibility for the costs of emergency health services \ndelivered to immigrants was through $25 million in payments to States \nbetween fiscal year 1998 through 2001. The following 12 States were \neligible for this additional funding over the four-year period, which \nexpired at the end of last year: California, $11.3 million, Texas, $4.0 \nmillion, New York, $3.1 million, Florida, $2.0 million, Illinois, $1.6 \nmillion, New Jersey, $765,000, Arizona, $652,000, Massachusetts, \n$482,000, Virginia, $312,000, Washington, $295,000, Colorado, $255,000, \nand Maryland, $249,000. Unfortunately, that provision in law expired in \n2001 and needs to be reauthorized.\n  The ``Federal Responsibility for Immigrant Health Act of 2002'' \nreauthorizes the program at $50 million between fiscal years 2003 and \n2007, extends the number of qualifying States to 15, and requires that \nStates pass those payments on to health care providers who are \nproviding this care. This helps cover the costs associated with care to \nimmigrants needing emergency care that do not qualify for Medicaid, \nsuch as men who do not meet the categorical requirements for Medicaid \ncoverage. In addition, the bill clarifies that the 15 qualifying States \nare those that have the highest percentage of immigrants rather than \nthe highest numbers, which assures States such as New Mexico are not \ninappropriately left out of the funding in the future.\n  And finally, the bill clarifies that the Federal Government should \nnot limit State or local governments from using their own funding to \nprovide health services to immigrants in their communities. The 10th \nAmendment prevents the Federal Government from interfering in the \nauthority by State and local governments to spend their own revenue as \nthey see fit.\n  Unfortunately, a provision in the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act, PRWORA, in 1996 has been interpreted by \nTexas Attorney General John Cornyn and some in the State of New Mexico, \nincluding the University of New Mexico Hospital, to preclude state and \nlocal governments from providing non-emergency care services, with the \nexceptions of immunizations and the testing and treatment of \ncommunicable diseases, unless the State decides to override the law by \npassing its own legislation specifically authorizing such services.\n  Others have disagreed. El Paso County Attorney Jose Rodriquez \ndisagreed with the opinion of the Texas Attorney General in a August \n14, 2001, letter by saying, ``There is nothing in the PRWORA that \nexpressly prohibits providing health care to undocumented aliens . . . \nThere are no enforcement mechanisms in the PRWORA, and there are no \npenalties directed at state or local governments.'' As a result, the \npublic hospitals in El Paso, TX, and elsewhere in Texas have largely \nignored the Texas Attorney General's opinion.\n  However, in New Mexico, the University of New Mexico Hospital has \nchosen to tighten eligibility requirements for its health care \nservices. They argue they are complying with the ambiguous law.\n  An article that appears in an Internet-based publication entitled \nBorderlines entitled ``Debate Over Immigrant Health Care Heats Up in \nNew Mexico'' in November 2001 notes, ``Critics say the move to deny \nhealth care to some U.S. residents, regardless of the reasons, is \ndangerous, impractical, and inhumane. It is dangerous, they argue, \nbecause anyone with a communicable disease, illegal immigrant or not, \ncan spread that disease if not treated. The policy is impractical, they \nadd, because an untreated health problem will likely worsen and require \nmore expensive treatments later, often in emergency rooms. And denying \nnon-emergency health care to people with serious, chronic diseases like \ndiabetes, asthma, or cancer means they must endure more pain and \nsuffering, often as their conditions deteriorate.''\n  As Dr. Catherine Torres of First Step Women's Health Center in Las \nCruces, NM, and a member of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission \nnotes, ``When do you treat a child with asthma? When [the child] can't \nbreathe?''\n  This provision has also led to the unfortunate situation of imposing \nadditional liability or malpractice exposure on health providers that \nwork for state or local governmental health programs for denying needed \nhealth services to an individual. Health providers should not have to \nviolate medical ethics of purposely denying needed health services to \nanyone and nor should they be exposed to additional liability because \nof a convoluted provision in federal law.\n  As Dan Reyna, director of New Mexico's Border Health Office in Las \nCruces, NM, adds, ``First, we're near an international border, we're \nnot going to change that. Second, health care providers, both public \nand private, are not immigration officers for the Federal Government. \nAnd third, it's to the benefit of every state to protect community \nhealth and the quality of life of every resident. If you accept these \nprimary premises, you have to provide preventative care services to \neveryone who needs it.''\n  I urge the passage of this legislation. Although it may not be \npopular, the federal government should help assume its responsibility \nfor immigration and the costs associated with health services. We talk \na great deal about personal responsibility when talking about welfare \nreform. It is time for the federal government to take on its \nresponsibility as well. State and local governments and health \nproviders, already stressed by the fact that our country has around 40 \nmillion uninsured residents, cannot take on these additional costs.\n  I would like to thank Senators McCain, Torricelli, and Corzine for \ntheir support and help on this legislation. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\n                                S. 2449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Department of National Homeland \nSecurity and the National Office for Combating Terrorism; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, with \nSenators Specter and Graham, the National Homeland Security and \nCombating Terrorism Act of 2002. This legislation seeks to strengthen \nthe Federal Government's ability to confront terrorism and other \nthreats to our homeland security.\n  Specifically, this legislation would create a new Department of \nNational Homeland Security to focus an array of agencies and programs \nthat are vital to securing our borders and critical infrastructure, and \nto preparing for and responding to homeland threats. It also would \ncreate a White House terrorism director to forge an effective strategy \nto combat terrorism across the entire Federal Government. In addition \nto the bill we introduce here, I am pleased to note that companion \nlegislation is being introduced today by Representatives Thornberry, \nHarman, Tauscher and Gibbons.\n  The events of September 11 brought home to us the very real threat of \nterrorism not only on foreign shores, but also here at home. Though the \npain of that day will stay in our hearts and minds forever, we now have \nan opportunity to step back from that single most horrid event in our \nmodern history and take action to prevent something like it from ever \nhappening again.\n  It seems that nearly every day, the media or government investigators \nexpose a new crack in America's homeland defense foundation, at our \nborders, our ports, or within our cyberspace. The fact is, without a \ngovernment that is permanently reoriented to meet unexpected challenges \nhere at home, new vulnerabilities will emerge. That's why we must \nmobilize government so that it can quickly and effectively prevent \nterrorist threats here at home and respond should the worst occur.\n  Our approach, combining a homeland security department with a White \nHouse office for combating terrorism, addresses the need to permanently \nrestructure critical homeland security functions under a cabinet-level \nsecretary with real operational authority and the ability to personally \ndirect a homeland security plan. At the same time, we would allow for \nthe highest\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\nlevel of coordination with other Federal agencies--Health and Human \nServices, the Defense Department, the Energy Department, for example, \nand real budget certification authority.\n  Our proposal stems from a series of hearings I convened last fall as \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. We held about a dozen \ndifferent sessions looking into various aspects of homeland security, \nranging from protection of our critical infrastructure to the state and \nlocal role in protecting Americans at home. Those hearings confirmed \nwhat experts and commissions had already warned us: that our government \nis poorly prepared to deal with the threat of terrorism. Although the \ngovernment has an array of programs related to terrorism and \nother homeland threats, these efforts are poorly coordinated and lack \noverall strategic leadership. We need focused, accountable leadership \nto forge these efforts into a cohesive homeland security program.\n\n  Among the witnesses we heard from were former Senators Warren Rudman \nand Gary Hart, who co-chaired the so-called Hart-Rudman Commission on \nNational Security/21st Century. Guided by recommendations of that \nCommission, Senator Specter and I introduced legislation to create a \nHomeland Security Department. After negotiations through the winter \nwith Senator Graham, we combined our proposal with his idea of \nconferring statutory authority on a White House terrorism office.\n  As our bill is written, the department will be led by a Cabinet \nofficial with real line and budget authority over critical homeland \nsecurity programs. The new department will bring together under one \nroof our key border security agencies, Coast Guard, Customs, INS law \nenforcement, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which \nis the cornerstone of our emergency preparation and response efforts. \nThe department will also include programs to protect our critical \ninfrastructure, and an office to promote research and development of \ntechnologies vital to our homeland security. The new department will \nprovide state and local authorities with a clear resource and point of \ncontact to forge a truly national response to this problem.\n  Yet we recognize that, no matter how robust a department we create, \nit can not include every agency that plays a role in homeland security, \nwhich is why our legislation incorporates Senator Graham's proposal to \nconfer statutory authority on a White House office. That office--the \nNational Office for Combating Terrorism--would coordinate a national \nanti-terrorism strategy. The office would be led by a presidentially-\nappointed, Senate-confirmed director charged with coordinating a \ncomprehensive assessment of terrorist threats and, along with the \ndepartment secretary, developing a strategy and a budget to fight \nterrorism here at home. The director would coordinate execution of the \nstrategy by relevant federal agencies--particularly those concerned \nwith intelligence and law enforcement.\n  Naturally, our new formation would require a major restructuring of \nthe Federal Government's public safety-related responsibilities. I know \nthis will not be easy. Machiavelli trenchantly observed ``there is \nnothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success nor more \ndangerous to manage than the creation of a new system.'' Within the \nagencies, and within Congress as well, as Governor Ridge has already \ndiscovered, there are powerful reflexes to protect administrative turf. \nBureaucracies are slow to change. Change is disruptive. It creates \nuncertainty and it distorts existing balances of power.\n  But we must look at September 11 as an urgent reason to create \nsomething better. A restructuring of the kind we envision is not \nunprecedented. We have undertaken bold organizational change in periods \nof crisis before. Consider General Marshall's transformation of the \narmy which helped win World War II or the National Security Act of 1947 \nthat created the CIA and Department of Defense in the midst of the Cold \nWar. More recently, the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, in streamlining \nthe military command, helped us to prosecute the Persian Gulf War.\n  The bottom line is if statutory and budget authority are not \nconferred upon the director of homeland security, the homeland defense \nof this nation will be less than what it should be. In the one area \nwhere compromise can be catastrophic, this is an unacceptable \ncompromise.\n  Let's be motivated by the words of Winston Churchill, who in 1941 \nsaid to the Axis powers, ``You do your worst and we will do our best.'' \nWe can tinker around the edges of change. Or, we can understand that \nSeptember 11 confirmed our worst fears: warfare has changed and we are \nno longer safe at home. We are in a terrible, new era and we urgently \nneed a government that is invigorated and effectively organized to meet \nthe challenge.\n  I thank my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that the text of our \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the disposition of weapons-usable \nplutonium at the Savannah River Site South Carolina; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will provide for the disposition of weapons usable plutonium at \nthe Savannah River Site, South Carolina. This bill will ensure the \nState of South Carolina will have an enforceable agreement on the \nconstruction and operation of a mixed-oxide, MOX, fuel fabrication \nfacility at the Savannah River Site. The bill also provides for clear \npathway to remove any weapons-usable plutonium from our State if the \nMOX facility is delayed or fails to operate as planned.\n  The Plutonium Disposition program is an important element of our \nNational Security. Under agreements made by the United States and the \nRussian Federation, each Nation agreed to dispose of designated amounts \nof weapons-grade plutonium. This agreement is a significant step toward \nsafeguarding nuclear materials and preventing their diversion to rogue \nstates. In addition, it has been widely acknowledged that Russian \ncriminal\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\ngroups are attempting to steal weapons-usable plutonium from poorly \nsecured sites for known terrorist organizations, and therefore most \ncertainly this is a matter of extreme National Security.\n  The MOX facility will be an important economic factor in my State. As \na result of this bill, Department of Energy officials will also know \nthat SRS, the largest industrial employer in my State, will be ready \nand eager to accept new missions and create jobs. Helping the Savannah \nRiver Site SRS, grow and remain the ``Crown Jewel'' among Department of \nEnergy facilities has been one of my proudest achievements of public \nservice as a Senator and Governor of my State. South Carolina and the \nDepartment of Energy have had an outstanding working relationship to \nbring jobs to SRS while helping to defend our National Security.\n  I deeply regretted the recent dispute over the mixed oxide (MOX) fuel \nfabrication facility and the Federal lawsuit that was recently filed. I \nhave called for reasoned and mature thinking to prevail in this matter. \nThis legislation is intended to provide the assurances to both parties \nand restore the elements of trust and cooperation, while protecting the \ninterests of the State and the health, safety and economy of its \ncitizens. Interested parties must not fail to view this matter without \ntaking all the factors into consideration. The health and security of \nSouth Carolinians must always be protected. current and future jobs in \nSouth Carolina must be protected. The National Security of the United \nStates must be protected. The legislation I am introducing today will \naccomplish all of these objectives.\n  This initiative is good government and I encourage its support by my \ncolleagues. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3881-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 260--DESIGNATING MAY 1, 2002, AS ``NATIONAL CHILD \n                         CARE WORTHY WAGE DAY''\n\n  Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Carnahan, and Mrs. Murray) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 260\n\n       Whereas approximately 14,000,000 children are in out-of-\n     home care during part or all of the day so that their parents \n     may work;\n       Whereas the average salary of early childhood educators is \n     $16,000 per year, and only \\1/3\\ have health insurance and \n     even fewer have a pension plan;\n       Whereas the quality of child care and other early childhood \n     education programs is directly linked to the quality of early \n     childhood educators, and low wages make it difficult to \n     attract qualified individuals to the profession;\n       Whereas the turnover rate of early childhood educators is \n     approximately 30 percent per year because of low wages and \n     lack of benefits, making it difficult to retain high quality \n     educators, and research has demonstrated that young children \n     require caring relationships to have a consistent presence in \n     their lives for their positive development;\n       Whereas the compensation of early childhood educators must \n     be commensurate with the importance of the job of helping the \n     young children of the United States develop their social, \n     emotional, physical, and intellectual skills to be ready for \n     school;\n       Whereas the cost of adequate compensation cannot be funded \n     by further burdening parents with higher child care fees but \n     requires public as well as private resources so that quality \n     care and education is accessible for all families; and\n       Whereas the Center for the Child Care Workforce and other \n     early childhood education organizations recognize May 1st as \n     National Child Care Worthy Wage Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 1, 2002, as ``National Child Care Worthy \n     Wage Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Child Care Worthy Wage Day'' by--\n       (A) honoring early childhood educators and programs in \n     their communities; and\n       (B) working together to resolve the early childhood \n     educator compensation crisis.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ndesignating May 1, 2002 as National Child Care Worthy Wage Day. On May \n1 each year, child care providers and other early childhood \nprofessionals nationwide conduct public awareness and education efforts \nhighlighting the importance of early childhood education. I hope these \nefforts will bring attention to early childhood education and the \nimportance of attracting and retaining qualified child care workers.\n  Every day, approximately 14 million children are cared for outside \nthe home so that their parents can work. This figure includes six \nmillion of our Nation's infants and toddlers. Children begin to learn \nat birth, and the quality of care they receive will affect them for the \nrest of their lives. Early child care affects language development, \nmath skills, social behavior, and general readiness for school. \nExperienced child care workers can identify children who have \ndevelopment or emotional problems and provide the care they need to \ntake on life's challenges. Through the creative use of play, structured \nactivities and individual attention, child care workers help their \ncharges learn about the world around them and how to interact with \nothers.\n  The dedicated individuals who nurture and teach our Nation's young \nchildren are undervalued despite the importance of their work. The \naverage salary of a child care worker is approximately $16,000 \nannually. According to the Department of Labor, in 1998, the middle 50 \npercent of child care workers and pre-school teachers earned between \n$5.82 and $8.13 an hour. The lowest 10 percent of child care workers \nwere paid an hourly wage of $5.49 or less. Only one third of our \nNation's child care workers have health insurance and even fewer have \npension plans. This grossly inadequate level of wages and benefits for \nchild care staff has led to difficulties in attracting and retaining \nhigh quality caretakers and educators. As a result, the turnover rate \nfor child care providers is 30 percent a year. This high turnover rate \ninterrupts consistent and stable relationships that children need to \nhave with their caregivers.\n  To address this issue, Senator Dodd and I have introduced the ``Focus \nOn Committed and Underpaid Staff for Children's Sake Act,'' a bill that \nwould establish a grant and scholarship program for child care \nproviders.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing the importance of \nthe service that child care workers provide and the need to increase \ntheir compensation accordingly. The Nation's child care workforce, the \nfamilies who depend on them, and the next generation of children that \nthey care for deserve our support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3881-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3881-S3882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 104--RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF \n    CIVIL ENGINEERS ON THE OCCASION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS \nFOUNDING AND FOR THE MANY VITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERS TO THE \n   QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE \n    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT HAVE LED TO THE PHYSICAL \n                    INFRASTRUCTURE OF MODERN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire) submitted \nthe following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 104\n\n       Whereas, founded in 1852, the American Society of Civil \n     Engineers is the oldest national engineering society in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas civil engineers work to constantly improve \n     buildings, water systems, and other civil engineering works \n     through research, demonstration projects, and the technical \n     codes and standards developed by the American Society of \n     Civil Engineers;\n       Whereas the American Society of Civil Engineers \n     incorporates educational, scientific, and charitable efforts \n     to advance the science of engineering, improve engineering \n     education, maintain the highest standards of excellence in \n     the practice of civil engineering, and protect the public \n     health, safety, and welfare;\n       Whereas the American Society of Civil Engineers represents \n     the profession primarily responsible for the design, \n     construction, and maintenance of the roads, bridges, \n     airports, railroads, public buildings, mass transit systems, \n     resource recovery systems, water systems, waste disposal and \n     treatment facilities, dams, ports, waterways, and other \n     public facilities that are the foundation on which the \n     economy of the United States stands and grows; and\n       Whereas the civil engineers of the United States, through \n     innovation and the highest\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\n     professional standards in the practice of civil engineering, \n     protect the public health and safety and ensure the high \n     quality of life enjoyed by the people of the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the American Society of Civil Engineers on \n     the occasion of the 150th anniversary of its founding;\n       (2) commends the many achievements of the civil engineers \n     of the United States; and\n       (3) encourages the American Society of Civil Engineers to \n     continue its tradition of excellence in service to the \n     profession of civil engineering and to the public.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, from the pyramids of Egypt, to the \nroadways and waterworks of Rome, through the great Gothic cathedrals of \nEurope, to today's water treatment facilities and transportation \nsystems, civil engineers have been building societies.\n  For the past 150 years, The American Society of Civil Engineers, \nASCE, has served as the professional organization for, and represented, \nthis great body of engineers within our country. The professional \nstandards and quality of work in the civil engineering community have \nbeen ensured through the efforts of the Society.\n  Without the efforts of our Nation's civil engineers, and those who \nlead within the profession, this country would not be the great Nation \nthat it is today. With the help of ASCE and the professional expertise \nof the Society's membership, we are working together to ensure that our \nchildren and grandchildren have a clean and safe environment in which \nto live.\n  It is with pleasure, as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, along with Senator Smith, the committee's \nranking member, that I recognize, through this concurrent resolution, \nthe 150th anniversary of the American Society of Civil Engineers.

CENTRAL ASIA TRADE ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States is now engaged in a war against \n     terrorism, and it is vital that the United States respond to \n     this threat through the use of all available resources;\n       (2) Open markets between the United States and friendly \n     nations remain a vital component of the national security of \n     the United States for the purposes of forming long lasting \n     friendships, strategic partnerships, and creating new long-\n     term allies through the exportation of America's democratic \n     ideals, civil liberties, freedoms, ethics, principles, \n     tolerance, openness, ingenuity, and productiveness.\n       (3) Utilizing trade with other nations is indispensable to \n     United States foreign policy in that trade assists developing \n     nations in achieving these very objectives.\n       (4) It is in the national security interests of the United \n     States to increase and improve ties, economically and \n     otherwise, with nations in Central Asia and the South \n     Caucasus.\n       (5) The development of strong political, economic, and \n     security ties between the nations of Central Asia and the \n     South Caucasus and the United States will foster stability in \n     this region.\n       (6) The development of open market economies and open \n     democratic systems in the nations of Central Asia and the \n     South Caucasus will provide positive incentives for American \n     private investment, increased trade, and other forms of \n     commercial interaction with the United States.\n       (7) Many of the nations of Central Asia and the South \n     Caucasus have secular Muslim governments that are seeking \n     closer alliance with the United States and that have \n     diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel.\n       (8) The region of Central Asia and the South Caucasus could \n     produce oil and gas in sufficient quantities to reduce the \n     dependence of the United States on energy from the volatile \n     Persian Gulf region.\n       (9) Normal trade relations between the nations of Central \n     Asia and the South Caucasus and the United States will help \n     achieve these objectives.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) Prior to extending normal trade \n     relations with the nations of Central Asia and the South \n     Caucasus, the President should--\n       (A) obtain the commitment of those countries to developing \n     a system of governance in accordance with the provisions of \n     the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe (also known as the ``Helsinki Final Act'') \n     regarding human rights and humanitarian affairs;\n       (B) ensure that those countries have endeavored to address \n     issues related to their national and religious minorities \n     and, as a member state of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), committed to adopting special \n     measures for ensuring that persons belonging to national \n     minorities have full equality individually as well as in \n     community with other members of their group;\n       (C) ensure that those countries have also committed to \n     enacting legislation to provide protection against incitement \n     to violence against persons or groups based on national, \n     racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, hostility, or \n     hatred, including anti-Semitism;

which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Whereas the American people respect the Iranian people, and \n     value the contribution that Iran's culture has made to world \n     civilization over three millennia:\n       Whereas the Iranian people aspire to democracy, civil, \n     political and religious rights and the rule of law, evidence \n     by increasingly frequent anti-government and anti-Khatami \n     demonstrations within Iran and the statements of numerous \n     Iranian expatriates and dissidents;\n       Whereas Iran is an ideological dictatorship presided over \n     by an unelected Supreme Leader with limitless veto power, an \n     unelected Expediency Council and Council of Guardians capable \n     of eviscerating any reforms, and a President elected only \n     after the aforementioned disqualified 234 other candidates \n     for being too liberal, reformist, or secular;\n       Whereas the United States recoganizes the Iranian peoples' \n     concerns that President Muhammad Khatami's rhetoric has not \n     been matched by his actions;\n       Whereas President Khatami clearly lacks the ability and \n     inclination to change the behavior of the State either toward \n     the vast majority of Iranians who seek freedom; or toward the \n     international community;\n       Whereas political repression, newspaper censorship, \n     corruption, vigilante intimidation, arbitrary imprisonment of \n     students, and public executions have increased since \n     Khatami's inauguration in 1997;\n       Whereas men and women are not equal under the law and women \n     are legally deprived of their basic rights;\n       Whereas the Iranian government shipped 50-tons of \n     sophisticated weaponry to the Palestinian Authority despite \n     Chairman's Arafat's cease-fire agreement, consistently seeks \n     to undermine the Middle East peace process; provides safe-\n     haven to al-Qa'ida and Taliban terrorists; allows transit of \n     arms for guerillas seeking to undermine our ally Turkey; \n     provides transit of terrorists seeking to destabilize the \n     U.S.-protected safe-haven in Iraq; and develop weapons of \n     mass destruction;\n       Whereas since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     and despite rhetorical protestations to the contrary, the \n     Islamic Republic has actively and repeatedly sought to \n     undermine the United States' war on terror;\n       Whereas there is a broad-base movement for change in Iran \n     that represents all sectors of Iranian society, including \n     youth, women, student bodies, military personnel, and even \n     religious figures, that is pro-democratic, believes in \n     secular government, and is yearning to live in freedom;\n       Whereas following the tragedies of September 11, tens of \n     thousands of Iranians filled the streets spontaneously and in \n     solidarity with the United States and the victims of the \n     terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the people of Iran deserve the support of the \n     American people: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) legitimizing the regime in Iran stifles the growth of \n     the genuine democratic forces in Iran and does not serve U.s. \n     national security interest;\n       (2) positive U.S. gestures toward Iran should be directed \n     toward the people of Iran, and not political figures whose \n     survival depends upon preservation of the current regime;\n       (3) it should be the policy of the United States to seek \n     genuine democratic government that will restore freedom to \n     the Iranian people, abandon terrorism, and live in peace and \n     security with the international community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3884-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n                department of health and human services\n\n       Elias Adam Zerhouni, of Maryland, to be Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Dr. Elias \nZerhouni on his confirmation by the U.S. Senate as the new Director of \nthe National Institutes of Health. I am pleased that his nomination was \napproved by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee this \nmorning and that the Senate has approved his nomination today.\n  I am proud that Maryland is home to the National Institutes of \nHealth, and some of the best and brightest researchers in the world. \nNow Maryland is the home of the National Institutes of Health's new \nDirector, Dr. Zerhouni.\n  Dr. Zerhouni has spent his impressive career turning medical research \ninto tools and treatments that improve patients' lives. He is an \ninnovative thinker and a successful entrepreneur who has turned his \nscientific discoveries into successful businesses. He is also a \ntalented administrator who will bring his leadership skills to bear on \nthis challenging new role. His administrative skills will be especially \nimportant as Congress completes the bipartisan commitment to double \nNIH's budget this year.\n  I am pleased that the U.S. Senate has given Dr. Zerhouni this \nresounding show of support as he prepares to take the helm of the \nworld's finest research institution. I look forward to working with Dr. \nZerhouni in his new role as Director of the National Institutes of \nHealth. The National Institutes of Health and the American people will \nbe well served by Dr. Elias Zerhouni.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nnomination of one of the nation's most distinguished scientific \nleaders, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, to be the Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Dr. Zerhouni's life is a story about endless possibilities. He \narrived from Algeria with little else but his medical training--and a \ndesire to help his fellow human beings facing disease. From that humble \nbeginning, he has explored the endless possibilities of medical \nresearch. His contributions have been extraordinary.\n  Dr. Zerhouni developed new methods for imaging living tissues that \nare in use in hospitals around the nation. As a skilled administrator, \nhe has demonstrated leadership and vision time and time again at Johns \nHopkins. He revitalized the Medical School's Clinical Practice \nAssociation. He worked skillfully with scientists, business leaders and \nelected officials to create a thriving biotechnology park.\n  Most recently, he established the groundbreaking Institute for Cell \nEngineering. At this remarkable new facility, scientists are exploring \nthe potential of stem cells to alleviate some of the most deadly \ndiseases we face as a nation. The stem cell research conducted at the \nnew Institute is already providing new insights into therapies for \nParkinson's Disease, spinal injury, diabetes, and other serious \nillnesses.\n  In many ways, the story of NIH is also a story about endless \npossibilities. NIH research has developed therapies to free millions of \nAmericans from the limitations of disease and disability so that they, \ntoo, can explore the endless possibilities of an active and productive \nlife.\n  Dr. Zerhouni will become the first NIH Director in this new century \nof the life sciences. Never have the possibilities for NIH been \ngreater. The NIH budget will increase to more than $27 billion this \nyear. Those funds will support research and training in thousands of \nresearch institutions across the nation and around the world. Leading \nthe NIH is an awesome responsibility that will determine the quality of \nlife for millions and millions of Americans for many years to come.\n  NIH research ranges from studies of microscopic structures in living \ncells to investigations of patterns of disease in entire populations. \nNIH research not only gives us information about what keeps us healthy \nor makes us sick, but it reveals new insights into who we are as human \nbeings.\n  The advances made by NIH research in just the first two years of this \nnew century are extraordinary--and the future promises still greater \nwonders. Already in this century, NIH research has helped map the human \ngenome. No less important than these basic genetic studies are recent \nfindings from NIH scientists that structured lifestyle changes can \nsignificantly reduce the risk of diabetics, sparing millions of \nAmericans from this deadly disease.\n  The impact of NIH research on human health is incalculable. Life \nexpectancies have risen dramatically over the last century, and some \nscientists believe that the first human being to live to be a \nproductive 150 year-old is already alive today.\n  Never before have the challenges for NIH been greater. The anthrax \nattacks of last fall taught the nation what many of us knew already--\nthat the powerful techniques of modern biology can be used not only to \nheal but to harm. Just this week, the Brookings Institute published a \nrisk assessment showing that a million Americans could die in a major \nbiological attack.\n  NIH must provide the leadership required to develop new medical \nweapons in the battle against bioterrorism. I know that good progress \nis already being make in the race to develop better vaccines against \nsmallpox, anthrax, and other dangerous pathogens.\n  I would also like to extend my thanks, and the thanks of the entire \nSenate to Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, who has served so effectively as Acting \nDirector since the departure of Dr. Harold Varmus. She has served in \nthis important position with dedication and skill, to the great benefit \nof NIH and the nation.\n  Earlier this week, our committee received Dr. Zerhouni's nomination \npapers from the President. A few days ago, we listened to him explain \nhis vision for meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities of \nthis new century of the life sciences as NIH Director. Earlier today, \nour committee approved his nomination unanimously. I hope my Senate \ncolleagues will confirm his nomination quickly. I wish every good \nfuture to Dr. Zerhouni, and\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nI look forward to working with him closely in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/02/senate-section/article/S3887-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, thank you for the recognition. I thank \nSenator Daschle for agreeing to this time.\n  Obviously, the farm bill is a very important issue for our country, \nfor our trade, and for many farmers, as well as consumers who depend on \nagriculture in America.\n  There are a lot of concerns about this legislation. This is a very \nlarge piece of legislation. I think it is a 6-year program. It adds \nover $73 billion to farm programs, as well as not only the commodities \nbut conservation and nutrition and food stamps. This is a huge bill.\n  I think having adequate time to discuss the conference report is \nimportant.\n  The ranking member on our side of the aisle, Senator Lugar, has a \nnumber of concerns which he needs to point out.\n  I think this is a fair way to get it done. It does take away time \nthat we could be spending on other bills but we cannot just ignore the \nsupport or the opposition to a bill of this magnitude.\n  All things considered, this is the best way to proceed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will say one more time that I \nappreciate the help and leadership shown by the Republican leader in \nbringing this bill to the floor. I know sometimes you can't have \neverything you want. I wanted a shorter period of time, but we will \nlive with this, and we will move on. I thank him for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
