Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 28, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 28) suspending certain \n     provisions of law pursuant to section 258(a)(2) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nstatutory time limit has been reduced to 2 hours to be equally divided \nand controlled between the chairman and the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee or their designees.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S11666]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, last Thursday, the Budget Committee \nreported this joint resolution which would suspend several budget \nenforcement mechanisms. We reported unfavorably in the Budget Committee \nby a unanimous vote of 22-to-0. I am certain people wonder why we have \na resolution that the budget committee rejected unanimously; how that \ncan happen.\n  It happens because it is required by law to bring this matter to the \nfloor, even though the Budget Committee has unanimously rejected its \nelements. The reason for that is, whenever economic growth is below 1 \npercent for two consecutive quarters, the balanced budget amendment \nrequires that the Congressional Budget Office should issue a low-growth \nreport. They did that on October 31.\n  The Senate is now required to consider this joint resolution which \nwould suspend five budget enforcement mechanisms. Those mechanisms have \nelements as follows: points of order against tax cuts or spending that \nviolate the budget resolution; the discretionary spending cap point of \norder; the point of order enforcing 302(a) and 302(b) spending \nallocations; the point of order against amendments to reconciliation \nbills, unless the amendments are deficit-neutral; and sequestration of \ndiscretionary and mandatory spending. All of those things would be \ntossed out and would not apply if we accepted this resolution.\n  Senator Domenici, the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, \nand I, and our Budget Committee colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, are \nunited in opposing the resolution and urge all Senators to vote to \ndefeat it. As I indicated, the Senate is required to take up this \nresolution. It is required by the Budget Act. However, it would be a \nmistake to adopt it because that would take away all protections to \nmaintain fiscal discipline.\n  The economic rationale for suspending budget enforcement procedures \nduring periods of low economic growth is that such procedures might \nmake it more difficult to enact stimulative measures quickly. We have \nalready seen that Congress has responded quickly to enact $40 billion \nin supplemental emergency spending. It is important to weigh the real \nrisk that long-term budget discipline will be undermined against the \nquestion of putting in place this resolution.\n  I believe in current circumstances that the risk is too great and it \ndoes not make sense to suspend these elements of budget discipline to \nprovide for the easier passage of tax cuts or additional spending. \nAgain, we have seen Congress act quickly to put in place stimulative \nspending. We have seen Congress act quickly this session to put in \nplace tax cuts.\n  When the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Budget \nCommittees issued their principles for economic stimulus a month ago, \nwe recognized that we were facing extraordinary circumstances and that \nCongress and the President would provide the resources necessary to \nrespond to the events of September 11. I am certain our budget \nenforcement procedures will not prevent that from happening.\n  I think every Member of this Chamber understands that our top \npriority is to defend this Nation. In addition, we must work to rebuild \nthat which has been destroyed and we must be prepared to counterattack \nthose who, in such a vicious way, have engaged in a sneak attack on our \ncountry.\n  We also recognize that an economic stimulus package should not \nundermine long-term fiscal discipline, which is essential to sustained \neconomic growth. I believe preserving our budget enforcement tools will \nbe very important in helping us to adhere to this critical overall \nprinciple.\n  Policies that adhere to the principles laid down by the joint House \nand Senate Budget Committee leadership are not likely to be held up by \nour budget enforcement procedures. In contrast, proposals that violate \nthe principles, especially those that worsen the long-term budget \noutlook by imposing substantial outyear budget costs, should be subject \nto normal budget procedures.\n  The suspension resolution would have us decide now, in one fell \nswoop, whether to suspend budget enforcement for the next 2 years. I \nthink it is very important that everybody understand what would happen \nif we went against the recommendation of the Budget Committee and threw \nout these budget procedures. There would be no protections, no special \nprotections for fiscal discipline for the next 2 years. I think such a \nblanket waiver would be most unwise. We will be much better off if we \ncontinue to look at each bill and amendment individually and retain the \nability to invoke budget enforcement procedures against those that \nthreaten our long-term fiscal discipline. This is a fundamental way we \nprotect the integrity of the trust funds of Social Security and \nMedicare for the long term.\n  I might add that passing this joint resolution would be \nunprecedented. We have only gone through this once before, in 1991, the \nlast time the economy was in recession. At that time, the Congressional \nBudget Office issued three successive low-growth reports leading to the \nintroduction of three resolutions to suspend budget enforcement \nprocedures. Each time, the Budget Committee reported out unfavorably \nand the resolution was defeated overwhelmingly on the Senate floor in \nbipartisan votes.\n  The Senate made the right decision then, and we should make the same \ndecision now. We have the will to enact a stimulus proposal. In fact, \none will be on the floor this afternoon. We have the ability to do that \nunder normal budget procedures, and it is critically important to \nmaintain our long-term fiscal discipline.\n  If there is one thing every economist has told us who has come before \nthe Finance Committee, of which I am a member, and the Budget \nCommittee, of which I am a member, it is that we need to couple short-\nterm stimulus with long-term fiscal discipline. It is that combination \nof policies that is most likely to allow us to emerge from this \neconomic slowdown.\n  I refer back to what happened in 1991 because I think it is important \nfor our colleagues to know this. In that year, on three occasions these \nresolutions came before the Budget Committee and then came to the \nfloor. These resolutions were the same as the one we consider today. \nThey would have suspended all of the budget enforcement procedures.\n\n  Here is what happened in the Budget Committee. On January 24, 1991, \nthey reported unfavorably, in a vote of 21-to-0 on that resolution. \nThen the full Senate voted on January 31, and they defeated it 97-to-2.\n  I think the record with respect to what occurred is very clear. The \nsame thing happened on May 7, when the resolution was taken up again. A \nsecond low-growth report was issued by the Congressional Budget Office, \nand on May 7 the Senate considered it and defeated it 21-to-0, \nreporting it unfavorably on a unanimous vote.\n  The Senate took it up on May 9, again under special procedures, and \nrejected it 92-to-5. Again, on September 12, another low-growth \nresolution came before the Senate Budget Committee and it was rejected \non a vote of 19-to-2. That one came to the floor of the Senate and was \nrejected 88-to-8.\n  I think it is clear that the Senate has determined these procedures \nought not to be abandoned, even at a time of sharp economic slowdown, \ncertainly not in the circumstances we face today. So we are here to \nvote on this joint resolution because the Balanced Budget Act requires \nus to do so. But Senator Domenici and I are united in our strong \nopposition to the joint resolution. We are joined in that position by \nevery member of the Senate Budget Committee. On a unanimous vote we \nreported this resolution unfavorably and urge our colleagues to reject \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I will be brief. I have a few remarks.\n  First, S.J. Res. 28 is an automatic resolution. It is required to be \nintroduced by the majority leader and considered by the Budget \nCommittee and the Senate under expedited procedures. That is why we are \nhere today. The resolution is automatic when the Congressional Budget \nOffice notifies the Congress of an economic slowdown, as described in \nthe Budget Act. On October 31 the Department of Commerce of the United \nStates advanced the preliminary report on real economic growth.\n\n[[Page S11667]]\n\n It showed the economy in the third quarter shrank at the annual rate \nof .4 percent, the largest fall since October of 1991. The report, \nwhich will likely be revised downward even more come the January \nreport, triggered the Congressional Budget Office notification of low \ngrowth and subsequently triggered the introduction of the resolution \nbefore us today.\n  The provision in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \nAct of 1985, sometimes referred to as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, \nthat necessitated the reporting of this resolution was simply that we \ndid not want to initiate major spending cuts in a time of recession.\n  I might add, the same section of the law that suspends spending cuts \nin a time of recession also covers events of war.\n  S.J. Res. 28 was reported unfavorably from the Budget Committee, as \nindicated by the chairman of the Budget Committee in his remarks just a \nfew moments ago preceding these. The committee is required to report \nthe resolution without amendment, to be discharged without comment. I \nconcurred with the chairman that the committee should express its \ndisfavor with the resolution to send a signal to the full Senate to \ndisapprove it. I understand a vote on this resolution is scheduled for \n5 o'clock today. I ask the Senate to join the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and me in disapproving the resolution.\n  If this resolution were somehow to make it to the President for his \nsignature--which he would not sign--it would effectively eliminate all \nfiscal discipline, all the enforcement tools we have in Congress all \nthe way through September 2003. I do not think we need to take such \ndrastic action. I think we understand the situation and we can act \naccordingly on our own, in a normal manner, to take action that is \nrequired by the facts as we find them, quarter by quarter. I do not \nthink we need to take the drastic action that is contemplated by the \nresolution.\n  Having taken this position on a bipartisan basis, however, does not \nmean we should not act to address the economic slowdown and the war on \nterrorism, and I believe the distinguished chairman has indicated so to \nthe Senate. We must take action on the war on terrorism, and obviously \nwith appropriate legislation we must act against the economic slowdown \nwith some kind of a stimulus package that, indeed, could clear this \nSenate and that would be acceptable to the President of the United \nStates.\n  We indeed must move in that regard. I understand the Senate's \ncalendar contemplates that we move in that direction. Whether we can \nreach an accord or not is still another subject.\n  In my view, the United States is in a recession, a recession that \nstarted even before the September 11 attacks of terrorism on the United \nStates.\n  Industrial production figures through September were down for the \ntwelfth consecutive month. This is the longest decline in industrial \nproduction since World War II. Some of us have been talking about that \nfor quite some time. Economists in the United States have been back and \nforth, but clearly nobody has been giving high marks to the economy. \nWhether they want to call it a recession or not, clearly it is not in \nthe best of shape.\n  We must take action as soon as we can get ourselves together. Some \nmust lead in this institution so that we can do something anti-\nrecessionary that is significant in the short term and in the long run \ntake the right kind of steps.\n  The unemployment rate has risen from 4 percent at the end of last \nyear to 5.4 today, and it is rising. In October alone, we lost over \n415,000 jobs, the biggest percentage increase in joblessness in more \nthan 15 years. The Federal Reserve Board has cut short-term interest \nrates and the discount rates to the lowest level since 1961 and 1955, \nrespectively. Yet even with these low interest rates, most private \ncompanies are having a tough time getting credit--a very interesting \nphenomenon.\n  Commercial and industrial loans are down compared to last year. I \nbelieve it is going to take some time for our country and the world \neconomy to work on its current problems. Restoring lost confidence will \nplay a key role in the recovery. But working off the excess capacities \nthat built up during the boom period of the 1990s will also be \nimportant. We must also maintain the tools of fiscal discipline to \nconvey to the American public and the market that we are keeping an eye \nnot only on the current challenges we face but also on those longer \nterm challenges.\n  We must maintain the provisions of the Budget Act that provide us \nwith future discipline, and we must deal with both tax and spending \nlegislation today while waiving the Budget Act on a case-by-case basis. \nI believe that is what we are recommending when we recommend the vote \nthat the Senate should take this afternoon.\n  Later today we will be considering a bill called the Economic \nRecovery and Assistance for American Workers Act of 2001 which was \nreported from the Senate Finance Committee last week. The bill was \nreported on a partisan basis with no Republican support. It will be \nsubject to a Budget Act 60-vote point of order. But any Republican \nalternative will also be subject to this same supermajority vote.\n  These 60-vote points of order would go away if this resolution were \nto become law. But in an interesting way, with the Budget Act points of \norder in place and with an almost evenly divided Senate, we are forced \nto work on a bipartisan basis in order to achieve the 60 votes \nnecessary to enact proposals for spending increases or tax cuts. We all \nknow the only way we are going to produce real stimulus legislation \nthat addresses the economic slowdown is to work together as Republicans \nand Democrats. I hope we will do that.\n  We started off right after that ominous day working together, arm in \narm, hand in hand. In fact, the people of America looked at us and \nsaid: That is fantastic; we haven't seen much like that in a long time.\n\n  Now we need to get our argumentative and partisan nature out of the \nway in the next few days and get on to something that we must do for \nAmerica and for our people. We need a stimulus package. We need it \nbadly. We need to show the public we can do it together with our \nPresident as we did immediately after the acts of terrorism when we did \nthings that we didn't even believe we could do as we look back on them. \nSome of them were rather hurried. Some might not have been the right \nmedicine. But I think overall the confidence that came from it \njustified it. It served us well. It will pay significant homage to the \nSenate in a bipartisan way, as we acted in the public interest exactly \nat the right time. Let's do it one more time.\n  We are not going to approve the bill that came out of Finance. We \nboth understand that. If the Republicans have a Republican proposal \nthat doesn't seem as if it will pass, maybe out of those actions will \ncome something better--maybe something that will really work, and I \nhope it will. I hope I can be part of that. I am not on the committee \nthat is doing the work. Good luck to them. I hope they can get it done. \nIn the meantime, we ought to start thinking together about what might \ntake place with the proposals coming out of the committee in the event \nthe sequence that the chairman and I discussed this morning is going to \nhappen.\n  If that happens, we certainly cannot leave the floor and be angry at \neach other, saying: Too bad. We are mad at them and they are mad at us, \nand it doesn't matter what happens to America.\n  That can't be the case. We can't do that. I am very hopeful we will \nnot and that within the next 2 days out of this partisan approach will \ncome something much better--something bipartisan that will do the job.\n  I thank the chairman for making his remarks brief so I could make \nmine. I state to the Senators that I am not going to be here for the \nentire time. I will leave for a while and be available very shortly. \nThe chairman is aware of that. He understands that if anyone wants to \nbe heard on our side, they should come down and seek recognition. I am \nhere now saying to any Republican who wants time within our time limits \nthat they are allocated the time by me unless there is objection. If \nthere is none, that is what we will do on our side.\n  Madam President, thank you very much. I thank the chairman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico,\n\n[[Page S11668]]\n\nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee and the former chairman of \nthe Budget Committee for his remarks, and for his strong support in \nrejecting the resolution that would abandon fiscal discipline. I think \nthis is another example of our working together in a way that is \nabsolutely great for the country.\n  After the series of events on September 11, the House and Senate \nbudget committees and Senator Domenici and I joined with our House \ncolleagues. We met together to give an update to our colleagues on the \nfiscal condition of the country. We met with the head of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. We were able to give a report to our colleagues \non where we stand at the moment.\n  We also agreed on a set of principles to apply to a stimulus package. \nWe were able to do that on a bipartisan basis, and I might say without \na raised voice and without an angry word between us. We weren't in \nperfect agreement; certainly not. We compromised. But we did in the end \ncome together around a set of principles that we thought were \nimportant.\n  One of the reasons we thought it was important to come together was \nthat we believed our Nation needed a stimulus package. I think the \nevidence overwhelmingly proves that is the case.\n  This chart shows what has happened to economic growth from 1999 to \nthe most recent quarter. What has triggered our being here today are \nthese last two quarters where you can see that we are below 1-percent \ngrowth. We are at .3 percent in the quarter previous to the most recent \none. During the most recent one, we saw a negative growth in the \nNation's economy. That triggered the resolution that has brought us \nhere today. The Budget Act requires that when you have two quarters of \nlow growth, you then must consider in the Budget Committee and on the \nfloor these provisions to suspend all of the budget points of order--\nthose things that we use to maintain fiscal discipline.\n  All of the indices are telling us that the economy has hit a \ndifficult period. We can see what happened to civilian unemployment. We \ncan see back in 2000 that we were down at less than 4 percent--a \nremarkable period. In fact, we are at the lowest level of unemployment \nin this Nation in 30 years.\n  But look at what has happened since. Look at what has happened since \nthe events of September 11. Unemployment has risen dramatically, and is \nstill rising. The distinguished occupant of the chair knows this well. \nShe represents the State of Washington. One of the major employers \nthere is Boeing. Boeing has announced the layoffs of tens of thousands \nof their employees. That is through no fault of theirs. It is not \nthrough any inability to compete, but it is because hundreds of \ncontracts for airliners have been canceled by the airline \nindustry. Their loads have been reduced 30 to 50 percent. That is the \neconomic reality for one critical industry in this country; and it is \nvery serious business.\n\n  It is not just the airline industry. It is industry after industry \nthat is engaged in massive layoffs. I recently met with financial \nleaders in New York. They told me they are in the process or getting \nready to lay off 20 percent of their employees. These are major \nfinancial institutions in this country and in the world, and they are \ngetting ready to lay off massive numbers of their employees because of \nthe economic slowdown. Those numbers are not yet seen in this increase \nin unemployment that is already in evidence.\n  It does not end there because we also see consumer confidence has \nplunged. This chart shows consumer confidence--going back again to \n1999, and coming forward to the most recent data--has gone to the \nlowest level since February of 1994. So clearly, we are being \nvictimized by a very serious economic slowdown.\n  We know the economy was weakening before September 11, and that the \nattack on this country on that date further weakened our economy. And \nnow we see a very serious circumstance develop.\n  It is critically important that we respond with an economic stimulus \npackage. It is also critical, we believe, that we couple that with \nlong-term fiscal discipline. One part of maintaining long-term fiscal \ndiscipline is to maintain the structures in the law that help us to \nkeep in place fiscal discipline. And those are the very things that \nwould be thrown out if this resolution before us is adopted. But we \nhave no alternative but to consider it. Even though the Budget \nCommittee rejected it on a unanimous vote--a totally bipartisan vote--\nwe still understand that if we do not reject it here, it would go into \nplace if the House took similar action and it got to the President and \nhe signed it. I do not believe any of those things will happen. It is \nnot going to pass here. It would not pass in the House. The President \nwould not sign it because it would be a serious policy error.\n  I know some will say: Gee, why were these procedures put in law? Why \nis it a requirement that the Budget Committee take it up? Why is it a \nrequirement that it come to the floor under expedited procedures for a \nvote? The reasons for that are very simple. The concern was, if we got \ninto a serious economic downturn, that there might be a failure to act, \nthat we should not have any hurdles in the way of Congress acting.\n  That may not be such a bad thought under certain circumstances. We \nmight find ourselves someday in a situation in which we are being \nblocked from taking action that the majority of us thought was \nabsolutely necessary for the economy to recover. That is not the case \nnow.\n  We have seen already a stimulus package pass in the House of \nRepresentatives. Although some of us would strongly disagree with that \nstimulus package, we know we are going to be considering a stimulus \npackage on the floor of the Senate this afternoon. We also know we have \nalready taken bipartisan action to provide $40 billion of assistance to \nNew York and additional funding for defense and intelligence and the \nfunds and resources necessary to combat terrorism. So Congress has \ntaken rapid action, and has demonstrated the ability to act. Beyond \nthat, we also recognize that Congress has acted in terms of support for \nthe airline industry which has been so devastated by the events of \nSeptember 11 and the aftermath.\n\n  We know that Congress can act, that Congress is going to take the \nadditional steps necessary to give lift to the economy, but we also \nknow it needs to be in the framework of long-term fiscal discipline. \nSome of us believe--I certainly do--one of the worst things we could do \nis to take action on long-term changes in our funding and in our tax \nstructure to respond to an immediate downturn, that that could hurt \nthis country very substantially going forward.\n  We do not want to deepen the hole we already see developing. We can \nsee very clearly that this country faces a serious fiscal challenge \ngoing forward. We have already projected that we will be using \nliterally hundreds of billions of dollars of Social Security and \nMedicare trust fund money to pay for the other functions of Government. \nThat is a mistake. That is not a route we should go down, but that is \nwhere we are headed. And to abandon these fiscal disciplines, in the \nface of an already serious long-term fiscal problem, would be a very \nserious mistake.\n  So, Mr. President, and colleagues, I hope very much that when we vote \nat 5 o'clock this evening, that this body will follow the leadership of \nthe Budget Committee in rejecting the resolution that would eliminate \nall of these budget enforcement mechanisms.\n  Later on this afternoon we are going to consider the Senate version \nof a stimulus package. As I indicated, on a bipartisan basis, those of \nus who have the most responsibility for the budget aspects of what we \ndo here--the leaders of the House Budget Committee and the Senate \nBudget Committee--agreed, on a bipartisan basis, that we should have a \nstimulus package and we should give lift to the economy in the short \nterm when it is needed, but we should also couple that with long-term \nfiscal discipline so we do not go deeper into the trust funds of Social \nSecurity and Medicare, so we do not put upward pressure on interest \nrates that could undo all of the good that is attempted to be \naccomplished by a fiscal stimulus package.\n  With that, I, again, call on my colleagues to join us in defeating \nthis resolution that is required to be brought\n\n[[Page S11669]]\n\nbefore us by the Budget Act, that has already been rejected by an \noverwhelming bipartisan, unanimous vote in the Senate Budget Committee.\n  We will have the opportunity to consider that at 5 o'clock this \nevening. We hope our colleagues in the Senate will join us in a \ncommitment to long-term fiscal discipline.\n  (Mr. EDWARDS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I do not know what the time \nconstraints are for this debate, but I wish to briefly make a point or \ntwo. As a former member of the Budget Committee and someone who has \nfollowed Senator Conrad as the new Chair of the Budget Committee, I \nthink you have won a deserved reputation for the kind of fiscal \ndiscipline which has really helped this country so much in the last 10 \nyears.\n  We were able to finally break away from the old deficits in the \nnational debt, which was growing at an unprecedented rate. We saw, over \nthe last 8 or 9 years, an amazing convergence of fiscal discipline, \ncreating annual surpluses and a booming economy, two things which I \nthink the American people would applaud, in terms of economic policy, \nas the most important things we could achieve.\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota has been outspoken, as have \nmany of my colleagues, in opposition to some of the tax cuts that have \nbeen proposed. Although they are appealing to those who might receive \nthem, you have to take a look and see what they achieve for our economy \nand what they cost us in the long run.\n  If I understand the Senator from North Dakota in what he is saying \ntoday, it is that, as we try to move toward something that truly moves \nthe economy forward, we should not do it at the expense of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, the Medicare trust fund, or long-term deficits. We \ndo not want to see ourselves back into that deficit situation.\n  I will tell the Senator my concern, and then I will ask him for his \nresponse. The House stimulus plan, which gives over $25 billion to the \nbiggest corporations in America--one corporation, IBM, receiving $1.4 \nbillion in tax breaks--money that is clearly being given to this \ncorporation, not to build a plant or hire more people but simply as a \nreward for whatever--and then with the Senate Republican plan, which \ntries to provide additional tax cuts to the highest wage earners in \nAmerica--both of these plans will fail to stimulate the economy but \nwill drag us down in terms of future potential deficits.\n  I would like the Senator, if he could, to contrast what he thinks is \nthe most important effort we can make now to stimulate the economy \nwithout driving ourselves back down into deficit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, I thank the Senator for his question. As I \nindicated earlier, on a bipartisan basis the House budgeteers and \nSenate budgeteers agreed to a set of principles to apply to any \nstimulus package. We did that, and we did it without an angry word \nexchanged. I applied those principles to what the House package for \neconomic stimulus was. What we found was that it failed every one of \nthe tests we had agreed to apply.\n  We said the proposal should sunset within 1 year so that we didn't \ndig the fiscal hole deeper in the outyears. The House bill, \nunfortunately, fails that principle because 71 percent of its total \ncosts are permanent tax cuts--permanent tax cuts, not temporary \nmeasures--designed to lift the economy now, but permanent tax cuts.\n  Second, we said a substantial portion of the fiscal stimulus should \nbe out within 6 months. If you are going to give stimulus to the \neconomy, you need to do it quickly. In our history, we have found that \nevery time we have tried to use a fiscal stimulus to give a lift to the \neconomy, we have been too late. That is the history. So we said let's \nnot be too late this time, let's get the money out in the next 6 months \nwhen we know we face a problem. Unfortunately, looking at the House \npackage, 40 percent of the 10-year cost occurs after the first year. \nSo, unfortunately, it flunks that test.\n  Third, we said the size should be about $60 billion. The House bill \ncosts $160 billion over 10 years. And targeting--we said the stimulus \nshould go to those most likely to spend the dollars and those most \nvulnerable in an economic downturn. If you look at the House bill, 35 \npercent of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent; 35 percent goes \nto the wealthiest 1 percent. Now the problem with that is the \nwealthiest 1 percent are the least likely to spend the money. That is \nthe whole idea of stimulus--to give lift to the economy. Only 19 \npercent goes to the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers under the House \npackage. They are giving crumbs to those at the lower end of the \neconomic ladder, who are the very ones most likely to spend it.\n  Every economist who has come before us has said: Look, get money into \nthe hands of people and companies that will spend it. Don't do what the \nHouse did. Part of their package, as the Senator from Illinois \nreferenced, would write a $2 billion check to a major automobile \ncompany in America and $1.5 billion to another large industrial company \nin this country--not to hire people or to invest, but to just write \nthem a check.\n  Amazingly enough, so much of their package has nothing to do with the \ncurrent economic downturn. It has to do with writing checks to wealthy \ncompanies and wealthy individuals, and every economist we have talked \nto has said that can't be taken as a serious stimulus package.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator this question: When you \nput it in terms of what they actually do, when you say the Republican \napproach in the House and Senate favors large corporations and the \nwealthiest Americans, while the Democratic approach tries to provide a \nbenefit to working families, to those who have been recently \nunemployed, and to smaller businesses to deal with depreciation, \nclearly what emerges from this is a question of justice and fairness. \nWhy in the world would you reward a profitable corporation with over a \nbillion dollars in tax cuts when they don't even promise to create a \njob? Why would you send a massive amount of tax rebate to somebody \nmaking a million dollars a year when, clearly, they are not \nsacrificing, and then ignore those who are struggling?\n\n  That justice and fairness argument is one that we have heard on the \nfloor. I have made it myself. I think most people would react \npositively to it. We are talking about stimulating the economy, and a \nquestion that has to be asked and answered is: Regardless of to whom \nyou give the money, will you get the desired result? If you gave the \nmoney to the wealthiest corporations, whether it was fair or not, and \nAmerica's economy went flying forward, you would say it worked; \nconversely, if you gave it to those who were recently unemployed, \nwhether it was fair or not, and the economy moved forward, you would \nsay it worked.\n  Let me ask about the economic effectiveness of the approach of the \nRepublicans versus the approach of the Democrats when it comes to \nstimulating the economy.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I don't think there can really be any question about \nwhich approach is going to be more effective from an economic \nstandpoint. What virtually every economist who has come before the \nFinance Committee and the Budget Committee has told us is the \nfollowing: No. 1, you need to get the money out there into the hands of \npeople and companies quickly so that it gets spent. That is what will \nstimulate the economy. So to the extent you are getting money into the \nhands of people who are the most likely to spend it and companies that \nare the most likely to spend it, you are getting the job done, you are \nstimulating the economy.\n  So with respect to individuals, it doesn't make much sense to give \nthe lion's share of the tax cut to the wealthiest because they are the \nleast likely to spend it. Therefore, they are the least likely to \nstimulate the economy. With respect to companies, it doesn't make much \nsense to write billion-dollar checks to companies that are already \nprofitable because, again, they are the least likely to spend the money \nthat will stimulate the economy.\n  Unfortunately, that is what the House Republican package does, as I \nhave indicated, overwhelmingly. Beyond that, they also suffer from the \nsecond part of the equation. The first part of the equation is to \nstimulate the\n\n[[Page S11670]]\n\neconomy in the short term, give it a boost, a lift. The test is getting \nmoney into the hands of individuals and companies quickly who will \nspend the money. That is the economic test.\n  On the longer term question, every economist, including Chairman \nGreenspan and former Secretary Rubin, has told us: But you have to \ncouple that with long-term fiscal discipline. You have to demonstrate \nto the markets that you are not going to just go out and spend money \nand undermine the tax base and make our long-term fiscal condition \nworse, because that will put upward pressure on interest rates and you \nwill undo all of the good you are trying to accomplish with a short-\nterm fiscal stimulus. If you abandon fiscal discipline for the long \nterm, that has the effect of raising interest rates; that has the \neffect of smothering the economy.\n  So we have to be smart about this, and we have to adopt two \nprinciples: One, yes, stimulate the economy in the short term, but, \ntwo, couple it with long-term fiscal discipline so we don't put upward \npressure on interest rates and don't undo what we are trying to \naccomplish.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield on this \nquestion as well: We have focused our discussion this morning on the \nquestion of tax policy and the impact of tax cuts on the people or \ncompanies that receive them. I want to ask the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee to reflect for a moment on the difference between tax cuts \nand spending programs at this moment in our economy.\n  One of my colleagues noted that last night on the television they had \nthe scroll that went across the screen and it said the difference \nbetween the economic stimulus package is that the Republicans are for \ntax cuts and the Democrats are for spending. That certainly doesn't \nexpress the contents or the direction of our own stimulus package, \nwhich includes tax cuts for working families as well as spending.\n  Could the Senator reflect on the effectiveness of spending contrasted \nto tax cuts when it comes to stimulating the economy? What value is \nthere to providing a tax break of $1.4 billion for a major corporation, \nas opposed to saying we are going to take $1.4 billion and invest it in \nAmerica? As a contrast, President Bush has proposed that to deal with \nbioterrorism we should give to State and local public health agencies \nnationwide $300 million.\n  That is supposed to respond to our concerns about bioterrorism. I \nthink that is woefully inadequate.\n  Interestingly enough, the House Republican stimulus package gives \n$1.4 billion, almost five times as much, to one corporation, with no \npromise they will do anything in return.\n  So will the Senator from North Dakota comment on the use of spending \nfor such things as school modernization, improving law enforcement at \nairports, protecting our infrastructure, and investing in public health \nto deal with bioterrorism as an economic stimulus?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to. We had a hearing on this before the Senate \nBudget Committee. We had very distinguished economists from both sides \ncome and give their testimony. It is very clear, both tax cuts and \nspending can be stimulative.\n  The first test is: Do they get out in time to be stimulative? That \ntest applies to spending and to tax cuts. The first test is: Do they \nget out in time to give lift to the economy when it is weak, No. 1?\n  No. 2, the question is: Do they go to companies and individuals who \nwill spend the money or invest the money? Because if people save the \nmoney, that is not stimulative to the economy in the near term. So that \nis critically important.\n  This is not a question of tax cuts versus spending. Our proposal on \nthe Democratic side has a combination of tax cuts and spending, but \nthey are designed to meet both principles, No. 1, that it gets out \nquickly and, No. 2, that it goes to companies and individuals who will \nactually spend or invest the money to stimulate the economy.\n  With respect to tax cuts on the Democratic side, the package of tax \ncuts we have endorsed include the following: bonus depreciation. Now, \nwhy are we doing that? Why are we giving a bonus if one buys capital \ngoods now? If a company makes an investment now to buy equipment, why \ndo we give them a bonus on the depreciation? The reason is, all of the \neconomists who came before us said behavior has to be changed. People \nwho are not buying now have to buy. One way to do that is to give bonus \ndepreciation. Actually, that provision is common in the two approaches, \nthe Republican approach and the Democratic approach.\n  No. 2, we provide for what we call net operating loss carrybacks so a \ncompany that has been hard hit by the events of September 11 and has \nlosses now but had income in previous years can take back the losses \nnow and get a refund against earnings in previous years. That is a \nprovision that is common between the two sides.\n  The third provision we have is to increase expensing for small \nbusinesses. Small businesses that now expense can write off $25,000 \nworth of purchases a year. We increase that to $35,000. Again, that is \na provision common to us both.\n  The fourth tax cut that is in our plan is to provide rebates to those \nwho were left out of the last round. People who pay payroll taxes but \nnot income taxes, they were left out. They did not get anything last \ntime. They are, by the way, the very people most likely to spend the \nmoney to actually stimulate the economy.\n  So those are provisions that are in our bill, that are in the \nRepublican bill as well, with some differences, because both of us \nrecognize those are stimulative.\n  In addition, we have some spending provisions on homeland security \nissues. What we are talking about with respect to homeland security is \nstrengthening security at airports, strengthening security at harbors, \nimproving local law enforcement. Those are things the economists have \ntold us may give a double hit. That is, not only will the spending be \nstimulative but if people are given a greater sense of security and, in \nfact, improve their security, that will also help the economy, because \none thing we are suffering from now is a lack of confidence, a \nreduction in consumer confidence.\n\n  Frankly, people do not feel safe. That is inhibiting air travel. That \nis inhibiting economic activity. So to the extent we have spending, \nthat stimulates the economy because it is moving into businesses and \nbuying goods and services from them but it also gives people a greater \nsense of security that may be the most stimulative part of the package \naccording to economists who came before the Senate Budget Committee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from North Dakota in asking \nanother question, it seems the point he made is critical, and that was \nreflected in a piece that appeared in the Washington Post over the \nweekend by Joseph Stiglitz, in which he talked about the impact of \nanxiety on the economy. At one point he said, ``Anxiety impedes \ninvestment.'' Certainly we know that anxiety breeds pessimism. So what \nwe are trying to do in the economic stimulus package, from the \nDemocratic side, as has been described by the Senator from North \nDakota, is to provide tax cuts and tax rebates to the people who can \nuse them, who will spend them for the things they need to survive, as \nopposed to the Republican approach in the House, which is to give tax \ncuts to corporations with no strings attached, over a billion dollars \nthat might not result in a single new job, perhaps more dividends for \nthe shareholders but no guarantee of a single new job.\n  So the tax cuts we are for are focused on the people who will spend \nthem effectively to get the economy moving, and then the spending part \nof our proposal is focusing on homeland security, issues that genuinely \nconcern people, whether we are talking about bioterrorism and making \ncertain we have a response to it or improving and enhancing law \nenforcement so wherever we might go there will be an adequate response.\n  Yesterday I was in New York City when the plane crashed. At that \npoint, they closed everything. They closed down the airports. Many of \nus changed our plans and rushed over to Penn Station to get the Amtrak \ntrain back to Washington. Trains were so crowded many of us had to \nstand the whole way. It was an indication people were concerned, and \nthey responded to that anxiety by changing their habits. Instead of \ntaking the airplane, they came to Amtrak. That sort of thing is \nhappening across America in ways large and small.\n\n[[Page S11671]]\n\n  Is it the belief of the Senator from North Dakota that in putting \ninvestments in this homeland security we are not only stimulating the \neconomy by putting people to work to do the things to improve aviation \nsecurity but we are also trying to build confidence back in this \neconomy which has been shaken not only by bad economic news but by the \nnews since September 11?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Precisely. I do not know what could be more clear. There \nare some on the other side who will stand up and decry spending. I did \nnot hear them decrying spending to increase our military preparedness. \nI think we are all joined as one, understanding we have to strengthen \nour military to respond to what is happening. But it is not our \nuniformed military that is on the front lines of response to this \ncrisis. It is also our firefighters and our policemen and all local law \nenforcement, and those elements of this fight against terrorism need to \nbe buttressed.\n  Does anybody doubt we need to add money to fight bioterrorism? Does \nanybody really believe we are prepared to do all of the things \nnecessary to cope with bioterrorism? I do not believe there is a single \nMember who can possibly believe we do not need to spend more money to \nprotect ourselves against anthrax and smallpox and all the other things \nthat could be used as weapons against this Nation.\n  Now, that happens to give a double hit. Not only is that spending \nstimulative to the economy because it buys goods and services; it also \nprovides people greater protection, and we need to do that. We need to \nstrengthen national defense. We need to strengthen law enforcement. We \nneed to strengthen our ability to wage war against those who would \nengage in terrorist attacks against us.\n  Yes, that is spending but it is spending for a purpose, and it is an \nimportant purpose.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from North Dakota, the manager of this \nbill, yield for one question? I will be brief. The Senator has about 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have heard the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator \nfrom Illinois speaking about security and how people feel. I think \nsomething that would not cost any money but would be good for the \neconomy is do something about airline security, which has been floating \naround now for more than a month. We had the terrible incident \nSeptember 11, with over 6,000 people killed. We had this terrible \naccident.\n\n  This bill is being held up because they don't want people to have the \nsame protection as the firemen and police who lost their lives in New \nYork protecting innocent people.\n  Do you think it would create economic security if we had airline \nsecurity?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, I don't know what could be more clear. What some \nare endorsing is a continuation of the policy that failed \ncatastrophically on September 11. Some would say that system is good \nenough; stay with the status quo and have some of these same private \ncontractors, who have failed abysmally, continue.\n  We saw an incident with one of the companies in Chicago where a guy \ngot on board with seven knives and a stun gun. That system is not \nworking. I don't know what could be more clear. We need tighter airport \nsecurity. That costs money, but it is an expenditure that we need to \nmake. Yes, it will stimulate the economy. More than that, it will \nprovide greater security to the American people.\n  As chairman of the Budget Committee, I have had many people come to \nme with things that need to be done to strengthen local law \nenforcement, strengthen our national defense, strengthen protection of \nour borders through the Border Patrol. Those need to be done. We need \nto do a better job of policing those who come into our country with \nvisas. Right now people come and say they will go to school and nobody \nchecks to see if they showed up at school.\n  One terrorist who engaged in the attack on September 11 was scheduled \nto go to a school and never showed up. We have no system for tracking \nto find out if somebody doesn't show up, why they didn't show up. That \ncosts money. That also will strengthen the security of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think we are all unhappy with airport security. Despite \nall of its failings, the private security company and the private \nairline did catch the guy; and then Government employees came, law \nenforcement officials, and let him go. We had to go back, find him, and \narrest him.\n  Eight people were fired on the spot as a result of the mistake. If \nthey had been civil servants, they could never have been fired.\n  The debate is whether we are basically going to add a political rider \non airport security. The political rider is to force the President to \nuse Government employees alone. It seems to me that is a political \nagenda, and it is not a safety agenda. We ought to give the President \nflexibility. Where Government employees work, use them. Set Federal \nstandards and enforce them. Where private contractors work, and work \nbetter, use them.\n  We have heard all the talk about the Republicans in the House who \nhave this strange idea that if we provide lower taxes, it will induce \npeople to work, save, and invest. All this talk about it being \ndistinctly inferior to the Democrat Senate bill which provides \nsubsidies to watermelon production, bison meat, distilling rum in \nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, new subsidies for tobacco, and tax \ncuts for people who don't pay taxes. I guess beauty is in the eye of \nthe beholder. It is up to the American people to decide what makes good \neconomic sense and what doesn't make good economic sense.\n  We will have an opportunity later today or tomorrow to debate this \nissue. I do not believe the American people are going to buy this grab \nbag of spending as a stimulus package. It is always interesting to me, \nhaving watched this whole process now going on 24 years, that every \ntime something new happens, everybody in politics goes back and takes \nall the old, tired, rejected ideas they ever had and dresses them in \nnew clothing. The new opportunity now is stimulus. All the old ideas \nthat never passed the laugh test in the past now have come forward as \npart of the stimulus package.\n  I hope we will get serious. I hope we will write a bipartisan bill. I \ncertainly intend to support that.\n  I didn't come over to talk about those things today. I came to talk \nabout the resolution before the Senate. Under the old Gramm-Rudman law, \none of the compromises in getting it adopted was a triggering mechanism \nwhere, if you had low economic growth or a projection of low economic \ngrowth, there was an opportunity for Congress to opt out of binding \nrestraints on deficit spending. I am pleased we are deciding through \nthe recommendation of the Budget Committee not to opt out of those \nbinding constraints. I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member \nfor their support to vote no on the resolution. I will certainly vote \nno on it.\n  However, this is largely symbolic. We are in one of the great \nspending sprees in American history. Since September 11, we have had a \ndramatic swing from a commitment to balance the budget and reduce debt \nand save Social Security to ``anything goes'' in the way of spending.\n  Obviously, we were all affected by September 11. I don't think there \nis any opposition anywhere to doing what we need to do to hunt down and \nkill these terrorists and to try to help people who were hurt by the \nterrorists and whose lives have been diminished, wrecked, or lost as a \nresult. However, nobody can claim all of the add-on spending has \nanything to do with terrorism. What we are going to have to decide \npretty quickly is if we have completely given up our commitment to \nbalancing the Federal budget and paying down debt. The only way we can \nshow that is not through some resolution which, again, I applaud. I \ncertainly would be unhappy if we were supporting the waiving of these \nold budget restrictions which represent the only protection we have \nagainst deficit spending, but I would have to say we are now in a \nsituation where appropriators in both parties--it is almost as if we \nhave three political parties: Republicans, Democrats, and \nappropriators--are saying even though the President believes he can \ncomplete the year with the $40 billion we have given him to\n\n[[Page S11672]]\n\ndeal with September 11, we are going to force him to take all this \nmoney.\n\n  The President has said after the first of the year, if it becomes \nclear he needs more money, he will come back and ask for it and--what I \nthink is even better--tell us what he wants it for. There seems now to \nbe a mad rush to force-feed the President into spending money.\n  I hope, first of all, we will reject the resolution today, disapprove \nit, and when we vote on all this new spending, we will remember the \ngesture we made today, and when a point of order is raised against this \nnew spending, as it will be, we will sustain that point of order.\n  Finally, simply drifting back and not getting into debate with the \nvery able chairman of the Budget Committee, it is clear the stimulus \npackage that passed the Finance Committee can't pass on the floor of \nthe Senate. I don't believe it has 51 votes, but it certainly does not \nhave 60. I simply urge the majority leader and the minority leader to \nsit down together and see if we can work out a compromise. We are \nheading toward Thanksgiving and Christmas. We need to do a stimulus \npackage if one can be put together that helps the economy. In all \nhonesty, I do not believe the stimulus package that passed the Finance \nCommittee would help the economy. My guess is it would probably be \nharmful. So if that were the only choice, I would simply vote no. But I \ndon't think it is the only choice. I think we can put together a \ncompromise. If we can do that, I suggest we get on with it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Texas for \nhis support of the position on the low-growth suspension of the budget \npoints of order. He is a respected member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, and he joined us in our recommendation to our colleagues \nthat we disapprove the resolution that would abandon the provisions \nthat help us maintain fiscal discipline. I thank him very much for \nthat.\n  When the Senator says we have been on a spending binge--if we have, \nhe has been part of it. I have gone back and looked at the votes. On \nthe emergency supplemental appropriations bill that provided $40 \nbillion to respond to the attacks on this country, that vote was \nunanimous. The Senator from Texas joined on that vote to support $40 \nbillion to respond to the attacks and help rebuild and repair those \nthings destroyed. On the air transportation safety and system \nstabilization to rescue the airline industry that was faced with \nimminent collapse, the Senator from Texas voted for that, too. Those \nare the only two things we have passed that are over and above what was \nagreed to by Republicans and Democrats with respect to the spending \nprovisions for this year.\n  So when he says we are on a spending binge, let's get this straight. \nEvery Member, with the exception of one in this entire body, voted for \nthe spending we have done in response to the sneak attack on the United \nStates--every single Member, with the exception of one. That one was \nnot the Senator from Texas.\n  Let me also indicate, in the Senate provision, the stimulus package \nthe Senate has put forward that we will be considering this afternoon, \n$5.5 billion of that $67 billion package is for agricultural economic \nemergencies. The Senator from Texas ridiculed some of them. They are \neasy to ridicule. The Washington Post over the weekend, on Sunday, in a \ncolumn of theirs, ridiculed one of the provisions of which I am a prime \nmover and a prime supporter. I take this moment to explain what that \nprovision is about and let people judge for themselves: Does it have \nmerit or doesn't it? I believe it does.\n  Out of a $67 billion package, there are some $200 million for \ncommodity purchases, the purchase of commodities for school lunch \nprograms and for other feeding programs. This is typically what we do \nin a stimulus package. At a time of economic downturn, more people \ncan't feed themselves, they can't feed their families, so we typically \nbuy commodities to strengthen the feeding programs we have in this \ncountry. That is a compassionate thing to do. That is the right thing \nto do. It should not be ridiculed by a Senator or the Washington Post \nor anybody else. It is the right thing to do.\n  Let's talk about this provision for the purchase of bison, buffalo--\nwhatever people are calling them. In this commodity program, to buy \n$200 million of commodities, there is $10 million to buy bison. Why? \nNo. 1, it is probably the most nutritious meat anybody can eat because \nit is low in fat, high in protein, and it goes very well in our feeding \nprograms--$10 million. But it has an added benefit because the bison \nindustry is flat on its back. It is about to go broke. That will \njeopardize thousands of families who are dependent on the bison \nindustry to strengthen their agricultural operations.\n  I know it is so easy to ridicule these provisions. The Washington \nPost regularly ridicules anything for farmers because all they can see \nis that in every farm program there are some who are wealthy people who \nbenefit. I agree with them, that is wrong. I wish we had much stricter \npayment limitations. I introduced a bill with the most strict payment \nlimitations anybody has ever introduced, but it did not pass. And they \nare focusing on the exception rather than the rule.\n\n  If they would go to my State, they would find--are there some abuses? \nYes. Are there some wealthy people who get farm program benefits? Yes. \nI wish it didn't happen. But do you know what else they would find? The \nvast majority of farm families in my State are struggling, they are in \ndeep trouble. Farm prices in real terms are the lowest they have been \nin 50 years. More than that, in the last month the prices farmers \nreceived went down 9.5 percent, the biggest 1-month drop since they \nstarted keeping records 91 years ago.\n  There is a crisis in agriculture. There is a crisis in rural America. \nFarm families are going under by the thousands. If we do not act and we \ndo not respond, it will get much worse. They can ridicule all they want \nand go to their cocktail parties here in Washington and believe they \nreally have the moral high ground because they ridiculed spending for \nfeeding programs for people who are hungry and to support hard-working \nfarm families who are on the brink of going under, they can feel smart \nand smug--go ahead. They are wrong. They are not being very thoughtful.\n  To suggest somehow this was related to lobbyists--that was the \nessence of the story in the Washington Post, that lobbyists are writing \nthis stimulus bill. I agree with them with respect to a lot of what I \nsee in the House stimulus bill. That has been well lobbied. But $10 \nmillion to buy food for our feeding programs from farmers who are going \nunder? I have not seen a single lobbyist in this town working for the \nbison industry. I have not seen one. Not one has come to me--not one. \nThere is no bison industry pact of which I am aware.\n  When people get smart and smug and ridicule--it is easy to ridicule, \nreally easy. But I don't think it is very smart and I don't think it is \nvery compassionate to ridicule putting money into an economic stimulus \npackage to buy commodities to help hungry people and to help farm \nfamilies who are going under. I don't see that as very smart, and I \ndon't see that as very compassionate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, time will be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me go back to what this larger \ndiscussion is about and the resolution that is before us.\n  When we are faced with two consecutive quarters of growth below 1 \npercent, the Budget Act then requires that the Senate Budget Committee \nconsider a resolution which would eliminate all of the budget \nprotections--all those things we use to maintain fiscal discipline. \nThat has happened. The last two quarters have been below 1-percent \ngrowth. So we have before us the resolution to eliminate the budget \nprotections.\n  The Senate Budget Committee met and on a bipartisan basis rejected \nthe notion of abandoning all of our budget protections--those \napproaches we use to maintain fiscal discipline. We rejected it and \nsent what is called the\n\n[[Page S11673]]\n\nresolution of disapproval to the Senate by a vote of 22-0.\n  Now the Senate has to vote because there are expedited procedures \nthat bring these provisions to the floor. We will vote at 5 o'clock. \nThe vote will be: Do we set aside the budget points of order that allow \nus to maintain fiscal discipline? Do we set those aside for the next 2 \nyears? The Budget Committee has said no. I hope the Senate in a \nresounding way says no this afternoon at 5 o'clock. That is what we \nhave done in the past.\n  In 1991, when we had a similar circumstance, the Senate Budget \nCommittee rejected the idea and reported unfavorably abandoning fiscal \ndiscipline 21-0. The Senate vote was 97-2 against giving up those \nbudget points of order and those protections for fiscal discipline.\n  Later that year, a second low-growth resolution came before the \nSenate Budget Committee. It was rejected 21-0. The Senate rejected it \n92-5.\n  In September, again, there was a low-growth resolution. The Senate \nBudget Committee rejected abandoning fiscal discipline on a vote of 19-\n2. The Senate rejected it on a vote of 88-8.\n  Once again, because the economy has been growing at less than 1 \npercent, this automatic resolution has come before the Budget Committee \nand has come before the Senate. The question is, Do we eliminate all of \nthose budget points of order that help us to maintain fiscal \ndiscipline? The Senate Budget Committee has acted saying no on a vote \nof 22-0. They voted out a disapproval resolution. Now the full Senate \nis going to have its chance to register its opinion at 5 o'clock this \nevening.\n  I hope that we reject it unanimously and send a clear message to the \ncountry and to the market that we intend at the same time we provide \nfiscal stimulus and a short-term lift for this economy to also maintain \nlong-term fiscal discipline and the integrity of our trust funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I compliment our chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for the leadership he has given us and how steadfast he has \nbeen to be conservative in his outlook and his projections on what we \nshould do with the projected budgetary surplus. It was the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, our chairman, who kept saying earlier this year: Watch \nout. These budget projections are too rosy. The budget, as projected \nover the next 10 years, is going to be considerably less.\n  Isn't it astounding that before September 11 the debate was over the \nuse of the surplus and whether to pay down or pay off the national debt \nover a 10-year period. Now we find ourselves in a shrunken surplus with \na wartime condition.\n  I also extend my compliments to the ranking member, our dear friend, \nthe Senator from New Mexico.\n  The point I want to make is how quickly the landscape shifts--that \nbefore September 11, if the Senate had taken the advice of the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, what we would have done would have been very \nconservative in our approach as to how we were going to use the \nprojected surplus. We wouldn't have frittered a lot of it away.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, that surplus was \nvery likely to, if not disappear, be reduced. With the events of \nSeptember 11, which put us on a wartime footing with new expenditures \nwe had not planned on, combined with the diminished surplus--we were \nplanning back in the summer to use the surplus to pay off the national \ndebt. That is not even in the cards. Indeed, what is happening is the \nsurplus that is left--the surplus in the Social Security trust fund--is \ngoing to be used up for other things to the point that we are facing \nthe prospects of deficit financing, which is spending more than we have \ncoming in in tax revenue in any one given year. That, of course, adds \nto the national debt.\n  How sad it is that we did not take the advice of the chairman and be \nconservative in the way that we were going to plan our spending and our \ntax cuts for the next decade so that we would have a greater cushion \nwhen the emergency came, as surely as it was going to come, only it \ncame sooner than we thought; it came on September 11.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership and for his knowledge about \nwhat this Nation is facing fiscally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Florida, who is a very valued \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee and also throughout his career \nhas been dedicated to fiscal discipline.\n  We did make some mistakes earlier this year, unfortunately, \ncollectively, in going too far, I believe, on the tax cut package in \nthe face of a very optimistic set of forecasts but a set of forecasts \nover a 10-year period that I think almost anybody could have \nanticipated was unlikely to ever come true. We tried to warn our \ncolleagues repeatedly that it was unlikely to come true; that you could \nnot trust a 10-year forecast, that it was filled with risks, that it \nwas filled with uncertainty, and we ought to be cautious.\n  Unfortunately, caution was thrown to the wind, and as a result we now \nface a circumstance where we will have budget deficits in this fiscal \nyear, and perhaps for several years thereafter, and for the next 10 \nyears we will see all of the Medicare trust fund money being used to \nfund the other operations of Government and a very substantial portion \nof the Social Security trust fund being used to fund the other \noperations of Government. That should not be done. That is a mistake.\n  We will regret it when the baby boomers start retiring in 10 years \nbecause, unfortunately, we had a budget in place before September 11 \nthat did not add up, and now it is even further off in the red because \nof the tragic events of September 11 and the aftermath.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I would like to address the \nSenate on another subject in addition to the budget.

Madam President, I call to the Senate's \nattention the fact that the travel and tourism industry is a most \nimportant industry to all of our States but especially to 30 of our \nStates. The travel and tourism industry is one of the top three \nindustries in those States. As a result, we see that the reluctance of \npeople to travel, particularly on airliners, is having a devastating \neconomic effect upon areas of the country that are magnets for travel \nand tourism.\n  Clearly, two such areas are in my State: Orlando, which is the No. 1 \ntourist destination in the world, and Miami, a central hub of travel \nand tourism throughout the Americas and of a huge cruise ship business \nto which passengers come by airliner. But you can look at other cities \nin the country--Atlanta, New York, Las Vegas--you could go to any \nnumber of the cities where travel and tourism is a major economic \ncomponent, and they are devastated.\n  For example, in Orlando it is very interesting; you see the dramatic \neffects of people afraid to be on airplanes and thus the reduced \nairliner traffic. You can go into downtown Orlando, in hotels that are \nmore accommodating to business travel, and you will find that they are \ndoing fairly well. But if you go out on International Drive, outside of \nOrlando, toward the tourist destinations, you will find hotels that \nhave less than 50-percent occupancy.\n\n  Indeed, I talked to the owner of one hotel--it is a hotel with 800 \nrooms--and\n\n[[Page S11674]]\n\nthey have closed up 600 of the 800 rooms. It does not take too long to \nunderstand, with that kind of reduced revenue, suddenly, the owners of \nthose hotels are not going to be able to pay their mortgages, their \ntaxes.\n  Look at the devastating effects upon employment in the areas where \nthey have laid off so many workers because they do not have the traffic \nto support all of the employees, and you see how that diminished \neconomic activity ripples through the economy and starts to devastate \nnot only a community but devastates a State. And when you look at the \nreduction in the sales tax in so many of our States, and the crisis \nState governments are now facing in their budgets, indeed, you see that \nit starts to economically devastate the Nation.\n  Why am I saying all this? I am saying it because we have something we \ncan do about it in this Chamber and in the other Chamber at the other \nend of the Capitol, because we have in front of us a bill for \nestablishing airline security, with all of these items on which we have \ngenerally gotten consensus such as sky marshals, such as reinforced \ncockpit doors, such as hijack training for airline employees. But we \ncome to this difference of opinion on the screeners, the airport \nsecurity personnel: Should they be privately contracted or should they \nbe federalized law enforcement officers?\n  The reason I rise to make these remarks is because I just heard a \nriveting story by Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. On a flight \ninbound to Reagan National Airport last night, a passenger, perhaps \nintoxicated, stood up and started walking toward the cockpit.\n  Now, mind you, the FAA has a regulation that for the last 30 minutes \nof a flight inbound into Reagan National Airport every passenger must \nremain seated. It is for the obvious reasons, with Reagan National \nAirport being so close to the centers of Government--10 seconds from \nthe Pentagon, 20 seconds from the White House, and 30 seconds of a \ndiverted flight path to the U.S. Capitol--that this was one of the \nsafety precautions the FAA required on inbound and outbound aircraft at \nReagan National Airport.\n  As relayed by Senator Stabenow, they were inbound, and suddenly this \nrather large gentleman got up and started walking toward the cockpit. \nWhat she shared with us was, she was so proud of the professionalism \nthat then occurred, with two sky marshals sitting in first class who \nimmediately got up, without any fuss, and got this passenger on to the \nfloor. Apparently, there was a third Federal law enforcement officer on \nthe plane as well, toward the back of the plane. Everyone was \ninstructed to get their heads down, that they were diverting \nimmediately to Dulles Airport.\n  The plane landed safely. All of the law enforcement personnel came \nout to the plane. It was handled very professionally. It was handled \nvery safely.\n  I tell you this riveting story, just told to me by Senator Stabenow, \nto make the point that the American public desperately wants to feel \nsafe when they get on an airplane. They want to know that the most \nhighly qualified, highly trained personnel are the ones who are not \nonly on that aircraft, as was just demonstrated by the sky marshals' \nprofessional behavior, but they want to know that the most highly \ntrained, qualified law enforcement personnel are the ones who are doing \nlaw enforcement checks of the hand-carried baggage and the profiling to \ntry to avoid any kind of incidents in the future that would jeopardize \nthe safety of the American flying public.\n  Now, it just seems to me that with so much at stake, not only for the \nsafety of people in airplanes but for the economic engine of this \ncountry, which is being so devastatingly affected in places such as my \nState and 30 other States where travel and tourism are one of the top \nthree industries, it would seem to me that we ought to be able to have \na meeting of the minds, enact this legislation, and get it to the \nPresident, who has said he will sign what the Congress produces, and \nget on about restoring the confidence of the American public in the \nsafety of flying.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I commend my colleague from Florida for a \nvery excellent statement regarding airport security. As many colleagues \nhere, over the weekend, I, too, traveled and met with some airport \nadministrators and officials. Regardless of where you are in the \ncountry, the message is the same. These are people who don't \nparticularly wear any labels of Democrat or Republican, Conservative or \nLiberal, whatever those labels may mean to some, but to most Americans \nout there, the issue of being more secure on something as fundamental \nas air travel is basic.\n  They don't understand why the Republican House leadership has refused \nto join the 100 Members of this body and the overwhelming majority of \npeople involved in the airline industry in getting federalization of \nthese workers and making airports as secure as possible.\n  I served in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic and many people \nwere going back home there on that flight yesterday. One young man \nserved in the Navy, and he just received his leave and was going back \nto visit his parents from the Dominican Republic. Another woman who \nescaped the World Trade Center tragedy lost her life on the flight \nyesterday.\n  Obviously, we don't make any equation of terrorist acts to what \nhappened yesterday upon the preliminary information. But it heightens \nthe security that people want to have in air travel. We call, again \ntoday, on the Republican leadership in the House to change their minds \nand adopt the bill embraced to this body 100-0 and offer the public the \nsecurity they deserve.\n  The Senator from Florida made an excellent point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11674-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11674-S11675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I want to take a minute and talk about the \nmatter before the Senate, which is the economic recovery package, the \nstimulus package. I say to my colleagues here, and to others, that, \nagain, this is one where the President --I know he is meeting with \nPresident Putin, and the subject matter is obviously the war against \nterrorism in central Asia. But it is also going to be very important in \nthe prosecution of that war that we convey to the American public our \ndeep concern about the present condition of our economy, and that there \nis clearly a recession.\n  The unemployment numbers are getting worse. Last month we had the \nhighest increase in unemployment in 20 years. There is every indication \nthat this economic downturn will be with us for some time. We have seen \na staggering number of people lose their jobs, particularly at the \nlower end of the economic spectrum. I hope the President will be asking \nus to extend unemployment benefits for these people who have lost their \njobs. First of all, it is a wonderful way to provide some stimulation \nbecause these are dollars that must be spent. The people on \nunemployment don't have the luxury, having lost their jobs, of opening \nup a savings account. They are trying to provide for their needs on a \ndaily basis. Those extended unemployment benefits are dollars that end \nup in the marketplace. If demand is one of the issues --and I believe \nit is, based on the economists who have shared their thoughts with us--\nthen clearly those who would receive these unemployment benefits are \ngoing to contribute to stimulating the economy.\n  Providing health care benefits--again, none of us subscribes to the \nnotion that people who are unemployed or lose their jobs are anywhere \nnear as much a victim as those victims on September 11, at the World \nTrade Center, or the Pentagon, or aboard that airplane in Pennsylvania. \nBut they are all victims.\n\n  We know that what happened on September 11 contributed to the \neconomic difficulties that existed on September 10. We know, for \ninstance, that airline travel is down some 20, 30 percent. We know, as \na result of that, the hotel industry and the restaurant industry--\nwhich, by the way, are the largest employers in America; some 17 \nmillion people work in the service industries these are the ones who \nhave been hit immediately. And the people who set tables, who wash \ndishes, wait on tables, who clean hotel rooms, who work in\n\n[[Page S11675]]\n\nsome of the more difficult and lower paying jobs in the country have \nlost their work. These are family members, heads of families, and they \nare out there wondering whether or not the next job is going to be \navailable for them. So they are, in a sense, victims because, clearly, \nthe events of September 11 have impacted their lives.\n  Many of us are suggesting as part of this economic package that we \ninclude extending unemployment benefits and health care, and we say to \nthose people and their families that we wish we could provide you with \na job tomorrow. We can't. We wish we could produce one for you \nimmediately. We can't do that. But we can reach out to you and say \nduring the next number of weeks we are going to provide extended \nunemployment benefits to you and see to it that States get back some \ndollars from Medicaid and the COBRA program, so you can have health \ncare coverage during this time of difficulty. I don't think that is an \nexaggerated or excessive request. I hoped, frankly, that the request \nwould be made of us to do this, rather than we making a request of the \nPresident and others to support this.\n  This is America. We are coming together as a people. Everybody who is \nhurt and has suffered as a result of these tragic events deserves an \nextended hand to try to see if we can't lift them up.\n  I was so impressed yesterday while watching the film clips of the \npeople in New York. Average citizens were racing to help the firemen, \nhelping to extend the hoses to try to put out the fires in the \ncommunities that were devastated by the downed aircraft. What a \nwonderful photograph, in a sense, during a time of tragedy. Average \ncitizens--not firemen or policemen but people in civilian clothes--were \nrunning along the streets, grabbing firehoses and helping the \ndepartments reach the flames to try to save lives and property. That is \nmy America. That is the America I know.\n  I want to see my Congress and my national leadership be as those \npeople in the streets of Queens yesterday who were racing along to help \nout during a time of tragedy. That is what this economic package we \nhave crafted tries to do. It is short term, it is focused, it is \nfiscally responsible, and it tries to help people who are suffering. \nThat is all we are trying to do--give a tax rebate, a tax cut for the \nfolks who didn't get it last spring so they might have additional \ndollars in their pockets to provide for family needs, and to see to it \nthat we might invest some dollars as well in hardening up our \ninfrastructure in the country.\n  Put aside September 11 for a minute. How many times have we heard \nover the last number of years that if you don't maintain the basic \ninfrastructure of your country--roads, bridges, mass transit systems--\neconomic growth suffers? So this bill will also include some dollars to \ntry to harden up this infrastructure so we will be better prepared to \nwithstand the kinds of terrorist attacks that could occur that would \nput those pieces of infrastructure in harm's way. This bill will \nprovide some resources for that. Of course, it puts people to work. \nImagine that; we might put some people to work by passing this bill.\n\n  That is basically the package. It is designed to provide unemployment \nbenefits, health care benefits, dollars for infrastructure, and a tax \ncut for people who did not get one so they might not only get a break \nthemselves but also contribute to the demand side of the equation which \nis necessary if this economic stimulus package is going to provide \nadditional lift during this time of difficulty.\n  I hope in these next couple of days we can come together. We have \ndone it before in the last few weeks. These are not excessive requests. \nThis is a fiscally responsible plan. We have done so much in the last \n10 years to put our economy on a footing that none of us imagined would \never be the case: that we would actually be in a situation where we \nwould be talking about eliminating the national debt if we wanted.\n  How many of us have seen those clocks in almost every city that \nrapidly show the increase of the national debt? Yet over the last 10 \nyears as the result of some very fine leadership in Congress, by the \nFederal Reserve, and obviously the White House, we were able to make a \ndifference to put this country on a path many people thought we could \nnot get on again.\n  As we talk about an economic recovery package, it must be fiscally \nresponsible. If we are going to spend ourselves once again into huge \ndebt, I cannot imagine anything more that Osama bin Laden or his \nsupporters would like to see than us not only weakened from their \nattacks on September 11 but that we would weaken our economy either \nbecause we made excessive tax cuts or spending additions that were \nunwise.\n  As most Americans, I am stunned. I represent the most affluent State \nin the country, and certainly many of my constituents would benefit \ndirectly. They are some of the top income earners in the country. I do \nnot hear my constituents talking about the need for a $1.3 million tax \nbreak for IBM or the Ford Motor Company as a result of repealing the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Where is the sense of contribution? Are they like the people in the \nstreets of Queens running and dragging those hoses along to help put \nout the fires, somebody who is probably making $20,000 or $30,000? Some \nof them are retired. They were racing along to help stop a fire. How \nabout that coming out of the top income earners in the country to help \nput out the fire in a sense? That is all we are asking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. I will wrap up by saying I hope we can \nfind some common ground this week and do what the American public \nexpects of us. I would so much love to hear my President ask me to \nextend these unemployment benefits and provide health care. Presidents \nin the past have done it.\n  This President is doing a wonderful job in the battle in central \nAsia. All of us appreciate his work and the work of his team.

Mr. President, I speak on some legislation filed by \ndistinguished Senators relative to S. 1673 this past Friday. I am \nhonored to join with my distinguished colleagues in offering \nlegislation to provide the maximum flexibility and stability our \nfarmers need to make proper business decisions based on market \nconditions.\n  I am mindful, of course, of agriculture's importance to our country's \neconomy and to America's security. I might add that agriculture is the \nNo. 1 industry in North Carolina. Our farmers rank third in the Nation \nbehind California and Florida in agricultural diversification.\n  It is with genuine appreciation that I join Senator Lincoln, Senator \nHutchinson, and Senator Miller in working together in crafting this \nbill. The farm bill we are introducing will be helpful in our \nguaranteeing that American farmers will continue to provide the \nAmerican people with the safe and adequate food supply that too many \ntake for granted.\n  The past several years have been a genuine challenge to farmers, \nwhether their operations are large or small. Farmers and their families \nhave long been the backbone of countless rural communities. Every day, \nfarmers face new challenges by literally dozens of factors beyond their \ncontrol, from weather to insect infestation, to overreaching \nregulations that unnecessarily increase the cost of production,\n\n[[Page S11676]]\n\nto trade barriers imposed by other countries on our farm products.\n  All these factors make it especially difficult for farmers to earn a \nprofit when prices are at such historic lows as they are today. As \nfarmers begin preparing for a new planting cycle, meeting with their \nbankers to plan the financial future of their businesses and their \nfamilies and making difficult decisions relating to capital \nimprovement, they also face the uncertainty that comes with \ncongressional consideration of a new farm bill. Farmers are already \nreeling from a string of especially difficult years, and this bill that \nwas offered on Friday provides a balanced and bipartisan approach to \nprovide the stability needed to better compete on a global playing \nfield while allowing farmers the flexibility they must have in order to \nadjust to the world market.\n  I think the House of Representatives is to be commended for its \nleadership in so quickly passing a farm bill that is a positive step \ntoward bringing stability and predictability to American agriculture. \nThe bill we offered Friday in the Senate is built on the concepts \nadopted by the House which, by the way, developed its bill by \nsoliciting the input of farmers and farm organizations throughout the \ncountry for the better part of 2 years.\n  We believe this bill is particularly well crafted to clear all of the \nlegislative hurdles necessary to present it to the President for his \nsignature by the end of this year.\n  Although we have had many important national issues to deal with \nduring this historic time, we must not forget the needs of America's \nfarmers.\n  I appreciate the willingness of my colleagues to work together on a \ngood piece of legislation, and I look forward to our continued \ncooperation with each other.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter endorsing the \nbill we introduced this past Friday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    North Carolina\n\n\n                                       Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                    Raleigh, NC, November 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: The North Carolina Farm Bureau favors \n     farm policy philosophies that were adopted in the House \n     version (H.R. 2646) of the Farm Bill. We are also supporting \n     your efforts along with Senators Hutchinson and Lincoln to \n     draft a similar bill that includes a well-balanced funding \n     approach among all titles.\n       All commodity groups were included in the writing of the \n     House Farm Bill. The bill outlines the ideals of farmers by \n     directly addressing farm programs while also making \n     significant investments and improvements in conservation, \n     rural development, export, research, and nutrition programs.\n       A Farm Bill that reflects the House version will result in \n     a less contentious conference report. This hopefully should \n     allow for a new Farm Bill to be signed into law this year.\n       Thank you for your hard work in offering a Farm Bill \n     proposal that helps address the challenges that our farmers \n     face today.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Larry B. Wooten,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The author of this letter, by the way, is the distinguished President \nof the North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation, Larry Wooten.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenator as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am proud to rise to thank my colleague \nfrom North Carolina, having had the pleasure of working with him and \nhis staff on this issue. I thank him very much for the leadership he \nhas provided the State of North Carolina and this great Nation and \ncertainly this body. I have had a wonderful time working with him.\n  I join my colleagues in introducing a bill of the utmost importance \nto our farmers. Since the passage of the Freedom to Farm bill in 1996, \nour farmers have toiled under clouds of uncertainty. Quite simply \nstated, our Nation needs a farm policy that works for working farmers. \nThat is why, along with Senator Hutchinson, Senator Helms of North \nCarolina, Senator Miller of Georgia, Senators Breaux and Landrieu of \nLouisiana, and Senator Sessions of Alabama, I am proud to offer a new \nalternative.\n  We have offered a farm bill that will ensure a strong safety net for \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers. We have offered a farm bill that will \nincrease investment in conservation programs by 80 percent. We have \noffered a farm bill that provides more effective support for \ndisadvantaged working families through nutrition programs. We have \noffered a farm bill that will increase and improve our Nation's \nagricultural trade programs such as the Food Aid Program that sends \nfood to the most needy of nations, many of which are aligned with us in \nour conflicts today against terrorism across the globe. We have offered \na farm bill that will preserve and protect our Nation's forests and \nenvironment while investing in rural America.\n  For too many years, while the American economy at large was posting \nastonishing and unprecedented gains, our agricultural producers have \nnot benefited from our prosperity. It is not only our farmers who are \nsuffering as a result of failed Government policy; the institutions of \nsmall-town and rural America--local banks and merchants, feed and \nsupply stores, equipment dealers, even corner grocers and family-owned \nhardware stores--are all caught in the web of financial collapse in \nrural America.\n\n  From a letter I received from a young farmer in northeast Arkansas a \nfew months ago, he said his family's farm is nearing ``a point of no \nreturn,'' and if the crisis continues he will have to leave the land \nthat his grandfather worked before him.\n  Our family farmers are farming away their equity. They are farming \naway their heritage. Their Government has not provided them the safety \nnet they need to be competitive in a global marketplace in order to \ncontinue to provide us, the American people and people across the \nglobe, the safest, most affordable and most abundant food supply in the \nworld.\n  Here is a letter from a bank president in southeast Arkansas who \nnotes that when he moved into his community in 1969, a new John Deere \ncombine sold for about $15,000. Today, a comparable model sells for \nabout $220,000. Fuel for that combine was 15 cents per gallon in 1969, \nhe writes, but today a gallon of diesel fuel costs about $1.05. He goes \non to note that while farmers could expect to receive $3 for a bushel \nof rice 33 years ago, today he only gets $2.70 for that same bushel.\n  As the costs continue to skyrocket--the input of resources demanded \nof farmers to be put into their crops--the return on these investments \ncontinues to fall below the levels they were paid over 40 years ago.\n  Here is a letter from a young woman in east Arkansas who works a 60-\nacre rice and soybean farm with her husband and child. Her husband is \nso depressed because of his lack of ability to be able to provide for \nhis family he needs counseling and medication and she can't let her \nchild participate in afterschool sports because of the additional costs \nthat are entailed.\n  She writes that where she and her family once felt pride in their \nsense of independence and self-sufficiency, today they feel only shame \nbecause they have to rely on loans and supplemental income payments to \nsurvive.\n  These stories are not unusual. In many rural areas, they are becoming \nthe norm.\n  We cannot afford to let our farmers continue to suffer this way. They \ncan't wait another year; their problems are real and they are here \ntoday. Our bill will address their problems. Our bill will restore them \nto a better economic future. Our bill will restore to them their hope \nso they can build a better future for their children and for the rest \nof the children in this great Nation.\n  I am proud to be a coauthor of this bill, and I am proud to say I \nwill take my stand to fight for its passage for the men and women who \ntoil day in and day out as agricultural producers in this great land. \nWe owe them no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined with my \ncolleagues to introduce a bipartisan farm bill--a farm bill that will \nsecure American agriculture into the 21st century.\n  For the past 4 years, our farmers have experienced an agricultural \ncrisis\n\n[[Page S11677]]\n\nunlike anything seen since the Great Depression. As they say where I \ncome from, it's been ``hell on a holiday.''\n  It has been particularly cruel because until the recent recession \ncame along, our suffering farmers had watched the rest of our economy \nthrive with tremendous growth and prosperity.\n  The way we distribute disaster assistance cannot continue. Our \nfarmers cannot wait any longer. The time for a new farm bill is now.\n  Our bill maintains the freedom for producers to plant the crops that \nbest reflect market conditions. It provides an adequate safety net \nduring economic and weather disasters, and it allows an 80-percent \nincrease in conservation spending. Let me repeat that: It provides an \n80-percent increase in conservation spending. That is nearly double \nwhat it is now. In past farm bills that would be unheard of.\n  The bill also makes dramatic and needed improvements in nutrition \nprograms, trade promotion programs, and forestry incentives. It also--\nand this is very important--provides greater funding for our nation's \nresearch institutions such as the University of Georgia.\n  I have heard from members of the administration and members of the \nAgriculture Committee that we must take this first farm bill of the new \ncentury in a new policy direction. I do not disagree. I believe that is \ntrue. Along those lines, I respectfully point out that our bill \nincludes the most dramatic farm policy change in nearly 70 years. That \nfavorite whipping boy of all farm subsidies, the peanut program, has \nbeen turned on its head.\n  Perhaps, a little history is in order, because where we are \nadvocating going compared to where we have been is as different as \nnight and day.\n  During the Great Depression, when the South I grew up in was that \n``one-third'' of a nation, President Roosevelt spoke about, the peanut \nquota system was established for poor farmers.\n  Quotas eventually became based on poundage and were set each year on \nthe projected needs of domestic manufacturers.\n  As years went by, they began to be rented sometimes from landowner to \nfarmer. Whether you agree with the policy or not, the peanut quota \nbecame a commodity in our neck of the woods.\n  The quota was passed down in families from generation to generation, \nand sold much as Coca-Cola or some other stock owned by our city \ncousins.\n  This policy, again rightly or wrongly, had seen little change since \nthe early days of the Depression. Many families came to rely on quota \nsupport as their only source of retirement. It was their 401k.\n  And then NAFTA and GATT were passed and the peanut farmers' world was \nturned upside down. Because then, in the name of globalization, our \ntrade protections for peanuts were lowered, imports were increased, and \nas a result quotas were gradually reduced.\n  Many peanut farmers across the country, seeing firsthand that what \nwas good for the goose was not always good for the gander, and \nrealizing what the future would hold if the current policy remained, \ndecided to follow a new path. A way of life for more than three \ngenerations was, to use a phrase we understand very well, ``gone with \nthe wind.''\n  This policy was so entrenched, because it had lasted so long, that \nthis change has been difficult. It has not been easy to accept. Where I \ncome from, a small problem that can be easily solved is known as ``a \nshort horse--soon curried.'' Well, this was a big horse, and it has \ntaken a long time not only to curry but to break it.\n  For months, I, along with many others, called for the peanut \ncommunity to unite and face reality--to get them to accept the fact \nthat the peanut quota system as their daddies and granddaddies knew it, \nwas gone, to understand that the people in Washington won't support it, \nand NAFTA and GATT are here to stay.\n  So, we, their representatives in Congress, urged them to accept this \nchange and work to develop a new, comprehensive policy that would allow \npeanut farmers to be competitive in world markets and that would \ncompensate those affected by the change. After a lot of discussion, I \nthink that is exactly what we have crafted.\n  There are never many people happy at a shotgun marriage, and that is \nwhat this is. To make such a drastic reform took careful bridge-\nbuilding to get across these troubled waters. We needed a transition. \nAnything else would have been unfair and not the American way.\n  We are willing to face the bad along with the good of fair and open \ntrade. But we also want to maintain a peanut industry that will survive \nfor future generations of peanut farm families.\n  The peanut program in this bill will be a tough row to hoe, but it is \nfair and the peanut community can say, ``We are now like everyone \nelse.''\n  There are another important point that I wish to make, and it is an \nissue that strikes at the heart of the entire agricultural industry.\n  I recently met with a large group of Georgia agriculture leaders, and \nthe message they expressed to me was one of great distress and crisis.\n  In this time of the lowest interest rates we have seen in years, in \nthis time of generous credit, there are banks all over rural Georgia \nthat will no longer finance a farmer on the basis of future crops or \nequipment value. It is not that they do not want to help their friend \nand neighbor, but it is simply too big a risk. The loan officer \nreluctantly points out that commodity prices are just too low, and they \ndo not see much of a chance for the farmer to repay the loan, no matter \nhow hard he and his family might work, not under our present trade \npolicy.\n  They also point out that the agricultural economy is so distressed \nthat equipment purchased by farmers for thousands of dollars only a \nshort time ago now has little value because no other farmer can afford \nto buy it.\n  The current recession did not bring this on, nor did the events of \nSeptember 11. Mother Nature and poor market conditions did, and it \nshows that our farmers must have a stronger safety net.\n  In addition, disasters over the past 4 years have exhausted many life \nsavings and left no collateral on which to finance anything. Those who \nsay we ought to wait to pass a new farm bill ought to have to walk a \nmile in those farmers' shoes. They ought to have to be the ones on the \nfarm who work from daylight to dark and from can to can't. They ought \nto have to be sitting at that kitchen table after supper when the kids \nare in bed and hear the discussion about having to give up a farm that \nhas been in the family for generations. Then, when the family farm is \nput up on an auction block and it goes for pennies on the dollar, what \ndo we say to them then? That is something we can't figure out over \nlunch at the Palm.\n  We are going to be talking this week about a stimulus package. We \nhave proposals on stimuli coming out of our ears. It is creme de la \ncreme that can be conceived only by those highly paid lobbyists, \npushing and pulling, paying and pimping, and promising to get their \nclients the best breaks and the most generous incentives.\n  I learned a long time ago that when it comes to how legislation is \nwritten--especially here in Washington--it is kind of like that country \nmusic song by Freddie Hart about his girlfriend: ``If fingerprints \nshowed up on skin, I wonder whose I would find on you.''\n  I am afraid both stimulus bills have a lot of questionable \nfingerprints on them, and we do not need the FBI to figure out whose \nthey are. Their names, addresses, and their interests are in the top \ncontributor list of both parties.\n  The legislation I am speaking on today also has fingerprints: \nFingerprints from callused hands--the hands of the workers who feed us \nand clothe us, people who, like the family dog, we just take for \ngranted.\n  Do I speak too harshly? I am sorry, but because I am not blind to \nwhat I see, I cannot be bland in what I say. Of course, we cannot \ncontinue to do things as we have always done, and we cannot continue to \nprovide disaster assistance each and every year. But there has to be a \ntransition, some ``weaning time,'' as it is called down on the farm.\n  Mr. President, this farm bill sets a new policy, a sea change in \nconservation and peanuts. It addresses the critical needs facing \nAmerica's farmers. It was written by Senators from both sides of the \naisle. I hope that same bipartisan support will pass a new farm policy \nthis year.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11678-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11678]]\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Therefore, the order with respect to H.R. 3090 should now \nreflect that the debate-only limitation will extend until 4:45 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now on the Economic Recovery Act. I \nwould like to make a few comments on it, if I might. I know I will be \nfollowed by my very good friend, a terrific Senator, Mr. Grassley from \nIowa.\n  This is a sober time. Our Nation is at war overseas and at home. Like \nall Americans, we are struggling to respond, to hold together, to \nassume our responsibilities. Among other things, we in this Chamber \nhave the responsibility to help get the economy back on track.\n  The September 11 attacks took a bad economic situation--our economy \nwas deteriorating--and made it significantly worse. I very sadly add, \nthe tragic crash of an American Airlines plane yesterday in New York, I \nam sure, adds more angst and concern across our country, which has a \nvery direct effect on people's emotions and psychology, but also, to \nsome degree, on the economy, people's willingness to believe in the \nfuture.\n  We had virtually no economic growth in the second quarter of this \nyear, and we have had negative growth in the third quarter of this \nyear, 2001.\n  In addition, in October unemployment jumped from 4.9 percent to 5.4\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\npercent. That is the largest jump since May of 1980. We also have \nreports of 638,000 layoffs of American workers announced since \nSeptember 11.\n  Manufacturing has been particularly hard hit. Last month, \nmanufacturing lost 142,000 jobs. That was just in the one month of \nOctober. That was the 15th consecutive month that manufacturing jobs \ndropped.\n  Since July of last year--a little over a year ago--manufacturing has \nlost an incredible 1.3 million jobs. That is over about 15, 16 months. \nManufacturing employment has now fallen to its lowest levels since \nNovember 1965.\n  The problems are not limited to the manufacturing sector. In October, \nnon-manufacturing industries experienced the most dramatic slowdown in \nbusiness activity since a report by the National Association of \nPurchasing Managers began in 1997.\n  Agricultural producers are hurting, too. Net farm business income was \nat a 10-year low in 1999 and 2000. Still, unless Government assistance \nis continued, net farm income in 2001 is actually projected to be lower \nthan farm income in 1999 and 2000. The most acute problems are faced by \nfarmers whose farms have been hit by floods, drought, tornadoes, and \nother national disasters.\n  Finally, the economies of New York and the surrounding regions have \ntaken an unimaginably severe blow from the events of September 11. It \nis not just the economy of the New York region that has taken a hit. It \nis our highly interdependent economy all across our entire country that \nhas suffered as a consequence of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon \ntragedies as well as the other events that have occurred.\n  So what can we do? How do we help Americans regain confidence in the \nfuture so people want to, for example, buy refrigerators and cars, take \nfamily vacations, and have a really good, confident feeling about the \nfuture? How do we help businesses believe in the future, invest in new \nproducts, design new products and ways of doing things? It is a \npsychology that really comes down to confidence. How do we help \nengender the confidence we all desire?\n  First, there is something--the fancy term is ``monetary policy.'' \nThat is essentially the Federal Reserve System essentially raising or \nlowering interest rates to help make borrowing more expensive or less \nexpensive. Basically, I think the Federal Reserve has done a pretty \ngood job.\n  Last week, the Federal Reserve Board cut short-term interest rates \nfor the 10th time this year--that is a lot of cuts over 1 year--\nclearly, trying to help make borrowing less expensive, people more \ninclined to borrow and to spend more, putting more money into the \neconomy. My guess is, more rate cuts will follow.\n  But monetary policy alone does not appear to be enough. We also have \nto pass legislation to stimulate the economy through what is called \nfiscal policy. Just as a reminder, fiscal policy is when Congress \nbasically either raises taxes or lowers taxes--spends money or does not \nspend as much--with an economic effect on the economy. To stimulate the \neconomy through traditional garden variety fiscal policy, Congress \nspends money.\n  Now, there are a couple of ways to spend money. One is through \ncutting taxes; that is, in effect, spending money. The other is direct \nexpenditures by the Congress. We are trying to figure out how to \nstimulate the economy by spending money.\n  Now, there is no magic, clearly--no magic, no recipe that will send \nus going back to double-digit growth. Nevertheless, I think there are \nsome simple guidelines that we in Congress can follow to help regain \nthat confidence. Most significantly, the bipartisan leaders of the \nHouse and Senate Budget Committees provided us about a month ago with \nsome very important guidelines. This is very important. The leadership \nof the Budget Committee--Republicans and Democrats, both House and \nSenate--all got together. That is remarkable. A lot of times around \nhere we are not always on the same page. But all four of them got \ntogether because they were thinking of the longer term, about our \nnational budget. They agreed upon a certain set of guidelines they \nthought were appropriate in an economic stimulus, economic recovery, a \npackage that we might pass.\n  Let me try to put in my own words what they said. They first said the \neconomic recovery stimulus bill should be temporary--that is, something \nthat is a direct, essentially a 1-year stimulus, upfront now, to help \nget the economy going. In one respect, I think it is because we have \nsome sense of what the economy is going to be like next year. We don't \nhave much of a sense of 2, 3, 4, 5 years down the road. We need to do \nwhat we can to stimulate the economy now and take stock a year from now \nto see where we are. They also said they should not spend too much over \nthe long run. That is part and parcel with the upfront.\n  We are very nervous in Congress about longer run, about runups in the \nFederal budget which tend to cause moderate and long-term interest \nrates to rise. Why? Because bond traders are thinking, gee, if Congress \nis spending all this money in the longer term, probably there will be \ncompetition for capital, and inflation is going to go up a bit, \nprobably, with all that spending, and the price of bonds goes down as \nlong-term rates stay up. They don't come down like we want them to. \nThey will come down if we say we are going to be responsible and we are \nnot going to spend a lot of money in the out-years. That is very \nimportant.\n  The Budget Committee chairmen--all 4--also said we should get the \nmoney into the hands of those who will spend it quickly; that is, they \nare talking more about a consumer-led stimulus. Get people spending \nmoney. Then businesses are going to want to invest, start manufacturing \nproducts and selling products to the people who are buying. They said--\nthe budgeteers--consumers who will spend money then help stimulate \nbusiness. They also said we should spend money on businesses who will \nspend it on capital equipment. That should be stimulative as well.\n  One more point: In addition to providing an economic stimulus in this \nlegislation, we also have to lend a hand to the Americans who are \nreally suffering. It is one thing to help put money in the economy; it \nis also as important--if not more important--to help the Americans who \nare really suffering and living paycheck to paycheck and trying to make \nends meet as a consequence of the terrorist attacks, or because of the \nrecession in which the economy is now. At a time like this, I think it \nis critical that they are all a part of this, and that we Americans \nwork together to find a good solution. That is what we tried to do in \nthis bill. That is what is contained in the bill the Finance Committee \nis now presenting to the Senate. I think we have done a pretty good \njob. The bill has six main elements, every one of which is important.\n\n  First, we provide a further tax rebate. You will recall that there \nare about 130 million taxpayers in our country. When the checks went \nout in the past summer on the tax bill this Senate passed, 79 million \nAmericans got a full rebate. Individuals got either $300, or families \ngot $600, and another 14 million taxpayers got a partial rebate--less \nthan the full $300 or $600. Another 34 million American taxpayers got \nno rebate whatsoever; 34 million got no rebate in the last go-around, \nlast summer. Why? The rebate then was limited to the amount that people \npaid in income taxes. You have to remember that a family who paid \nincome taxes of less than $600 did not get a full rebate.\n  For a family of four, that would be a gross income of about $30,000. \nIf they made less than that, they didn't get a full rebate. In many \ncases, they didn't get any rebate. So here is what we do in this bill. \nThis bill provides a second round of tax rebates for people who paid \npayroll taxes but got only a partial rebate, or no rebate, the last \ntime around. As a result, by the time the second round of checks go \nout, every one of the 130 million people who paid Federal taxes also \nwill receive a full rebate.\n  To some extent, this is a matter of simple fairness. After all, some \ngot it last time and the rest of the Americans should get it this time. \nIt is also more than that. The people who didn't get full rebates \nearlier tend to have relatively low incomes. Those who got it last time \nhave higher incomes. The people who get it now are likely to spend a \nhigher proportion of the new income they get because they are lower \nincome Americans. They have to spend\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\nit, frankly, to make ends meet. That would be a direct stimulus to the \neconomy.\n  Second, we establish a series of temporary tax incentives. Most \nsignificantly, we provide special tax depreciation deductions for a \nlimited time to encourage businesses to invest in new plants and \nequipment. As it now stands, businesses deduct the cost of new plants \nand equipment over a period of years. There are various rules that \napply. We add a temporary depreciation ``bonus'' of 10 percent for \ninvestments made before the end of next year.\n  What does that mean? That basically means, whatever your depreciation \nschedule is, take 10 percent and do it all the first year, expense it \nmore quickly, move it up, which helps your bottom line. It encourages \nyou to invest. Senator Hatch and others have suggested that we make the \npercentage higher than 10 percent. I am open to that. I am open to a \nhigher percentage if it fits into the framework of our overall bill.\n  The accelerated depreciation deduction will have a couple effects. \nFirst, it will encourage businesses to invest sooner rather than later. \nThat, in turn, will directly stimulate the economy. Further, to the \nextent some of the additional investments could be put to use right \naway, it will increase productivity. That is no small matter.\n  We also provide an even larger depreciation deduction for small \nbusinesses by increasing what is called the ``expensing'' deduction \nunder section 179. This deduction is available only for new investments \nmade in the next 12 months.\n  Finally, we allow companies a longer period to carry back net \noperating losses. This change is needed to make the first two \ninvestment incentives work efficiently. It also provides a modest break \nfor companies struggling to stay on their feet.\n  Those are the nationwide investment incentives through tax cuts. It \nis one way to stimulate the economy through fiscal policy; it is tax \ncuts. There are lots of ways to do it and that is one way in this bill. \nThat is very important.\n  The third section of the bill provides tax relief to the area in \nLower Manhattan that was devastated by the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11. Yesterday's crash has rekindled our memory of what \nhappened on September 11--the death, the destruction, the horror, and \nthe angst in our national psyche.\n  The September attacks also had a huge economic effect on New York \nCity. It was amazing to all of us who have been to Ground Zero and have \nseen it. Fifteen thousand businesses were destroyed or disrupted and \n125,000 workers were displaced. That is just the beginning of it. The \nSenators from New York and New Jersey can go on and on in much greater \ndetail and describe the magnitude and degree of devastation that New \nYork has suffered.\n  Every American wants to help, from those who live across the river in \nNew Jersey, to those who live across the country in my State of \nMontana. All Americans want to help. We are all together in this.\n  Let me explain how we came up with the New York package. After the \nattacks, Senators Schumer and Clinton and Torricelli and Corzine, along \nwith Governor Pataki, approached me with a series of tax proposals for \nNew York City. We had lots of discussions. They have been wonderful in \nrepresenting their people and, second, working to do what is right. We \nrejected several ideas, but we revised others. After a lot of give and \ntake, we were able to agree on a package that is fair, targeted and, I \nthink, practical.\n  The basic idea is pretty simple. We provide temporary tax incentives \nto encourage business to either stay in lower Manhattan or to relocate \nin New York City.\n  There are three main provisions. First, we expand the work \nopportunity tax credit which exists under current law to encourage \nemployers to hire certain categories of individuals.\n  We create a new category for people who find jobs in lower Manhattan \nor who used to work there and relocate to another part of New York \nCity.\n  Second, we allow enhanced cost recovery to encourage businesses that \nlost property in the attacks to relocate to New York City.\n  Third, we authorize the issuance of $10 billion in tax-exempt private \nactivity bonds to rebuild the area damaged by the attacks.\n  As a related matter, we include an amendment offered by Senator \nTorricelli based on a bill I wrote with Senator Grassley. It provides \ntax relief to victims of the terrorist attacks, including both attacks \nof September 11 and the Oklahoma City bombing a couple of years ago.\n  Clearly, we will be taking stock at the end of this year as to what \nmore is needed for our country, including New York City. This is \nbasically to stem the hemorrhage, to help people at least tread water \nand not sink. But we are going to be taking a look at this again, and I \nwelcome working with all the people from New York and other parts of \nthe country as we try to find a national economic plan for next year.\n  The final provision in this part of the bill allows Indian tribes to \nissue additional types of tax-exempt bonds to promote economic \ndevelopment. This provision obviously is not related to the September \n11 attacks or the recession, but it will help promote economic \ndevelopment in a part of America--Indian country--that has been left \nbehind for far too long.\n  I will now move on to the fourth section of the bill, unemployment \nbenefits. We all understand the problem. In October, we had the biggest \njump in the unemployment rate in 20 years. Work is harder to keep and \neven harder to find. In response, we have taken an approach that \nCongress has adopted many times in the past; that is, we extend \nunemployment benefits by 13 weeks.\n  We also take a few additional steps. We temporarily increase \nunemployment benefits by the greater of 15 percent or $25 a week. These \npeople, because of inflation and the difficulty with making ends meet, \ndeserve that. We make modest and temporary improvements in the \noperation of the unemployment insurance program. Specifically, we \nupdate the reporting period and provide better coverage for people \nseeking part-time work. One does not have to be a full-time worker to \nqualify. If you are a part-time worker, you should and do qualify.\n  Others argue that unemployment insurance is a poor economic stimulus. \nThis surprising argument is contrary to the history of the program and \nto the overwhelming economic evidence.\n  Alan Krueger of Princeton University put it this way:\n\n       Unemployment insurance is the quintessential economic \n     stimulus: benefits ramp up temporarily in a downturn and \n     reach those most in need.\n\n  A similar point was recently made by Joseph Stiglitz, co-winner of \nthe 2001 Nobel Prize for Economics. He said:\n\n       First, we should extend the duration and magnitude of the \n     benefits we provide to our unemployed. . . . This is not only \n     the fairest proposal, but also the most effective.\n\n  Senior economist Jane Gravelle of the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service recently said this:\n\n       Extending unemployment compensation is, in fact, likely to \n     be a more successful policy for stimulating aggregate demand \n     than many other tax/transfer changes.\n\n  Remember, one of the main reasons we have an unemployment insurance \nprogram is to provide economic stimulus during times of economic \ndownturn. That is the whole point of it. Explaining the program in \n1934, President Roosevelt said that it will ``act as a stabilizing \ndevice in our economic structure and as a method of retarding the rapid \ndownward spiral curve and the onset of severe economic crisis.''\n  To put it bluntly, people who have lost their jobs and are struggling \nto get by are likely to spend any additional money they get, providing \na direct stimulus to the economy.\n  The next section of the bill helps people maintain health insurance \ncoverage for themselves and their families. As unemployment rises, the \nnumber of uninsured Americans also rise. People are laid off, and they \ndo not have health insurance.\n  In the recession of the early 1990s, more than half the workers who \nbecame unemployed also became uninsured. That is an important point. \nMore than half the workers who lost their jobs in the early 1990s also \nlost their health insurance. My proposal responds to this in a couple \nof ways.\n  The first way is through the so-called COBRA program. That program \nwas enacted in 1987. It allows people to\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\nmaintain their employer-provided health insurance coverage for 18 \nmonths after they leave a job as long as they pay the full premiums \nthemselves. That is current law.\n  That is also the problem. Simply put, COBRA premiums--that is, paying \nfull freight for health insurance--is very expensive. On average, the \ncost for individual coverage is $2,700 a year. As one is layed off, to \nmaintain COBRA health insurance, one has to pay $2,700 for coverage, \nand for family coverage, turn that 2 and 7 around and it comes out to \n$7,200 or almost $600 a month. Not many families on unemployment \nbenefits can afford that.\n  The average unemployment benefit is $231 a week. As a result, only \nabout 18 percent of the workers who qualify to maintain their health \ninsurance coverage under COBRA actually do so. It stands to reason. It \nis too expensive, so it is only 18 percent.\n  Here is what we do. First, we provide a 75 percent subsidy for COBRA \ncoverage. In essence, the Federal Government would pay the portion of \nthe premium that previously had been paid by the employer. This is for \nonly 18 months. It is temporary.\n  Second, we give States funds and flexibility to pay the remaining 25 \npercent for people with very low incomes.\n  Third, we give States funds and flexibility to provide Medicaid \ncoverage for workers who are not eligible for the COBRA program.\n  Fourth, we increase the matching rate for State Medicaid coverage to \nmake it easier for States to maintain coverage at a time when State \nbudgets are being squeezed. We have heard a lot about this. A lot of \nState budgets are in tough shape. Most have a constitutional \nrequirement to balance the budget, and they are strapped. It is very \ndifficult. I am not going to get into whether they properly cut taxes \nin the last 2 years when times were good, but nevertheless, we have to \ntake things as they are, and I think the States do need some help.\n  Forty-nine States face balanced budget requirements and are likely to \ncause them to increase taxes and cut spending, even though such steps \ncould deepen the recession. The increase in the matching rate provides \nfiscal relief for States at a time when it is badly needed.\n  All told, these provisions will maintain health insurance for \nmillions of workers who have lost their jobs or stand to lose them in \nthe difficult months ahead.\n  Like unemployment insurance, this proposal has been criticized pretty \nsharply. Some argue that covering health insurance costs will not \nprovide an economic stimulus, apart from these people who are out of \nwork and need a little help.\n  I grant the case is not as straightforward--strictly on the stimulus \npoint--as it is for unemployment insurance, but still the argument for \nstimulus is very strong. In any event, this part of the proposal is not \njust designed to provide economic stimulus, it is designed to help \npeople who have lost their jobs to the recession.\n  Critics also argue the proposal is an indirect way to establish a new \nentitlement program. We have heard that, too. Some people do not like \nnew entitlement programs, as a matter of philosophy and ideology, never \nmind what the practical consequences may or may not be.\n  This is not a new entitlement program. We are responding to a \ntemporary crisis with a temporary solution. The program ends after 1 \nyear on December 31, 2002: It is over; it is the end of the line; it is \ndone.\n  Finally, critics argue the program will be slow and cumbersome. Let's \nbe candid. There are several competing proposals to provide temporary \nhealth insurance coverage. Each raises the same issues: How efficient \nand how quickly will the dollars be in the hands of people who need it? \nWhether we are talking about direct payments, COBRA tax credits--that \nis another idea--block grants to the States--that is the President's \nidea--we still have to come up with a system that works quickly and \neffectively. I am less hung up as to which it is. I want people who \nneed health insurance to get health insurance benefits quickly and \nefficiently.\n  If someone can come up with a better approach that accomplishes our \ngoal, I am more than willing to listen.\n  Let me now turn to a section of the bill that is extremely important: \nThe provisions for agriculture and rural economic development.\n  To set the stage, let me remind colleagues once again about the state \nof the agricultural economy. We have had an unprecedented streak of bad \nweather and bad economic conditions. Farmers in parts of the South and \nnorthern-tier States have been particularly hard hit. Although some \nsectors and some regions have begun to recover, farmers' overall \nearnings from their farming operations--that is, absent Government \npayments--are down sharply. The current difficulties could not come at \na worse time.\n  A downturn in farm income does not just impact farmers. It wreaks \nhavoc in the rural communities that depend on them. Farmers in economic \ndistress are not able to make their usual purchases of seed, \nfertilizer, not to mention food and clothing. This puts the \nagricultural sector at considerable risk.\n  To ensure the stimulus plan also provides benefits to agriculture-\ndependent economies in the South, the Midwest, the northern-tier, the \nbill extends three programs that have been critical to shoring up farm \nincome in the last 3 years. Not a new program, it just extends the \ncurrent program.\n  Some of my colleagues have attacked the agriculture section of the \nbill. They have poked fun at it, circulating pictures of various fruits \nand vegetables. The farmers and ranchers across this country may not \nfind this all so amusing. They may wonder why the economic problems of \nailing corporations demand immediate action but the economic problems \nof farmers and ranchers deserve only derision.\n  They are asking that question, and rightfully so: Why do big \ncorporations get assistance in an economic downturn but not farmers and \nranchers? Good question. We know the answer. Farmers and ranchers are \npart of America, too.\n  Let me be blunt. My constituents, including farmers and ranchers \nsuffering through another disaster, deserve economic relief every bit \nas much as Americans from urban areas.\n  Finally, to complete my summary of the bill, we also extend various \ntax and trade provisions that are scheduled to expire under current law \nand make a handful of additional changes to the Tax Code. I believe \nthis bill will help us achieve our objective of providing a fiscal \nstimulus for the economic recovery of our Nation.\n  It is temporary. It is carefully targeted. It will increase both \nbusiness investment and consumer demand, heavier on consumer demand \nwhich is needed more in this country. Perhaps more importantly, it will \nextend a helping hand to the people who have lost their jobs and risk \nlosing their health insurance.\n\n  On balance, it is a very solid bill that deserves support in this \nChamber. Time is critical. I hope we can complete debate quickly. Every \nday counts for Americans who need assistance and are looking at us. Is \nthe Congress going to stand up and do what it should do, so we have a \nchance to wrap up our differences with the House before Thanksgiving? \nIt is important we pass this quickly.\n  I understand others will disagree with my description of the bill. \nThey will say it falls short. They will argue we need more tax cuts, \nthat we do not need to do so much for the unemployed, that there are \nbetter ways to cover health insurance. They will question whether we \nshould have any agriculture provisions in this bill at all.\n  I say let us have that debate, and let us try to resolve our \ndifferences with due respect to each Senator's point of view. Let us \nget to the bottom, get the facts out, learn the truth, what works, what \ndoes not work, so we can get the job done.\n  After all, the American people are suffering. They have been hit with \nshock after shock after shock. They look to us for leadership. It is \ntime to provide it.\n  As the President said, quoting the heroes who jumped the hijackers \nover Pennsylvania, let's roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to be with my \nfriend, Chairman Baucus, to discuss an economic stimulative package and \nto declare that if he and I can work together, we are going to get such \nan economic stimulative package passed as\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\nwe did in the case of the tax bill that was passed and signed by the \nPresident in June, the largest tax reduction in the last 20 years, a \nneeded tax reduction because the American people are being taxed at the \nhighest level since World War II.\n  About that tax bill, if we had not passed that tax bill with the \nrebates that went out during August and September, with the flatness of \nthe economy, we would now be discussing what we are going to do about \nthe flatness of the economy because we did not do something last \nspring. It was fortuitous we were able to pass such a tax bill, and \npass it before there was a demonstrated need for it, to get the \ntaxpayers their rebates, to help consumer demand, and to keep the \neconomy going. We would have been considering a tax bill if we had not \npassed the earlier tax bill, regardless of what happened on September \n11.\n  Obviously, we are now debating because of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11 and the dramatic downturn in the economy that has resulted \nbecause of that terrorist act.\n  I suggest as we consider this legislation and what ought to be done \nfor economic stimulus because of the September 11 terrorist attacks and \nthe impact that has made on the economy, that everything be directly \nrelated to that incident, and that Members of the Senate not try to get \nanything on the agenda that would not otherwise be legitimately there \nbecause of the September 11 happenings.\n  So I rise for this debate on an economic stimulative package because \nof the need for it as a result of what happened on September 11 and for \nno other reason.\n  Chairman Baucus and I shared a goal at the start of this process. We \nboth wanted a bipartisan economic stimulative package that also \naddressed the needs of people who were hurt because of September 11 and \nhelped those with unemployment benefits and health care needs for \ndislocated workers. I still have that as my goal.\n  My discussions this afternoon I want to divide into three parts: The \nprocess for this bill; the substance of the bill, looking primarily at \nsimilarities between what Democrats think need to be done and what I as \na Republican leader think needs to be done--in other words, these are \npositions taken by our respective caucuses--and finally, how to resolve \nthese differences and get a bipartisan bill through the Senate because \nI think we all know right now there are not enough votes to get a \npartisan package of either caucus through this body.\n  Chairman Baucus rightly insisted that the Finance Committee act on \nthis matter. There was talk by the majority leader of skipping the \ncommittee and bringing it directly to the floor. As a ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, I support the chairman. He can count on my \nsupport in respecting the jurisdiction of the committee.\n  Unfortunately, however, in asserting our jurisdiction, we did not \noperate in a committee process, in a bipartisan tradition. Despite all \nthe speeches to the contrary, the bill we have now on the Senate floor, \nput forth last Thursday night by the Senate Finance Committee, was \ndesigned to be partisan. Why somebody would make that judgment, I don't \nhave the slightest idea. In all the victories I have had on the floor \nin this Senate in the 21 years I have been a Member, I don't think any \nhave been a partisan victory. I have been able to work with members of \nthe other party in order to get something done.\n  There is an old saying: You can get anything done if you don't care \nwho gets credit for it.\n  In that respect, I think designing a partisan package was a way to \nbring this bill to a stone wall. My job--and I think Chairman Baucus \nshares this with me--is to break down that stone wall, get beyond that, \nget our people together, get the opposing sides together, and get \nsomething to the President with the idea we are here to help the \neconomy and to not help one political party or the other.\n  The economic stimulus package passed out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee embodied then the Democratic caucus position on the issues we \nfelt ought to stimulate the economy. The bill was precooked and passed \nout of committee because Democrats decided to deal only with \nthemselves. As unfortunate as that event was, obviously we are out here \non the floor of the Senate. Last Thursday is history. It is all water \nunder the bridge.\n  Equally unfortunate, however, the partisan acts of the Democrats in \nthe Finance Committee have necessitated a confrontational debate from \neach side. By choosing a partisan strategy, the Democratic leadership \nhas placed us in a position where, aside from the substantive issues \ninvolved, there is necessarily a partisan division. I point this out \nonly because it is a needless barrier to my goal of a bipartisan \nstimulative package in the tradition of how Senator Baucus and I got \nthe tax bill of last spring to the President for signature on June 7.\n  On the Senate floor, the majority leader does not have an unfettered \nright to push this bill through on a partisan basis. He has a right to \ntry but he cannot succeed because this bill violates the restrictions \nof the budget resolution. It is subject to a 60-vote point of order \nunder the rules of the Senate. So, too, if Republicans wanted to push \nours, we could not get it passed. It would be subject to a 60-vote \npoint of order. We are in a position where neither side can win.\n  I am frustrated and disappointed right now because there is so much \ncommon ground between us and where the Democrat bill is. I am \nfrustrated because, regardless of this common ground, there is little \nwill on the part of the Democratic caucus to meet our side halfway or \neven part of the way. That unwillingness doesn't make a lot of sense in \na Senate that is divided: 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and one \nIndependent.\n  Where is the common ground? Starting with the economic stimulus \nitself, basically the President of the United States and Chairman \nGreenspan gave us a green light to the stimulus exercise. Chairman \nGreenspan requested we take a hard look at proposals that were \ntemporary, immediate, and efficient. Since his meetings with the \nPresident and with us on the Senate Finance Committee, there has also \nbeen indication that what he has done on interest rates, although he \ncan still do more and will probably do more, is reaching the end of the \nroad of what can be done through monetary policy, and that there needs \nto be a stimulative package that parallels, through Congress, what \nChairman Greenspan is trying to do through the Federal Reserve System.\n\n  We have been working with Chairman Greenspan because we want these \nprograms to complement each other. We also think Chairman Greenspan has \na pretty good feel for what it takes to turn this economy around. We \nsought his advice in a bipartisan way. The President sought his advice. \nChairman Greenspan said we needed to pay particular attention to the \ndecline in manufacturing investment.\n  I have a chart that demonstrates the relationship of consumption \nexpenditures and manufacturing expenditures. As the red line shows, we \nhave had a steady growth in personal consumption expenditures. We have \nhad more ups and downs with domestic investment, mostly manufacturing \ninvestment. In the last three quarters, we have seen a very dramatic \nturndown in manufacturing investment. It reached a high and dropped. I \nam glad to hear the chairman of the committee say in his opening \nremarks that the 10-percent accelerated depreciation they allow in \ntheir legislation is negotiable. We think, and Chairman Greenspan \nthinks, about 30 percent is what it will take to stimulate the economy.\n  The other side speaks about consumer demand and doing something about \nconsumer demand. The chart shows there has not been an erosion of \npersonal consumption expenditures as there has been a dramatic erosion \nof manufacturing investment.\n  Of course, why manufacturing investment and encouragement of that? It \nis time tested from both Republican and Democrat Presidents, changing \ntax law from time to time in the last 50 years to stimulate the economy \nbecause it enhances productivity; but more importantly, the equipment \nbought by major corporations is made at another manufacturing place \nthat creates jobs. It is a good way to help the economy in two ways: It \ncreates jobs where the enhanced machinery is manufactured, and it also \nmakes each person working where this is installed more productive, as \nwell.\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\n  We need a balance between demand and manufacturing. If we trust \nChairman Greenspan, and a lot of people in the United States have \nconfidence in him according to the polls, we need to pay particular \nattention to the downturn in manufacturing investment and follow \nChairman Greenspan's advice.\n  Now, Democrats and Republicans have agreed to pursue accelerated \ndepreciation as a stimulus. Both caucus plans have this proposal \nincluded, but there is an ineffective 10-percent accelerated \nappreciation in the Democrat plan, compared to the positive 30 percent \nin the Republican plan. Both caucuses pursued proposals that, while not \nas stimulative as accelerated depreciation, would still provide much \nneeded relief to struggling businesses.\n  It is another area of common ground that Democrats propose \nliberalizing the net operating loss carryback rules, but Republicans \npropose repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax. Here again, \nthere is room for negotiation and compromise that will lead to a \nbipartisan agreement.\n  Republicans put on the table an acceleration of the income tax rate \ncuts put in place by the bipartisan tax relief bill I spoke of twice \nthis afternoon that was signed by the President on June 7. That \nincluded the tax rebates, as well. The Democratic leadership objects \nstrenuously to the proposal because, although this proposal is \nstimulative--I have not heard otherwise--it reopened a statute that a \nmajority of the Democrats did not support last spring.\n  I recognize acceleration is not viewed as common ground, but I think \nit begs a question, if we are going to be intellectually honest with \neach other. How could the Democrats reopen the statute that the \nPresident signed June 7 by putting rebates for payroll and nontaxpayers \non the table. It appears a bit inconsistent. In one place you can open \nthe bill, but in another place you cannot open that tax bill of last \nspring.\n  To those of us on this side, then, it appears the Democratic \nleadership has taken the positive gesture by the President on rebates \nbecause President Bush wants to get money to lower income people to \nstimulate the economy. So they have taken a positive gesture by the \nPresident but have not been flexible in return.\n  Needless to say, by default, both sides have common ground on the \nnext round of rebate checks. This proposal stimulates consumer demand. \nFormer Secretary Rubin was very keen on some modest level of consumer \ndemand stimulus. So on the investment side and the consumers demand \nside, both Republicans and Democrats have proposals with similar \nfeatures, with the Republicans placing more emphasis on investment. But \nthe Democratic leadership has made marginal rate cut acceleration some \nsort of a deal breaker.\n  We Republicans want to provide dislocated workers with assistance for \ncoverage for health insurance. First off, I want to clear up some \nmisstatements. Some have incorrectly said that Republican proposals do \nnothing to help cover the cost of health insurance for dislocated \nworkers. This is baloney.\n  The President supported health care assistance by proposing funding \nfor health care benefits to laid-off workers. Both the House bill and \nthe Senate Republican caucus position embrace this idea. In \nnegotiations, in particular, I want to say to the Presiding Officer, I \nwas willing to go beyond the President's proposal. I offered to more \nthan triple the amount of money. I also proposed expanding coverage of \nhealth benefits to dislocated workers who do not qualify for COBRA, \nsuch as small business workers. I then offered Democrats complete \nflexibility to write the criteria under which the money would be \ngranted so they could be confident in the program doing what they want \nit to do. So how much more flexible can you be? But the Democratic \nleadership said no and rejected the offer.\n  So we do have a common ground on the goal of helping dislocated \nworkers with health care benefits. Are there any differences in how we \nwant to provide this assistance? The answer is yes. The whole point of \nthis bill, though, is to get people health care benefits right now, not \ndown the road. Yet the Democratic leadership proposes to create a new \nbureaucracy that will take many months to get up and running. The \nDemocrats' proposal would not be able to get benefits to workers until \nit is too late. This is a stimulative package to help us out of the \nrecession, not to give people help way beyond the turn-around in the \neconomy.\n  The reason the Democrats' proposal would do this is because Federal \nlaw requires that when a new Federal program is established, \nregulations must be promulgated and the public be given notice and \nopportunity to comment. Clearly, these laws affecting new programs are \nin place for a good reason.\n  We can avoid this hurdle by using existing programs, especially ones \nthat are tailor made for national emergencies. That is why the \nPresident took the approach he did through National Emergency Grant \nPrograms. If there is not enough money there to satisfy people on the \nother side of the aisle, we can take care of that. But we ought to take \ncare of it in a manner that gets the money to the people in a month, \nnot in a year. Our goal was to use the existing National Emergency \nGrant Program, one that the Federal Government and States have used for \nyears and have experience with, to ensure benefits can get to \ndislocated workers in the fastest way possible. No new infrastructure \nwould be required by the Federal Government and States could quickly \naccess much needed funds.\n\n  The bottom line is hard-working Americans who have lost their jobs as \na result of the September 11 tragedy cannot wait 6, 9, or 12 months for \nhealth care insurance. They need help and need it right now. We propose \nto do just that. But, again, the Democrat leadership was not interested \nin bipartisan compromises, even when they represented common sense.\n  I have another problem, though, with the Democratic health package; \nthat is, it places undue burdens on States which are already struggling \nto respond to adverse impacts of September 11. Requiring a new Federal \ninfrastructure and corresponding new State infrastructures in order to \naccess emergency funds seems to be downright unreasonable.\n  We should be working our hardest to get money to States immediately \nfor them to get it to their workers who do not have health insurance. \nWe should not penalize them by demanding that they, too, establish \nextensive new bureaucracies to get money to people in need.\n  For example, the Democrats' proposal would require many States to \nenact legislation in order to set up and fund new State infrastructures \nto certify and deliver COBRA benefits. This is obviously a nonfunded \nmandate. But in addition, the Democrats' proposal requires States to \nuse their own money. This means only those States which happen to have \nextra money in their Medicaid budget could help workers who are not \nCOBRA eligible. I am not aware any State is claiming to have extra \nMedicaid money burning a hole in its pockets for those people. I think \nthis is just plain wrong.\n  I propose to provide 100 percent Federal funding through National \nEmergency Grant Programs to allow States, then, to cover non-COBRA \neligibles.\n  Once again, I asked the Democrat leadership: Why are you insisting on \ndoing this the hard way, especially when there are much more efficient \nalternatives?\n  Now I have a few points about extended unemployment benefits to \ndislocated workers. We want to do more than just provide unemployment \nchecks. First of all, let me make it very clear. Why do you have a \nstimulus package? It is not to give unemployment checks, even though \nthat is what we are doing. But the idea of stimulating the economy is \ngetting people a job. People want a job; they don't want unemployment \nchecks. We want incentives to get workers back their paychecks.\n  But both sides agree that providing 13 weeks of additional benefit to \nworkers in need is reasonable. We have done that five times in the last \n30 years, I believe.\n  The Democratic leadership, however, wants to take finite resources \nand spread them thinly across every State so the needy will not get \nenough help. I offered to provide unemployment benefits in two ways--\nkind of take your choice. The first was to allow 13 weeks of benefits \nto be extended to those States which experienced a significant increase \nin unemployment. So what is\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\na significant increase in unemployment? In that regard, I was \ncompletely flexible.\n  In fact, I was more than willing to bring the threshold well below \nwhat the President proposed.\n  In addition, I believe that extended unemployment benefits should be \nmade available to particular industries or communities adversely \nimpacted by September 11. This should be the case even if a State as a \nwhole doesn't experience a major increase in unemployment.\n  So I hope I have made it apparent that on our side we care about \ndislocated workers and getting them unemployment and health benefits. \nThe differences are grounded in how to do it, and not whether to do it. \nI still believe that we are not that far apart and our differences can \nbe bridged. If we are willing to take the partisan blinders off and \nfocus on getting help to workers immediately instead of winning \nideological points, we can come to agreement on a proposal.\n  I have been so flexible that I know how Gumby feels.\n  So, here we are, and I am left asking why we are stuck in this \npartisan ditch. We have common ground on the investment side, consumer \nspending side, unemployment benefits, and health coverage for \ndislocated workers. Why couldn't we work out an agreement? It seems \nthat there are three reasons.\n  The first reason is that the Democratic leadership doesn't want two \nnegotiations with Republicans. They don't want to negotiate with Senate \nRepublicans first and then have to negotiate with the White House and \nHouse Republicans later in conference. I have to chuckle when I hear \nthis type of objection coming from the Senate Democratic leadership. \nWhen I was negotiating the bipartisan tax cut in the Finance Committee, \nI ran into the same objection from many in the Senate Republican \ncaucus. You know who would bring this up. They said, Grassley, don't \nnegotiate with Baucus. If you do, you will have to negotiate further to \nthe left on the Senate floor. One negotiation is better than two.\n  If I had followed that ``one negotiation'' directive, we would have \nhad chaos on the Senate floor last spring.\n  As it turned out--and for reference for people who are fearful that \nmaybe the bipartisan Senate Finance Committee agreement couldn't hold \nin conference right now--the track record of last spring is that the \nbipartisan Finance Committee agreement held on the Senate floor and \nlargely stayed intact in conference. But if the House and Senate \nparties agree to a so-called preconference strategy, which has been \ntalked about within just the last 4 or 5 hours due to our constrained \ntime now that we are getting up against adjournment this fall, I will \ncertainly support that effort and hope it happens.\n  So you can't proceed because you don't want to negotiate twice. I \nhope I have proved that is not a problem here in the Senate, if you do \nit right.\n  There is a second reason given for not negotiating.\n  It seems that many in the Senate Democratic caucus want some kind of \n``payback'' against the bipartisan tax relief legislation. In their \nview, the bipartisan deal was wrong, and with their caucus now running \nthe Senate, they do not want to see it repeated in any way. In their \nview, a bipartisan Finance Committee deal would have been a bad deal \nunless it contained all four corners of the Senate Democratic caucus \nposition. As I said, I showed movement on several issues but could not \nget movement from the other side. Everyone knows that unless both sides \nmove, you can't get a deal.\n  So here we are with basically the Senate Democratic caucus position \nas the Finance Committee bill. The bill before us is a partisan \nproduct. There is no gesture to the Republican side. The Finance \nCommittee bill says, ``Our way or the highway.'' I only ask, is this \nwhat the American people want? I didn't think so at the time of the tax \ncut last spring, and I don't think so now.\n  There is a third reason we can't get a deal. Senate Democrats say the \nHouse Republican partisan process necessitate a partisan response. We \nare kind of engaged in a game of legislative ping pong. That \nfrustration, while understandable, doesn't justify shutting out Senate \nRepublicans. Senate Republicans are not irrelevant. The House passed a \npartisan tax bill in the Spring, but that did not stop the Senate from \npassing a bipartisan package which the President signed on June 7. The \nSenate should not be rendered irrelevant because of partisan politics \nin the House.\n  The American people expect us to work together. That is what I have \nbeen trying to do over the past few months. Senate Republicans are \nflexible and willing to move toward Senate Democrats, but it is a two-\nway street and Democrats must also show movement.\n  To sum up, we want to get a bipartisan stimulus package. \nBipartisanship does not mean adopting the Senate Democratic caucus \nposition.\n  At this time, we are struck with this partisan, special interest \nDemocratic bill that came out of committee on an 11-to-10 vote. We see \nthat, even the media, like the Washington Post, call this bill a poor \nexcuse for economic stimulus. They blame lobbyists for shaping a \nstimulus bill. ``Special Interests Scramble for Tax Break's, Other \nWindfalls''. The headline of one Post article reads ``Lobbyists Shaping \nEconomic Stimulus bill.'' And it goes on to talk about companies \ngetting tax credits for millionaires and payments going to billionaire \nbison ranchers.\n  Let me note, however, that extensions of provisions that expire under \ncurrent law are matters we should address.\n  In the Finance Committee, the Democratic leadership lined the votes \nup, and we on this side were left out. That was an unfortunate outcome \nfor the Finance Committee, which has a great bipartisan tradition.\n  With some optimism, I noted at the Finance Committee markup that the \ncentrists, a group of some Republicans and some Democrats who consider \nthemselves right in the center of the political spectrum, indicated \nthat things on the Senate floor would be different. I am hopeful of \nthis sentiment expressed by the centrist group and that, combined, we \ncan get enough votes to put together a bill that will get 60 votes to \nget a bipartisan bill through. I hope this will cause the Democratic \nleadership then to engage in a bipartisan debate. It is about time the \nprocess on this bill changes and reasonable heads prevail.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Massachusetts be \nrecognized after the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kerry). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today brave young Americans are on the \nfront lines of the fight for freedom from terrorism, and here at home \nwe must work together to defeat the terrorists who would poison our \npeople, panic our society, and paralyze our democracy. An essential \npoint of protecting our homefront is protecting our economy because the \nstate of our Union cannot be strong if the state of our economy is \nweak.\n  Even before September 11, the Nation's economy was already weakening. \nThe unemployment rate had been climbing for months. Relatively few new \njobs were being created. Companies were announcing a successive round \nof layoffs. Business investment was being drastically reduced. Profits \nwere rapidly falling.\n  Last week, consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level in 7 \nyears. And 2 weeks ago, the unemployment rate took the largest jump in \n21 years. Nearly 8 million people are now out of work through no fault \nof their own, left with no pay and no golden parachute. For them and \ntheir families, life is a nightmare of missing paychecks, unpaid bills, \nlost health insurance, and no job on the horizon.\n  Surely, it is these Americans who deserve our highest priority in \nCongress. Helping these workers is the quickest way to stimulate our \neconomy. But if we act in the wrong way, a stimulus package could \nactually harm the economy.\n  The Republicans would rely almost exclusively on permanent tax cuts \nthat\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\nwould do little or nothing to promote growth when we need it most, \nwhich is right now. Their proposals are neither fair nor will they \nwork. They do not measure up to the high standard required of us. A \ntrue stimulus package cannot be a disguise for special interests, nor \ncan it run the risk of imposing large, new, long-term deficits on the \nFederal budget.\n  Permanent, new tax cuts, on top of the now nearly $2 trillion in tax \ncuts enacted earlier this year, would actually hurt the economy by \nincreasing the cost of long-term borrowing. Such cuts would discourage \nthe kind of business investments we need to encourage.\n  A true economic stimulus program must meet three criteria:\n  First, it must have an immediate impact on the economy. The dollars \nin the stimulus package must be spent in the economy as soon as \npossible. The best way to accomplish this goal is to target the funds \nto the low- and moderate-income families who are the most certain to \nspend it rather than to save it.\n  Second, the tax cuts and spending provisions in the plan must be \ntemporary. They must focus on the immediate need to generate economic \nactivity. And they must not impose substantial new long-term costs on \nthe Federal budget.\n  And third, the package must be fair. It must focus on those who need \nand deserve the help, who are suffering the most in these difficult \ndays. It must reflect the renewed national spirit of taking care of \neach other.\n  The bill reported out of the Finance Committee--and I commend Senator \nBaucus for this, as well as Senator Byrd for the homeland security \nprovisions which are part of the package--rightly gives first priority \nto the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in the current \nseriously sagging economy. It puts money directly in the hands of those \nwho will spend it immediately and will help laid off workers provide \nhealth insurance for their families.\n  Let's look at the proposal of the Finance Committee, which represents \nthe best judgment of the Democrats on this measure. Let's look at the \nheart and the soul of this particular program.\n\n  All we have to do is look at the reports over this past weekend by \nthe Nobel laureate in economics, Joseph Stiglitz:\n\n       The United States is in the midst of a recession that may \n     well turn out to be the worst in 20 years, and the \n     Republican-backed stimulus package will do little to improve \n     the economy--indeed, it may make matters worse.\n\n  We may be in the midst of the worst recession of the last 20 years, \n``and the Republican-backed stimulus package will do little to improve \nthe economy--indeed, it may make matters worse.'' That is not a \nDemocratic statement or comment, and it is repeated by economists \nacross the country.\n  What have been the proposals? The principal proposals of the \nDemocratic effort have, first of all, included unemployment \ncompensation in order to get resources out to those who are unemployed.\n  We can ask ourselves, what has been the record of the Senate over the \nperiod of recent years? My friend and colleague from Iowa talked about \nhow, in recent years, Republicans had supported unemployment \ncompensation. That is true.\n  The unemployment insurance benefits were extended four times during \nthe recession in the early 1990s. At its peak, an additional 33 weeks \nof benefits were provided. On November 15, 1991, the Senate passed an \nunemployment compensation bill to add an additional 20 weeks of \nunemployment benefits for States with high unemployment rates and 13 \nadditional weeks for other States. That vote was 91 to 2. The \nRepublican Senators voting for the extension included Senators Burns, \nCochran, Craig, Domenici, Gramm, Grassley, Jeffords, McCain, McConnell, \nMurkowski, Nickles, Smith, Specter, Stevens, and Warner, and then-\nDemocratic Senator Shelby also voted in favor of the extension. The \nvote was 91 to 2. It represented a bipartisan effort. This is virtually \nidentical to what was considered back at that particular time in 1991.\n  Then, in 1992, we were still facing the challenges of significant \nunemployment, and we passed 94 to 2 to supplement the regular benefits. \nThe bill raised the maximum additional weeks to 33 weeks of benefits \nfor States with high unemployment, and 26 weeks for all other States. \nIt was a much more dramatic bill. This bill is much more modest. That \nvote was 94 to 2. And that included the Republican leader, Senator \nLott, as well as Senator Grassley, and other Republicans.\n  Then in June of 1992, by a voice vote--and it passed--we had an \nincrease in the unemployment compensation. Then the conference came \nback, and the vote was 93 to 3. That was in 1992.\n  Then in 1993, the vote was 79 to 20.\n  What is it about the Republican leadership that they are opposed to \nthis program now? That is what these workers are asking. Not only the \nhundreds of thousands of workers who lost their jobs prior to September \n11, but all those who have lost their jobs since that time, they say: \nYou have done it before for workers. You have done it when we have \nneeded it. Why aren't you willing to do it now? That is part of the \nchallenge of the Democratic leadership to our Republican friends.\n  We have listened to the ranking minority member of the Finance \nCommittee who says: Well, we have supported it in the past. We will try \nto work something out.\n  You can work it out right now by supporting this very modest \nproposal. And it is fairly easy to understand why this has been an \nimportant provision, why this is a responsible provision. The cost of \nthis proposal: $14 billion. That is the unemployment proposal. At the \npresent time, we have $38 billion in Federal unemployment insurance \ntrust funds that have been paid on behalf of the employees. We are \ntalking about taking $14 billion out of there. We have done it in the \npast.\n  What is their resistance? What is their reluctance? Why aren't they \nwilling to look after what is most important in a recession--the real \npeople who are suffering, the workers who are suffering, men and women \nwho want to go to work today and can't go to work because their jobs \nhave been lost to them? Real people, real families. Those are the \npeople we are caring about. The funds are sufficient, obviously, to \ntake care of that. We have more than enough funds.\n  Why is this important? As we have seen before, unemployment insurance \nis an ideal stimulus. It delivers the stimulus where and when it is \nneeded. It provides $2.15 of positive impact to the GDP for every $1 \nthat is spent. That has been the history of it, according to the \nDepartment of Labor. And it has been relied on by the Congress, and the \nSenate, going back for a long period of time.\n  Let's look at what is happening out there in the real world in terms \nof the levels of newly unemployed not seen since 1992. This chart I \nhave in the Chamber, going from 250,000 to 550,000, shows what is \nhappening in 2001. It shows the greatest increase, as I mentioned, of \nthe number of unemployed workers going right up through the roof. It is \nvirtually the highest we have seen in over 10 years. It is a real \nproblem. The statistics show it. The families show it. We have the \nresources to be able to afford it. We have enacted that at other times \nin our history, and done it in a bipartisan way.\n  Now look at the percentage of unemployed workers receiving \nunemployment benefits which has declined over the last 25 years.\n  In 1975, 75 percent of those who were unemployed received \nunemployment insurance. And then, during the 1980s, the States squeezed \nback eligibility for workers who were unemployed. We have seen, as a \nresult of that, that we are down now, with figures getting further and \nfurther from what they were in 1975. We are finding out that only 38 \npercent of those workers are receiving the benefits now. We not only \nhave to do something in order to extend unemployment compensation, but \nwe also have to do something about the eligibility and who will be \neligible for that program. The Democratic program does just that. It is \none of the key important features.\n\n  (Mr. TORRICELLI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is what is happening out there. Low-wage workers \nare half as likely to receive unemployment benefits as other unemployed \nworkers, even though low-wage workers are twice as likely to be \nunemployed. That is because of the change\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\nof the rules and regulations in the States. Nationwide, they are twice \nas likely to be unemployed and they have half as much chance of getting \nany kind of coverage. In all but 13 States, unemployed workers seeking \npart-time work are not eligible for unemployment benefits. In all but \n12 States, most unemployed low-wage workers are not eligible for \nunemployment benefits.\n  The Democratic plan ensures that more than 600,000 low-wage and part-\ntime workers will receive the benefits. These are men and women whose \nemployers are paying into the fund now on their behalf. That is the \nextraordinary thing. These workers are being paid for in the fund at \nthe present time, but they are not eligible because they have been \neffectively written out with the redrafting and changes of the \nunemployment laws in their respective States. There are only 13 States \nthat even provide unemployment help and assistance for part-time \nworkers--those workers who work 30 hours a week or less.\n  What we have seen in the workforce is that there has been a very \nimportant transition to increasing what they call the temps, the part-\ntime workers. Seventy percent of those are women, because they want to \ngo into the workforce, and sometimes to expand their families and then \ngo back into the workforce. They may want to work a certain number of \nhours, and even though they are paying in under the unemployment \ncompensation, they are being left out; but not under the Democratic \nprogram. That is very important.\n  This chart shows that there are only 13 States that provide \nunemployment insurance for the part-time workers. This chart shows that \nonly 12 States provide unemployment insurance for the low-wage workers. \nThat is a dramatic difference from other times of recession we have \nseen.\n  So this proposal--one very important aspect of it, the unemployment \ninsurance--has been accepted by Republicans historically. The reason \nthey have accepted it is that, as other distinguished economists and \nthe CRS have pointed out, this program is truly a stimulus in terms of \nthe economy. It is fair, temporary, and it works. It provides very \nimportant assistance to needy families.\n  I want to take a minute--and I see others on the floor who wish to \nspeak--on another major part of our program--that is with regard to \nhealth insurance, which is important. Many colleagues remember the \ndebate we had on the Patients' Bill of Rights not long ago and what \nmany of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle said:\n\n       If we want to look at what the real problem is in America, \n     it is the 44 million people who do not have any health \n     insurance.\n\n  That was Senator Santorum on June 20.\n\n       If you have no insurance, the likelihood of getting good \n     health care in the United States is much less.\n\n  That was Senator Frist.\n\n       We will be using the health care coverage for seniors who \n     are taking arthritis medicines, men and women who are being \n     treated with chemotherapy or kidney dialysis, and families \n     waiting for loved ones to have bypass surgery. These are the \n     lives that will be disrupted, even devastated, as a direct \n     result of this bill. They are talking about the Patients' \n     Bill of Rights.\n\n  Then Senator Hutchison said:\n\n       The Kennedy-McCain bill ignores what I believe is the most \n     important patient protection, and that is affordable health \n     insurance.\n\n  Well, Mr. Republican, your problems are solved because under the \nDemocratic program we provide an effective extension of health \ninsurance for those who had it in their previous employment and lost \nit, and for those who didn't have it but need it in terms of this \nrecession. We have a lot of statements and comments about the \nimportance of extending this. And, we are doing the job.\n  Let me just review a couple of facts. The typical unemployment \nbenefit is $925 per month. The health insurance costs are about $588 \nper month, which is 63 percent of the unemployment benefit. Only 18 \npercent of workers today, if they qualify for COBRA, are able to take \nadvantage of it. It doesn't do very much for them. The Senate \nDemocratic plan provides 75-percent premium assistance. CBO estimates \nthis would cover 7.2 million workers.\n  We listened to my friend from Iowa talk about what the Republicans \nwere doing. Senate Republicans have an inadequate plan that at least \nwould provide a family with 2 weeks of COBRA. Theirs is the $3 billion, \nwhich they say can be used for unemployment compensation, health \ninsurance, and other kinds of activities in the States, leaving it up \nto the States. We heard that outlined, but the numbers weren't \ndescribed. If they use it all for health to offset premiums, it will \nlast for 2 weeks for COBRA. So when we recognize the difference, it is \nvery real.\n  The next chart demonstrates $925 a month as the average unemployment. \nIn order to recover your COBRA, it is 65 percent of that. As a result, \nvery few are able to do it. If we have the Democratic program, the \namount that will be required will only be 16 percent. That will result \nin about 80 percent of all of those being covered.\n  This chart shows who recovered. Nearly half of all workers are not \neligible for COBRA, including workers in small businesses of fewer than \n20, workers in businesses that go out of business, individuals who buy \nindividual coverage, those whose employers do not offer health \ninsurance or cannot afford to take it up. They are excluded. What do we \ndo? They need an affordable health option.\n  We Democrats are proposing a new Medicaid State option to cover these \nworkers. CBO has estimated that 2\\1/2\\ million workers will benefit \nfrom our plan. The Republican plan has no relief for these workers; \nzero will be included. The administration proposes to take funds from \nthe CHIP program for these workers, to cover the workers they would \nlike to cover, which is basically taking money that is guaranteed to \nthe States, on which the States rely to provide coverage for uncovered \nchildren. It is effectively robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  On this chart, if you look at the categories on the Democratic and \nRepublican packages:\n\n       Guarantees workers help paying COBRA, who will have COBRA \n     but find difficulty in affording it.\n\n  We would help the 7.2 million unemployed Americans. The Republican \nbill has no guarantee.\n\n       Providing help for displaced workers.\n\n  We provide 2\\1/2\\ million Americans with coverage. There is no such \ncoverage under the Republicans.\n\n       Provide the State fiscal relief by improving Federal \n     Medicaid payments.\n\n  That is what they call an ``enhanced match,'' which has been so \nsuccessful to get children. We provide that, and the best estimate at \nCBO is that 4 million will be covered.\n  If one is concerned about health care, this is how it gets done. It \nis not just what we are saying; it is what the CRS and the CBO says. \nThis is an effective program to deal with the health aspects of this \nproposal.\n  If we are talking about something that is going to be temporary, if \nwe are talking about something that is going to be stimulative, if we \nare talking about something that is fair, these aspects of the Finance \nCommittee proposal meet all of those criteria. It will assist those who \nare impacted--working families. It will give them some lift. We have \ndone that in a bipartisan way historically.\n  We ask the question: Where are our Republican friends? Why are they \nnot joining us as they did at other times? If you understand the \nimportance of health care, this is the best way to do it. If they have \na better way of doing it, I am sure our leadership and the Finance \nCommittee will welcome that opportunity. This will ensure that workers \nwho need health care for their families are going to be able to \nmaintain their coverage, and the health industry, which is so important \nto our country, is going to prosper. This is limited to 1 year. It is a \n1-year stimulus program.\n  The democratic plan helps ensure that States do not have to make \nbudget cuts that would undermine any Federal stimulus. States have \nyearly balanced budget requirements and many are already looking at \nmajor budget cuts to meet those requirements. To help keep State \neconomies strong, our plan freezes planned Federal Medicaid cuts and \nenhances the Medicaid matching rate by up to 3 percent for States that \nagree not to cut back on their coverage. This plan will provide \nimmediate assistance to States and help assure they do not have to make \nbudget cuts that put us deeper in recession.\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\n  The Democratic plan is also a fair balance between tax incentives and \nspending incentives for the economy. The tax incentives in the plan \nmeet the three essential criteria for a stimulus--they will put money \ninto the economy now, they do not impose substantial new long-term \ncosts on the federal budget, and they treat fairly those who are most \nin need.\n  Seventy percent of Americans today pay more in payroll taxes than in \nincome taxes. Yet many of them received no tax rebate earlier this \nyear. The rebate unfairly ignored these low- and moderate-income \nfamilies. A one-time rebate of payroll taxes to them now will \nimmediately inject $15 billion into the economy, placing the dollars in \nthe hands of people who are likely to spend them immediately. \nEconomists tell us that families with modest incomes are likely to \nspend the extra money they receive right away on needed consumer goods. \nThose with higher incomes are more likely to save it.\n  The Democratic bill also includes temporary, targeted tax cuts to \nstimulate immediate business activity. These changes provide more \nfavorable treatment for new investments now, and they deserve to be \nsupported.\n  Because the tax cuts in the Democratic plan are truly designed to be \nan immediate economic stimulus, they do not incur any substantial cost \nbeyond 2003. This point is vital to our economic recovery. Enacting new \npermanent tax cuts which can trigger large long-term Federal deficits \nwould be counterproductive. Permanent new tax cuts--on top of the \nnearly $2 trillion in tax cuts enacted earlier this year--would \nactually hurt the economy now, by raising the cost of long-term \nborrowing and discouraging the kinds of investment we need most today.\n  The House of Representatives passed, by the narrowest of margins, a \nso-called stimulus package that will not stimulate economic growth in \nthe short term, and will not be affordable in the long term. It merely \nrepackages old, unfair, permanent tax breaks which were rejected by \nCongress last spring under the new label of ``economic stimulus.'' The \nAmerican people deserve better.\n  The long-term cost of the House plan is too high, and less than half \nof the dollars would reach the economy next year. The House plan offers \n$46 billion in tax breaks to big businesses by permanently repealing \nthe corporate alternative minimum tax and by giving permanent new tax \ncuts for multinational corporations. These provisions are an \nunacceptable giveaway of public resources.\n  The alternative suggested by our Republican colleagues in the Senate \nis also flawed. Their proposal to accelerate the reduction of upper \nincome tax rates would cost $120 billion over the next decade. Only a \nsmall percentage of these dollars--less than one dollar in four--would \ngo into the economy in 2002. And these dollars would go to those least \nlikely to spend them. The result would be little immediate stimulus, \nlarge long-term costs, and a grossly unfair distribution to the \nwealthiest individuals in our society.\n\n  In fact, the House Republican proposal gives $115 billion in \npermanent new tax breaks to wealthy individuals and corporations, while \nthe Senate plan would give them $142 billion in new tax breaks. Yet \neach of the Republican tax plans provide only $14 billion for low- and \nmoderate-income families. Under the GOP plan, the tax cuts for \ncorporations and wealthy individuals are permanent, while the cuts for \nworking families are limited to just 1 year. The result is unfair, and \nit will not provide the economic stimulus that the Nation urgently \nneeds now.\n  Our Democratic alternative also includes key steps to make our \ncountry stronger and safer. It includes needed resources to fight \nbioterrorism and improve our ability to respond to an attack. It will \nhelp detect an attack by strengthening our public health system. It \nwill help treat the victims of an attack by making sure that our \nhospitals and other health facilities are better prepared. It will \nexpand pharmaceutical stockpiles and develop new treatments. We owe it \nto the American people to take these steps now, and we need this \nlegislation to do that.\n  Perhaps never before in history has our Nation faced such grave \nchallenges. The tragedy of September 11 has touched us all. Together, \nwe witnessed a horror we could not have imagined and bravery which \ninspires us all. The tragedy may have shaken our basic assumptions \nabout the world in which we live, but Americans have not retreated in \nfear. Instead, they have risen to meet these new challenges. The spirit \nof September 11 has compelled vast numbers of our fellow citizens to \nask what they can do for their communities and our country.\n  It is time for Congress to do its part. We must respond to the \neconomic crisis the Nation faces. As we do so, we must show our \ndedication to America's best ideals. As we fight for a safer society, \nwe can also create a more just society at the same time. September 11 \nhas taught all Americans that we need to help each other as never \nbefore.\n  We will not ignore the plight of millions of Americans hurt by this \ntragedy and by economic forces beyond their control. As we work \ntogether to get our economy moving again, we can also work together to \nsee that none are left behind. We have a unique opportunity to give \nhelp and hope to every American as we enact a stimulus plan that puts \nAmerica back to work.\n  The American people are meeting this challenge, and we must \ndemonstrate to them that Congress is capable of meeting it, too. The \ntest we face now is to pass a stimulus package that truly lifts the \neconomy, and lifts it fairly and responsibly. The American people are \nwatching this debate closely, and they are waiting for our answer.\n  I hope Americans who are paying attention to this debate understand \nthe dramatic contrast between what has been suggested by our Republican \nfriends and the proposal that has been advanced by our Finance \nCommittee. Hopefully, we will gain their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee for yielding the time, and I compliment him on \nhis extraordinary leadership in bringing the Senate to this moment.\n  It may well be that this Nation was headed towards an economic \ndownturn before September 11. We may debate that fact, but there is no \nmistaking that every State in the Nation is now facing a dramatic \nchange in economic circumstances.\n  In October, the unemployment rate rose one-half point, to 5.4 percent \nof working Americans; 400,000 people lost their jobs, including 8,000 \nin my State of New Jersey alone.\n  As this has affected our families individually, the economic change \nhas affected our States collectively. Thirty States are now clearly in \na position of economic recession.\n  The Senate is faced with two very different philosophies in dealing \nwith this change of economic circumstances. The Senate Finance \nCommittee, under Chairman Baucus leadership, has sought to address both \nthe causes of the downturn and those most dramatically affected by the \neconomic downturn.\n  The bill, as Senator Kennedy has illustrated, provides 13 weeks of \nextended unemployment benefits. It makes many part-time workers \neligible. These are the people on the front line of our economic \ndifficulties, and rightfully and exclusively, this bill, among the \nalternatives before us, provides the most help to families who, through \nno fault of their own, now find themselves wanting for rent payments, \nmortgage payments, or tuitions, and only have the bridge of \nunemployment benefits to get them through the crisis.\n  In New Jersey, this means 50,000 people will be able to continue \ntheir unemployment benefits or face the prospect of no help at all; \n11,000 part-time workers in New Jersey, the most vulnerable of the \nvulnerable, will be able to continue their benefits.\n  The bill also addresses the reality that as people lose their jobs, \ntheir problems are compounded by the emergency situation of also losing \nhealth benefits. The legislation provides a 75-percent subsidy for \nlaid-off workers to purchase COBRA insurance.\n  As families are vulnerable, so are the States. The National \nGovernors' Association projects State revenues to be $30 billion less \nthan previously forecast. As we all know, as the States\n\n[[Page S11706]]\n\nstart to reduce their budgets to deal with the budgetary emergencies, \nthe first to suffer will be education and health care.\n  Twenty-nine States already face $600 million of projected reductions \nin what they will be able to provide in health care. The Baucus bill \nprovides $5 billion directly to States through an increase in Medicaid \nmatching funds.\n  These provisions are all national in scope. They help every State in \nthe Nation deal with this economic emergency, but, in fact, as acute as \nthe situation is nationally, regionally it is the most severe. While \nall the Nation is in pain, it is most severe in those areas directly \nimpacted by the terrorist attacks on September 11.\n  It would be no surprise to anyone in the Senate to know the economic \ndownturn is affecting the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut areas most \ndirectly. The attacks not only killed thousands of people, but for \nthose left behind, those whom they loved and their neighbors, the \neconomic impact is particularly acute. Prior to September 11, 300,000 \npeople worked in Lower Manhattan in the impact area. Since the attacks, \n125,000 people have been displaced; 19,000 have already left the city; \n35 million square feet of office space is currently unavailable.\n\n  Indeed, in Battery Park City, home to thousands of New Yorkers in \nLower Manhattan, only 30 percent of the tens of thousands of residents \nhave returned to their homes.\n  The simple truth is, as a matter of employment and residency, Lower \nManhattan will never be the same without Federal assistance. This \nlegislation dealing with the economic emergency in the Nation, as it \ndeals with national unemployment, the national health care situation, \nthe national need for stimulus, focuses in particular on the fact there \nis an acute economic emergency in Manhattan.\n  The legislation that I offered with Senator Schumer and Senator \nClinton contains $5 billion in economic assistance to New York. I make \nno apologies for offering this legislation. Almost unbelievably, I have \nread in the national media that somehow this constitutes some form of \nspecial interest legislation.\n  The terrorists may have attacked buildings that were in New York, but \nthis was an assault on America, on every American, and it tests our \nconcept of national union whether when an individual city, State, or \ngroup of people are attacked, whether we respond as a city or State or \nwe respond as a country.\n  I may live in New Jersey, but on September 11 my country was \nattacked, and we should all respond as Americans.\n  If there is a special interest contained in this legislation to deal \nwith residency and employment, the economic stability and the \nreconstruction of New York, let us identify that special interest.\n  The interest is, we are all Americans, we are all in this together, \nand we will respond together. That is the interest being tested.\n  Now, indeed, the pain may be particular to New York, but it is shared \nwith their neighbors whom I represent in the State of New Jersey. Two \nhundred thousand New Jersey residents are employed in Lower Manhattan, \nor they were employed, because 40 percent of the people who worked in \nthe World Trade Center lived with their families in New Jersey. Fifteen \nthousand people lost their place of employment if they did not also \nlose their lives. Sixty-six thousand people from New Jersey commuted \nevery day to Lower Manhattan on the PATH railroad system, all of which \nto Lower Manhattan is now in shambles.\n  The $5 billion in tax incentives will apply to the 1.6-square-mile \nrecovery zone around the World Trade Center. That is where people I \nrepresent worked every day. They lost their offices. Many lost their \ncompanies. Most lost their means of employment with which to feed their \nfamilies and raise their children.\n  Special interests? Very special. Keeping these people employed, their \nfamilies alive and prosperous, that is our special interest.\n  This $5 billion in tax incentives includes a $4,800 employee wage tax \ncredit for existing and new hirers to try to keep employment stability \nin Lower Manhattan so a bad situation does not get worse; second, $10 \nbillion in private activity bonding authority to rebuild the real \nestate in the impacted zone; third, to encourage businesses to stay and \nreinvest in Lower Manhattan. The bill will allow the cost of \nreplacement property to be deducted as a loss.\n  There is no better symbol to the world of American resolve, our \ndetermination to survive, than to rebuild in this economic zone and to \nprovide stability for employment in the impacted area. That is exactly \nwhat we intend to do.\n  Then there is the question of the Nation's infrastructure. We are not \nresponding properly to the recession, this economic emergency, if we \nprovide for unemployment benefits, provide for health insurance, \nprovide for the areas most acutely impacted, if we do not also do \nsomething about the national infrastructure.\n  I yield to Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from California be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. This package is not complete if we deal with \nunemployment and health benefits and the impacted area of New York, but \nwe do not also do something about the national infrastructure.\n  The truth is this Nation had a severe infrastructure problem long \nbefore there was a recession. Thirty-three percent of the Nation's half \nmillion bridges are structurally deficient. Fourteen million children \nattend schools that are a decade or two beyond the needs of basic \nrepairs. The time to do that work is when we have workers to do it.\n  In 6 months or a year, as commercial construction activity in the \nNation slows and people employed in the building trades add to the \nranks of the unemployed, the one means of keeping them working is to do \nthe work for the Nation that already needs to be done. Yet our \nRepublican friends and even some in the media call this a special \ninterest--pork.\n\n  Can building a school for a child in a deficient structure ever be a \nneedless expenditure? It may be safe for someone in some media outlet \nor someone who feels good about their own child to call building a \nschool pork. To me, it is meeting a basic obligation.\n  I have placed in this bill, and I make no apologies for it, a major \nnational investment in national infrastructure to build high-speed rail \nlines. It is right and it is proper. As was demonstrated on September \n11, this Nation's transportation infrastructure is fragile. When it is \ninterrupted, business stops, employment declines, and the Nation's \neconomy suffers. This economic downturn is an opportunity, once again, \nto increase employment by modernizing our infrastructure, as we have \ndone in almost every recession in the last 50 years.\n  As the chart to my left illustrates, as we try now to provide duality \nin our national transportation infrastructure so the Nation is not \nentirely dependent on an aircraft system, this chart demonstrates how \nmuch each of these Federal Governments contributes to the construction \nof rail systems.\n  In Germany, the government provides 21 percent; France, 20 percent; \nthe United Kingdom, almost 18 percent; and the United States of \nAmerica, .04 percent of our rail system is provided by the Federal \nGovernment. It is therefore no wonder the Nation is largely without a \nmodern high-speed rail system outside of the Northeast corridor.\n  The amendment I provide in this economic stimulus package provides $9 \nbillion in bonding authority which will be repaid by Amtrak. The \nFederal Government only pays the interest on these bonds. It would cost \n$4 billion to provide modern systems throughout the country, in the \nSoutheast from Washington to Jacksonville, including Virginia, North \nand South Carolina and Georgia; a modern high-speed rail system from \nOrlando-Miami-Tampa; on the gulf coast, from Houston and New Orleans, \neventually to Atlanta; and a Midwestern Express covering nine States.\n  This is the moment. We need to employ people. Ridership is soaring. \nThe demand is clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. This is the moment to build this high-speed rail \nsystem. It is in this legislation. It is identical to the legislation \ncosponsored by 56 Senators, including Senator Lott and Senator Daschle. \nUse this moment to build this system.\n  The legislation also includes $2 billion toward the engineering and \nconstruction of a new Trans-Hudson tunnel between New York and New \nJersey. This is vital. There has not been a rail tunnel built between \nNew York, connecting it with the rest of the Nation, since 1920.\n  The existing tunnels do not have escape mechanisms. They do not have \nadequate fire protection. They are old and they are slow. This \nlegislation will immediately begin the engineering and then the funding \nof a new rail tunnel. So if in any future emergency or terrorist attack \nwe lose the existing tunnels, there will be one safe, modern, fast \ntunnel to connect New York with the remainder of the Nation and allow \nin New Jersey an Amtrak for the rest of the country to expand the rail \ncommuter network, which is now at capacity, to get more people out of \ntheir automobiles and onto trains, throughout suburban New Jersey, into \nManhattan.\n\n  Nothing would convince employers to remain in Manhattan longer and \ninvest better than the knowledge there will be a rail network to get \nemployees there in the decades ahead. Our constituents are giving us \nexactly that message. Ridership is up 45 percent from New Jersey to New \nYork City since September 11. Amtrak now runs 21 trains per hour \nthrough the existing tunnel capacity. They need to get that rate to 45. \nThis new tunnel can add 20 trains an hour. We can get people out of \ntheir cars. We can get them into safe trains. This legislation contains \nexactly that capacity.\n  This is simply a good economic stimulus package. It is good in what \nit does to the unemployed. It is good in what it does for vulnerable \nfamilies. It provides the proper public works to get people employed \nand keep them employed and make the national investments we need for \nthe coming decades.\n  I am proud of it. It is the right thing. It is good legislation. I \nthank Senator Baucus. I thank my colleagues for being responsive to New \nYork, New Jersey, and the Connecticut region during this time of \ncrisis. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to do so \nwith pride.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Seeing no one else on the floor, I ask unanimous consent \nfor an additional 5 minutes for a total of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have not spoken on the floor of the \nSenate in a long time. The issues have been coming fast and furiously \ntoward us. Today I will discuss with my colleagues in the Senate the \nvery important economic stimulus bill. Beyond that, before I turn to \nthat bill, I will discuss what I consider to be the three most pressing \nmatters to deal with, in addition to our normal appropriations work.\n  One of those is certainly this economic stimulus package. The last \neconomic data we had showed the greatest loss of jobs in 1 month for 21 \nyears. It has been 21 years since we have lost so many jobs in 1 month. \nWe must take up this economic stimulus bill. We have been hit hard by \nthe terrorists, and before that we were beginning to see a slowdown in \nour economy. The combination of the two is simply not acceptable.\n  Another pressing need is aviation security. I say in no uncertain \nterms I cannot say what the President says to the American people: Get \nin those planes and fly. I want to say those words, and I will say \nthose words when we have passed the laws we need to pass to make flying \nas safe as possible.\n  We do not now screen and check all the bags that are in the \nunderbelly of the planes. We don't check and screen the cargo for \nbombs. No, we do not. We do not have screeners who are a well-trained \nsecurity force. We do not have air marshals on every flight. We do not \nhave yet a secure cockpit always locked and not open during the flight.\n\n  These are four basic measures we have learned are the key to aviation \nsecurity. El Al, that runs the Israeli airline, has told us very \nclearly: There are no secrets; these are the things we have to do. When \nwe do those things, I will look in the eyes of your constituent and \nmine, and I will say not what I am saying today, which is, yes, it is \nsafer than it was on September 11; but I can look at them and say the \nskies are as safe as we can make them.\n  To be a Pollyanna, to stand up and say, come fly with me--as the \nFrank Sinatra song goes--I cannot do it. I fly a lot. I am in the air a \nlot to do my work. As I said, I know we are safer than we were before \nSeptember 11, but we are nowhere near where we should be. I call on the \nconferees to get moving. I call on the House Republican leaders to get \noff their ideological problems and understand the same old way of doing \nbusiness with private security handling the bags is a failure.\n  That is something we must do right away. We also need a package for \nhomeland defense or homeland security. Senator Byrd has a wonderful, \nwell-thought-out package which will become, I hope, part of the \neconomic stimulus at a later time. It is modest in its approach but \nwill allow us to vaccinate every man, woman, and child against smallpox \nand, God forbid if we have to, against anthrax, and develop the kind of \nwork we need to prevent bioterrorism, protect our nuclear powerplants. \nAgain, airport security, chemical plants, and we will give special \ngrants to law enforcement, local and State, and rebuild our public \nhealth system so when we have a problem the local people, the first \nresponders, will have the wherewithall to do what it takes.\n  I am very happy that Senator Byrd will be doing this. It ought to \nbecome part of the stimulus package because not only do we need it for \nthe defense of our country, but we also know those dollars will be \nspent and every one of those dollars will help provide jobs.\n  That gets me to where we are right now, this economic stimulus \npackage dealing with tax cuts. If you want to see the difference \nbetween Republicans and Democrats, if you are sitting at home and \nscratching your head and saying, aren't these guys and gals all alike, \nI say take a look at this package. What do the Republicans do, to the \ntune of more than $20 billion over 10 years? They give big dollars to \nthose who have them--surprise. They give $1.4 billion to IBM. The last \nI checked, they earned $5.7 billion in the year 2000. The last I \nchecked they were laying off people, not hiring people. Is that what we \nwant to do, reward them for that?\n  Ford Motor, a $1 billion refund check; their corporate profits were \n$9.4 billion. General Motors, $833 million? Their corporate profits in \n2000 were $2.9 billion. And, GE, a $671 million refund check. Their \ncorporate profits were $9.3 billion.\n\n  I do not know how to say this in a way that doesn't sound harsh, but \nin the nicest way I can say it, it is this. I believe you have said it \nin your way as well, Mr. President.\n  For people to use the 9-11 tragedy, which you felt in your State--in \nyour heart, with perhaps a few of you in this body more than any of \nus--to use 9-11 as an excuse to do something that these Republicans \nhave wanted to do since the minute they took over control of the \nCongress, which is to reward their biggest contributors, is nothing \nless than unpatriotic. It is my feeling. It is how I feel. It is my \nopinion. It is not a fact. It is my opinion.\n  Let my say it again. To use 9-11 as an excuse to pay back your \nbiggest contributors--who are laying off people, by the way, and who \nare doing just fine, thank you very much--is a disgrace.\n  If you want to see the difference in the parties, look at our tax \ncuts. They deal with ways to stimulate investment by businesses by \ngiving a bonus depreciation to encourage investments in capital \nequipment, additional depreciation for small business, net operating \nloss carrybacks that will help companies that have done well in the \nlast few years but not as well recently to get an immediate tax refund, \nand we propose giving tax rebates to those who were left out earlier \nthis year.\n  I know Republicans have that provision as well. But the lion's share \nof\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\nwhat they do is this--and how about this--escalate the tax breaks so \nthe wealthiest people among us get back $16,000 a year.\n  That is not $16,000 over 10 years. That is $16,000 in a year. Those \nare the people earning over $1 million a year. Thank you--they are \ndoing fine, and they are not going to spend the money.\n  We had an interesting meeting with the former Treasury Secretary who \npresided over the greatest economic recovery our country has ever seen, \nRobert Rubin. He told us that those in that top bracket are not going \nto spend that money. They are spending everything they can spend.\n  These corporations are not going to put anybody to work when they get \ntheir refund checks. These are the people who are slimming down, who \nare cutting back. So what kind of economic stimulus is the Republican \nplan? It is a giveaway to the wealthiest people at the expense of \neverybody else.\n  And, might I add, it is a budget buster. It is a budget buster. When \nyou look at the costs of the Grassley plan and the House plan, what are \nwe looking at over the period? We are looking at about $170 billion \nover the period. When we look at our plan, even if you add on the \nhomeland security, you are looking at about $60 billion over the 10-\nyear period.\n  So they are bringing us right back into the deficit hole where they \ntook us in the first place and it took a Democratic administration to \nget us out of that mess. Now they are putting us right back in the \nmess, deficits as far as the eye can see. To do what? Help the richest \npeople in the country, the richest corporations.\n  I remember the days when there wasn't an alternative minimum tax \nbecause I was over on the House side when we decided it was outrageous \nthat the biggest corporations in the country were paying zero taxes. I \nremember that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes remaining before the \ndebate on the nomination.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 4 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think you were in the House at that time \nas well, when we closed that terrible loophole and we made sure these \ncompanies, these companies that were popping champagne corks on tax day \nbecause they paid nothing in the defense of their country, paid nothing \nto educate one child, they paid nothing to give health care to one \nchild, and we said that was wrong and we walked down the path and we \nput in a fair alternative minimum tax.\n  Here they are, boys; they are back. They are back and they are trying \nto go back to those days when the largest corporations in America paid \nzero.\n  Again, to use the 9-11 tragedy as an excuse to do this is beyond my \nability to express. I usually don't have too much trouble, but this is \nhorrific.\n  Let's not go back to those days in the 1980s. I will give an example. \nSenator Robert Byrd told a story about a woman in Milwaukee, the mother \nof three children, who in 1983 earned $12,000. On that income, she paid \nmore taxes than Boeing, GE, DuPont, and Texaco put together. Welcome \nback to those days, if you go with that House plan.\n  Senator Grassley just does away with this prospectively. The House \ngives them a rebate for the past. He doesn't do that, but he does away \nwith it for the future. So I will be able to stand up here, if he \nprevails, and say the same thing next year: A woman earning $12,000 \npaid more in taxes than all these corporations together. I do not want \nto go there.\n  Here is the bottom line. We have the best economist in the world \ntelling us the House plan and the Senate Republican bill will make \nthings worse. That is Joseph Stiglitz, awarded the Nobel Prize in \neconomics last month. He says the family earning $50,000 would get \nzero, but the Republican plan would give $50,000 over 4 years to \nfamilies making $4 million a year.\n  What are we doing? This is a time we need to get money into this \neconomy. We need to jump-start this economy. It started to go down when \nPresident Bush came in. With 9-11, it has gone straight this way. We \nbetter do something that gets it going.\n  So we have a lot of work to do. I can only hope the American people \nwill weigh in, in this debate, and understand the average American with \nthe Republican plan gets nothing, gets big deficits again that will \nfall on their children, and the big corporations and the most wealthy \namong us will be ready to pop their champagne corks.\n  That is not fair. It is not just. It is not what 9-11 was all about. \nI hope we can stop it, come together, and have a fair plan for all \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11708-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11708-S11711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF EDITH BROWN CLEMENT, OF LOUISIANA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n                  CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 4:45 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now go into executive session and \nproceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 511, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Edith Brown \nClement, of Louisiana, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order there will be 15 \nminutes for debate, time to be equally divided by the chairman and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee. At 5 o'clock, a vote will \nfollow on that nomination. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent the time be equally charged against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate the nominee and her family \non her nomination, confirmation and what is soon to be her appointment \nto the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I also \ncommend the Senators from Louisiana for working with the committee and \nthe majority leader and working with the President to bring this \nnomination forward and to have the Senate act to confirm Judge Clement.\n  I take special pride in this confirmation because we are finally \nbringing some help to the Fifth Circuit. Since 1999, Chief Judge King \nof the 5th Circuit has declared a state of emergency in the Circuit \nsuch that the hearing and determination of cases and controversies \ncould be conducted by panels of three judges selected without regard to \nthe qualification in 28 U.S.C. section 46(b) that a majority of each \npanel be composed of judges of the 5th Circuit.\n  I well recall when delays in the confirmation process over the last \nseveral years threw the 2nd Circuit into a similar emergency in March \n1998, and how hard I worked to get those five vacancies filled to end \nthat emergency in my Circuit. I am glad that we are proceeding with \nJudge Clement today in order to try to help the 5th Circuit.\n  Judge Edith Brown Clement from Louisiana was among the first nominees \nsent to this committee by the President. Unfortunately, in the wake of \nthe Republican leader's objection to keeping that nomination and many \nothers pending over the August recess, Senate rules required that her \nnomination be returned to the President without action as the Senate \nbegan its August recess. She was nominated again in September to serve \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which encompasses \nthe States of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n  This is one of the many Circuits that were left with multiple \nvacancies at the end of the Clinton administration. Since January 23, \n1997, Judge Garwood's seat on the 5th Circuit has been vacant. Despite \nthe fact that former President Clinton nominated Jorge Rangel to fill \nthis vacancy in July of 1997, Mr. Rangel never received\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\na hearing and his nomination was returned on October 21, 1998. On \nSeptember 16, 1999, former President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno \nto fill the same vacancy. Once again, the nominee did not receive a \nhearing.\n  Since April 7, 1999, the seat previously occupied by Judge Duhe of \nthe 5th Circuit has been vacant. Although former President Clinton \nnominated Alston Johnson to fill that vacancy only 15 days later, on \nApril 22, 1999, Mr. Johnson was never granted a hearing by the \nJudiciary Committee in 1999, during all of 2000, or during the first \nmonths of this year while his nomination was still pending.\n  Over the last several years I have commented on those vacancies as I \nurged action on the nominations of Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and \nAlston Johnson to fill those vacancies on the 5th Circuit. None of \nthose nominees were ever provided a hearing or acted upon by the \nSenate. After 15 months without action, Mr. Rangel asked not to be re-\nnominated. After 15 months and two nominations, Enrique Moreno's \nnomination was returned to the President without action. After nearly \n23 months and two nominations without action, Mr. Johnson's nomination \nwas withdrawn by President Bush in March of 2001.\n  The nominations hearing for Judge Clement was the first hearing for a \nnominee to the 5th Circuit in 7 years--since September 14, 1994. She \nwill likewise be the first judge confirmed to the 5th Circuit in 7 \nyears.\n  Since July 2001, when the Senate was allowed to reorganize and the \ncommittee membership was set, we have maintained a strong effort to \nconsider judicial and executive nominees. With the confirmation of \nJudge Clement, we reach yet additional milestone. Judge Clement is the \nfifth nominee to the Courts of Appeals confirmed by the Senate since \nJuly 20 this year. We have now confirmed as many Court of Appeals \nnominees as were confirmed during the first year of the first Bush \nadministration and two more than were confirmed during the first year \nof the Clinton administration. I thank the Majority Leader, the \nJudiciary Committee and all Senators for their cooperation in reaching \nthis important goal.\n  In addition, I note that by confirming our 18th judicial nominee, we \nhave now confirmed more total judges this year than were confirmed in \n1989, the first year of the first Bush administration. With the \nconfirmations of Judges Armijo, Bowdre, Friot, and Wooten last week, \nthe Senate confirmed its 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th District Court \njudges for the year and matched and then exceeded the number of \nDistrict Court judges confirmed in 1989, which was 10.\n  With the confirmation of Judge Wooten last week, the Senate confirmed \nits 17th judge over all and matched the number of judges confirmed in \nall of the 1996 session. With the confirmation of Judge Clement to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit we have exceeded that total \nfor the 1996 session. Of course, in 1996, the Senate majority at that \ntime did not proceed on a single nominee to a Court of Appeals and \nlimited itself to confirming only 17 judges to the District Courts.\n  Thus, despite all the upheavals we have experienced this year with \nthe shifts in chairmanship and, more importantly, the need to focus our \nattention on responsible action in the fight against international \nterrorism, we have matched or beaten the number of confirmations of \njudges during the first year of first Bush administration and the last \nyear of the first Clinton term.\n  As a judge on the Court of Appeals, Judge Clement will have a vital \nrole to play in protecting and preserving our civil liberties in the \ndays ahead. Our system of checks and balances requires that the \njudicial branch review the acts of the political branches. I trust that \nJudge Clement will take this responsibility seriously and will rely on \nour rich history of judicial precedent to make wise decisions in the \nchallenging times ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah has 1 minute 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto use the remaining time of the Senator from Utah, unless he appears. \nI will then immediately yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wanted to highlight that the Fifth \nCircuit is one of those circuits where for the last 6 or 7 years there \nwas a refusal to hold any hearings on the nominees. I think we are \nchanging the way things have been done in the past. On this nomination, \nthere was a hearing within weeks after the nominee had cleared all the \npaperwork. I applaud the majority leader for bringing this nomination \nbefore the Senate.\n  I also thank the members of the Judiciary Committee, and the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, who voted for this nominee on a \nrollcall vote in the committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for the \nnomination of Edith Brown Clement to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit. She has made a well-respected name for herself both as a \nlitigator and as a Federal district court judge.\n  Judge Clement graduated from Tulane University School of Law in 1972. \nAfter graduation, she accepted a clerkship with U.S. District Judge \nH.W. Christenberry in the Eastern District of Louisiana. At the \nculmination of her clerkship, Judge Clement began a 16 year career as a \nlitigator, eventually becoming a partner at the New Orleans firm of \nJones, Walker. As a practitioner, she developed an expertise in \nadmiralty and maritime law, and litigated a multitude of complex and \nnuanced cases.\n  In 1991, President G.H.W. Bush nominated Judge Clement to be a \nFederal district judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana--the same \ncourt for which she had served as a law clerk more than 15 years \nearlier. As a judge, she has written extensively on admiralty law as \nwell as issues of general interest to practitioners.\n  I must note that although Judge Clement's confirmation hearing was \nheld on October 4, she was still receiving written questions from \nJudiciary Committee members nearly 1 month later. In fact, she received \na lengthy set of questions from one member on November 1, the same date \nher nomination was voted out of committee. Judge Clement nevertheless \ncooperated fully and answered the questions promptly. I wish to commend \nher and the Department of Justice for their efforts in complying with \nthe requests of committee members.\n  During her tenure, Judge Clement has served with honor and \ndistinction. She has proven herself to be exceptionally qualified for a \nposition on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I praise President \nBush for recognizing that fact by nominating her to serve on that \ncourt. I wholeheartedly support Judge Clement's nomination, and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Edith Brown \nClement to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit today, but I \ndo so with some reservations. I rise today to discuss my concerns for \nthe record and to comment on the issue of privately funded judicial \neducation about which I questioned Judge Clement.\n  Judge Clement has served for nearly a decade as a U.S. district judge \nin Louisiana. She is supported by my two colleagues from Louisiana and \nreceived a ``well-qualified'' rating from a majority of the ABA's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary. There is nothing in her \nrecord as a judge that gives me reason not to support her nomination.\n  At Judge Clement's hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nKohl asked her two questions concerning her attendance at a number of \njudicial education seminars sponsored by free-market economics \norganizations. Let me quote the full exchange between Senator Kohl and \nJudge Clement:\n\n       Senator Kohl. I would like to turn briefly to the topic of \n     privately-funded judicial seminars, or what some have called \n     junkets for judges. Your financial disclosure forms indicate \n     that you have attended a significant number of these seminars \n     in recent years, including a seminar on environmental law \n     hosted by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the \n     Environment.\n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\n       As you are probably aware, such seminars have come under \n     intense scrutiny based on evidence that the seminars are one-\n     sided and that they are being funded by corporations and \n     special interest groups that have an interest in Federal \n     court litigation. Senator Kerry and Senator Feingold have \n     introduced legislation that would ban these kinds of trips.\n       Do you think that those Senators are correct to be \n     concerned about these trips, and might you support their kind \n     of legislation?\n       Judge Clement. Well, as you know, judicial officers are \n     frequently invited to participate as speakers or participants \n     in programs dealing with judicial education, as well as \n     continuing legal education for lawyers, as well as \n     participate in lectures to law students. My experience has \n     shown that the panels and the speakers are from a widely \n     diverse group, that there is a representation from private \n     industry as well as from government and public officials, as \n     well as from the law schools, including the deans of the law \n     schools and the faculty members.\n       So to that extent, my participation in programs, either as \n     a speaker or as a participant, has reflected that there is a \n     wide variety of opinions expressed. I think it is a very \n     broad-based presentation of issues dealing with \n     constitutional law, as well as antitrust and economic, as \n     well as environmental issues. So to that extent, I don't see \n     a problem with the educational opportunities afforded to the \n     judiciary.\n       Senator Kohl. Do you plan to continue these types of \n     seminars in terms of your attendance in the event that you \n     are confirmed to the fifth circuit?\n       Judge Clement. Well, some of the seminars are basic \n     economics which, of course, I have completed. And then there \n     is an advanced economics, which I have completed. Some of the \n     seminars are focused on the Constitution, some are focused on \n     environmental issues. So to the extent that I haven't already \n     been exposed to that information and to the extent that I am \n     impressed with the faculty that's being presented, I would \n     evaluate the opportunity at that time when presented with the \n     invitation.\n\n  I was concerned about this exchange for a number of reasons. First, \nJudge Clement seemed to minimize her participation in judicial \neducation seminars that are put on for judges by outside interest \ngroups. The question Senator Kohl posed was not about her giving a \nspeech or a lecture, but about attending all-expense paid seminars \nfunded by corporate interests with room, board, and airfare worth \nthousands of dollars to places like Montana and Captiva Island, FL. \nJudge Clement has taken five such trips from 1994-1998.\n  I was also concerned by Judge Clement's testimony that the seminars \nshe attended were balanced and broad-based. An exhaustively researched \nreport released last year by the Community Rights Counsel suggests \nstrongly to the contrary. Judge Clement's answers to Senator Kohl's \nquestions suggested that she sees nothing wrong with these trips and \nwould not hesitate to attend similar events in the future if the topic \nof the seminar interests her.\n  Because I was concerned about Judge Clement's testimony, I asked a \nfew followup questions in writing. Those questions had not yet been \nanswered when Judge Clement came up for a vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is why I voted ``present'' in committee.\n  One of my questions called Judge Clement's attention to a Harvard \nEnvironmental Law Review article that specifically discussed one of the \nseminars that she attended, a trip to Montana in 1996 sponsored by the \nFoundation for Research on Economics and the Environment, FREE. After \ndiscussing the views of the various presenters at that seminar, the \nauthors conclude:\n\n       It is easy to see why some corporations and extreme \n     conservative foundations so eagerly fund FREE. FREE's \n     seminars for judges explain how and why judges should strike \n     down Federal environmental laws. FREE's assertion that its \n     seminars present a ``very wide range'' of viewpoints is true \n     only insofar as they feature both extreme positions like \n     those of Greve, Huffman, and DeCrane, as well as moderate \n     views such as those of Olson and Snow. The seminars offer no \n     views contrary to the seminar's principle themes. No one at \n     the seminar 1. gave a robust defense of existing Federal \n     environmental laws, 2. explained fully why the market fails \n     to protect the environment, or 3. critiqued the legal and \n     constitutional analysis of Huffman and Greve.--D. Kendall and \n     E. Sorkin, ``Nothing for Free: How Private Judicial Seminars \n     are Undermining Environmental Protections and Breaking the \n     Public's Trust,'' 25 Harv. Env. L. Rev. 405, 447 (2001).\n\n  Judge Clement reviewed the article and stated in her response that \nshe remains of the view that this seminar and others she attended \n``focused on the problems and solutions from varied perspectives.'' \nEssentially, Judge Clement refused to acknowledge that these seminars \nhave any bias whatsoever. I found this answer troubling because I \nbelieve that most fair-minded observers, even if they do not agree with \nme that there is a problem with judges taking expense paid trips to \nreceive ``education'' from a specific corporate point of view, would \nagree that the seminars in question are slanted in favor of one \napproach to the law.\n  I also asked Judge Clement whether she had inquired about the \ncorporate sponsorship of these seminars before attending and if not, \nhow she complied with Judicial Conference Committee on Codes of Conduct \nAdvisory Opinion 67. That opinion states:\n\n       It would be improper to participate in such a seminar if \n     the sponsor, or source of funding, is involved in litigation, \n     or likely to be so involved, and the topics covered in the \n     seminar are likely to be in some manner related to the \n     subject matter of such litigation. If there is a reasonable \n     question concerning the propriety of participation, the judge \n     should take such measures as may be necessary to \n     satisfy himself or herself that there is no impropriety. \n     To the extent that this involves obtaining further \n     information from the sponsors of the seminar, the judge \n     should make clear an intent to make the information public \n     if any questions should arise concerning the propriety of \n     the judge's attendance.\n\n  The central thrust of this opinion in my view is that judges have the \nresponsibility to inquire about the sources of funding of programs they \nattend and to take steps to avoid the appearance of impropriety should \nthe funders be involved in litigation before them. Judge Clement's \nresponse to my question was troubling. She said she relied entirely on \nthe sponsoring organization's description of their purpose and \nsponsors. And she added: ``Corporate sponsors were never identified, \nand to this day I do not know who they are.'' I find this attitude of \nwillful ignorance of the underlying sources of funding for these \nseminars, an attitude that I fear is shared by many members of the \njudiciary who go on these trips, very disturbing indeed.\n  At the very foundation of our system of justice is the notion that \njudges will be fair and impartial. Strict ethical guidelines have been \nin effect for years to remove even the hint of impropriety from the \nconduct of those we entrust with the responsibility of adjudicating \ndisputes and applying the law. One-sided seminars given in wealthy \nresorts funded by wealthy corporate interests to ``educate'' our judges \nin a particular view of the law cannot help but undermine public \nconfidence in the decisions that judges who attend the seminars \nultimately make.\n  Distinguished judges and academics, most notably former \nRepresentative, Court of Appeals Judge, and White House Counsel Abner \nMikva, have spoken out against these ``judicial junkets.'' I have \nworked with Senator Kerry on legislation to address this issue. I hope \nthat the federal judiciary can address this growing public perception \nproblem through its own internal rules, but if it doesn't, I believe \nthat Congress has the responsibility to act to protect the independence \nand the reputation of the judiciary.\n  Despite my reservations and concerns about Judge Clement's response \nto questions on this issue, I will vote for her. One reason is that in \nanswering my questions she did acknowledge the importance of guarding \nagainst the appearance of impropriety. And she promised she would guard \nagainst such appearances if she is elevated to the 5th Circuit. \nFurthermore, there is no indication that her opinions as a judge have \nbeen unduly influenced by these seminars.\n  In sum, I want to be clear that I do not believe that taking part in \nthese seminars should disqualify a judge from a subsequent \nconfirmation. I do believe, however, that our judges need to be more \nattuned to the appearance problem that there participation creates. I \nhope that in responding to questions on this topic, future nominees \nwill recognize the importance of the public perception of their \nindependence and impartiality.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of trips taken by Judge \nClement, to which I previously referred, be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Publicly Disclosed Trips by Judge Edith B.

Mr. President, it is a privilege for me today to honor and \ncelebrate one of Massachusetts' most esteemed public servants, Mayor \nPeter Torigian of Peabody. After 23 years, the dean of Massachusetts \nmayors is retiring from public office but hopefully not from public \nlife.\n  The city of Peabody is known as the ``Tanner City'' for its leather \ntrade dating back to the 1630s, and therefore it is only appropriate \nthat this former leather worker and leather-neck has led Peabody with \nvigilance, compassion, and integrity for over two decades. Peter's \nascent to city hall began in a ``three decker'' in the heart of \nPeabody's industrial sector. Born to hard-working Armenian immigrants, \nPeter was studious and gifted, as well as the star quarterback for the \nPeabody High School football team. After school, the future mayor \nworked as a tanner and experienced first-hand the leather factories \nthat were once the life-line of Peabody's industrial economy. He then \nput in 3 years of his life to the service of the U.S. Marine Corps \nbefore returning home to Peabody. As all of us in this body know: Once \na Marine, always a Marine. He spent 16 years as a letter carrier for \nthe U.S. Post Office. In a harbinger of things to come he quietly rose \nthrough the ranks to presidency of the union local.\n  Then began his formal public career with his election to the city \ncouncil in 1968--a tumultuous year in the history of our country--and \nculminated with his election as mayor in 1979. The longest-serving \nmayor in Peabody history, his legacy will not be counted just in years \nbut in the progress the city has enjoyed during his tenure. His peers \nthroughout the state honored him with the title of ``Best Municipal \nExecutive'' in a survey conducted by the Boston Globe, and his \nmanagement expertise continues to be widely solicited. With an \ninstinctual gift for sharing his\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\nknowledge and experience, he was recently appointed to the MBTA \nAdvisory Board, elected as a member to the Metropolitan Planning \nOrganization, and has served as chairman of the Essex County Advisory \nBoard since 1983. The Massachusetts Municipal Association benefited \nfrom his service on its board of directors as well as the Local \nGovernors Advisory Committee, which he started serving on in 1983.\n\n  The honors and citations, if stacked, reach to the sky; honored by \nthe AARP in 1998, Peabody's Veterans Council in that same year, and \nhonored by the Anti-Defamation League the year before. His housing \nefforts won the acclaim of the Citizens for Adequate Housing Community \nService Award at the beginning of the 1990s, he was the North Shore \nChamber of Commerce's ``Man of the Year,'' in 1991, and was honored by \nthe President of Portugal with ``Command of the Special Order of Infant \nHenry the Navigator'' award in 1996.\n  Every public official is ultimately judged by the impact their \npolicies have after the official has left office. In this way, \ngenerations of Peabody's children will be Peter's legacy, since \nthousands of children went through Peabody public schools during Mayor \nTorigian's time, and now their children are doing the same. The \nbusiness growth in Peabody during Peter's term stands in stark contrast \nto the aged and fading industrial based that he inherited, and now the \nresidents enjoy a robust economic climate while at the same time \nmaintaining the New England flavor of the community.\n  I am honored to rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable man who has \nassembled an inspiring and very real list of achievements. I regard \nmyself as fortunate to have him as a friend and colleague in \ngovernment, and I join the families of Peabody and his peers throughout \nthe State in celebrating his exemplary public service and in wishing \nhim godspeed as he moves on to new horizons.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Peter Torigian, the outstanding Mayor of \nPeabody, MA, who is retiring at the end of this year. He has served the \npeople of Peabody with great skill and dedication for the past 22 \nyears, and I know they join me in thanking him for his commitment and \ndedication to public service.\n  Mayor Torigian will long be remembered for the revitalization of \nPeabody's economy. He skillfully guided the transformation of an old \nmanufacturing base into a thriving new office complex known as \nCentennial Park.\n  His impressive record of success in promoting economic development in \nPeabody and throughout the region is well known. He was instrumental in \nthe development of the North Shore Mall, creating thousands of new \njobs, the lowest corporate tax rate and the broadest tax base in all of \nMassachusetts.\n  He's also done an outstanding job in preserving open space and in \ncleaning up brownfields in the area. Brook Farm is a magnificent \nexample of Mayor Torigian's commitment to the environment.\n  Under Mayor Torigian's leadership, Peabody has thrived on its \ndiversity as well. Peabody recently celebrated its 18th annual \nInternational Festival, in which thousands of people visited the city \nto celebrate its history and its heritage.\n  And Mayor Torigian's commitment to senior citizens has been \nunwavering. He created the Peabody Community Life Center, a remarkable \ncenter for seniors on the North Shore to gather and enhance their \nquality of life.\n  All of us in Massachusetts are grateful for Mayor Torigian's \ndistinguished service to the City of Peabody and to our State, and \nwe're grateful for his friendship. We know that his commitment to \npublic service will continue in other ways, and he will be deeply \nmissed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to express profound sorrow \nfor the loss of life caused by the tragic crash of American Airlines \nflight 587 in the residential community of Belle Harbor, Rockaway, \nQueens, and the loss of 246 passengers and 9 crewmembers who were \ntraveling to the Dominican Republic, as well as the loss of life on the \nground where the plane crashed. It has added to the immeasurable \nsadness that New York and America have been forced to bear since the \nhorrific events of September 11.\n  It is impossible to speak about the destruction that happened \nyesterday without recognizing the overwhelming sacrifices of the \nresidents of the Rockaways. They have already contributed greatly to \nthe defense of our city and our Nation. The families in this part of \nQueens have had to attend more funerals in the past 2 months than \nanyone should have to bear. They have lost many people who worked at \nthe World Trade Center, as well as the numerous firefighters and police \nofficers who make up this close-knit community. The courage and the \nvalues of these New Yorkers, these Americans, these public servants, \nhave brought comfort to so many and have stood as a shining example of \nwhat is best of America.\n  I think it is fair to say that our entire country stands in awe of \ntheir acts of bravery and self-sacrifice. It was doubly tragic to see \nthe loss of life in this accident and to know that it happened in an \narea where lives were just beginning to resume some sense of normalcy \nand then were so horribly disrupted again.\n  As I walked around the crash area with FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh \nyesterday, I was able to show him a neighborhood that I think came as a \nbit of a surprise. Joe has done a very good job, just a terrific job as \nour FEMA Director, in the time he has been in that position. He \nresponded with just great dispatch and compassion to the World Trade \nCenter attacks.\n  I think being in Lower Manhattan and seeing the community there was \none view of New York. But being in Belle Harbor, seeing the single-\nfamily homes that could be found in so many other communities around \nour country, was a reminder of the diversity that is New York. We have \nso many different kinds of neighborhoods. Yet in every one of them we \nwill find people who are stalwart, steadfast, and willing to work hard \nand play by the rules, and who oftentimes have contributed to the \ngreatness of that city and, in turn, our State and country.\n  Senator Schumer, Congressman Weiner, and I will be asking FEMA to \ninclude this tragedy in Queens as part of the presidentially declared \ndisaster. We believe the members of these affected communities, \nincluding the Dominican community in Washington Heights, Brooklyn, and \nelsewhere, and the Rockaway neighborhood where the plane fell to Earth, \nshould have access to the disaster services they need and deserve.\n  Although all of us in New York and America experienced a terrible \nshock yesterday upon learning of the crash, we know there was one \nparticular segment of our community that was very hard hit. Initial \nestimates indicate that anywhere from 150 to 175 of the passengers on \nboard flight 587 were Dominican-Americans, or Dominicans. New York's \nDominican community, which is centered in Washington Heights, is a \nstrong and vibrant cultural sector tucked into northern Manhattan, \nalmost on the opposite end of where the World Trade Center once stood.\n  Our Dominican community, with all of its excitement, its energy, its \nculture, and colorful history, has contributed greatly to the soul of \nNew York City. Dominican-Americans have made many contributions to \nbusiness and the arts, to labor and politics, and their contributions \nare really just beginning. They have also maintained strong ties with \nthe Dominican Republic and the people who live there.\n  Although it is growing rapidly, New York City's Dominican community \nis renowned for its smalltown feeling in a city obviously famous for \nits huge size. But a tragedy such as the one that happened yesterday \nreverberated across the entire community because virtually everyone \nknows someone who has lost a loved one.\n  The community's response to this latest tragedy has been an \noutpouring of relief. We have seen that a crisis center for families \nhas been already set up in Washington Heights. We have seen Dominican-\nAmerican elected officials rallying around, serving their constituents. \nWe know the kind of efforts that will be undertaken by the\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\nDominican-American community will bring great comfort and support to \nthose who have lost loved ones.\n  Now we have to do whatever we can as the larger New York and American \ncommunity to stand with and support these families. I spent some time \nlast night at the Ramada Inn, that was set up at JFK Airport for the \nfamilies to come seeking information and help. It was a grueling and \nwrenching experience. Many of the families there lost not just one \nmember but several. I met one young man who lost his wife, his \ndaughter, and his mother-in-law because they were going to the \nDominican Republic to attend the funeral of a relative.\n\n  I met another young man who proudly held the picture of his brother \nwho had just gotten back from his tour of duty on the U.S.S. Enterprise \nin support of our efforts in Afghanistan. He had just come back home \nand was going down to see friends and relatives. His family was so \nproud of this young man who had served our country.\n  There are many stories such as that which we will hear over the days \nand weeks ahead.\n  Of course, all that any of us can do is to promise our support and \nwhatever assistance is needed; to offer our thoughts and our prayers; \nto stand with the government and the people of the Dominican Republic \nfor whom this is a profound and unsettling tragic occurrence; to \ndemonstrate clearly in all that we do that we will stand in the face of \nwhatever comes; that New Yorkers are neither daunted nor beaten down by \nthe continuation of tragedy and challenge; and that our determined \nspirit as Americans remains undiminished.\n  I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues \nin ensuring that these New Yorkers, like those who were affected on \nSeptember 11, know that our country stands behind them and with them.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11713-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I would like to share an experience \nthis evening and commend a group of individuals who were involved in \nU.S. Airways Flight 969 last evening where I was a passenger going from \nPittsburgh to National Airport. It was diverted into Dulles, as many of \nus have heard. There was a situation where someone stood up in explicit \ncontradiction to the words from the pilot about what was to be done \nunder national policy. Once you are within 30 minutes of Reagan \nNational Airport, passengers are not under any circumstances to leave \ntheir seats. Unfortunately, this individual did and headed towards what \nappeared to be the cockpit.\n  I commend the air marshals who were on that flight. They responded \nwith professionalism. They responded quickly with what appeared to be a \nthreat to those of us who were on the flight.\n  I commend the pilot on U.S. Airways Flight 969 who responded with \nprofessionalism. He calmed what obviously was a potentially very \nconfusing situation and what could have been great panic. This was the \nresult of the pilot, the flight attendants, and the crew.\n  I would like to give my thanks and congratulations to everyone who \nwas involved in this incident with the way they conducted themselves.\n  I was thinking as I sat in the 11th row and the B seat that this is \nan example of what could happen with national law enforcement officials \nprofessionally trained to do our airline security. It reaffirmed my \ncommitment to the belief that we need to do what this Senate did 100 to \n0, which is to pass a law that says those who look at the baggage and \nthose who do the security checks of our carry-ons are professionally \ntrained Federal law enforcement officials. I call on my colleagues to \nbring that bill back from the conference committee with that provision \nin it.\n  I don't believe there was a person on that plane last night who was \nnot grateful for the fact that we had Federal law enforcement officials \ntrained to protect the people on that plane; they responded \nprofessionally as Federal law enforcement officials.\n  Every day we are grateful to receive that kind of protection from our \nCapitol Police as well, and I think our families deserve to have that.\n  I encourage my colleagues to reflect on what is best for all \nAmericans, and not what is best for the interests of one party or the \nother.\n  I can say with great confidence--and it was reaffirmed last night for \nme--that having Federal law enforcement officials who are trained both \non the ground checking the baggage as well as on our airplanes is in \nthe interests of all of our families.\n  I find it interesting now as we are grappling as a body of the Senate \nand the House and coming together as Americans to support the \nPresident; this is our team on the field. We are the team of Americans. \nThe coach is the President, and we are all there together. We are \nsupporting the President. We want him to be successful. We all need to \nbe successful in fighting these terrorist attacks and making sure that \nour people are safe.\n  I think it is also important and it is our responsibility to be able \nto disagree about a particular play or a particular strategy when the \nteam is on the field.\n  In this particular case, I urge the President to join us in embracing \nthe principle that we should have Federal law enforcement security at \nevery level of airport and airline security.\n  I also ask our colleagues to focus now as we stimulate this economy \nand put money back into people's pockets as well as homeland security. \nThe time is now to act. We know that workers need assistance. We know \nthe economy needs stimulus. The best way to do both of those is to \nprovide relief to workers who need it the most. Economists across the \ncountry agree that providing relief to low- and moderate-income \nfamilies is one of the most successful ways to stimulate the economy. \nWhy? They will immediately take those dollars and go to the grocery \nstore. They will buy shoes for their children who go to school. In \nMichigan they will go buy a winter coat. They may buy a new car, which \nwe would also be very happy about in the State of Michigan.\n\n  People will turn those dollars around because they need to be able to \nlive and to be able to care for their families. Studies have shown that \nevery $1 invested in unemployment insurance for those who have lost \ntheir jobs because of September 11 or other downturns in the economy \ngenerates $2.15 in gross domestic product. Directly, we know that $1 \ngenerates $2.15.\n  So I hope this week we will embrace what the Democrats have porposed \nto stimulate this economy, to put money back in people's pockets, who \nwill then use it to care for their families, to\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\nspend in the economy, and that we will invest in those critical \nhomeland security measures that are absolutely necessary for us to move \nforward as a country.\n  This is an opportunity to get it right. This is an opportunity for us \nto take action, action to keep us safe in airports and on airlines, \naction to keep us safe whether it relates to bioterrorism or food \nsafety or other critical measures that have been proposed for action by \nthe Democratic caucus, and action as it relates to focusing on those \nwho are unemployed and those who are low- and moderate-income families \nwho need to have money in their pocket to help stimulate this economy.\n  The time to act is now. I call on my colleagues, this week, to put \nthat at the top of the agenda for both of those items.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11714-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11714-S11715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BILL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to speak a little about the \nstimulus economic recovery bill that is now pending, particularly from \nthe point of view of what the provisions are that affect small \nbusiness.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, it became clear that our economy \ngenerally was going to suffer. I remember reading an article. It was \nkind of stunning in a certain aspect; that is, if the terrorists were \naiming the planes at the ``masters of the universe''--New York bond \ntraders, and so forth--it did wreak tremendous devastation and tragedy \nfor so many people who do trade in securities, but to an even greater \ndegree it has affected the economic livelihood of small businesses, \nshop owners, different communities in the city of New York. It is \nmiddle-income and lower-income people, who live in New York and across \nthe country, who are hurt the most, who are hurt more than higher \nincome people.\n  The loss of life is beyond description. But, in addition, the \neconomic devastation has hit small business more than it has hit big \nbusiness. And small businesspeople have a much harder time adjusting \nthan do big businesses. So for that reason, because we have limited \nresources, we want to make sure we have a balanced solution that very \nmuch helps small business.\n\n  When the President spoke about an economic stimulus, he made three \nbasic points. One, he wanted us to stimulate the economy. He suggested \nthat it be short-term. He also suggested that any stimulus not have \nadverse long-term consequences on future budgets. These are principles \nwith which we all agree.\n  Let me speak now about small business. We say this many times, and I \nthink it is very important to say it again. Small business really is \nthe backbone of America. More new jobs are created by small business \nthan by big business. That is a fact. We tend to forget that. We read \nreports that such-and-such company is laying off so many people and \nanother company is laying off another thousand people, or several \nthousand people. We hear that, and those are big companies that have \nlots of employees, and unfortunately they are laying off relatively \nlarge numbers. We don't hear a word about the mom-and-pop businesses in \nour communities that had to lay off a few people. It is happening all \nover the country. The numbers are so great. They are also the same \nbusinesses that create more jobs. They create more jobs than does big \nbusiness.\n  Small business is also the genesis and the fountain of more business \nideas. More business ideas are developed by small business than by big \nbusiness. There is probably a reason for that. A small business has to \nfight to survive; the margins are so low. If you are opening up a small \nbusiness, you have to pay that payroll tax the first day, even though \nyou don't have any income. It is very tough. Lots of people have new \nideas and they want to start a business. That is the American way.\n  It is critically important that we not lose sight of small business. \nIn fact, I think we should help small business because in many ways it \nis the bedrock of our country. Here is what we have done. Let's look at \nsome of the provisions of the bill. One is to increase the amount a \nbusiness can expense. It is called section 179 of the Tax Code. That \nsection allows businesses to expense rather than depreciate assets, \nright now, this year, instead of writing it off over a period of time. \nWe increase the limit. By increasing that limit, small business can \nwrite off more and invest more than they otherwise could.\n  Section 179 of the code provides an exception to the normal \ndepreciation rule. That is the limit that a small business can expense. \nIt allows up to $24,000 in business purchases to be deducted in the \nyear of purchase. The amount is reduced once a business makes $200,000 \nworth of purchases in a given year. That is not a lot of money, but \nthat is the limit. We want to allow businesses to deduct more so they \npurchase more products upfront.\n  Increasing the amount that can be expensed is the simplest way to \nstimulate small business to try to expansion. It helps small business \nkeep up with rapid growth and change in the technology sector by \nreducing the capital costs of the company.\n  The bill reported by the Finance Committee includes a provision that \nincreases the amount a business can expense from $24,000 to $35,000 \nover a 12-month period. This also raises the maximum amount of \nqualified purchases from $200,000 to $325,000. This provision provides \nan immediate and focused stimulus. It is only available to companies \npurchasing equipment, and only if they make the purchases within a 12-\nmonth period. I might say that this is a bipartisan provision.\n  There are a lot of bipartisan provisions in this bill. We hear \nsometimes about the partisan provisions, but much more in this bill is \nmore bipartisan than not. One is the rebate checks. Both sides agree to \nthat. Both sides agree to the small business 179 expensing limit being \nraised. Both sides agree to bonus depreciation; it is just a question \nof how much. Both sides agree to extending unemployment compensation \nbenefits; it is just a question of how much. Both sides agree that we \nshould probably help the people who have lost their health insurance \nbecause they have lost their jobs.\n\n  Over the last year, more than half of the people who have lost their \njobs as a consequence have also lost their health insurance. That is \nbecause most people who are laid off had health benefits as part of the \njob, but they don't anymore.\n  So this expensing is one of the other bipartisan provisions.\n  A couple of statistics about small business. In 1996, there were \nabout 5 million corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships \nthat had potential 179 investments. Of those 5 million, about 96 \npercent had gross receipts of $5 million or below. We are talking small \nbusiness, not big business. Expanding the amount of investments these \ncompanies can make and expense immediately would give these small \nbusinesses real incentive to invest and give the economy a needed lift. \nIn Lower Manhattan alone, there are between 14,000 and 16,000 \nbusinesses directly affected by the collapse of the Trade Towers. That \nis according to the Empire State Development Corporation. I daresay \nthere are many more indirectly affected. It is estimated that as many \nas 105,000 businesses may ultimately be impacted directly or indirectly \nin New York as a consequence of the disaster of September 11. Those \nbusinesses need to bounce back, and this provision, along with other \nspecific provisions in the bill, will go a long way to provide that \nassistance.\n  I might say that the 179 provision, where businesses can expense \nmore, is not only targeted to New York, but to the whole country, \nbecause this economic downturn we are experiencing really began about a \nyear or so ago, and it was accelerated by September 11; but the whole \ncountry has experienced an economic downturn. That is why this \nprovision will help New York and also the rest of the country.\n  Madam President, I also believe that tomorrow morning, in the spirit \nof bipartisanship, we are finally going to sit down and work out an \nagreement on the stimulus/economic recovery bill. I\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\nthink the leadership on both sides of the aisle is going to meet with \nsenior tax-writing Senators and House Members and we are going to say: \nWe have had our say, and each party scored its points. Now let's get on \nto business and do what the American people want--that is, write an \neconomic recovery bill on a bipartisan basis as quickly as possible and \nhelp get this country moving.\n  As the President said recently, in reference to a fellow who helped \nprevent an airplane disaster in Pennsylvania when he said, ``Let's \nroll,'' I say to all my friends and colleagues that I very much hope \ntomorrow, when we have this meeting, we start to roll and put together \na bipartisan bill. This section 179 small business expensing provision \nis one of many which I know we are going to agree to in helping our \neconomy.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11715-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11715-S11716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THE UNEMPLOYED\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I want to speak a little bit about \nhealth insurance. As I mentioned before, our country's economic \ndownturn has put millions of American workers and their families at \nrisk.\n  The unemployment rate has increased by 25 percent over the same time \nlast year. In October alone, we lost 415,000 jobs. That is 1 month \nalone. That is the highest single jump since 1980.\n  In addition to losing jobs and income, many Americans have lost their \nhealth insurance. Clearly, this is something we need to address. Health \ninsurance is necessary because it gives us access to needed health care \nservices and it gives families financial security from medical bills.\n  Uninsured workers and their families often delay or skip needed \ntreatment. When they do seek care, they often end up heavily in debt. \nMany of us serving in this body have encountered many people deeply in \ndebt because of needed health care. Many families even go bankrupt as a \nresult. In fact, half of all bankruptcies are a direct result of health \nor medical bills, not out-of-control spending by families.\n  I believe very strongly that giving laid-off workers assistance so \nthey might keep their health insurance is of utmost importance. In my \nview, helping Americans who lose their jobs hold on to their health \ninsurance is the right thing to do, not just for the families put at \nrisk but for the economy as well.\n  Some critics have said we should include health insurance coverage in \nthe economic stimulus package. Some say we should not. Some have gone \nso far as suggesting the President should veto a bill that includes \nthese provisions. It is not stimulus, they say; therefore, the \nPresident should veto the bill. I have heard that many times from \nrepresentatives of the President.\n  I am the first to admit the arguments that health care coverage is \nstimulative are not as strong as the arguments for some of the other \nprovisions of the bill. For example, virtually everyone agrees \nunemployment insurance, while helping people supplement lost income, is \nalso stimulative. In fact, the multiplier effect is $2.50 for every $1 \nspent on unemployment insurance. Nevertheless, there are several \nreasons I believe health care does represent stimulus, and I would like \nto review them for my colleagues and for the benefit of the critics.\n  First, the rate of health insurance coverage is sensitive to economic \nconditions. Over the past several years, a strong economy has helped to \nmoderate the growth of the uninsured population. The number of \nuninsured Americans has been growing. In the past several years, the \nstrong economy has helped moderate that growth of uninsured population. \nMany employers use health care benefits as a way to attract and keep \nworkers in a competitive market.\n  During the same period, we created CHIP, the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, to make health insurance coverage available to more \nchildren. In times of recession, though, things are much different. \nSimply put, a downturn in the economy means many more people go \nuninsured. Employer-sponsored insurance declines, and States struggle \nto pay their share of the cost of public programs, such as Medicaid and \nCHIP. I know that is true in my State.\n  According to a recent study, a 2-percent increase in unemployment \nwill lead to an additional 3.2 million people eligible for Medicaid. \nThat means the October jump in the unemployment rate alone will lead to \nan additional 800,000 people on Medicaid.\n  We do not need a report to tell us this. We know this from past \nexperience. In the recession of the early 1990s, more than half of the \nworkers who lost their jobs became uninsured. Let me repeat that. In \nthe recession of the nineties, more than half of the workers who lost \ntheir jobs also as a consequence became uninsured. We cannot let that \nhappen again.\n\n  Second, personal spending on health care means less consumer \nspending. Families with health insurance are able to spend more on \nother priorities. Families without health insurance spend more out of \npocket on health care, making it harder for them to spend on other \nthings.\n  A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation tells us that nearly one in \nfive uninsured cannot meet their essential expenses. Nearly one in four \nuninsured cannot pay their full gas, electric, or oil bills; one in \nseven persons who do not have health insurance cannot pay their full \nrent or mortgage.\n  Third, States are facing serious fiscal problems. State budgets are \nmore unstable in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Revenues are \ndeclining while the need for spending on important programs is \nincreasing. Sales tax revenues have dropped in States that rely on \ntourism at the same time disaster relief efforts and unemployment are \nincreasing.\n  Last month, the Washington Post reported a number of States \nparticularly hard hit by the recession are already calling special \nlegislative sessions and taking dramatic action to reduce spending. \nMany of these States are thinking about making reductions in Medicaid \nbenefits or cutting eligibility to alleviate budget pressures, despite \nthe fact that more people will likely be turning to States for help \nwith health insurance.\n  Putting money into the health care system, which represents 13 \npercent of the national economy and employs millions of people, will \nitself stimulate the economy. This is particularly true in rural areas \nwhere the local hospitals are often the biggest employer.\n  Including health insurance in an economic stimulus package is of \ncritical importance both to the economy and to the American people.\n  What about the specifics of my proposal? The health provisions in my \npackage are short term; they are temporary. My bill provides direct \nsubsidies to the purchase of private COBRA coverage. It would give a \n75-percent Federal premium subsidy for those eligible for COBRA \ncoverage. Anyone who lost their job after September 11 would be \neligible to receive this assistance for up to 12 months. The program \nwould be strictly short term and would end December 31, 2002.\n  Why focus on COBRA? Because COBRA coverage was specifically designed \nto help workers maintain their health coverage when they change or lose \ntheir jobs. Unfortunately, though, this coverage is very expensive: \n$2,600 a year for individuals and a full $7,000 for families. That is \nalmost $600 a month for family coverage.\n  Consider the average unemployment check is just over $800 a month, \nand one realizes why fewer than 20 percent of displaced workers \nactually sign up for COBRA. It is just too expensive. They cannot \nafford it.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the COBRA subsidy will \nhelp up to 7 million Americans hold on to their health insurance even \nafter they lose their jobs. But COBRA subsidies will not help everyone \nwho loses their job. It will not help those who are not eligible for \nCOBRA either because they worked for a small employer who is exempt \nfrom COBRA or that firm went bankrupt.\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\n  To help those workers, my bill also includes a short-term, temporary \nMedicaid option for individuals and families who are not eligible for \nCOBRA. This is a State option. It is up to the States. They can decide. \nI propose to give States an enhanced matching rate to encourage States \nto adopt this new coverage option.\n  Like the COBRA subsidies, this coverage is available to people who \nbecome unemployed after September 11 this year, and like the subsidies, \nMedicaid coverage will be available for 12 months.\n  Some say that States cannot afford to take up this option, even with \nan increased Federal match. I understand that. That point is well \ntaken, and it is one of the reasons I am also proposing to increase the \nmatching rate for Medicaid. By giving States a higher Medicaid match, \nan F-match, as it is called, States will have an easier time \nmaintaining coverage.\n  The additional funding may give the States what they need to take up \nthe new coverage option for displaced workers. All told, this may \nmaintain health coverage for millions of people who have lost their \njobs or stand to lose them in the difficult months ahead.\n  I have also heard critics argue my proposal is an indirect way to \nestablish a new entitlement program. It is not. That is not the \nintention. We are responding to a temporary crisis with a temporary \nsolution. All coverage, whether received through corporate or Medicaid, \nwill be provided on a temporary basis. The program ends after 1 year. \nIt is in the law, black and white, underlined. It is there. It ends in \n1 year.\n  Critics argue the COBRA Program and Medicaid coverage will be slow \nand cumbersome to implement. First, I disagree. I think we can get the \nprogram up and running in short order but not if we wait 6 months for \nnew regulations to be published. My proposal specifically states the \nprogram should be implemented regardless of whether a final rule has \nbeen published. That is not new. It is not unusual. It is a step that \nis taken in times of emergency, and I argue the current economic \nsituation dictates we are in such an emergency.\n  Let us also be candid. There are several competing proposals to \nprovide temporary health care coverage, and they all raise the same \nissues. Whether we are talking about direct payments, COBRA, tax \ncredits, as some propose, or block grants to States, as the President \nhas suggested, we have to come up with a system that works quickly and \nworks efficiently.\n  I say let us work on solving these implementation issues together \nrather than trying to undermine each other or pointing fingers and \nsaying it cannot be done.\n  Let me conclude by reiterating how important health care coverage is \nto Americans and how devastating it can be for a family to lose its \ncoverage. I believe the package of health proposals I have put together \nwill go a long way toward helping those who are truly in need. It will \nalso provide a quick, temporary boost to the economy.\n  I realize not everyone agrees with our approach, but I do hope we all \ncan agree health insurance coverage is a crucial element of any \neconomic stimulus package. It is the right thing to do, and it is good \npolicy.\n  I look forward to working with all my colleagues to reach an \nagreement that keeps our primary goals in mind; that is, stimulating \nthe economy and helping American families.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I was proud to support the entire \nVA-HUD Appropriations conference report yesterday, including its vital \ninvestments for our Nation's veterans. Chairperson Mikulski and Ranking \nMember Bond work hard each and every year to provide investment in a \nwide range of important agencies and programs, ranging from veterans, \nto housing, to the National Science Foundation.\n  This year I am particularly proud of a new investment within the \nNational Science Foundation, NSF, to promote math and science \neducation. Two new programs have been funded: the Mathematics and \nScience Partnerships program and the Noyce Scholarships worth $165 \nmillion.\n  Our elementary and secondary students are currently sadly lacking in \ntheir mastery of technical subjects. Although our 4th graders are on a \npar with the rest of the world, by the time they reach the 12th grade \nthey are in the bottom half of countries of the world. This is an \nintolerable situation. Our United States students come to college ill \nequipped to study mathematics, science, and engineering. The \npartnerships and scholarships funded in this package offer the promise \nof substantial improvement in the performance of our students.\n  Under the Mathematics and Science Partnerships programs, \nuniversities, businesses, and local educational institutions will form \npartnerships to develop new programs to teach these subjects. These \nprograms will be watched and evaluated and those that are successful \nwill be incorporated into the mainstream of K-12 education.\n  The Noyce Scholarships will address a different problem. One of the \nbest predictors of student performance is the quality of the teacher. \nToo many of our teachers of technical subjects are not well qualified. \nThe scholarships will remedy this situation by supporting students of \ntechnical subjects who agree to teach two years for every year of \nsupport. This will ensure that many of our urban and rural schools that \nare particularly in need of good teachers will obtain relief.\n  President Bush proposed the math and science partnerships in his \nbudget. Working with Senators Kennedy and Roberts, I sponsored \nlegislation in the Senate to authorize the Partnerships and the Noyce \nScholarships. The House of Representatives has already passed a similar \nmeasure introduced by Congressman Boehlert. The VA-HUD appropriations \npackage provide the first year of funding and the down payment to start \nthese key programs to improve math and science education, and invest in \nour future.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues for the entire package, and \nI am especially pleased about these new investments in math and science \neducation which represent such promise for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11716-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, today I take notice of a recent \npositive development in the creation of a more modern legal regime for \ninternational shipping. I was very pleased to see that America's \nimporters and exporters and the ocean carriers that transport America's \ninternational trade reached agreement last month on\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\nthe form and substance of international cargo liability reform.\n  While this is a field with which most of us are at best only vaguely \nfamiliar, it has been the subject of intense debate in maritime circles \nfor many years. In fact, draft reform legislation proposed by the \nMaritime Law Association of the United States was the subject of a \nhearing in the Senate Commerce Committee in 1998. Similar draft \nlegislation was also reviewed by the Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine during the last Congress under the \nleadership of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. Because of the inability of \nthe commercial parties to agree on how or whether to proceed with such \na proposal, however, the legislation was never introduced.\n  Last month, the World Shipping Council, representing the ocean \nshipping companies serving America's foreign trades, and the National \nIndustrial Transportation League, representing American importers and \nexporters, announced that they had reached agreement on cargo liability \nreform. They issued a joint statement outlining their agreement and \npledged to work through the process to be established by the U.N. \nCommission on International Trade Law, (UNCITRAL), to assist in the \ndevelopment and ratification of a new international cargo liability \nconvention. The goal of this effort is to produce an internationally \nacceptable instrument that can be ratified by the United States and our \ntrading partners.\n  Most parties are in agreement that the U.S. law governing cargo \nliability, which dates back to 1936, can benefit from being updated, \nideally in the context of a uniform international legal regime. What \nthey have not been able to agree on, until now, is what real reform \nshould look like.\n  The shippers and carriers have also agreed on a reasonable timetable \nfor pursuing an international solution, and the shippers will forego \ntheir push for U.S. legislation so long as the international process \nproduces an acceptable convention within this timeframe.\n  I commend the carriers and shippers for agreeing to set aside their \ndecades of differences on this issue and for trying to help produce an \nagreement that can be adopted by the United States. I also want to \ncommend my colleague, Senator John Breaux, for his interest and \nleadership on this very important issue. As the ranking Republican on \nthe Senate Subcommittee for Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine, \nwhich Senator Breaux chairs, I will work closely with him to keep a \nwatchful eye on this process and to consult with the World Shipping \nCouncil and the NIT League, as well as with all other interested \nparties over the next few years to receive progress reports.\n  I would also encourage the State Department, the Department of \nTransportation and other agencies within the U.S. Government that may \nbe involved in the multilateral negotiating process to consult \nregularly with the commercial parties and include them directly in the \nintergovernmental process.\n  As you can tell, I have two critical goals for this process: one, I \nwant all relevant parties to work together for a commercially and \npolitically-acceptable agreement for our trading partners; and, two, I \nwant the U.S. Government to be a helpful and productive partner in this \nprocess. While these negotiations go on, I will be monitoring things \nclosely, and hope that a positive international agreement can come \ntogether in the not-too-distant future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11717-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESS EMERGENCY RELIEF AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I want to submit for the Record a \nmanagers' substitute amendment to S. 1499, the American Small Business \nEmergency Relief and Recovery Act of 2001, which incorporates a number \nof improvements to the emergency relief provided by the bill as \nintroduced. Senator Bond and I have been trying to bring this up before \nthe full Senate, but, for almost one month since October 15, two \nsenators have been blocking its consideration and passage.\n  The Kerry-Bond bill is a fiscally responsible and measured response \nto help small businesses that are struggling because they were affected \nby the attacks on September 11 or because they can't get loans or \nventure capital from traditional private-sector lenders and investors \nwho are pessimistic about the economy. This legislation makes loan \ncapital and business counseling available to the small businesses in \nall of our States, and it does so by tailoring many of the Small \nBusiness Administration's, SBA, programs.\n  Let me draw your attention to changes included in the managers' \nsubstitute amendment:\n  One. For businesses located in a declared disaster area or at an \nairport, or for small businesses that were closed or suspended for \nrelated national security reasons by Federal mandate, they may use the \ndisaster loan proceeds to refinance any existing business debt within \nthe bill's loan caps. For one year after approval of such refinancing, \nprincipal payments on such refinancings will be deferred and the small \nbusiness will be required to make interest only payments. Full payments \nwill resume at the end of that year.\n  Two. For emergency relief loans under section 7(a) of the Small \nBusiness Act, the guaranteed percentage was reduced from 95 percent to \n90 percent in response to the Administration's concerns that the \ngovernment's risk was too high at 95 percent.\n  Three. The size standard applicable for travel agencies with respect \nto disaster loans and emergency 7(a) loans under the managers' \namendment is increased from $1 million to $2 million in average annual \nreceipts.\n  Four. The SBA Administrator's authority to waive or increase size \nstandards and size regulations is applied to both disaster loans and \nemergency 7(a) guaranteed loans.\n  Five. In order to encourage lenders to make the emergency and regular \n7(a) loans to small businesses adversely affected by the effects of the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 200l, the managers' amendment \nreduces the on-going lenders' fee from one-half of 1 percent to one-\nquarter of 1 percent.\n  Six. The requirement of non-Federal match is waived for the Women's \nBusiness Centers program with respect to individualized assistance \nauthorized under this Act.\n  Seven. It requires the SBA to report to the pertinent House and \nSenate Committees periodically on its implementation of this \nlegislation.\n  Eight. The managers' amendment increases the authorization levels for \nthe 7(a) and 504 programs by $2 billion each, and for the Small \nBusiness Investment Company participating securities and debentures \nprograms by $700 million and $200 million, respectively, to accommodate \nincreased demand anticipated in the wake of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  Nine. In the loan term provisions for emergency 7(a) loans, a cap of \n$3 million was added for the ``gross amount of the loans.'' This \nclarifies that the other stated caps apply to the SBA-guaranteed \nportions of the loans.\n  Ten. To make clear that Congress expects the SBA to implement these \nemergency relief provisions as quickly as possible, a section was added \nrequiring SBA to issue interim final rules and implementing guidelines \nwithin 20 days of the date of enactment of this legislation.\n  Eleven. Under the 7(a) stimulus loans, the managers' amendment \nreduces by half the upfront guarantee fee paid by the borrower, and it \nestablishes a guarantee percentage of 85 percent on all such loans.\n  Twelve. Under 504 stimulus loans, the managers' amendment reduces by \nhalf the annual guarantee fee paid by the borrower, currently .41 \npercent, and retains the upfront bank fee of 50 basis points, .50 \npercent.\n  These are important changes that Senator Bond and I have worked out \nto make a good bill better. I am very pleased that the Chairman of the \nHouse Committee on Small Business, Congressman Don Manzullo, and \nCongressman Jim Moran introduced a bill identical to our managers' \namendment on November 6 and appreciate their cooperation throughout \nthis process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11717-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11717-S11718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THANK YOU TO STAFF FOR PUBLIC SERVICE\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, times of adversity have always \nbeen fertile soil in which to find triumphs of the\n\n[[Page S11718]]\n\nhuman spirit. As an old English proverb so eloquently put it, ``A \nSmooth sea never made a skilled mariner. Trials are not enemies of \nfaith but are opportunities to prove God's faithfulness.''\n  The events of Tuesday, September 11 will never be forgotten. Nor will \nwe forget how this Nation has changed since that fateful day. In the \nweeks since the horrendous attacks on our country, there has been no \nshortage of stories about the heroic acts of everyday men and women who \nput their own lives on the line to help others. By now we've all heard \nthe story of United flight 93 that crashed in rural Pennsylvania. By \nall accounts, the passengers, after discovering their hijackers \nsinister plan, rushed the cockpit and sacrificed their own lives in \nsaving people on the ground. These were regular citizens placed in an \nunimaginable situation. They saved people, likely right here in this \nbuilding, who never knew they were in danger.\n  But then we know that whenever times have gotten tough in this \ncountry, Americans have always stepped up to answer the call. We \nremember the story of Clara Barton, a woman who learned about medicine, \nand rushed to the battlefields of the Civil War to tend to the wounded. \nThere were also the women who filled factories and other places of \nbusiness during World War II when their husbands, fathers, and brothers \nleft to fight. These women did what, at the time, had never been done \nbefore. They provided needed support, and carried our country during an \nunparalleled time of need.\n  Books of American history are full of stories about ordinary people \naccomplishing unbelievable things. The pages about today's events still \nawaiting the ink of hindsight will be no different. I would like to say \nnow, that the men and women who work on Capitol Hill will be among the \nheroes history will remember.\n  I have been amazed at the strength of the men and women, many of them \nrecently graduated from college, on my staff who have come to work \nevery day since the attacks, prepared and ready to serve their country \nin the face of possible terrorist attacks or biological warfare. These \nmen and women have risen to the occasion and answered the call of duty. \nOur interns, on their tour of duty in our Nation's Capitol without pay \nand far from home, come each day ready to work and willing to serve. \nEven when the Capitol complex was shut down, the 26,000 men and women \nwho work in the six House and Senate office buildings scrambled to find \nalternate workspace and were always on call.\n  These attacks have left us feeling afraid and violated, but, my \nfriends, our Nation has never been stronger. If that fact is ever \ndoubted, just look up to the windows of the Dirksen Building with a \nflag in almost every window. Go to the offices of members whose \ncolleagues continue to be displaced due to anthrax closings where they \nshare conference rooms, computers and phone lines, all in the name of \ndoing the business of the American people. If the attackers plan was to \ndrive us apart, they have failed. I would like to thank each member of \nmy staff for their service to me, and to this great country.\n  At this time I would like to place into the Record the names of the \nmen and women on my staff who have served in the aftermath of the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  Cooper Allen, Michael Andel, Daniel Barton, Krista Boyd, Macio \nCameron, Amanda Cooper, Adel Durani, Eric Easley, Eileen Force, \nElizabeth Gladden, Charlie Godwin, Lori Gregory, Marilouis Hudgins, \nElaine Iler, Farrar Johnston, Bill Johnstone, Tamara Jones, Lynn \nKimmerly, Jamie Mackay, Neil Martin, Glen Marken, Matt McKenna, \nPatricia Murphy, Mark Pascu, Michel Pearis, Allison Priebe, Simon \nSargent, Mark Stedham, Jane Terry, Steve Tryon, Donni Turner, Andrew \nVan Landingham, Charlotte Voorde, Derek Walters, and Adnan \nZulfiqar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11718-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE WEEK\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, November 11-17 is National \nOsteopathic Medicine Week, a week when we recognize the more than \n47,000 osteopathic physicians, D.O.s, across the country for their \ncontributions to the American healthcare system. This year, we \ncelebrate D.O.s commitment to preventative medicine and end-of-life \ncare. I am especially pleased these festivities are taking place in my \nhome State of Missouri.\n  During National Osteopathic Medicine, NOM, Week, D.O.s and patients \ncelebrate the benefits of preventative health care by looking at the \nsimple things that can be done to live healthier lives. As physicians \nwho treat people, not just symptoms, the nation's D.O.s are dedicated \nto helping maintain health through a whole-person patient-centered \napproach to healthcare. And, within that principle, they recognize \ndeath as the legitimate endpoint to the human lifecycle and respect the \ndignity and special needs of both patients and caregivers.\n  During NOM Week, D.O.s across the country will explore \nmultidisciplinary perspectives on end-of-life care, the ethical debate \nof pain management and physician-assisted suicide and ways to remove \ncommunications barriers in the physician-patient relationship at end of \nlife. Activities also educate Americans about end-of-life care and \nrelated topics, such as advances in pain management, cultural \nsensitivities toward final stages of life, organ donation, advance \ndirectives, and end-of-life care options and financing.\n  For more than a century, D.O.s have made a difference in the lives \nand health of my fellow citizens in Missouri as well as all Americans. \nOverall, more than 100 million patient visits are made each year to \nD.O.s. Osteopathic physicians are committed to serving the needs of \nrural and underserved communities and make up 15 percent of the total \nphysician population in towns of 10,000 or less.\n  D.O.s are certified in nearly 60 specialties and 33 subspecialties. \nSimilar to requirements set for M.D.s, D.O.s must complete and pass: 4 \nyears of medical education at one of 19 osteopathic medical schools; a \n1-year internship; a multi-year residency; and a State medical board \nexam. Throughout this education, D.O.s are trained to understand how \nthe musculoskeletal system influences the condition of all other body \nsystems. Many patients want this extra education as a part of their \nhealth care. Individuals may call 866-346-3236 to find a D.O. in their \ncommunity.\n  In recognition of NOM Week, I would like to congratulate the over \n1,700 D.O.s in Missouri, the 616 students at the Kirksville College of \nOsteopathic Medicine, 871 students at the University of Health Sciences \nCollege of Osteopathic Medicine and the 47,000 D.O.s represented by the \nAmerican Osteopathic Association for their contributions to the good \nhealth of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11718-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11718-S11719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJOR DAVID B.

I commend Major Chandler for his performance, and \nexpress my appreciation to him for all his efforts and dedication.\n  Major Chandler's leadership ability shined throughout his fellowship. \nDuring a very busy and challenging year for the Senate, Major Chandler \nhandled a new Congress, a new administration, confirmations, a \ncompressed defense authorization process, and finally, the tragic \nevents of September 11. His composure in the face of all these \nchallenges ensured timely inputs to me, my staff, and to the people of \nthe great State of Arkansas.\n  He served as one of my key advisors on a variety of national security \nissues. Major Chandler's efforts with the bipartisan, bicameral C-130 \nCaucus resulted in a modernization plan supported by members of \nCongress from 27 States. He assisted me in my duties on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, especially relating to my role as the ranking \nRepublican on the Personnel Subcommittee. His hard work was greatly \nappreciated during Senate deliberations on the FY02 Defense \nAuthorization bill.\n  Major Chandler has been a credit to the Air Force Legislative Fellows \nprogram. The Air Force should be very proud of his service this past \nyear. Certainly, I will follow the development of Major Chandler's \ncareer with pride. My appreciation and best wishes go with\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\nhim, his wife Sheri, and their daughter Shelby.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11719-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 6:43 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2620.

A bill to authorize the President to reduce or suspend \nduties on textiles and textile products made in Pakistan until December \n31, 2004; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, today I rise to introduce the \nPakistan Emergency Economic Development and Trade Support Act. This \nlegislation will provide the President with the authority to reduce or \nsuspend any existing duty on imports of textiles and textile products \nthat are produced or manufactured in Pakistan. This Act is vitally \nimportant to shore up the economic strength of our strategic ally, \nPakistan, so central to our Nation's ability to continue to prosecute \nthe war against terrorism.\n  Currently, Pakistan is providing invaluable basing rights and \nintelligence assistance to the United States as we continue to degrade \nand dismantle the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Taking this action \nagainst the Taliban is crucial if we are to successfully locate and \ndestroy Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network, which the Taliban \nis currently harboring within Afghanistan's borders. Al Qaeda continues \nto represent public enemy number one in the war against terrorism.\n  Pakistan's bold stand against terror alongside the United States is \nnot made in a vacuum. There are very real economic and social \nconsequences in Pakistan for assisting the United States in our war \neffort, and it would be a failure of United States foreign policy not \nto pursue the means of assisting our ally in its time of need.\n  Textiles and textile products are Pakistan's main export. As a result \nof the war effort, invaluable orders for textile products made and \nexported by Pakistan have been canceled due to perceived instability in \nthe region and a lack of confidence that such orders will ultimately be \ndelivered. According to the Pakistan Textile and Apparel Group, \nPakistan has witnessed a 64 percent reduction in orders for clothes \nthat would be made from December through February by the 14 largest \napparel factories in Lahore, Karachi, and Faisalabad. As a result, \nemployment in these factories has dropped 32 percent from a year ago. \nThe Pakistani government has estimated the overall decline in orders at \n40 percent. This has very real consequences for the future of Pakistan, \nits stability, and its ability to forge a future of economic prosperity \nfor its people.\n  As we are all aware, a small yet very vocal fundamentalist Islamic \nminority within Pakistan which has spoken out against the Pakistani \ngovernment's assistance to the U.S., has called for and implemented \ndamaging general labor strikes, and has encouraged countless numbers of \nyoung Pakistanis to cross the border into Afghanistan to fight \nalongside the Taliban. A further weakened economy and increased \nunemployment, the clear results of a weak market for Pakistani textile \nexports, only adds to the influence of fundamentalists in Pakistan, by \nstrengthening social and economic unrest on which fundamentalists prey.\n  Currently, the Pakistani government is devoting much needed resources \nto innovative and existing human development programs inside the \ncountry. Pakistan is spending a full 2 percent of its gross domestic \nproduct, approximately $2 billion per year, on a program that combines \nimproved primary education, basic health care, and skills training for \nincome generating activities for the Pakistani people. Pakistan's \nefforts to utilize human development programs to lift up the Pakistani \npeople are central to stemming the tide of fundamentalist elements in \nour ally. An already weakened economy, hampered by years of sanctions, \ncombined with increased unemployment only serve to add to existing \nsocial dissatisfaction and civil unrest within Pakistan. This undercuts \nthe valuable impact of human development on Pakistan, makes increasing \nthese human development efforts far more difficult, and jeopardizes the \nlong-term stability of our ally.\n  As a weakened market for Pakistani textile exports ultimately renders \nhuman development programs within Pakistan less effective, especially \nthe primary education element, young Pakistani's are faced with the \nprospect of no education and therefore no quality employment. An all-\nto-frequent alternative to this prospect is for young Pakistani's to \nattend Madrasas, Islamic religious schools run by mullahs, where too \noften basic skills and primary education are supplanted by religious \nteachings used to indoctrinate young Pakistani's into following the \nperverted version of Islam followed by Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and \nthe Taliban.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to work with me to provide the President \nwith authority to assist Pakistan in the textile market immediately. \nSuch action is vitally important to the stability of our important \nally, and victory in our Nation's war against terrorism. Failing to \ntake quick action only strengthens our enemy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1676. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for small business, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, today I am introducing a package of \ntargeted, affordable tax relief provisions designed to help the \nNation's small businesses during this time of economic distress. While \nthe Finance Committee has recently reported a more general stimulus \nbill to the full Senate, that measure only contains a few items that \nwill help small businesses, which are the lifeblood of our Nation's \neconomy, creating the majority of new jobs. As the Chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I believe that \nI have an obligation\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\nto do more for small businesses, and I hope that several of the \nprovisions in my bill may be accepted by the Finance Committee's \nChairman and Ranking Member as the stimulus bill nears Senate passage.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, I have also introduced an \nemergency small business relief bill, S. 1499, which would provide \nassistance to small business concerns adversely impacted by the \nterrorist attacks of September 11. That bill currently has 51 \ncosponsors, including 15 Republicans. S. 1499 provides loan and \ninvestment assistance, as well as other programmatic relief, to small \nbusinesses impacted by the attacks, but it does not contain tax \nprovisions. I am introducing this new bill today to complement what I \nhave tried to accomplish with S. 1499. Given that my emergency bill has \nsuch widespread support, I plan on offering it as an amendment to the \neconomic stimulus package when it reaches the Senate floor, and I hope \nthat it will be added to the package before it reaches the President's \ndesk. This important legislation has been held hostage to someone \nelse's political agenda for too long one way or another, it's important \nthat we pass it and achieve the agenda of small businesses hurting \nacross this country.\n  I have titled the bill that I am introducing today ``The Affordable \nSmall Business Stimulus Act of 2001.'' Before outlining the contents of \nthe bill, I want my colleagues to know why I have selected this \n``affordable'' approach.\n  During this session of Congress, some in Congress have supported what \nI might call the ``kitchen sink'' approach. It includes everything on \nsmall business's tax wish list, often also including a number of items \nthat do not directly relate to small business, such as a complete \nrepeal of the individual Alternative Minimum Tax. As a result, that \napproach is very expensive, and not something that could be enacted \ntoday given the changed budgetary situation and the fact that we are at \nwar.\n  I call my bill an ``affordable'' stimulus package for small business \nbecause it is very targeted in the policies that it includes, and, as a \nresult, it will spend our limited resources wisely. It does not include \neverything that I would like to do for small business on the tax side, \nbut it includes enough to help stimulate this essential component of \nour economy. Moreover, the bill will help address the tax complexity \nthat many small businesses face because it includes the Single Point \nTax Filing Act that has passed the Senate on two previous occasions.\n  Let me briefly explain the contents of my bill.\n  First, as in other Senate proposals, my bill increases the expensing \nlimitation for small businesses. My bill raises it to $35,000, and it \nincreases the phase-out level, above which expensing is not allowed, to \n$350,000. The stimulus package that I recently voted for in the Finance \nCommittee temporarily increased these amounts to $35,000 and $325,000, \nrespectively. The increases in my bill, however, would be permanent, \nand both the $35,000 and $350,000 limits would be increased annually \nfor inflation beginning in calendar year 2003.\n  Second, my bill modifies and expands a provision that was signed into \nlaw in 1993 regarding new equity investments in small businesses' \nstock. Under my bill, new investments in companies with capitalization \nof up to $100 million at the time of investment will have a 75 percent \ncapital gains exclusion if the investments are held at least three \nyears. The exclusion for such investments will be 100 percent if they \nare made in a business involved in ``critical technologies,'' as \ndefined by the Commerce Department, or in technologies related to \ntransportation security, personal identification, anti-terrorism, \npollution minimization, remediation, or waste management. The 100 \npercent exclusion would also be allowed for investments in specialized \nsmall business investment companies, or SSBICs, which are private \nventure capital companies licensed by the SBA whose investments are \nmade solely in disadvantaged small businesses. Both the 75 and 100 \npercent exclusion levels would be available for investments made by \nboth individuals and corporations. In addition, the rollover period for \nsuch investments would be increased from 60 days to 180 days. The \nprovision passed in 1993 was too narrow, and I hope that this new, \nexpanded capital gains treatment will help prompt new investments in \nsmall and entrepreneurial businesses.\n  Third, my bill recognizes that the current depreciation schedules for \nhigh-tech equipment and software are out of date, given how quickly \nsuch items become obsolete in our fast-changing economy. My bill would \nreduce the recovery period for computers or peripheral equipment from \nfive years to three, and for software from three years to two. This \nchange would be permanent.\n  Fourth, my bill would make the health insurance expenses of the self-\nemployed fully tax deductible. Under current law, 60 percent is \ndeductible in 2001, 70 percent in 2002, and 100 percent in 2003. My \nbill would speed up the 100-percent deductibility to this year.\n  Fifth, to simplify tax filing, my bill would include the Single Point \nTax Filing Act. This section would simplify the tax filing process for \nemployers by allowing the Internal Revenue Service and State agencies \nto combine, on one form, both State and Federal employment tax returns. \nThis provision has been passed by the Senate twice before, but it has \nnot yet become law. There is currently a demonstration project along \nthese lines in Montana, which is working very well. I believe such \nauthority should extend to all States.\n  Sixth, my bill would extend the existing income averaging provisions \nto cover fishing as well as farming. In other words, the choice to \naverage income from a farming trade or business under present law would \nbe extended to cover income from the trade or business of fishing as \nwell. Under my bill, a farmer or fisherman electing to average his or \nher income would owe the alternative minimum tax, AMT, only to the \nextent he or she would have owed AMT had averaging not been elected. \nThis is an important change that will benefit not only people in my \nState, but also throughout New England and in other regions of the \ncountry where fishing is an important industry.\n  Finally, my bill would modify the tax treatment of investments in \ndebenture small business investment companies, or SBICs, so they are \nless likely to create unrelated business taxable income, UBTI, \nliability. The current tax treatment of money borrowed from the \ngovernment by a debenture SBIC creates taxable income for an otherwise \ntax-exempt investor, which makes it almost impossible to raise capital \nfrom these investors. Free to choose, tax-exempt investors opt to \ninvest in venture capital funds that do not create any UBTI liability. \nTherefore, my bill would assure that money borrowed from the government \nby an SBIC does not subject tax-exempt investors to UBTI. In so doing, \nthe bill would encourage greater investment in SBICs, which provide \ncritically needed venture capital to emerging small businesses. These \nventure capital funds are sorely needed in today's stalled economy.\n  I believe that ``The Affordable Small Business Stimulus Act of 2001'' \nwill provide a much-needed stimulus to small business in a way that we \ncan afford. I look forward to working with the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Finance Committee to have some or all of its provisions \nenacted into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1677. A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to create a safe harbor for retirement plan \nsponsors in the designation and monitoring of investment advisers for \nworkers managing their retirement income assets; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, that will significantly \nhelp employees get better advice on how to invest their 401(k) plans. \nThe Independent Investment Advice Act of 2001 removes an existing \nimpediment that prevents employers from offering this needed \ninformation to their employees. This legislation was carefully prepared \nwith input and consultation with affected groups and interested \nstakeholders and is supported by the American Association of Retired \nPersons, AARP, the American Society of Pension Actuaries, ASPA, \nCommittee on\n\n[[Page S11722]]\n\nInvestment of Employee Benefit Assets, CIEBA, the Financial Planning \nAssociation, FPA, and the Small Business Council of America, SBCA.\n  Over the past several years, the demand by 401(k) plan participants \nfor individualized investment advice has been growing, yet less than a \nthird of employers offer this service. Primarily, employers do not \noffer this invaluable resource due to concerns about being responsible \nand ultimately liable for the selection and monitoring of an investment \nadviser. In general, current law relieves employers of their liability \nfor the actual investment decisions made by their employees in a 401(k) \nplan. It is therefore illogical to make employers liable for providing \ntheir employees with sound, independent investment advice when we have \nintentionally shifted the burden to employees to invest their \nretirement funds wisely. The creation of a safe harbor for offering \nqualified independent investment advisers will remove this \ninconsistency and facilitate the flow of reliable, informed advice to \nemployees.\n  The Independent Investment Advice Act of 2001 creates a safe harbor \nfor plan sponsors by giving them clear guidance as to what is necessary \nto ensure that they will not have liability for the selection and \nmonitoring of qualified investment advisers. Employers will be deemed \nto have satisfied their fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA with \nrespect to the selection and monitoring of qualified investment \nadvisers, provided they meet the following strict criteria.\n  First, the employer must contract with qualified investment advisers. \nEntities such as Federal and most State registered investment advisers, \nbanks and insurance companies will be deemed to be qualified providers \nof investment advice provided the individual actually offering the \nadvice is a registered investment adviser, registered representative or \na registered broker or dealer. The Secretary of Labor has the authority \nto expand this category for other comparably qualified entities and \nindividuals.\n  Next, the investment adviser must verify in writing that it has met \nseveral standards. The investment adviser must state that it is \ncurrently qualified as defined above and acknowledge that it is a \nfiduciary and as such, solely responsible for the information provided \nto the participants. The investment adviser must also review the plan \ndocuments, including investment options, and guarantee that the \nrelationship with the investment adviser will not be in violation of \nany existing prohibited transaction rules under ERISA. It must also \nprovide documentation that it has the necessary insurance coverage, as \ndetermined by the Secretary of Labor, for potential claims by plan \nparticipants.\n  Finally, before hiring the investment adviser, the plan sponsor must \nreview the verification as previously described from the investment \nadvisor. It must also review the investment adviser's fee structure and \ncontract. Finally, it must review the Uniform Application for \nInvestment Registration as filed with SEC or comparable filing with the \nDepartment of Labor. After reviewing all of these documents, the \nadviser must determine that there is no material reason to not enter \ninto a contract with the investment advisor. The plan sponsor has a \ncontinuous duty to investigate the investment adviser if information is \nbrought to its attention questioning whether the adviser remains \nqualified or if a significant number of employees register complaints. \nBased on this review the plan sponsor must determine whether or not to \ncontinue using the investment adviser's services.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in advancing this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. McCain (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Burns, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1678. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat a member of the uniformed services or the Foreign Service shall be \ntreated as using a principal residence while away from home on \nqualified official extended duty in determining the exclusion of gain \nfrom the sale of such residence; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I, along with Senators Allard, \nLieberman, Snowe, Levin, Murkowski, Cleland, Inhofe, Landrieu, Burns, \nDurbin, Sessions and DeWine are proud to sponsor this bill to allow \nmembers of the Uniformed and Foreign Services, who are deployed or are \naway on extended active duty, to qualify for the same tax relief on the \nprofit generated when they sell their main residence as other \nAmericans. I am pleased to announce that the Secretary of State greatly \nappreciates this legislation and the strong support of this measure by \nthe senior uniformed military leadership, the 31-member associations of \nThe Military Coalition, the American Foreign Service Association, and \nthe American Bar Association. Despite such considerable support, I have \nheard that there are some lower ranking officials from the Office of \nManagement and Budget that may have some minor concerns with this \nlegislation but they have not conveyed their concerns to me or my staff \ndirectly.\n  This bill will not create a new tax benefit. Let me say that again: \nthis bill will not create a new tax benefit, it merely modifies current \nlaw to include the time members of the Uniformed and Foreign Services \nare away from home on active duty when calculating the number of years \nthe homeowner has lived in their primary residence. In short, this bill \nis narrowly tailored to remedy a specific dilemma, it treats service \nmembers and foreign service officers fairly, by treating them like all \nother Americans.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 delivered sweeping tax relief to \nmillions of Americans through a wide variety of important tax changes \nthat affect individuals, families, investors, and businesses. It was \nalso one of the most complex tax laws enacted in recent history.\n  As with any complex legislation, there are winners and losers. But in \nthis instance, there are unintended losers: service members and Foreign \nService Officers.\n  The 1997 act gives taxpayers who sell their principal residence a \nmuch-needed tax break. Prior to the 1997 act, taxpayers received a one-\ntime exclusion on the profit they made when they sold their principal \nresidence, but the taxpayer had to be at least 55 years old and live in \nthe residence for 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale. This provision \nprimarily benefitted elderly taxpayers, while not providing any relief \nto younger taxpayers and their families.\n  Fortunately, the 1997 act addressed this issue. Under this law, \ntaxpayers who sell their principal residence on or after May 7, 1997, \nare not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit from the sale; joint \nfilers are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit they make from \nselling their principal residence. The taxpayer must meet two \nrequirements to qualify for this tax relief. The taxpayer must: one, \nown the home for at least 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale; and two, \nlive in the home as their main home for at least 2 years of the last 5 \nyears.\n  I applaud the bi-partisan cooperation that resulted in this much-\nneeded form of tax relief. The home sales provision sounds great and it \nis. Unfortunately, the second part of this eligibility test \nunintentionally and unfairly prohibits many of our men and women in the \nArmed Forces and Foreign services from qualifying for this beneficial \ntax relief.\n  Constant travel across the U.S. and abroad is inherent in the \nmilitary and Foreign Services. Nonetheless, some service members and \nForeign Service Officers choose to purchase a home in a certain locale, \neven though they will not live there much of the time. Under the new \nlaw, if a service man does not have a spouse who resides in the house \nduring his absence or the spouse is also in the military and also must \ntravel, that service member will not qualify for the full benefit of \nthe new home sales provision, because no one ``lives'' in the home for \nthe required period of time. The law is prejudiced against dual-\nmilitary couples who are often away on active duty, because they would \nnot qualify for the home sales exclusion because neither spouse \n``lives'' in the house for enough time to qualify for the exclusion.\n  This bill simply remedies an inequality in the 1997 law. The bill \namends the Internal Revenue Code so that service members and Foreign \nService Officers\n\n[[Page S11723]]\n\nwill be considered to be using their house as their main residence for \nany period that they are away on extended active duty. In short, active \nand reserve service members will be deemed to be using their house as \ntheir main home, even if they are stationed in Bosnia, the Persian \nGulf, in the ``no man's land,'' commonly called the DMZ between North \nand South Korea, or anywhere else on active duty orders.\n  In 1998 alone, the United States had approximately 37,000 men and \nwomen deployed to the Persian Gulf region, preparing to go into combat, \nif so ordered. There were also 8,000 American troops deployed in \nBosnia, and another 70,000 U.S. military personnel deployed in support \nof other commitments worldwide. That is a total of 108,000 men and \nwomen deployed outside of the United States, away from their primary \nhome, protecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so dear. \nToday since the September 11 attacks on the United States we've asked \nover 100,000 service members to deploy abroad to seek out and destroy \nthe terrorists and their supporting organizations responsible for this \nincomprehensible deed.\n  The average American participates in our Nation's growth through home \nownership. Appreciation in the value of a home because of our country's \noverall economic growth allows everyday Americans to participate in our \ncountry's prosperity. Fortunately, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nrecognized this and provided this break to lessen the amount of tax \nmost Americans will pay on the profit they make when they sell their \nhomes.\n  The 1997 home sale provision unintentionally discourages home \nownership among members of the Uniformed and Foreign Services, which is \nbad fiscal policy. Home ownership has numerous benefits for communities \nand individual homeowners. Owning a home provides Americans with a \nsense of community and adds stability to our Nation's neighborhoods. \nHome ownership also generates valuable property taxes for our nation's \ncommunities.\n  We also cannot afford to discourage military service by penalizing \nmilitary personnel with higher taxes merely because they are doing \ntheir job. Military and Foreign service entails sacrifice, such as long \nperiods of time away from friends and family and the constant threat of \nmobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the tax code to \nheap additional burdens upon our men and women in uniform.\n  In my view, the way to decrease the likelihood of further inequities \nin the tax code, intentional or otherwise, is to adopt a fairer, \nflatter tax system that is far less complicated than our current \nsystem. But, in the meantime, we must insure that the tax code is as \nfair and equitable as possible.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 was designed to provide sweeping tax \nrelief to all Americans, including our men and women in uniform. It is \ntrue that there are winners and losers in any tax code, but this \ninequity was unintended. Enacting this narrowly-tailored remedy to \ngrant equal tax relief to the members of our Uniformed Services \nrestores fairness and consistency to our increasingly complex tax code.\n  I request unanimous consent that my statement and the letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record and that the full text of the \nlegislation that I have introduced be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1678\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Military Coalition, a consortium \n     of nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans \n     organizations, representing more than 5.5 million members, \n     plus their families and survivors, is grateful to you for \n     introducing The Military Homeowners Equity Act--a bill that \n     would restore capital gains tax equity for military \n     homeowners.\n       Your legislation is essential to correct a serious \n     oversight in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which \n     inadvertently penalizes servicemembers who are assigned away \n     from their principal residence for more than three years on \n     government orders. Very often, servicemembers keep their \n     homes while reassigned to overseas or elsewhere in the hopes \n     of returning to their residence. On occasions when this \n     proves impossible, and the home must be sold to permit \n     purchase of a new principal residence, servicemembers find \n     themselves subjected to substantial tax liabilities--all \n     because military orders kept them from occupying their \n     principal residence for at least two of the five years before \n     the sale.\n       In 1999, both the House and Senate passed corrective \n     legislation (H.R. 865) as part of the Taxpayer Refund and \n     Relief Act of 1999, but the President vetoed this bill over \n     an unrelated issue. Your new bill will be important to \n     resurrect this fairness issue and allow servicemembers to \n     comply with government orders and leave home to serve their \n     country without risking a large capital gains tax liability.\n       The Military Coalition pledges to work with you to seek \n     inclusion of your bill in the pending economic stimulus \n     package so military members can once again enjoy the same \n     capital gains tax relief already provided to all other \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           The Military Coalition.\n       (Signed by representatives of the following organizations:)\n         Air Force Association; Air Force Sergeants Association; \n           Army Aviation Assn. of America; Assn. of Military \n           Surgeons of the United States; Assn. of the US Army; \n           Commissioned Officers Assn. of the US Public Health \n           Service, Inc.; CWO & WO Assn.

John McCain,\n     Senate Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 23,000 active-duty \n     and retired members of the Foreign Service which the American \n     Foreign Service Association (AFSA) represents, thank you for \n     your leadership and support with your soon-to-be-introduced \n     bill extending to the Uniformed Services and the Foreign \n     Service the tax treatment enjoyed by all other Americans when \n     they sell their principal residence.\n       As you know this is an important active-duty issue for both \n     the Uniformed Services and the Foreign Service. Your bill, \n     amending section 121(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     addresses an inequity faced by our members because of the \n     particular nature of our profession. As you are well aware, \n     our careers require us to live for years at a time away from \n     our homes in duty posts around the world in service to our \n     nation. In the case of the Foreign Service, our duty \n     assignments range from 2-4 years. Back-to-back assignments \n     abroad are common. It is not unusual for a member of the \n     Foreign Service to spend six or more years abroad before \n     returning to Washington for an assignment here. With the \n     current two-in-five year occupancy test, many of our members \n     in both the Uniformed Services and the Foreign Service find \n     that we do not have the same flexibility in selling our homes \n     as enjoyed by our fellow Americans. After several years \n     abroad, there are many reasons why we may wish to sell our \n     homes upon returning home. As with other Americans, we would \n     like our homes to reflect and be suited to the changes in our \n     lives--the increase or decrease in the size of our families, \n     divorce, retirement, promotions and the ability to pay more \n     for a house, the schools our children would attend, etc. Yet \n     because of current law, we cannot sell our principal \n     residences without living in them again for two years or else \n     pay a serious tax penalty. Your bill, gratefully, addresses \n     these problems.\n       The members of the Uniformed Services and the Foreign \n     Service have been faced with this problem since the change in \n     the tax code in 1997. We hope that your provision can become \n     law soon. If we can be of any assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me or Ken Nakamura, AFSA's Director of \n     Congressional Relations at (202) 944-5517 or by e-mail at \n     nakamura@afsa.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John K. Naland,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 31, 2001.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Your efforts to improve the quality of \n     service enjoyed by our Navy-Marine Corps team are greatly \n     appreciated. I would like to extend my support for the \n     legislation that you intend to introduce to correct the tax \n     disadvantage created by The Tax Reform Act of 1997.\n       The Marine Corps has been tracking several intended to \n     correct this tax disadvantage. As you know, The Tax Reform \n     Act repealed certain portions of the existing law that \n     allowed military members to maintain the status quo with \n     other taxpayers for exclusion of capital gains. The Act \n     provided for an exclusion, obviously not intended to \n     disadvantage military service members or members of the \n     Foreign Service. In order to qualify, a taxpayer must ``own \n     and use'' the property for two of the five years preceding \n     the sale. Since our personnel seldom remain in one location \n     for over three years, it is difficult to qualify for the \n     exclusion.\n       Please let me know if there is any way in which I can be of \n     assistance or service.\n           Semper Fidelis,\n\n                                                   J.L. Jones,\n\n                                       General, U.S. Marine Corps,\n     Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         American Bar Association,\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2001.\n     Hon. John M. McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the American Bar \n     Association, I would like to commend you for your leadership \n     in developing a proposal on the issue of the military \n     homeowners capital gains exemption. Such legislation is \n     needed to correct an inequity that occurred as a result of \n     the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law No: 105-34).\n       As you know, Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     permits a single taxpayer to exclude up to $250,000 of the \n     capital gains on the sale of a principal residence and \n     permits a married couple filing jointly to exclude up to \n     $500,000 on such a sale. Yet in order to qualify for such an \n     exclusion, a taxpayer must have owned and used the home as a \n     principal residence for two out of the five years prior to \n     its sale. Otherwise, a taxpayer must pay taxes on all or a \n     pro rata share of the capital gains on the sale of the home.\n       Unfortunately, this provision penalizes service members who \n     are unable to use a principal residence for two out of the \n     five years prior to its sale, because they are deployed \n     overseas or required to live in military housing. The ABA \n     urges Congress to amend Section 121 of the IRC to either: (1) \n     treat time spent away from a principal residence while away \n     from home on official active duty as counting towards the \n     ownership and use requirement, or (2) suspend the ownership \n     and use requirement for time spent away from a principal \n     residence due to official active duty. Earlier this year, the \n     ABA submitted comments to the Internal Revenue Service on \n     proposed regulations regarding Section 121. A copy of our \n     comments is enclosed for your review.\n       We want to thank you for your plans to rectify the inequity \n     created for service members by Section 121. We look forward \n     to working with you to establish a military homeowners \n     capital gains exemption.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert D. Evans,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I want to thank Senator McCain for \noffering the ``Military Homeowner Equity Act'' and voice my full \nsupport as original sponsor. The bill provides tax equity to members of \nthe uniformed services and the Foreign Service by permitting them to \nbenefit from the capital gains tax exemption when they sell a principal \nresidence, as other Americans enjoy. The bill does so by providing that \nabsences from the principal residence due to serving on a qualified \nofficial extended duty as a member of a uniformed or Foreign Service of \nthe United States be treated as using the residence in determining the \nexclusion of gain from the sale of such residence.\n  This bill does not create a new benefit, it simply adjusts an \noversight and brings fairness and equality to the Code by recognizing \nthe unique circumstances of the members of the uniformed and Foreign \nServices. This proposed correction is not new to this Congress. The \nTaxpayer Refund and Relief Act, which passed both the House and Senate \nduring the 106th Congress included provisions to correct this problem. \nUnfortunately, that bill was vetoed.\n  The citizens of this country earned the many improvements made to the \ntax code in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Under this law, taxpayers \nwho sell their residence are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit \nfrom the sale, $500,000 for joint filers. This is a well deserved tax \nbreak that encourages and rewards home ownership. The taxpayer must \nmeet two requirements to qualify for this relief. First, they must own \nthe home for at least 2 of the last 5 years, and second they must live \nin the home for at least 2 of the last 5 years. It is the latter \nrequirement that is not fair or equitable to our service members.\n  The requirement for a taxpayer to have lived in a principal residence \nfor 2 of the previous 5 years from the date of sale in order to take \nadvantage of the full capital gains exclusion on the sale of a \nprincipal residence is difficult if not impossible for our career \nservice members to meet. Unlike most Americans, career members of our \nmilitary must, as a matter of law, serve throughout the world based on \nthe needs of the nation. Our Foreign Service personnel, on average, \nspend more than 55 percent of their career abroad, for periods of 2 to \n4 years. Consecutive tours keep our uniformed and Foreign Service \nmembers away from a ``principal residence'' far beyond the 5-year test \nperiod required in the current tax law. The unique circumstances of our \nuniformed and Foreign Service members effectively exclude them from \ntaking full advantage of the 1997 changes in the tax law if they wish \nto sell their home.\n  Service members move at the direction of the U.S. Government. They \npick up and move their families on a regular basis whenever the need of \ntheir service requires them to move. It may be possible for service \nmembers to purchase a home at some locations, but selling that home and \npurchasing another at the next location is often not possible. This \nhappens when their new location is overseas, they are assigned to live \nin government housing, off-post housing is not available for sale, or \nhome prices in the new area are simply not within their budget. Thus, \nfrequently they are unable to meet the requirement to live in a house 2 \nof the last 5 years preceding a sale.\n  Additionally, our career service members need and want to sell their \nhomes for all of the multitude of reasons that most Americans sell. \nThey may have an increase or a decrease in the size of the family or \nwant to change neighborhoods or schools. They may have the ability to \nafford more because of promotions or salary increases or it may simply \nbe time to retire and leave the service. They should not be\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\npenalized for their time away when buying and selling their home was \nimpossible or impractical.\n  The intent of the capital gains exclusion in the IRS code is to \nencourage home ownership by exempting capital gains taxes on the sale \ntheir home and allow more Americans to enjoy our country's prosperity. \nAgain, the situation that career service members are in makes it \ndifficult, or impossible, to follow this course of action. This bill \nremedies the situation. I urge my colleagues to join us in co-\nsponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 1679. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \naccelerate the reduction on the amount of beneficiary copayment \nliability for Medicare outpatient services; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, today I am introducing the Medicare \nBeneficiary Liability Reduction Act. This legislation will help \nAmerica's seniors better afford the costs of receiving needed medical \nservices.\n  As you may know, most seniors are required to pay a portion of the \ncosts associated with medical care they receive under the Medicare \nprogram. In particular, Medicare Part B, which covers physician, \nlaboratory, outpatient and other services, requires most beneficiaries \nto cover 20 percent of the cost of care they receive. However, there is \nan anomaly in the Medicare system that has required many beneficiaries \nto pay much more out-of-pocket for hospital outpatient department, \nHOPD, services. in particular, prior to 1997, many beneficiaries were \nrequired to pay more than 50 percent of the approved Medicare costs for \nhospital outpatient care. I am concerned that this situation made it \ndifficult for lower income seniors to receive needed outpatient medical \nservices.\n  To address this problem, I am happy to say that the Congress included \nmeasures in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that sought to bring \nbeneficiary cost sharing for HOPD care in line with the out-of-pocket \nrequirements for other Medicare Part B services. Unfortunately, while \nthis legislation was a step in the right direction, it will still take \nnearly 40 years of the cost sharing level to be reduced to the targeted \nlevel for some outpatient procedures. Clearly, this prolonged time lag \nis unacceptable.\n  In subsequent years, I have supported additional measures to expedite \nthe reduction in seniors' cost sharing liability by placing a limit on \nhow much a senior can be charged in any given year and requiring that \nthe coinsurance level be brought down to 40 percent by 2006. These were \nimportant achievements. The legislation I am introducing today takes \nthe final step to bring seniors' copayment rates for HOPD services down \nto the desired 20 percent level.\n  In particular, the Medicare Beneficiary Liability Reduction Act would \ncontinue to reduce HOPD cost-sharing requirements so that by 2010 and \nthereafter seniors would be required to pay no more than 20 percent of \nthe allowable Medicare costs for HOPD care. I strongly believe that \nthis legislation will help ensure our nation's seniors are not over-\nburdened with unfair Medicare cost sharing requirements. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this important effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1679\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act \nof 1940 to provide that duty of the National Guard mobilized by a State \nin support of Operation Enduring Freedom or otherwise at the request of \nthe President shall qualify as military service under that Act; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I rise today to urge your support for \namending the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, SSCRA, to expand \nthe protections of that Act to National Guard personnel protecting our \nNation's airports and nuclear facilities. Specifically, this bill will \nprovide civil relief to National Guard personnel mobilized by State \ngovernors in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, or who are \notherwise called up at the request of the President.\n  The SSCRA is an important Act that provides help to people who have \ntaken on financial burdens without knowing they would be called up to \nserve in the military. Today those people are the men and women of our \nNational Guard called-up to protect our nation's airports. Men and \nwomen of the National Guard serve the Nation and our States as a unique \norganization among all branches of the United States armed forces, the \nGuard is America's community based defense force, located in more than \n2,700 cities and towns throughout the Nation. Some 60 of these units \nare in my home state of Minnesota. National Guard members are integral \nmembers of their communities, they and their families live, shop, work, \nworship and go to schools in our cities and towns. It is this link \nbetween the community and its citizen-soldiers that makes the National \nGuard unique and so vital to our homeland security. It is imperative we \ngive them the protections of the SSCRA they rightly deserve.\n  I would like to take a moment to explain the protections offered by \nthe SSCRA. Most people have debts or financial obligations of one kind \nor another, mortgages on family homes, debts related to buying cars, \ncharge account debts from buying things with credit cards, or child-\nsupport payments. The SSCRA does not wipe out any debts or other \nfinancial obligations of people who have been called up for active \nduty. But it does give them certain protections. A few of these are \nespecially important because they affect a large number of people: \nSection 526 states that interest of no more than 6 percent a year can \nbe charged by a lender on a debt which a person on active duty in \nmilitary service incurred before he or she went on active duty. This is \nvery important. The men and women of our National Guard are people like \nyou and me, they've bought things on credit and have jobs that allow \nthem to pay off that debt. But now, many have taken pay cuts to protect \nour airports. Capping interest on their debt is important to ensuring \ntheir financial security.\n  Other sections of the SSCRA protect people from being evicted from \nrental property or from mortgaged property, against cancellation of \nlife insurance, from having their property sold to pay taxes that are \ndue; and from getting stuck in a lease, some Guardsmen may have \nrecently rented a new apartment only to find their duty is going to \nsend them far from their new property.\n  Unfortunately, the SSCRA only applies to National Guard personnel \nmobilized directly by the President of the United States, and does not \nprotect those mobilized by state governors at the request of the \nPresident, as is the case with those National Guard now protecting our \nairports. This distinction is inequitable and actually, makes no sense. \nService performed by those mobilized by a governor at the request of \nthe President face the same problems as those mobilized by the \nPresident directly. It is only right that they receive the same \nprotections.\n  Although the President is clearly authorized to mobilize the National \nGuard himself, on September 27 he instead requested State governors to \nmobilize their own National Guard personnel. He did so again last \nFriday. Under this type of mobilization the National Guard remains \nunder the full operational control of the State, providing the \nnecessary flexibility to deal\n\n[[Page S11726]]\n\nwith security issues that are better handled at the State and local \nlevel. While National Guard mobilized in this manner receive the \ngeneral benefits of active duty military personnel, such as VA Veterans \nstatus and Tricare family health insurance, they do not receive the \nadditional benefit of civil relief under the SSCRA.\n  In Minnesota, soldiers have received orders to provide protection at \nairports until as late as March 28, 2002. These soldiers are serving in \na full-time status, six to seven days per week. While the Minnesota \nNational Guard initially began providing security at the Minneapolis/\nSt. Paul, Duluth and Rochester airports, they were recently informed \nthat they will provide security at five additional Minnesota airports. \nThis means they will spend less time with their families and employers. \nSome of them face the real possibility of financial ruin due to their \ntime away from work. They have mortgages and car payments, things they \nmay have easily expected to be able to pay. Some have college debt and \nothers child support payments. Many have taken pay cuts to leave their \nprofessions to come out and protect our airports, to protect us. We \nmust act now to provide them the civil relief they rightly deserve. And \nwe must be aware that National Guard units may soon be asked to secure \nother facilities such as power plants and water treatment facilities in \nthe near future. Addressing these issues now will ease the burden \nplaced upon these soldiers now and in the future.\n  It is my belief that the SSCRA was never meant to purposely exclude \nNational Guard mobilized in the manner they have been today, we simply \ncould never have imagined the need for round-the-clock security at our \nairports when this Act was written. September 11 changed so many things \nfor us. And it is time we change the SSCRA to ensure we provide \nbenefits to protect those who are protecting us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11726-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 178--CONGRATULATING BARRY BONDS ON HIS SPECTACULAR \n RECORD-BREAKING SEASON IN 2001 AND OUTSTANDING CAREER IN MAJOR LEAGUE \n                                BASEBALL\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncongratulating Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants for his historic \nachievements during the 2001 baseball season and to thank him for his \ncontributions to baseball and his community.\n  On October 7, 2001 at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, Barry Bonds \nhit his 73rd home run, setting a new record for most home runs in a \nseason, eclipsing the previous mark of 70 set by Mark McGwire of the \nSt. Louis Cardinals in 1998. In addition, during the 2001 campaign \nBarry Bonds set records for slugging percentage, 16 points above the \nprevious mark, and most walks in a season, surpassing the feats of the \nimmortal Babe Ruth.\n  Barry Bonds' outstanding play on the field added to what was already \na Hall of Fame career: 3 Most Valuable Player awards, 567 career home \nruns, 7th on the all-time list, the only player with more than 400 home \nruns and 400 stolen bases, 10 All-Star Game appearances, 8 Gold Glove \nawards, and the Sporting News' Player of the Decade for the 1990s.\n  As a native San Franciscan and life-long San Francisco Giants fan, I \ncould not be prouder of Barry Bonds. His roots in California and the \nBay Area run deep. Born in Riverside, he grew up in San Mateo and \nattended Sierra High School. After attending Arizona State University \nand beginning his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Barry Bonds \nreturned to his hometown team, the Giants, in 1993.\n  No one should be surprised that Barry Bonds has reached the elite \nlevel of baseball players. After all, he is the son of former major \nleague star and San Francisco Giant, Bobby Bonds, and the godson of \nperhaps the greatest living ball player, the great Willie Mays.\n  His exploits in baseball are matched by his dedication to the \ncommunity off the field. Seven years ago he founded the Barry Bonds \nFamily Foundation, headed by his mother, Pat Bonds. The Foundation \nsupports activities and programs opportunities of African American \nyouth in the Bay Area. Barry Bonds and his Foundation are particularly \ninvolved in the United Way's ``Link and Learn'', a program dedicated to \nraising student achievement through greater parental involvement, \naccess to tutoring and interactive technology.\n  All baseball fans, even those of the Los Angeles Dodgers, can \nappreciate Barry Bonds' breathtaking skill, record setting performance, \nand commitment to his community. During a difficult time for our \ncountry, he gave us a reason to return to the ballpark and cheer him on \nthe way to a new home run record. All over the country, fans rose from \ntheir seats for every at-bat, celebrated each home run, and even booed \ntheir own teams when they intentially walked him.\n  At 37 years old, he is in the prime of his baseball career and I am \nsure he will amaze and dazzle us many more times in the future.\n  Again, I congratulate Barry Bonds for his season and thank him for \nall that he has done for baseball and his community. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11726-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11726-S11727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 179--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n         ENSURING QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR OUR NATION'S VETERANS\n\n  Mr. BOND submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Res. 180\n\n       Whereas certain marine species including Atlantic tunas, \n     swordfish, marlins, sailfishes, and pelagic sharks migrate \n     through broad oceanic expanses and traverse the coastal \n     waters of many nations;\n       Whereas, of these highly migratory species, tuna and \n     swordfish stocks in particular support major fisheries and \n     are among the most highly valued of marine species;\n       Whereas due to the transboundary nomadic nature of these \n     highly migratory species, effective efforts to conserve and \n     manage these stocks require international cooperation and \n     coordination;\n       Whereas the International Convention for the Conservation \n     of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) was established in 1966 to provide \n     international management of highly migratory species;\n       Whereas the highly migratory species managed by ICCAT \n     support extremely important commercial and recreational \n     fisheries in the United States which are vital sources of \n     income to United States fishing communities;\n       Whereas repeated violations of ICCAT conservation quotas \n     and minimum size requirements, circumvention of compliance \n     penalties and other actions have undermined the ability of \n     ICCAT to establish, maintain and enforce conservation and \n     rebuilding plans for overfished species of fish under ICCAT's \n     management authority;\n       Whereas the latest scientific information suggests there is \n     extensive mixing of bluefin tuna harvested in the eastern \n     Atlantic and Mediterranean region with bluefin tuna harvested \n     in the western Atlantic;\n       Whereas the current level of harvest of bluefin tuna \n     harvested in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean is \n     excessive and must be reduced, and that due to mixing, \n     management measures in the east directly affect the west;\n       Whereas a failure of ICCAT member nations to enforce \n     quotas, size limits and other conservation measures adversely \n     affects United States commercial and recreational fishermen: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should make full use of all \n     appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, relevant international \n     laws and agreements, and other appropriate mechanisms to \n     ensure ICCAT member compliance with ICCAT conservation \n     measures and quotas, for all species under ICCAT management \n     authority, including bluefin tuna;\n       (2) the United States should press for improved monitoring, \n     recording and reporting of harvesting and compliance \n     information by contracting and non-contracting nations to \n     ICCAT, including systems that will increase transparency of \n     such reporting information, in order to provide the \n     scientific information necessary for effective management of \n     these stocks;\n       (3) the United States should encourage the Commission to \n     identify nations that engage in actions that diminish the \n     effectiveness of the Commission's fishery conservation \n     program, including those engaged in illegal, unreported, or \n     unregulated fishing for these stocks; and\n       (4) the United States should encourage the Commission to \n     adopt recommendations authorizing the use of enforceable \n     measures, including World Trade Organization-consistent trade \n     measures, to prevent such nations from taking actions that \n     would undermine the effectiveness of conservation and \n     management recommendations of the Commission.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise today to submit a resolution along \nwith my colleague Ms. Snowe of Maine, that calls on the United States \nto make full use of all appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, relevant \ninternational laws and agreements, and other appropriate mechanisms to \nensure international compliance with the International Commission for \nthe Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, ICCAT, conservation measures for \nall managed species.\n  This week a group of committed fishery managers, scientists and \nindustry representatives began travel overseas to represent our nation \nat the 17th regular meeting of the ICCAT in Murcia, Spain.\n  This multinational fishery conservation and management body of over \n40 nations has a mandate to ensure the sustainability of all Atlantic \nfisheries for swordfish, billfish and a number of tuna species. Such \nmultinational cooperation is necessary to effectively conserve and \nmanage these species, which migrate widely on the high seas and through \njurisdictions of many coastal Atlantic nations. Effective unilateral \nmanagement of species that migrate through multiple jurisdictions is \nsimply not possible, as was specifically recognized under the 1995 U.N. \nAgreement on Straddling Stocks and Highly Migratory Species.\n  I am sad to report that many ICCAT member nations have failed to \ncomply with basic ICCAT quota and minimum size regulations for several \nimportant species. The magnitude of these violations is so great that \nit could render useless all of the conservation plans that ICCAT have \nput in place to date. I find this very troubling, particularly given \nthe tremendous burdens placed on U.S. fishermen to improve conservation \nof these species. They rightly object to being disadvantaged in the \nmarketplace by nations who can sell fish more cheaply because their \ncosts of compliance with the law are essentially zero.\n  Furthermore, it is my understanding that some ICCAT member nations \nhave undermined essential conservation plans from the outset for \nseveral ICCAT species, by simply setting a quota that is in flagrant \ndisregard of the best advice of the scientific community. These species \ninclude bluefin tuna and swordfish. Both of these species are extremely \nimportant to fishermen along the East Coast.\n  As I stated earlier compliance to basic conservation measures is \nabsolutely essential to rebuilding our highly valuable stocks of \nswordfish and tuna. American fishermen have made great sacrifices for \nthe conservation of bluefin tuna and swordfish in order to rebuild \nthese stocks to their maximum sustainable yield. Nothing infuriates \nlaw-abiding U.S. fishermen more than having their future conservation \ngains squandered by nations that openly flout ICCAT's scientifically-\nbased conservation standards. This simply cannot continue.\n\n[[Page S11728]]\n\n  I strongly urge the U.S. delegation to this year's ICCAT to demand \nfull compliance with all conservation measures, including sound, \nscientifically based quotas for all managed species. We have learned \nthe hard way that the alternative to pro-active conservation is \noverfished and depleted stocks. These impacts go beyond financial costs \nto the fishing industry, and can place severe strains on local \ncommunities, national economies, and critical food supply chains. I do \nnot need to remind you, of the devastating impacts overfishing caused \nin New England. In the 1980s our fishermen, like those of many ICCAT \nnations do today, believed that our oceans contained unlimited amounts \nof cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder. But by the early 1990s our \nstocks crashed causing severe economic harm to fishermen and their \ncoastal communities. U.S. fishermen know firsthand what a fishery crash \nwill mean and they are more than willing to do their part to ensure the \nsame fate does not befall our international fisheries. The truth of the \nmatter is, without compliance by all of ICCAT member nations, \nrebuilding these species is a sisyphean feat, an endless uphill battle. \nThe U.S. cannot lift this boulder alone, we are but a small component \nof the total fishery. Sound, pro-active conservation works, one need \nonly look at Georges Bank today and see how far we have come with cod, \nhaddock and yellowtail flounder.\n  The truth, is that the fishermen of the United States cannot carry \nthe conservation load by themselves for highly migratory species. But \neven here in the United States we have shown that it is possible to \nrevive multi-jurisdictional species through coordinated but mandatory \nconservation measures, the Atlantic states worked together to bring \nstriped bass back from the edge, and the resulting striped bass \npopulation has exceeded all expectations. We must ensure that this is a \nmodel we successfully export to other nations, and ICCAT is the place \nwe need to do it. The U.S. must demand from our fellow ICCAT members \nwhat we already demand from ourselves: use the best science when \nsetting quotas and comply with quotas once they have been set. It is a \nsimple rule, and it works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nKerry, to submit a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate \nregarding the policy of the United States at the 17th Regular Meeting \nof the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, \nICCAT.\n  We are submitting this resolution today as our delegates prepare for \nthe upcoming ICCAT meeting in Murcia, Spain which begins on November \n12, 2001. At this meeting the ICCAT will set international quotas for \nhighly migratory species and recommend conservation and sustainable \nmanagement measures. The ICCAT is an international body and only has \nthe authority to make recommendations to its member nations. As such, \nthe effective management of highly migratory species, such as bluefin \ntuna, requires the cooperation of the member nations in this voluntary \nregime. The sustainable harvest and longterm viability of U.S. bluefin \ntuna fisheries depends on the compliance with management measures by \nall member nations. Unfortunately, several member nations routinely \ntake actions that undermine the convention.\n  In some cases, the conservation efforts of other countries do not \ndirectly affect the United States and its fishing industry. That is not \nthe case with highly migratory species, such as the ones managed \nthrough ICCAT. Recent scientific studies conducted cooperatively with \nU.S. fishermen have shown that bluefin tuna caught off the coast of the \nUnited States migrate to and from the Eastern Atlantic and the \nMediterranean Sea. This means that the traditional notion of the \nEastern Atlantic stock being separate and independent from the Western \nAtlantic stock is not accurate and the data indicate it is one mixed \nstock of fish. Therefore, overharvesting of bluefin tuna in the Eastern \nAtlantic has a direct effect on United States fisheries.\n  This resolution expresses the Senate's belief that the United States \nneeds to push for improved monitoring, reporting, and compliance with \nall ICCAT management plans. This will help all nations to identify \nthose that have routinely acted counter to the recommendations of the \nICCAT and aid enforcement efforts. It is important for the \ninternational community to understand which nations are undermining the \nrecovery efforts of the ICCAT and take action to correct this problem. \nThe United States should push for the necessary changes to create \ntransparency in the conservation and management efforts of all members \nof the ICCAT. We need to know who is a dedicated partner in these \nefforts to conserve and sustainably manage highly migratory species.\n  As chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oceans, \nAtmosphere, and Fisheries, Senator Kerry and I have been dedicated to \nimproving fisheries management. This resolution is a critical step in \nensuring that the international management plan approved by the ICCAT \nin 1998 meets the sustainable harvest goals that we all fought for. I \nurge my colleagues to join us and support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/13/senate-section/article/S11728-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 82--AUTHORIZING THE 2002 WINTER OLYMPICS \n              TORCH RELAY TO COME ONTO THE CAPITOL GROUNDS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Dodd, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. \nStevens) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.
