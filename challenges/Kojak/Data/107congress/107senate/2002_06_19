Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss, \nbriefly, a proposed rule for the Republican conference on the issue of \nseniority for members, chairmanships, and also for ranking members.\n  Effective January 1, 1997, the Republican caucus adopted a rule which \nprovided that there would be a 6-year limit on committee chairmanships \nand ranking members; chairmanships, of course, if in the majority, \nranking members if in the minority.\n  There has since arisen a controversy as to whether that meant 6 years \nas chairman and an additional 6 years as ranking member or whether that \nmeant 6 years total for chairman and ranking member.\n  Having participated in the conference which produced the rule, I \nthink it is fair to say that the intent was to have a total 6-year \nlimitation,\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\nchairman and ranking member combined.\n  Certainly, there is no doubt that in establishing a 6-year limit for \nevery leadership position in the Republican caucus, except for the \nposition of Republican leader--majority leader or minority leader, \ndepending on control of the Senate--aside from Senator Lott's position, \nit is plain that all the other leadership positions were limited to a \ntotal of 6 years, without distinction as to whether it was a majority \nor minority position.\n  The chairman of the conference, Senator Santorum, came out with an \ninterpretation that the rule did mean total years whether it was \nchairman or ranking member; not 6 and 6, but a total of 6 years.\n  Yesterday, I circulated a proposed rule which would make it \nconclusive that a Republican Senator shall be limited to 6 years in the \naggregate for service as chairman and ranking member of a committee. \nFor example, if the Senator served 4\\1/2\\ years as chairman and 1\\1/2\\ \nyears as ranking, that would constitute the requisite 6-year limit.\n  There has been some consideration as to whether being ranking is \nreally a position of significance. I would submit from my experience in \nthis body that it conclusively is not as good as being chairman, but it \nis the lead Republican on the committee.\n  For example, on Intelligence, the chairman and the ranking member, or \nvice chairman, have access to the confidential briefings. On the \nJudiciary Committee, the chairman and the ranking member have access to \nthe confidential briefings by the Attorney General when something \narises where notification is important, or by the FBI Director or by \nthe INS Director or any one of the Federal agencies subject to \noversight by the Judiciary Committee.\n  At the committee hearings, it is the chairman and the ranking member \nwho are accorded the right, the privilege, of making opening \nstatements. There is a considerable difference on staff, and the \nranking member does have a say, to a significant extent, on the \norganization and direction of the committee. So I think, as a practical \nmatter, being ranking is very significant.\n  Some of my colleagues have raised the concern that if they served as \nranking for a year, for example, they would then not be able to serve \nas chairman for 6 years--if we Republicans retook the majority--but for \nonly 5 years.\n  So my rule has a subsection which provides that if a person who has \nseniority to be ranking member elects not to be ranking member, that \nperson may do so; and then that would not count against the 6 years as \nchairman if and when the Republicans again control of the Senate.\n  So for those who think the position of ranking member is not of \nsignificance, or choose not to undertake that position, or prefer not \nto have that position, which would then be a limitation on their \nservice as chairman, that member can opt not to serve as ranking \nmember.\n  When this rule was proposed, I had grave doubts about it, frankly, \nhaving been here for a considerable period of time, and approaching the \nsituation where I would have the seniority. But as the rule was put \ninto effect, obviously, I have observed it.\n  As a part of the rule, I could no longer serve as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. But it seems to me the Republican caucus ought to \ngo back to where we--Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. An additional 1 minute is \ngranted.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion--the two most popular words of any \nspeech--I think it is a fair assessment that what was intended was 6 \nyears in total. That was the interpretation, to repeat, which the \nchairman of the Republican Conference, Senator Santorum, had made by an \nofficial interpretation.\n  The rule I am proposing, which will be voted on next Tuesday--I had \neach member of the Republican caucus served with notice, both having it \ndelivered to their offices yesterday and having a copy served on each \none of the desks here so there is a double service of notice--would \nprovide for a 6-year maximum limitation, having provided the leeway for \na Member not to serve as ranking, if he chose to follow that course, so \nas to have the full 6 years as chairman, if and when the Republicans \nare the majority party.\n  I, again, thank my colleagues. I thank the Senator from New Jersey \nfor his patience, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5722-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5722-S5725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I appreciate this opportunity to, once \nagain, speak on a topic I believe needs to be debated fully in front of \nthe American public and before this fall's elections. That topic is \nSocial Security and the proposals circulating with regard to \nprivatization of Social Security and the reduction in guaranteed \nbenefits for future generations.\n  Yesterday two of our Nation's top experts on Social Security issued a \nthoughtful and detailed new study on the recommendations of the Bush \nSocial Security Commission to privatize Social Security. The report was \nprepared by Dr. Peter Orszag of the Brookings Institution and Dr. Peter \nDiamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is the \nincoming president of the American Economic Association--two credible, \nthoughtful researchers who bring objectivity to their work in this \narea.\n  The report by Drs. Orszag and Diamond objectively confirmed what I \nand many Democrats in the House and Senate have been trying to say on a \nregular basis on the floor for some time: The Bush Social Security \nCommission has developed privatization plans that would force deep cuts \nin guaranteed benefits. Those cuts for many current workers could \nexceed 25 percent and for some future retirees up to 45 percent.\n  These cuts would apply to everyone, even those who choose not to risk \ntheir benefits in privatized accounts. Cuts would be even deeper for \nthose who do invest in privatized accounts. In fact, actual cuts are \nlikely to be deeper than current estimates, as the Commission's plans \ndepend on substantial infusions of revenues from the General Treasury.\n  Given the current state of our Federal budgetary policies, it is \npretty hard to expect that we will put $2.5 to $3 trillion into the \nSocial Security fund from the general revenues over the next 40 years \nor so, with the major demands we have on our general revenues.\n\n  Remember, what we actually will be doing is spending Social Security \ntrust fund moneys for those general purposes, as opposed to infusing \nmoney into the Social Security trust fund.\n  This year we will run roughly a $300 billion deficit, if you include \nexpenditures out of the Social Security trust fund, taking every penny \nof that to spend on other things, some quite responsible with regard to \nnational security and homeland security. The fact is, we are using \nSocial Security funds for everything but Social Security.\n  With respect to the basic elements of the Orszag and Diamond report, \nthey spell out in great detail all of the cuts in guaranteed benefits. \nI urge my colleagues to take a look at it. This is not just political \nrhetoric. This is about the facts of what this Commission's report is \nproposing. It is noteworthy. In fact, it is newsworthy.\n  The New York Times today--and I will include the article for the \nRecord--gives a good summary of the report and relates the fact that \nguaranteed benefits are going to be cut if we follow the propositions \nincluded in that report.\n  First, the Orszag and Diamond report provides a lot of detail about \nhow these deep benefit cuts will come about. It finds that, even if you \nadd income that can be derived from the privatized accounts, many \nseniors would be substantially worse off under the Bush Commission \nplans than under current law.\n  Let me repeat that, because this is one of the arguments I hear \ncoming back all the time when we talk about Social Security. Even if \nyou add the income that can be derived from privatized accounts, many \nseniors would be substantially worse off under the Bush Commission \nplans than the current system.\n  Take, for example, a two-earner couple who claims benefits at age 65 \nin 2075. Their guaranteed benefits would be reduced by 46 percent. \nSince the whole point of Social Security is to\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\nprovide guaranteed benefits, this 46-percent cut is what actually \nmatters. They go through the detail of itemizing how you get to that, \nbut that is the bottom line. There is no argument with the numbers. In \nfact, they are verified by the Social Security actuaries themselves in \nthe Bush Commission report.\n  Having said that, I recognize it is possible that cuts in guaranteed \nbenefits will be offset in some part by income from privatized \naccounts. It is possible, but it may not even be likely. The Orszag-\nDiamond report actually makes that quite clear.\n  As their report explains, if you go back to the couple whose \nguaranteed benefits would be cut by 46 percent and use assumptions \nadopted by the Social Security Administration, this couple, on average, \nwould be able to offset about a quarter of their benefits with income \nfrom an annuity purchased with the proceeds from their privatized \naccount. However, if my arithmetic is right, that still leaves them \nwith a 21-percent cut in benefits compared to current law.\n  This 21-percent net cut in benefits is not the end of the story \nbecause projected income from privatized accounts also comes from \nincreased risk. In the world I came from, we used to assign \nprobabilities about whether events would happen. It is called the risk-\nadjusted view of what returns would be. These alternative proposals are \nnot guaranteed. They are not locked in. Sometimes they can be great; \nsometimes they can be poor. Markets move sideways for long periods of \ntime. Sometimes they go up; sometimes they go down.\n  Not only are you getting real cuts that the Orszag-Diamond report \nitemizes, but you are also taking on the risk with these privatized \naccounts that you won't have the resources to buy that actuarially \npresumed annuity that is going to make up for those benefits.\n  After all, the promise of a dollar backed by the full faith and \ncredit of the U.S. Government in your Social Security is a lot better \nthan those risk-adjusted returns in the stock market. That is what the \nAmerican people are looking for.\n  Drs. Orszag and Diamond decided to make such an adjustment using the \nrisk adjustment approach as advocated by the Bush Office of Management \nand Budget so they could actually make these things on comparisons that \nare real. They found, if you adjust those benefits, as I suggested, for \nthe levels of risk, the same two-couple wage earner would face a 40-\npercent cut in benefits. That is using these statistical adjustments \nthat are reasonable.\n  Madam President, this puts the lie to those who claim it is worth \ncutting guaranteed benefits in return for a gamble in the stock market. \nIt just doesn't work out. The truth is, even using the assumptions of \nthe administration, privatized accounts are a risky, bad deal and are \nnot likely to compensate for the deep cuts in guaranteed benefits they \nwould require.\n  The next point I want to bring out from this Orszag-Diamond study \nrelates to one of the assumptions of the Bush Social Security \nCommission--the assumption of large infusions of general revenues from \nthe rest of the budget. They suggest you put that in conjunction with \nwhere we are in our budgetary status in the country today, and we have \ntrouble to start with just on a fundamental basis. But the Orszag-\nDiamond report finds that under model 3--there are three different \nmodels the Commission talks about--the present value of the general \nrevenue transfers in 2001 dollars, to flush up the Social Security \ntrust fund and make it actuarially sound, is $2.8 trillion. That is a \nlot of dough. I have a hard time even understanding what $2.8 trillion \nis, but I don't think we have that kind of money laying around in our \ngeneral revenues.\n  If you protect disabled individuals from cuts, since they generally \ncannot work and make contributions to privatized accounts, you would \nneed $3.1 trillion in general revenues. The totals for model 2 are \nalmost as high.\n  Madam President, $3.1 trillion is such a huge number that I am sure \nmany Americans don't have an idea of what that really means. But it is \nalmost as large as the entire publicly held debt we have, which we have \naccumulated over 225 years, which is now $3.4 trillion. In fact, it is \nalmost as large as the entire Social Security shortfall, which we are \ntrying to correct in the first place, which is $3.7 trillion over the \nnext 75 years.\n  In other words, if we really will have $3.1 trillion in extra general \nrevenues sitting around doing nothing, we could solve this Social \nSecurity problem just flatout. We would not have to move to \nprivatization, or adding risk adjustments to individual accounts to try \nto get this done; and certainly we would not have to move to these \nkinds of significant cuts in benefits that are proposed in the \ncommission's suggestions.\n  That sounds pretty good and pretty easy, but is it realistic to \nassume that we would have that extra $3.1 trillion just available to \nsubsidize privatized accounts? The Bush commission obviously thinks so. \nBut they are hard pressed to find many others who would agree. In fact, \nnow that the Bush tax cuts have been enacted, which by themselves will \ncost $8.7 trillion in that same period, we are now looking at \nprojections of deficits for years to come.\n\n  So long as those tax breaks remain in place, the Commission's \nassumption of large general revenue transfers is pretty much in the \nworld of fantasy.\n  Another point made by the Orszag-Diamond study is that the privatized \naccounts proposed by the Commission don't just drain money from the \nSocial Security trust fund over the next 75 years; they drain the trust \nfund permanently. This may surprise some people who think privatization \nwould involve some short-term transition costs.\n  We often hear about a $1 trillion transition cost. But the fact is \nthat these drains are self-sustaining because they have created a \nprogram that subsidizes these personal accounts, these privatized \naccounts.\n  The Orszag-Diamond report makes this clear. This should come as no \nsurprise when you remember that people are trading a risk account for \none that is guaranteed. So they are going to have to do something to \nencourage people to do that, and they are draining money from the \nSocial Security trust fund to encourage making that happen. I think \nthat is very dangerous. I really do believe it is a misrepresentation \nof how this whole process works. I think the study makes this very \nclear in very detailed, objective language.\n  Finally, I want to highlight the Orszag-Diamond study's conclusions \nabout the depth of the cuts that would be required in benefits for the \ndisabled and for family members who survive the loss of a loved one \nbecause these would be especially severe. There would be little \nrecourse for most victims of these cuts.\n  According to the Orszag-Diamond report, disabled individuals would \nface cuts of up to 48 percent by 2075. These same reductions would \napply to the younger children of workers who die prematurely.\n  These are the cuts that would apply to all beneficiaries, even those \nwho do not risk their benefits in privatized accounts. So I think it is \nimportant the American people understand that this isn't just political \nrhetoric. We have an objective study using the numbers of the Social \nSecurity actuaries to show that we are talking about real cuts, real \ncuts in guaranteed benefits, and that we are subsidizing privatized \npersonal accounts to try to encourage something that is going to \nrequire a huge infusion of general revenues from the general accounts \nof the Government. Where that will come from is a mystery to me and to \nmost who look at it.\n  So I think we have a real serious cause for debate in front of this \nelection this fall to make sure that people understand what they are \nbuying into if we go to this Social Security privatization scheme. \nPersonally, I think it is a disaster for our country.\n  I hope, as do the 50 Members of this body who wrote a letter to the \nPresident last week urging him to publicly reject these cuts in \nguaranteed Social Security benefits, we can have this debate before \nthis election so that when we bring this topic to the floor, it will be \nsomething the voters have expressed themselves on before we express \nourselves. I think it is very productive that we have serious, \nthoughtful, objective evidence such as the Orszag-Diamond report to \nhelp bring light on this debate.\n  I am going to make sure my colleagues have a chance to review this,\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\nmake sure it is circulated. I thank my colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary of the Orszag-\nDiamond report and the New York Times article be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, June 19, 2002]\n\n   Report Predicts Deep Benefit Cuts Under Bush Social Security Plan\n\n                       (By Richard W. Stevenson)\n\n       Washington, June 18.--Opponents of President Bush's plan to \n     create personal investment accounts within Social Security \n     released a report today concluding that the administration's \n     approach would lead to deep cuts in retirement benefits and \n     still require trillions of dollars in additional financing to \n     keep the system solvent.\n       The report, by Peter A. Diamond, an economics professor at \n     the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Peter R. \n     Orszag, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is sure \n     to provide material to Democrats for this fall's \n     Congressional elections.\n       White House officials criticized the report as misleading \n     or wrong. They said the report exaggerated the cuts in \n     benefits by comparing them with what is available under \n     current law, rather than with what the system could afford to \n     pay if no changes were made to the system as the population \n     ages in coming decades.\n       Without any changes, Social Security will start paying out \n     more in benefits than it takes in from payroll tax revenues \n     and interest starting in 2027, leaving it increasingly \n     dependent on redeeming government bonds the system holds, \n     according to the system's trustees. By 2041, Social Security \n     would exhaust its ``trust fund'' of bonds, leaving it unable \n     to pay full benefits.\n       The report concluded that under two of the commission's \n     three proposals, monthly benefits for each member of a two-\n     earner couple retiring at 65 in 2075 would be well below \n     benefits promised under current law even after taking account \n     of the returns from a personal investment account. The report \n     did not analyze the commission's third proposal, which would \n     not seek to restore the system's long-term solvency.\n       Under one of the commission's proposals, the report said, \n     total benefits would be 10 percent below current-law benefits \n     for low-income people, 21 percent below current-law benefits \n     for middle-income people and 25 percent below current-law \n     benefits for upper income people.\n       Under the other proposal, the reductions in total benefits \n     would range from 21 percent to 27 percent, and would be even \n     larger if adjusted for the risk of investing in the stock \n     market, the report said. The benefit reductions would be \n     smaller for people who reach retirement age in the next three \n     or four decades.\n       Charles P. Blahous, executive director of the president's \n     commission, said the study ``appears to have been \n     deliberately constructed to bias the discussion against \n     proposals that include personal accounts.''\n       Mr. Blahous cited calculations showing that in most cases \n     retirees would receive larger benefits under the commission's \n     proposals than the current system can actually afford to pay, \n     and that in some cases beneficiaries would do as well as or \n     better than the current system promises.\n\n         The Century Foundation, New York, NY; Center on Budget \n           and Policy Priorities, Washington, D.C.\n                                                    June 18, 2002.\n\n   Social Security Commission Plans Would Entail Substantial Benefit \n          Reductions and Large Subsidies for Private Accounts\n\n\n  new study analyzes implications of commission plans for retirement \n          benefits, social security financing, and the budget\n\n       The proposals that President Bush's Social Security \n     Commission issued in December would substantially reduce \n     benefits for future retirees and the disabled while requiring \n     multi-trillion dollar transfers from the rest of the budget \n     to finance private retirement accounts, according to a major \n     new study co-authored by the incoming president of the \n     American Economic Association and a Brookings Institution \n     expert on the economics of retirement. The study is being \n     published jointly by the Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities and the Century Foundation; a more technical \n     version of the study, also being released today, is available \n     as a Brookings institution working paper on the Brookings \n     website.\n       The study finds that the private accounts the Commission \n     proposed would significantly worsen Social Security's \n     financial position, both in the short-term and permanently, \n     by drawing funds from Social Security to subsidize those who \n     elect the private accounts. The Commission proposals are able \n     to restore long-term solvency, the study shows, only through \n     very large transfers of tax revenues from the rest of the \n     budget to compensate for the losses the private accounts \n     would cause Social Security to incure. Under these proposals, \n     the rest of the American public would, through these \n     revenues, be required to subsidize those who elect to \n     participate in the private accounts.\n       The study by Peter A. Diamond, Institute Professor of \n     Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and \n     Peter R. Orszag, Senior Fellow in Economics at the Brookings \n     Institution, draws heavily on a technical analysis of the \n     Commission's proposals by the Office of the Chief Actuary at \n     the Social Security Administration. It is the first study to \n     examine a variety of effects implied, but not directly \n     stated, in the actuaries' analysis. The Diamond-Orszag study \n     of the two Commission proposals that are designed to restore \n     long-term Social Security solvency shows the Commission \n     proposals contain three principal components.\n       First, the plans restore long-term balance to Social \n     Security either solely (under one of the plans) or primarily \n     (under the other plan) through Social Security benefit \n     reductions. These benefit reductions would be large and would \n     affect all beneficiaries, including disabled beneficiaries \n     and those who do not elect private accounts.\n       Second, the plans would replace part of the scaled-back \n     Social Security system that would remain with a system of \n     private accounts. Those choosing the individual accounts \n     would have some of their payroll taxes diverted from Social \n     Security to the accounts; in return, their Social Security \n     benefits would be reduced further. The amount that Social \n     Security would lose because of the diversion of these payroll \n     tax revenues would, on a permanent basis, exceed the \n     additional Social Security benefit reductions to which these \n     beneficiaries would be subject. In addition, the accounts \n     would create a cash flow problem for Social Security because \n     funds would be diverted from Social Security decades before a \n     worker's Social Security benefits would be reduced in return. \n     The private accounts consequently would push the Social \n     Security Trust Fund back into insolvency and permanently \n     worsen Social Security's financial condition.\n       To avoid insolvency and restore long-term balance, the \n     plans' third component consists of the transfer of extremely \n     large sums from the rest of the budget to make up for the \n     losses that Social Security would bear because of the private \n     accounts. The transfers would equal two-thirds of the entire \n     existing Social Security deficit over the next 75 years under \n     one of the Commission plans and 80 percent of the Social \n     Security deficit under the other plan. (The second plan \n     assumes additional transfers from the rest of the budget to \n     reduce the magnitude of the Social Security benefit \n     reductions it contains.)\n       The Diamond-Orszag study raises questions about where the \n     trillion of dollars assumed to be transferred from the rest \n     of the budget to offset the costs of the private accounts \n     would come from, a matter on which the Commission is silent. \n     Noting that virtually all budget forecasts show budget \n     deficits outside Social Security for decades to come, with \n     these deficits mounting as the baby boom generation retires--\n     which means there are no surpluses outside Social Security to \n     transfer--the study calls the Commission's reliance on large \n     unspecified transfers from the rest of the budget a serious \n     weakness of these plans. Financing the transfers would \n     require large tax increases or deep cuts in other programs, \n     but the Commission did not recommend any such changes.\n       Without the assumed transfers of trillions of dollars, the \n     study shows, the Commission's numbers do not add up. ``The \n     assumed transfers in the Commission's plans effectively \n     constitute a large `magic asterisk' that serves to mask the \n     adverse financial impact of the individual accounts on Social \n     Security solvency,'' the study reports.\n\n\n                           benefit reductions\n\n       The study also examines the effects the Commission plans \n     would have on the benefits that workers receive when they \n     retire. It finds that those who do not opt for the individual \n     accounts would face deep benefit reductions.\n       Under the Commission plan (identified by the Commission as \n     ``Model 2''), workers aged 35 today who retire at age 65 in \n     2032 and do not choose the private accounts would have their \n     Social Security benefits reduced 17 percent, compared to the \n     benefits they would receive under the current benefit \n     structure. Benefits would be reduced 41 percent for those \n     born in 2001 who retire at age 65 in 2066.\n       As a result, the percentage of pre-retirement wages that \n     Social Security replaces would decline substantially. For a \n     two-earner couple with average earnings that retires at age \n     65 in any year after 2025, Social Security is scheduled to \n     replace 36 percent of former earnings. Under the \n     Commission's Model 2 plan, by contrast, Social Security \n     would replace 30 percent of former earnings for such a \n     couple that is 35 today and retires at age 65 in 2032, and \n     just 22 percent of former earnings for a future couple \n     composed of two individuals born in 2001 who retire in \n     2066. The study finds that under the Commission plans, the \n     role of Social Security in allowing the elderly to \n     maintain their standard of living in retirement would \n     decline rather sharply over time.\n\n\n        Effects on the Disabled and Children of Deceased Workers\n\n       Benefit reductions would be particularly severe for the \n     disabled and the young children of workers who die.\n       For those who begin receiving disability benefits in 2050, \n     Social Security benefits\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\n     would be reduced 33 percent under one of the Commission's \n     proposals and 19 percent under the other. (The benefit \n     reductions could be smaller under the latter plan because it \n     assumes the transfer of additional sums from the rest of the \n     budget.)\n       For those who begin receiving disability benefits in 2075, \n     the benefit reductions would be 48 percent under one plan and \n     29 percent under the other.\n       Equivalent benefit reductions would apply to the young \n     children of deceased workers.\n       These reductions would disproportionately harm African-\n     Americans. Both the proportion of workers who are disabled \n     and the proportion of young children whose parent or parents \n     have died are higher among African-Americans than among the \n     population as a whole.\n       Diamond and Orszag warn that the disabled and the children \n     of deceased workers would have little ability to mitigate \n     these severe benefit cuts with income from individual \n     accounts, because many workers who become disabled would have \n     had fewer work-years during which to contribute to private \n     accounts, and also because the Commission plans would deny \n     all workers--including the disabled--access to their accounts \n     until they reach retirement age. The economists term the \n     treatment of the disabled under the Commission plan as \n     ``draconian.''\n       The Commission recognized its proposals would have such \n     effects and stated it was not recommending these reductions \n     in disability benefits. Diamond and Orszag show, however, \n     that the Commission counted all of the savings from these \n     disability benefit cuts to make its numbers add up. Without \n     these benefits cuts, none of the Commission plans would \n     restore long-term Social Security solvency (unless even \n     larger transfers of revenue were made from the rest of the \n     budget).\n\n\n                      Impacts of Private Accounts\n\n       The benefit reductions just described would apply to all \n     beneficiaries, including both those who do not opt for \n     private accounts and those who do. Workers who choose the \n     private-account option would be subject to additional \n     reductions in Social Security benefits, on top of the \n     reductions that would apply to all beneficiaries, in return \n     for the income they would receive from their accounts.\n       For retired workers who received a return on their account \n     equal to the average expected return that the actuaries and \n     the Commission have forecast, the total reduction in benefits \n     (factoring in the income from individual accounts) would be \n     smaller. But many such workers still would face benefit \n     losses.\n       Under Model 2, a medium-earning couple that retired at age \n     65 in 2075 and received the average expected rate of return \n     from a private account would receive a combined benefit--\n     including a monthly annuity check from its account--that is \n     about 20 percent below the benefit the couple would receive \n     under the current Social Security benefit structure. Diamond \n     and Orszag observe that given the large infusion of revenue \n     from the rest of the budget under this plan, a 20 percent \n     benefit reduction is quite substantial.\n       Moreover, if the stock market does not perform as well in \n     future decades as the actuaries and the Commission have \n     assumed, private accounts investments would do less well than \n     figures suggest and the benefit reductions would be larger.\n       The study also explains that because of the risk associated \n     with investing in stocks, analysts generally agree that in \n     comparing returns from different types of investments, \n     adjustments for risk must be made. If the approach to ``risk \n     adjustment'' that the Office of Management and Budget \n     recently used in an analogous situation is applied here, the \n     combined benefits from Social Security and individual \n     accounts for the medium-earning couple retiring in 2075 are \n     estimated to be 40 percent lower than the Social Security \n     benefits the couple would receive under the current benefit \n     structure.\n       The study warns that the large, unspecified revenues the \n     Commission counts on from the rest of the budget might not \n     materialize. If they did not fully materialize and payroll \n     taxes were not raised, the benefit reductions would have to \n     be still larger under these plans. Failure to identify a \n     source for these revenues leaves Social Security subject to a \n     substantial risk that the funding would not materialize.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak today on the status \nof our nuclear industry in this country and the realization that it is \ntime that the U.S. Senate resolve the question of what to do with the \nhigh-level waste that is generated by our nuclear reactors generating \npower throughout this Nation.\n  What would you think of the Federal Government's response to entering \ninto a contract to take the high-level nuclear waste in 1998, and, 1998 \nhaving come and gone, the ratepayers who receive nuclear power into \ntheir homes have paid somewhere in the area of $11 billion to the \nFederal Government to take that waste in 1998?\n  As we all know, 1998 has come and gone. The sanctity of the \ncontractual relationship between the Government and the nuclear \nindustry, obviously, has been ignored by our Government. As a \nconsequence, there is potential litigation--litigation that has arisen \nas a consequence of the nonfulfilling of the contractual arrangement \nthat was entered into to take the waste. So, clearly, we have a \nresponsibility that is long overdue.\n  Some people, relatively speaking, are inclined to ignore the \ncontribution of the nuclear industry in our Nation. It provides our \ncountry with about 21 percent of the total power generation. It is \nclean energy. There are no emissions. The problems, of course, are what \nto do with the high-level waste.\n  Other nations have proceeded with technology. The French reprocess. \nThey recover the plutonium from the almost-spent nuclear rods. They \nreinject plutonium into a mixture that is added into the reactors and, \nbasically, burn as part of the process of generating energy.\n  The Japanese have proceeded with a similar technology. The rods, \nafter they are taken out of the reactors, are basically clipped in the \nprocess of the centrifugal development, while the plutonium is \nrecovered. It is mixed with enriched uranium, and it is put back in the \nreactors. The waste that does occur is basically stored in a glass form \ncalled vitrification.\n  We have chosen not to proceed with that type of technology, and I \nbelieve ultimately we will change our policy and, indeed, recover the \nhigh-level waste that is associated with the rods.\n  In any event, we are faced with the reality that we are derelict in \nresponding to the contractual commitments into which we entered. We \nhave before us a situation where this body is going to have to come to \ngrips with the disposition of what to do with that waste.\n  The House has already acted. On June 6 of this year, the Senate \nEnergy Committee, by a vote of 14 to 10, favorably reported S.J. Res. \n34, which is the Yucca Mountain siting resolution. The resolution \napproves our President's recommendation to Congress that the Nation's \npermanent deep geological storage site for spent nuclear fuel and other \nradioactive waste be located at the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada.\n  What the resolution does not do is build a repository. It merely \nselects the site, and approval of the resolution would start the \nDepartment of Energy on the licensing process.\n  This is a long-awaited step forward in the process to develop this \nNation's long-term geologic repository for high-level radioactive \nwaste. In making the decision, President Bush relied on the \nrecommendation of Secretary of Energy Abraham and on two decades of \nscience that has found, in the words of one Department of Energy \nassessment, ``no showstoppers.'' This is not something that has just \ncome up. We have been at it for 20 years.\n  The vote last month in the House was 306 to 117. As I indicated, the \nHouse has done its job. It affirmed the exceptional science, \nengineering, and public policy work that has gone into this very \nimportant national project. It reached a conclusion, exactly as I \nindicated earlier. Now it is the Senate's turn to vote on the \nresolution.\n  The 20 years of work, the over $4 billion that has been invested in \ndetermining whether this site is scientifically and technically \nsuitable for the development of a repository is a reality to which the \ntaxpayers have already been subjected; $4 billion has been expended at \nYucca Mountain. I personally visited the site, and I can tell you that \nfor all practical purposes, the site is ready.\n  For those who suggest we put this off, let me again remind my \ncolleagues, we have not made this decision in haste. It has been 20 \nyears in the process. In fact, the most recent independent review done \nby the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board in January of this year \nfound, one, ``No individual, technical, or scientific factor has been \nidentified that would automatically eliminate Yucca Mountain from \nconsideration as a site of a permanent repository.''\n\n  I am confident in the work done to date by the Department of Energy, \nbut this work will not cease with this recommendation. On the contrary, \nscientific investigation and analysis will\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\ncontinue for the life of the repository, and I believe that sound \nscience and sound policy guide this decision. For over 20 years, we \nhave relied on science to guide us, and now that science says this site \nis suitable.\n  I am often reminded how these things are resolved, and while it is \nappropriate to have public input, this is an area of technology in \nwhich we really need sound science and not emotional discussions or \narguments. We have created this waste. We have to address it. Nobody \nwants it. Somebody has to have it. The Yucca Mountain site has been \ndetermined as the best site, and the science supports it.\n  In fact, the review board addressed the very issue of science vis-a-\nvis policy and concluded that the ultimate decision on Yucca Mountain \nis one of policy and informed science. Policy decisions lie with our \nelected officials. That is why we are here, Madam President. We base \nthem on sound science and facts, of course, but ultimately, we have to \nmake the tough calls. We cannot vote maybe; we can only vote yes or no.\n  The Secretary has acted. The President has acted. The House of \nRepresentatives has acted. Now the Senate must act. Nevada exercised \nits opportunity to object to actions taken by the Federal Government. \nThat is their right as granted by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  It should be pointed out that the veto authority given to the State \nof Nevada is rather unusual. A Governor of a State was able to veto a \ndecision of a sitting President--indeed extraordinary--but now it is \ntime for the Senate to act, and it is our obligation, indeed our duty, \nbecause some decisions, tough as they are, need to be made with the \ngood of the entire Nation in mind.\n  I should also point out that when the act was considered in 1982, the \nquestion of a State veto was somewhat controversial. The subsequent \nvotes of both the House and Senate outlined very specifically the \nnecessary balance to this State veto. If Congress is not permitted to \nact, as some have threatened in the Senate, then that carefully crafted \nbalance will be lost. I wish the State of Alaska had been given an \nopportunity for a veto on the issue of ANWR. Nevertheless, that is a \ndifferent issue for a different time.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act anticipated that this would be a tough \ndecision and laid out some very strict, fast-track procedure to ensure \nthat the decision would be put to a vote so that the will of the \nmajority would be heard. This is one of those rare cases when Congress \nmade the decision to not allow procedural games to obscure the \nsubstance of a very important decision. We will have to vote sometime \nbefore July 27 of this year, governed by certain rules on S.J. Res. 34, \nand a decision will be made, Madam President. That is the procedure \nthat Congress decided back in 1982. We must make this decision, and we \nwill make it soon.\n  The Federal Government has a contractual obligation to take the \nNation's spent fuel. That obligation, as I indicated in my earlier \nremarks, was due in 1998. That was a contractual commitment. The \nFederal Government is in violation of that contractual commitment. So \nfar, no waste has been removed despite the fact that the nuclear waste \nfund now has in excess of $17 billion for the specific purpose of \ntaking the waste.\n  If the spent fuel is not taken soon, at least one reactor, the \nPrairie Island reactor in Minnesota, will have to shut down, and we \ncannot afford to sacrifice nuclear power, not in Minnesota nor, for \nthat matter, anywhere. Madam President, 21 percent of all power \ngeneration comes from nuclear energy.\n\n  Other States have spent fuel piling up: 1,860 metric tons in \nCalifornia, 1,542 metric tons in Connecticut, and a whopping 5,850 \nmetric tons in Illinois. We have waste at other sites, including \nHanford in the State of Washington.\n  Nuclear, as I indicated, is 21 percent of the Nation's clean, \nnonemitting electrical energy. Nuclear is safe, solid, baseload \ngeneration that helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  The Federal Government's obligation does not just extend to \nutilities. We also have a responsibility to continue to clean up our \ncold war legacy. These are Department of Energy weapon sites, several \nthroughout the United States, that must be cleaned up. To accomplish \ncleanup, waste must be removed in sites such as Rocky Flats in \nColorado, Hanford in Washington, Savannah River in South Carolina.\n  For a variety of reasons, all based on sound science, we must proceed \nto affirm the President's site designation of Yucca Mountain as one of \nour Nation's safe, central, remote nuclear waste repositories. To \nborrow from Secretary Abraham's February 14 letter to President Bush:\n  A repository is important to our national security. A repository is \nimportant to our nonproliferation objectives. A repository is important \nto our energy security. A repository is important to our homeland \nsecurity. A repository is important to our efforts to protect our \nenvironment.\n  We have a responsibility, Madam President, to site a repository. It \nis an overarching national responsibility. It is one we cannot shirk. \nThe alternative would be to leave this waste at 131 sites in over 40 \nStates--sites which were not designated to be permanent repositories.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He has been a mainstay \nin the Cardinals broadcasting booth for nearly 50 years.\n  He called games featuring Cardinal greats such as Stan Musial, Bob \nGibson, Lou Brock, Ozzie Smith, and Mark McGwire. He was well known for \nwrapping up Cardinal victories with his trademark, ``that's a winner.''\n  Mr. Buck was a decorated war veteran, father of eight, and one of the \nmost accomplished sports broadcasters of all time. He has been inducted \ninto 11 halls of fame, including shrines for baseball, football, and \nradio.\n  Jack Buck was accomplished out of the broadcasting booth as well. In \nfact, he was selected as St. Louis' Citizen of the Year in 2000 for his \ncontributions to the community.\n  He was dedicated to finding a cure for cystic fibrosis and raised \nwell over $30 million toward that goal. ``Finding a cure would be the \ngreatest thing to happen in my lifetime,'' he once said.\n  Jack Buck was also a poet who enjoyed a well-turned phrase. When \nbaseball resumed last year after the September 11 attacks, Buck, a tear \nin his eye, read a patriotic poem during a pregame ceremony at Busch \nStadium. ``As our fathers did before, we shall win this unwanted war,'' \nhe said. ``And our children will enjoy the future we'll be giving.''\n  Buck often told a story about the day his wife, Carole, asked what he \nwould say to the Lord when they meet at the gates of heaven. He \nresponded: ``I want to ask him why he's been so good to me.''\n  Today we join with all who knew and loved Jack Buck to say, ``Now \nthat's a winner.''\n  I yield the floor.

The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3899\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, momentarily, I will be offering an \namendment on behalf of the majority of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee which addresses the Crusader artillery system program and the \nArmy's fire support requirements.\n  The amendment would do two things: First, it would take $475.6 \nmillion out of the Crusader program and put the money into a separate \nfunding line for Future Combat Systems research and development, the \nArmy's armored systems modernization line.\n  In terms of making sure this issue is very clear, it is essential to \nunderstand that the first action this amendment would take would be to \nmove that $475 million from the Crusader program but keeping it in the \nArmy's Future Combat Systems research and development program; that is, \nthe Army's armored systems modernization line.\n  It would do a second thing which was very important to the majority \nof the Armed Services Committee; that is, that it would require the \nChief of Staff of the Army to conduct an analysis of alternatives for \nthe Army's artillery needs and to submit his findings to the Secretary \nof Defense no later than 1 month after the date of enactment of this \nbill.\n  Under this amendment, the Department would not be permitted to spend \nthe $475 million until after the Secretary of Defense adds his own \nconclusions and recommendations to the Army Chief of Staff's report and \nforwards the report to the Congress. With his own decision, the \nSecretary of Defense would, under our amendment, be required to submit \nthe recommendations of the Chief of Staff of the Army.\n  They may be two different recommendations, as they were during the \nhearing that we had, where we had the Secretary of Defense saying the \nCrusader should be terminated immediately, and the Chief of Staff of \nthe Army giving us the reasons he believed the Crusader system made \nsense in terms of modernization, made sense in terms of transformation. \nIt was a very important hearing for all of us, including the Presiding \nOfficer, who was present at that hearing.\n  At that point, after that period had run--1 month after the date of \nenactment--the Secretary would be free to do a number of things: spend \nthe money for future combat systems in that account or request a \nreprogramming to spend the money on other programs which address the \nArmy's indirect fire requirements.\n  So under our approach, we would accomplish two things, basically: \nOne, we would make sure this money is spent for future combat systems \nessential to the Army; secondly, we would provide that the Army \ncomplete the analysis, which was truncated, which was interrupted when \nthe Secretary of Defense, in early May, said it was his decision to \nterminate the system before that analysis could be completed.\n\n  This was an analysis which was going to look at a number of very \ncritical issues. The Army was looking at seven questions, questions \nwhich were critical to the survival of soldiers in our future. These \nare questions which could be life-and-death questions down the road. \nThese are survival questions. These are questions which affect the men \nand women in the Armed Forces at some point down the road.\n  How these questions are answered could literally make the difference \nbetween whether or not we prevail during a battle and what casualties \nare incurred during a battle at some time in the future.\n  These were not just questions of affordability at which the Army was \nlooking, these were questions of capability, of various alternatives. \nFour indirect fire alternatives were being analyzed by the Army. They \nwere analyzing these alternatives in six different combat scenarios. \nAnd they were going to answer seven questions. Again, the answers to \nthose questions are critically important to success in combat or to \nsurvive in combat.\n  The majority of the committee objected to the termination of that \nanalysis. Many people had concluded that Crusader ought to be canceled. \nOther people had concluded that Crusader should not be canceled. But I \nthink where many of us--perhaps most of us--in the Armed Services \nCommittee finally rested, wherever you tend to go or be on that \ncontinuum, for or against, that there is a middle ground here, where \nthat analysis, which was underway by the Army, not only would help us \ndetermine whether we should leave Crusader, terminate Crusader, but \nwould also help us determine where those funds should be spent as an \nalternative to Crusader.\n  So this study became significant and relevant to both whether we \nleave our current path and to what new direction should we move. That \nis why the amendment, which I offered in committee, required that the \nSecretary of the Army be given a reasonable period of time to complete \nthat analysis so that we would have the benefit of the Army's analysis.\n  The Secretary of Defense would not be bound by it. The Secretary of \nDefense, after that analysis was completed, would have an opportunity \nto reach his own conclusions. They may or may not be the same. They may \nor may not be, as he has already decided, that we should leave Crusader \nand move to something else. But at least it would be based on an \nanalysis which addressed such critically important questions as the \nArmy was in the process of addressing--looking at all the alternatives, \nlooking at the risks, looking at the benefits of approaching each one \nof those or utilizing each one of those alternatives.\n  The committee approved this amendment by a vote of 13 to 6. And that \nis where it currently stands.\n  The amendment which we adopted is not part of this bill. It is, in \neffect, going to be offered in a few moments as a proposed committee \namendment. More technically stated, it is an amendment which I will be \noffering on behalf of the committee because, since this is a new bill \nwhich was filed, a committee amendment technically would not be in \norder. So it amounts to the same thing. But for those on the Armed \nServices Committee, they should be aware of the fact that this will be \nan amendment which I will be offering on behalf of the committee \npursuant to the majority vote of that committee.\n  In conclusion, the amendment would simply require the Department of \nDefense to undertake a reasoned analysis of all the alternatives, an \nanalysis which the Army was in the middle of making, before making a \nfinal decision whether to terminate the Crusader program and, if the \nprogram is terminated, how the money should best be spent to support \nthe Army's indirect fire needs. The objective is not to preserve a \nparticular program or to advance a particular approach. It is simply \nintended to ensure a reasoned analysis of a potentially life-and-death \nissue. I hope we will adopt this approach.\n  I understand my dear friend and colleague from Virginia, our ranking \nmember on the Armed Services Committee, may be offering a second-degree \namendment.\n  Madam President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration. I am authorized by the committee to send that \namendment to the desk.\n  I wish to make clear there is one very technical change in the \namendment. I have stricken the words that are confusing, ``organic-to-\nunit.'' Those words have been stricken from the amendment adopted by \nthe committee. I have touched base with at least one key Senator on the \ncommittee who is very supportive of proceeding with Crusader. I have \ntouched base with my ranking member on this issue. There is no \nobjection to those words being stricken in a number of places to \nprovide greater clarity.\n  I ask that the amendment be immediately considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3899.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reallocate an amount available to the Army for indirect \n                             fire programs)\n\n       On page 26, after line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 214. REALLOCATION OF AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR INDIRECT FIRE \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Reduction of Amount for Crusader.--Of the amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 201(1) for the Army \n     for research, development, test, and evaluation, the amount \n     available for continued research and development of the \n     Crusader artillery system is hereby reduced by $475,600,000.\n       (b) Increase of Amount for Future Combat Systems.--Of the \n     amount authorized to be appropriated by section 201(1) for \n     the Army for research, development, test, and evaluation, the \n     amount available for research and development for the \n     Objective Force is hereby increased by $475,600,000. The \n     amount of the increase shall be available only for meeting \n     the needs of the Army for indirect fire capabilities, and may \n     not be used under the authority of this section until the \n     report required by subsection (d) is submitted to Congress in \n     accordance with such subsection.\n       (c) Reprogramming of Amount for Indirect Fire Programs.--\n     Upon the submission to Congress of the report required by \n     subsection (d), the Secretary of Defense may seek to \n     reprogram the amount available under subsection (b), in \n     accordance with established procedures, only for the \n     following purposes:\n       (1) Payment of costs associated with a termination, if any, \n     of the Crusader artillery system program.\n       (2) Continued research and development of the Crusader \n     artillery system.\n       (3) Other Army programs identified by the Secretary \n     pursuant to subsection (d) as the best available alternative \n     to the Crusader artillery system for providing improved \n     indirect fire for the Army.\n       (d) Reporting Requirement.--(1) Not later than 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Chief of \n     Staff of the Army shall complete a review of the full range \n     of Army programs that could provide improved indirect fire \n     for the Army over the next 20 years and shall submit to the \n     Secretary of Defense a report containing the recommendation \n     of the Chief of Staff on which alternative for improving \n     indirect fire for the Army is the best alternative for that \n     purpose. The report shall also include information on each of \n     the following funding matters:\n       (A) The manner in which the amount available under \n     subsection (b) should be best invested to support the \n     improvement of indirect fire capabilities for the Army.\n       (B) The manner in which the amount provided for indirect \n     fire programs of the Army in the future-years defense program \n     submitted to Congress with respect to the budget for fiscal \n     year 2003 under section 221 of title 10, United States Code, \n     should be best invested to support improved indirect fire for \n     the Army.\n       (C) The manner in which the amounts described in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) should be best invested to support \n     the improvement of indirect fire capabilities for the Army in \n     the event of a termination of the Crusader artillery system \n     program.\n       (D) The portion of the amount available under subsection \n     (b) that should be reserved for paying costs associated with \n     a termination of the Crusader artillery system program in the \n     event of such a termination.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense shall submit the report, \n     together with any comments and recommendations that the \n     Secretary considers appropriate, to the congressional defense \n     committees.\n       (e) Annual Updates.--(1) The Secretary shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees, at the same time that the \n     President submits the budget for a fiscal year referred to in \n     paragraph (4) to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, \n     United States Code, a report on the investments proposed to \n     be made in indirect fire programs for the Army.\n       (2) If the Crusader artillery system program has been \n     terminated by the time the annual report is submitted in \n     conjunction with the budget for a fiscal year, the report \n     shall--\n       (A) identify the amount proposed for expenditure for the \n     Crusader artillery system program for that fiscal year in the \n     future-years defense program that was submitted to Congress \n     in 2002 under section 221 of title 10, United States Code; \n     and\n       (B) specify--\n       (i) the manner in which the amount provided in that budget \n     would be expended for improved indirect fire capabilities for \n     the Army; and\n       (ii) the extent to which the expenditures in that manner \n     would improve indirect fire capabilities for the Army.\n       (3) The requirement to submit an annual report under \n     paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to budgets for fiscal \n     years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3900 To Amendment No. 3899\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this is an amendment that was considered \nby our committee. The chairman has stated very accurately the facts. \nThe vote was 13 to 6. I happen to have been in the six. I would like to \nexplain the background.\n  The President sent to the Congress a document entitled ``Department \nof Defense Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Amendment, Crusader Termination, May \n2002.''\n  The operative message is on page 4. It says as follows: Department of \nDefense Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Amendment for Crusader Termination, \nResearch, Development, Test and Evaluation, Army. Justification: The \nDepartment of Defense has decided to terminate the Crusader Artillery \nSystem Program. This action will support development of objective force \nindirect fires and network fires. Crusader funding can be used to \naccelerate the development and fielding of indirect fire platforms such \nas the high mobility artillery rocket system and precision munitions \nsuch as Excalibur Projectile Precision Guided Mortar Munitions and \nGuided Multiple Launch Rocket System (unitary). Certain selected \ntechnologies developed within the Crusader program will have \napplication to future artillery programs. These changes should boost \nlong-term capabilities.\n  When this arrived in the Congress, it provoked, understandably, \nconsiderable concern. The Senator from Oklahoma, I am sure, will \nshortly address those concerns. He has been fully involved throughout \nthis. I commend him for bringing to the attention of the chairman and \nmyself the need to address this very carefully within the committee as \na separate item. That was done, as I stated and as the chairman stated. \nThe committee action represents such consensus as a vote of 13 to 6 \nrepresents.\n  In my capacity as ranking member of the committee, I have an \nobligation to work with the Secretary of Defense and to determine the \nextent to which we can arrive at the budget amendment request sent by \nthe President. I have done that in such a manner as to develop an \namendment, which I will shortly send to the desk, in the second degree \nto the amendment offered by the chairman. This amendment was drawn \nafter careful consultation with the Secretary and other members of the \nDepartment of Defense through several sessions yesterday. I think it is \na very fair compromise and hopefully will be adopted by the Senate.\n\n  I represent that the amendment I have devised reaches the same basic \ngoals as enunciated in this justification forwarded to the Congress by \nthe President. At the same time, my amendment recognizes the important \ncontributions by the chairman and others in drafting the committee \namendment. I, too, join the chairman in expressing concern about what I \ncall ``due process'' accorded the Department of the Army in the course \nof reevaluating this Crusader system at the direction of the Secretary \nof Defense, which to some degree was done prior to the forwarding to \nthe Congress of this budget amendment.\n  The chairman--and, indeed, I and others--believed the Army should be \ngiven the opportunity to fully explore, as the chairman stated, the \nreasons for either continuing Crusader or pursuing other avenues \nleading to the goals enunciated in the budget amendment.\n  Therefore, my amendment carefully preserves--at least I have \nendeavored to do that--the portions of the chairman's amendment which \nenable the Army to perform those important analyses, forwards them to \nthe Secretary of Defense, and then the Secretary is to take certain \nactions.\n  The basic difference between the chairman's amendment and my \namendment is that my amendment eliminates the reprogramming, a series \nof four reprogrammings which are required when a matter of this \nimportance is brought to the Congress. It is my judgment--and I think \nthe Secretary of Defense--that we should as quickly as possible, to \nsave dollars and in every other way, remove the delays incorporated in \nmoving to a new system for the U.S. Army with regard to its very \nimportant indirect and network fires.\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\n  The four reprogramming actions have the possibility of delays built \nin, plus the fact that, for whatever reason, one of those four \ncommittees could block the action. I believe with the consideration \nbeing given in the Senate today, the consideration that will be given \nin a conference between the House and the Senate, assuming the \namendments are adopted, that we will have given proper congressional \noversight of the decision by the President and the Secretary of Defense \nto stop the Crusader program terminating and proceed with moving in \naccordance with the justification I have outlined. So for that purpose \nI now send to the desk an amendment in the second degree and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3900 to amendment No. 3899.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To substitute a notice-and-wait condition for the exercise of \n                        authority to use funds)\n\n       Beginning on page 2, strike line 7 and all that follows \n     through line 5 on page 3, and insert the following:\n\n     ``development for the Objective Force indirect fire systems \n     is hereby increased by $475,600,000. The amount of the \n     increase shall be available only for meeting the needs of the \n     Army for indirect fire capabilities, and may not be used \n     under the authority of this section until 30 days after the \n     date on which the Secretary of Defense submits to the \n     congressional defense committees the report required by \n     subsection (d), together with a notification of the \n     Secretary's plan to use such funds to meet the needs of the \n     Army for indirect fire capabilities.\n       ``(c) Use of Funds.--Subject to subsection (b), the \n     Secretary of Defense may use the amount available under such \n     subsection for any program for meeting the needs of the Army \n     for indirect fire capabilities.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The administration is on record as opposing any action to \nstop the Defense authorization process which would block the \nPresident's determination to terminate the Crusader program. For that \nreason, I have developed this alternative, which has the support of the \nadministration.\n  The discussions I have had over the past several days with the \nSecretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary, the Secretary of the Army, and \nothers, have lead to this compromise, which would, with minor \nmodification, make the Levin amendment acceptable to the \nadministration. So the Levin amendment survives if modified by the \nWarner second degree in a document that is acceptable to the \nadministration.\n  The second-degree amendment does not alter the intent of the original \namendment by Senator Levin. The chairman, quite properly, has concerns \nwith the process, as do I, which was followed to terminate the Crusader \nprogram. The chairman believes the Army has not been given ``due \nprocess.'' I concur in that. My amendment would not alter the part of \nthe Levin amendment which addresses this issue.\n  Under the provisions of my amendment, the underlying Levin amendment \nwould still do the following:\n  Transfer the $475 million for the Crusader field artillery system to \na budget line for the Future Combat Systems to be used only for the \npurpose of developing indirect fire capabilities for the U.S. Army; \nprovide the Army time to conduct an analysis of alternatives to address \nits requirement for indirect fire capabilities; require the Chief of \nStaff of the Army to submit recommendations to the Secretary of Defense \non several issues, including the best way to allocate funding for \nfiscal year 2003 and beyond, to address Army indirect fire support \nrequirements; require the Secretary of Defense to forward the Army \nChief of Staff's report to the Congress, and to make recommendations \nregarding the best way to meet the Army's requirement for indirect fire \nsupport.\n  I want to make it clear, the Secretary of Defense has the final \nauthority.\n  My amendment differs from the Levin amendment in one key way. The \nLevin amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to seek reprogramming \napproval to transfer funding from the Future Combat System budget line \nto those lines which would support the Army's indirect fire \nrequirement, as a result of the review conducted under the Levin \namendment.\n  The Warner amendment would replace that formal reprogramming process \nwith a simpler ``notice and wait'' procedure.\n  Under my amendment, the Secretary of Defense would notify the \nCongress of his intention to transfer funds to support the Army's \nindirect fire requirements. The transfer would be effective 30 days \nafter notification.\n  This approach will allow the Congress to retain oversight over this \nimportant issue but remove the ``one member'' or one committee veto, \nwhich is sometimes the result of the reprogramming process.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the reason this amendment--with or \nwithout the second degree--is so critical is that the decisionmaking \nprocess that has been used here has been so defective and denies the \nArmy, the public, and the Congress critically important information \nrelative to the need for future artillery systems. That information \nshould have been available prior to the decision of the Department of \nDefense. Instead, there has been a zigzag decisionmaking process. That \nzigzag decisionmaking process should not have been followed because it \nleaves us without answers to the critically important questions about \nrelative risks under various scenarios, under various kinds of \ncombinations of artillery systems.\n  I want to go through just a bit of that to give a flavor as to why it \nis so important that this analysis of the Army be reasonably completed \nand not be truncated or terminated a few days after it was supposed to \nbegin in May.\n  This field artillery system, called Crusader, which is an advanced \nfield artillery system, has been under development since 1994 to be the \nArmy's next-generation self-propelled howitzer and artillery resupply \nvehicle.\n  There has been criticism of the Crusader program outside of the \nDepartment of Defense, and that is to be welcomed. It is always to be \nconsidered when we get that kind of criticism of a system. Congress \nshould consider that criticism, and we have. But until very recently, \nthe civilian and military leadership of the Defense Department \nconsistently and strongly supported the Crusader program in testimony \nbefore the Congress.\n  The fiscal year 2003 budget that was submitted by the President for \nthe Department of Defense was submitted on February 4 of this year. \nThat budget and the authorization bill that is before us included $475 \nmillion in continued research and development funding for the Crusader \nprogram.\n  On February 28, General Shinseki, Chief of Staff of the Army, \ntestified before the Congress that:\n\n       Crusader's agility to keep up with our ground maneuver \n     forces--its longer range, its high rate of fire, its \n     precision . . . and the addition of Excalibur--would bring \n     the potential of a precision weapon . . . with the platform \n     and the munition being brought together, [and] would be a \n     significant increase to the potential shortage of fires that \n     we have today. Excalibur itself will not solve the problem. \n     And Crusader is very much a part of our requirement.\n\n  ``The bottom line''--quoting General Shinseki's testimony to our \ncommittee on March 7--``is we need it.'' That is referring to the \nCrusader.\n  Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz recently testified in \nresponse to a question of whether we need Crusader as follows:\n\n       I think we need some of it, a lot fewer than the Army had \n     planned on. We have cut the program by almost two-thirds. And \n     they have done a lot to cut the size and the weight of the \n     system.\n\n  Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz said the following:\n\n       But I am not one of those people who think that I can bet \n     the farm on not needing artillery ten years from now.\n\n  He summarized:\n\n       And I think this [Crusader] is the best artillery system \n     available.\n\n  That was just a few days before they reversed field. Something \nchanged dramatically in the attitude of the senior civilian leadership \nof the Defense Department toward the Crusader program in just a matter \nof a few weeks.\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\n  The first change of course actually came in late April. The media \nreported--and I was told personally--that the Office of the Secretary \nof Defense would be reviewing the Crusader and other weapons systems \nduring the program review process leading up to the fiscal year 2004 \nbudget, and that a decision on the program would be made around \nSeptember 1. This was documented in the recent Army IG Report on The \nRelease of Crusader Talking Points to Members of Congress, which noted \nthat prior to April 30, the Defense Guidance indicated that a Crusader \nalternatives study would be completed no later than September of 2002.\n  Then came the second change of course. On May 2, Secretary Rumsfeld \ntold the press that Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz and Under Secretary \nAldridge had ``advised the Secretary of the Army that they wanted a \nstudy within 30 days that would look at a specific alternative that \nwould assume Crusader was canceled.''\n  On May 2, the Secretary of Defense told the press that within 30 days \na study would be looking at alternatives to Crusader.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld went on to say it was his impression that ``when \nthe study comes back, a final decision would be made.'' In other words, \nno final decision until the 30-day study period was completed.\n  The same day, May 2, Under Secretary Aldridge also told the press:\n\n       We'll brief the deputy secretary in 30 days, and then we'll \n     make a decision is this the right plan or may not be the \n     right plan. We're allowing the Army to tell us if that is in \n     fact the case, being as objective as possible . . . so we \n     have a basis for an analytical judgment based on rational and \n     objective criteria.\n\n  That is Under Secretary Aldridge on May 2. Thirty days, so we have \nrational and objective criteria.\n  Less than a week later comes change of course No. 3. On May 8, before \nthe 30-day study is completed, Secretary Rumsfeld announces:\n\n       After a good deal of consideration, I have decided to \n     cancel the Crusader program. We still do not have any study \n     based on rational and objective criteria to support that \n     decision, and that zigzag decisionmaking process did not end \n     with the decision to terminate the program.\n\n  On May 16, the Armed Services Committee held a hearing on the \nproposed termination. At that hearing, the Secretary of Defense \ntestified that the Crusader money be spent ``to accelerate a variety of \nprecision munitions, including GPS-guided rounds for all U.S. 155-\nmillimeter cannons, as well as adding GPS guidance and accuracy to \nupgraded multiple-launch rocket system vehicles and the more mobile \nwheeled version of this system, the high mobility artillery rocket \nsystem, or HIMARS.''\n  The Secretary also testified that the Department would maintain key \npieces of Crusader technology for use in the Army's Future Combat \nSystem.\n  At the same hearing, the Chief of Staff of the Army testified he \ncould not comment on the Secretary's proposed alternatives to the \nCrusader program because he had not had the opportunity to analyze \nthose alternatives or to review any analysis that may have been \nconducted by the Secretary's office.\n  Nonetheless, the Department of Defense formalized these alternatives \nin a budget amendment that was submitted to the Congress on May 29. \nThat budget amendment provided $195 million for the artillery component \nof the Army Future Combat System; $115 million for other aspects of the \nFuture Combat System; $165 million for precision artillery and other \ninitiatives unrelated to the Future Combat System.\n  Even after the committee had its hearing, the Department of Defense \nand the Army continued to provide the committee with inconsistent \ninformation.\n  On May 22, the Army informed the committee that it would cost $385 \nmillion if termination were delayed until early next year. On June 5, 2 \nweeks later, the Department of Defense informed the committee that it \nwould cost $584 million if the termination were delayed until early \nnext year. We have a $200 million difference, about an 80-percent \nincrease in costs in just a matter of 2 weeks.\n  On May 22, the Army informed the committee that it would cost $290 \nmillion to terminate the Crusader program immediately.\n\n  On June 10, we were told the termination costs could be reduced to \nless than $100 million if the Department entered into a bridge contract \nto transfer Crusader technologies to the Future Combat System and made \na commitment to follow on FCS contracts with the Crusader contract.\n  It is possible, Madam President, that the Department's budget \namendment takes the right approach for the future of the Army. It is \npossible. But this kind of ad hoc decisionmaking, this zigzag change of \ncourse, is not the way in which we should make decisions which are \nlife-and-death decisions for the people we put in harm's way and could \nbe life-and-death decisions, indeed, for whether or not this country \nwins a battle in the years ahead.\n  It is important we take this step back and conduct the reasoned \nanalysis before deciding how to proceed. My amendment would provide for \nthat analysis to be completed.\n  The second-degree amendment of the Senator from Virginia also \nprovides the same time period, as I understand it, for this reasoned \nanalysis to take place. The difference between these amendments--and I \nhave not yet decided, because I have not had an opportunity to read the \nexact language of the amendment of the Senator from Virginia, as to \nwhat my position will be on his second-degree amendment. But as I \nunderstand the difference, it is whether or not, after the analysis is \ncompleted by the Army, after there is a recommendation by the \nDepartment of Defense, there is either a period where there would be a \nrequest for reprogramming or whether there would be a 30-day wait \nperiod without that reprogramming process.\n  That difference may sound more significant than it really is. The \nreason is that under the language of my amendment, if reprogramming is \nnot adopted, the money is nonetheless required to be spent in the \nFuture Combat System budget line. It will not be spent for Crusader \nunless there is a reverse in decision relative to Crusader, a reversal \nby the Secretary of Defense.\n  As I understand the language--and I want to study it--in the second-\ndegree amendment, the 30-day period would be provided so that if a \ndecision were made by the Secretary of Defense following the completion \nof this objective analysis, there would be 30 days available for the \nCongress to act to reverse that decision should it choose to do so.\n  In either event, under either the first-degree amendment or the \nsecond-degree amendment, if the Secretary of Defense decided after \nreceiving the Army analysis that he did not want to finish Crusader \nunder either the first-degree amendment or the second-degree amendment, \nthere would not be funding for Crusader. So there is no difference in \nthat sense. Under both amendments, if the Secretary's decision \nfollowing the analysis is not to complete Crusader, the money will not \nbe spent to complete Crusader. The difference is more subtle than that.\n  I yield the floor to give others a chance to speak. I want an \nopportunity to study the language in the second-degree amendment. I \nthank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our distinguished chairman. He \nvery accurately cited that my amendment embraces the corrections of the \nstudy requirement and the actions by the Chief of Staff of the Army is \nidentical to his.\n  I share the concerns of the Senator from Michigan. He recited in \naccurate detail a process which he characterized as zigzag.\n  Again, my amendment in no way dislodges the goal by the chairman to \nhave that work done by the Army. Then it goes to the Secretary of \nDefense. Where we differ is in what takes place after the Secretary of \nDefense has made his decision.\n  I listened carefully, and the Senator said if we go the reprogramming \nroute, if I may pose a question, then the money will be spent, but my \nunderstanding is if one of those committees fails to act, that money \nessentially is parked for an indefinite period of time; am I not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would be in the Future Combat System line which most of \nthat money would be spent even under the proposal of the Secretary of \nDefense, his budget amendment, for the Future Combat System.\n  Under both approaches, if the decision of the Secretary of Defense, \nfollowing the completion of the Army\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\nanalysis, is not to proceed with Crusader, the money will not be spent \nfor Crusader.\n  There is no difference between our approaches, as I understand it. \nThe difference would be that under our amendment, he would seek \nreprogramming. If any of the four committees did not grant them \nreprogramming, then the money would not be spent on Crusader. It would \nhave to be spent within the Future Combat System.\n  Mr. WARNER. At what point in time would that expenditure take place?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Immediately.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will come back and define that later, but I think it is \nimportant other colleagues address that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I have enjoyed listening to the debate \nso far, and I rise very briefly today in support of the chairman's \nunderlying amendment to terminate funding for the Army's beleaguered \nCrusader mobile artillery system. I support the decision of the \nSecretary of Defense to cancel this program. Last month, I actually \nintroduced legislation that would terminate the Crusader, saving the \ntaxpayers an estimated $10 billion over the life of the program.\n  I commend the Secretary of Defense for his efforts to transform our \nmilitary to meet the challenges of the 21st century and beyond, and \nagree that the cold war era dinosaurs such as the Crusader should be \nterminated.\n  The centerpiece of the Crusader system is a 40-ton, 155-millimeter, \nself-propelled howitzer designed to fire heavy artillery shells long \ndistances to target enemy tanks and other armored vehicles on the \nbattlefield.\n  Each system has two support vehicles. Our military is seeking to be \nable to deploy rapidly, obviously, to anywhere in the world, but the \nCrusader apparently is not conducive to such rapid deployment. \nAccording to a recent New York Times editorial:\n\n       If the Army was still facing the Soviet Union across \n     Central Europe or contemplating battle against a similar \n     military power in the coming decade, the Crusader would be \n     indispensable. But the threat has changed and the Crusader \n     program, with a price tag of $11 billion, is not needed and \n     should be cancelled.\n\n  An editorial in our leading newspaper in Wisconsin, the Milwaukee \nJournal Sentinel, calls the Crusader a gold-plated weapons system and \nargues the Crusader is too expensive for a time when even a war-engaged \nPentagon must make serious choices about how to spend its money.\n  I agree that it is past time the Pentagon reorient its thinking and \nits spending requests toward the threats of the 21st century and away \nfrom the cold war. Cancelling the Crusader is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  The chairman's amendment would transfer the $475.6 million allocated \nfor the Crusader program into a Future Combat Systems line item within \nthe Army's research, development, testing, and evaluation account.\n  In addition, the Army Chief of Staff would be required to prepare a \nreport on alternatives to the Crusader program and submit it to the \nSecretary within 30 days of the enactment of this bill. This report \nwould include an analysis of the Army's future artillery needs.\n  I urge the members of the Armed Services Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee to exercise strict oversight of any \nreprogramming request that may be submitted as a result of the Army's \nreport. I agree with the chairman of the committee that we should be \ncareful about how the $475.6 million that is shifted into the Future \nCombat Systems account is allocated. The Future Combat Systems account \nshould not be treated as a blank check. It should not be used as a way \nto revive part or all of the Crusader program. We should scrutinize \ncarefully how these funds will be spent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Levin's underlying amendment, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is interesting to follow Senator \nFeingold because both of us have raised plenty of questions about what \nwe consider to be waste in the Pentagon budget, and I will be \nrelatively brief. I strongly support Chairman Levin's amendment because \nI think it corrects serious flaws in the process by which the \nDepartment of Defense summarily decided to terminate the Crusader \nwithout any prior consultation with the Army or the Congress. That is \nwhat bothers me the most.\n  I have long been a critic of wasteful and unnecessary defense \nspending, particularly when it diverts needed resources from pressing \noperational and readiness needs of our Armed Forces. I also strongly \nbelieve in fair, transparent, and informed Government decision-making, \nwhich did not occur in the decision to cancel the Crusader.\n  For me, this is as clear a kind of question as we can have before us. \nThe Army has stated for over a decade that there is need for an \nindirect, long-range, rapid-fire system to support ground troops, the \nvery purpose for which the Crusader was developed. Far from being a \ncold war system, the Crusader's development began in 1995, after the \ncold war ended and Iraq was defeated. The program is on schedule, on \nbudget, and the system's weight has been cut substantially. As a \nresult, the Bush administration's original fiscal year 2003 budget \nrequest was for full funding for the Crusader.\n  Three Defense Secretaries, three Army Secretaries, three Army Chiefs \nof Staff, and numerous officers of the field have given testimony in \nsupport of the system. In the last few months, a parade of \nadministration officials have testified, including Deputy Defense \nSecretary Wolfowitz, to congressional defense committees supporting the \nCrusader. Yet 2 months after the testimony by top Army brass, the \nSecretary of Defense abruptly cancelled the program.\n  The Secretary's abrupt decision to terminate the Crusader was made in \nsecret and without consultation with even high-level Army officials. It \nclearly did not follow the normal review within the Pentagon and looks, \nby its speed, designed to avoid normal scrutiny by Congress. We cannot \ngive up that oversight.\n  The decision was made without consultation with the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, without consultation with the Army, and without consultation \nwith Members of Congress. An argument can be made one way or another \nultimately about this weapons system, but for any weapons system I \nwould like to see a careful review process. I think that is critically \nimportant.\n  The decision to halt the program and the President's subsequent \nrequest to reallocate funds--not to just reduce funds but to reallocate \nfunds--was an extraordinary flip-flop in the administration's position.\n  I will not apologize for being concerned about potential job losses \nin Minnesota should the program be cut. I recently met with workers and \nofficials at the United Defense Industries plant in Minnesota. The \npoint is: Maybe, like it or not, a decision will be made, upon a \ncareful review process, that this weapons system makes no sense. Maybe \nthe decision will be made, with a highly skilled workforce, that there \ncan be other uses made with other technology and that indeed all kinds \nof decisions can be made and different directions can be taken. I do \nnot know. What I do know is these workers are owed fairness and decent \ntreatment by the Government. They deserve their day in court. Minnesota \nfirms and workers who are most affected by this decision should have a \nchance to make their case within the normal transparent policy process, \nnot a closed process, not a secret backroom process, which is all we \nhave seen so far.\n  I need to repeat that point. I have taken all kinds of unpopular \nvotes on all kinds of weapons systems, and at the end of the day if I \nam convinced there is not merit to this, then that is the way I will \nvote. But there has not been any careful review process. There has not \nbeen any analysis of: How much does it cost to cancel? What do we get \nfrom the investment? What are the alternatives? Where is the money \ngoing to be spent?\n  We can hardly blame men and women, a highly skilled workforce, for \nsaying to me or to any Senator or anybody who represents them: At least \ncall for a decent, fair, thorough, and rational review process. This is \nour skilled work. We are proud of what we do. We believe the weapons \nsystem has great merit, but, Paul, we understand.\n  When I went to visit people, I said: You know my positions. But they \nare\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\nsaying: At the very minimum, we deserve our day in court. There ought \nto be a careful review process. There cannot be a 180-degree turn, with \nthe Secretary of Defense announcing the program is cancelled, \nperiod. Senator Levin's amendment is all about process. Process sounds \nboring. Senator Levin's amendment is about fairness. It is about \nfairness. I hope it will get strong support.\n\n  Responsible defense spending decisions, especially those that have \ndecades-long consequences, ought to be made only after a careful \nanalysis and consideration of the need to have U.S. forces as well \nequipped and as well trained as possible. That is what happens to some \nMembers critical of the expenditures and weapons systems. We are \naccused of being weak on defense. That is not the point. The point is, \nthere is not any Senator here who does not want our Armed Forces to be \nwell trained and well equipped. The question is what weapon systems \nmake sense and how best do we do the job.\n  The Pentagon so far offered scant evidence to viable alternatives to \nthe Crusader. It seems clear the alternatives they have vaguely \nsuggested--largely missile and precision-guided munitions programs in \nthe early stage of research and development--will not adequately \nreplace the capabilities of the Crusader. I want the case made before \nwe cancel a program and throw people out of work.\n  Further, they could cost more, with a higher risk they could not be \ndelivered on time. The cost of the termination alone of the Crusader is \nestimated to be $285 million.\n  In short, colleagues, the administration has failed to provide to \nCongress with any comprehensive analysis of alternatives in terms of \ntechnology, readiness, operational effectiveness, costs, and \ndeliverability. The Levin amendment is not putting this off forever. It \nis not: postpone, postpone, postpone. Rather, it is saying we ought to \nhave the careful review process.\n  Whether it is this weapons system or any weapons system, this \namendment is all about setting an important precedent if we are going \nto carry out our responsibilities for careful review. We have invested \n$2 billion in the Crusader. The Pentagon owes the American people, at \nthe very least, an open and transparent review before it abruptly \ncancels an otherwise good artillery system. We have invested $2 \nbillion. Perhaps the case can be made this system should be canceled; I \nam not so sure, but that is beside the point.\n  The point is, Where has there been an open and transparent review of \nthis weapons system? That is something that we request. That is a \nmatter of elementary fairness and also a matter of the way we ought to \nbe making these decisions.\n  The Levin amendment is an important and positive step forward out of \nthe mess. It requires the Army Chief of Staff to conduct a serious \nstudy of the best way to provide for the Army's need for indirect fire \nsupport. At the same time, it provides the Secretary of Defense, \nfollowing the study, a full range of options. These include \ntermination, to continue funding of the Crusader, to funding \nalternative systems to meet the battlefield requirements.\n  This is a pretty reasonable amendment. If instead the Senate passes \nan amendment that immediately terminates the Crusader program, it will \nvalidate an unacceptable decisionmaking process by our Government, by \nour Pentagon. It will also lead to the loss of the Crusader scientific \nand engineering team and its technology. This would occur without \nsaving our Government anything in termination costs.\n  In contrast, if the Senate accepts the chairman's amendment, there \nwould be an orderly process, and we come to final judgment. This would \nhappen without losing the extraordinary team and the technology in the \nmeantime and without adding to the Government's eventual cost if \ntermination is the final option chosen.\n\n  However one feels about the Crusader itself, the Levin amendment is \nabout something different--about the best way to restore fair, \ntransparent, and informed Government decisionmaking to the process, \nwhich has been the opposite so far.\n  Colleagues, I don't know that I need to repeat what I have said. I \ndon't think I could be clearer in my presentation. I make this appeal \non the basis of the way these decisions ought to be made. We deserve \nthe transparency. We as legislators deserve an open, transparent \nprocess, much less the people we represent. To me, this is a synthesis \nor marriage that makes sense, No. 1, to best represent people in my \nState who are saying: We are going to be losing our jobs. We think we \nhave done good work and, at the very minimum, can't you as a Senator \ndemand there be an orderly and transparent process and we have our day \nin court. I should do that.\n  For every Senator, Democrat or Republican, for whatever position you \nmay or may not have right now based upon what information you have \nabout the Crusader, this is just a matter of overview, of \naccountability of where we figure into the decisionmaking.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time there being no others seeking \nrecognition on the pending and underlying second-degree amendment, I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do at some point want to be recognized \non the second-degree amendment, the Warner amendment to the underlying \namendment. But not until we have had a chance to evaluate it a little \nbit more. That is what we have been doing in the last few minutes.\n  As the ranking member, Senator Warner knows this is something that \ncame up fairly quickly. We need a chance to look it over.\n  In the meantime, I see Senator Akaka, the chairman of the Readiness \nSubcommittee, is going to be seeking recognition. So if it is \nacceptable, I would like to talk a little bit about our Readiness \nSubcommittee, our feelings, and then maybe respond to a couple of \ncomments concerning the Crusader. Then if there is time, perhaps \nSenator Akaka could follow me.\n  First of all, I congratulate both Chairman Levin and Senator Warner \nfor their leadership in the Senate Armed Services Committee. They have \nworked tirelessly in the past months to formulate a bill that for the \nmost part provides for increased readiness for the Armed Forces and the \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  I also thank Senator Akaka, the chairman of the Readiness \nSubcommittee, for his bipartisan leadership of the subcommittee. As the \nformer chairman of that subcommittee and now the ranking member of the \nReadiness Subcommittee, I believe the subcommittee took a balanced \napproach to address a number of the readiness management concerns \naffecting the armed services.\n  In keeping with our bipartisan approach to readiness, this bill \nincreased funding for identified shortfalls in the services' \ninfrastructure, equipment, maintenance, and operating budgets. I \nespecially want to highlight the increases in the ammunition \nprocurement, depot level maintenance, base operations, and military \nconstruction. While I support many of the readiness items in this bill, \na few lines cause me some concern.\n  Foremost, I am concerned about the $850 million reduction for \nprofessional services contracts. This reduction would have significant \nimpacts on the level of services provided to the Department.\n  I had hoped the bill approved by the Armed Services Committee would \nbe more supportive of the Department's proposed readiness range \npreservation initiative. Although the bill includes two of the \nprovisions requested by the Department, the modifications relating to \nthe Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Marine Mammal \nProtection Act, are not on the mark. I believe they should have been on \nthe mark. I do know the political reality was the support was not \nthere. I hope, when we send this bill to the President for signature, \nit will include some of these provisions since they are essential to \nmaintaining the training and readiness of our forces.\n  We might remember it was not long ago that we determined that in \nseveral of our training installations we actually paid more money for \nsome of the\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\nenvironmental provisions than we did for ammunition. That was at a time \nwhen we had severe budget constraints, which are less severe today.\n  Although I support many of the provisions of the bill, especially \nthose in the readiness accounts, I was among the eight Republican \nSenators who voted against reporting out the bill in its current form. \nMy vote against the bill was based on the drastic reductions, over $800 \nmillion, from the President's request for missile defense programs. The \nreductions, according to General Kadish, the Director of the Missile \nDefense Agency:\n\n       . . . would fundamentally undermine the administration's \n     transformation of missile defense capabilities and eliminate \n     the opportunity for the earliest possible contingency against \n     medium range ballistic missiles abroad.\n\n  I have been at the forefront when it comes to the development of \nmissile defense to protect our Nation's citizens. I find it ironic, in \nlight of what happened on the 11th of September, that we are not \nputting in the money necessary for a missile defense system.\n  I have very serious concerns about that. I know the administration \ndoes. I fully support what the administration is trying to do with \nmissile defense. Of course, we cut the authorization considerably for \nthat.\n  Let me just make a comment or two about the discussion that has taken \nplace here concerning the Crusader. I have to agree, Chairman Levin is \ncorrect when he talks about the chain of events that led to the May 8 \ncancellation by the administration. It was something that we determined \nafterwards in committees that none of the military, none of the \nuniformed services were aware of. It was not right and I think everyone \nagrees that was not the proper procedure.\n  I will say this. Let's not forget the real problem we have with \nartillery today. I will start by saying there are people in this \nChamber and elsewhere who really do not believe we need artillery, we \ndo not need a gun.\n  But when you ask these same people if they are prepared to say we do \nnot need ground troops in the future, there is not anyone who is going \nto say we do not need ground troops in the future. When we have troops \non the ground, and we know we will have them on the ground--we had them \nin Anaconda and Afghanistan--you have to offer cover. Of course, if it \nis close to ships, you could do it that way, but that is highly \nunlikely. You could do it from the air or with artillery. If you do it \nfrom the air, as we depended on air in Afghanistan, then you have two \nproblems.\n  No. 1, according to the testimony of General Shinseki, it took an \naverage of 25 minutes of response time to be able, from the air, to get \nthe cover necessary. In other words, our troops were naked for a 25-\nminute period of time. That is unacceptable.\n  Second, it was further testified--we had testimony that was very \nconvincing--that in one-half of the cases the weather was such we could \nnot get that cover from the air.\n  So what is the alternative? The alternative is to do it with \nartillery. I have lots of quotes here--that I will probably put in the \nRecord, but I will not bother quoting right now--from the top military \nuniformed people saying we really needed to have the artillery \ncapability at that time. So let's look at where we are today.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the Crusader. The Crusader is the \nsystem of the future. It is a system that will correct the problem, the \ndeficiency we have right now.\n  We in this Chamber have to make a determination: Are we willing to \nsend our troops into combat with inferior equipment? I would say that \nis unacceptable. So let's look at where we are today.\n  This is the Paladin. That is the best thing we have today. It was \ndesigned in 1963. I have spent many hours inside the Paladin, in the \ntraining areas. It is inconceivable to me that we would be expecting \nour troops to use such antiquated equipment, one where after every fire \nyou have to take a pole and take the breach and then hand load it, put \nthe shell in, put the charge in behind it, close it, cock it, take a \nrope and pull it. I can show you Civil War movies where they had to go \nthrough that same process. That is totally unacceptable.\n  First of all, we determined if we are going to have ground troops we \nhave to have artillery. There are two things you want in artillery: One \nis range, the other is rate of fire. This is the Paladin right down \nhere. It is at the very low end of the spectrum.\n  In here are four countries that make a system that is better than the \nPaladin. In other words, these countries--such as this one here, \nPZH2000. I took the effort to go to Germany and sat inside one when it \nwas fired. It is far superior to the Paladin but not as good as the \nCrusader. Here is the Crusader. In terms of rate of fire, in terms of \nrange, it would be superior, if we had that, to the rest of these.\n  Before we had what happened on May 8, we thought we were going to be \nin a position to have that Crusader capability so our troops that go \nout there would have something superior to the rest of them. Now we see \nif we do not have that, we have the British, the Russians, South \nAfricans, and the Germans, all making a system that is better than what \nwe have here.\n  It may be that we can get there. I think most people agree that if we \nare going to have a gun for the future, we need to have it by 2008. The \nPaladin Crusader would have been there by that time. It may be that \nlater on we will find another alternative and have a gun that will be \nconsistent with the requirements of the Future Combat System by 2008, \neven though it would be lighter. The complaint was that the Paladin \nCrusader was too heavy. They knocked it down from 60 tons to 39 tons. A \nlot of people legitimately believe it is too heavy. Now they are \ntalking about some alternative of around 18 tons to 20 tons. That is \nfine. We need to be able to pursue that.\n  But the bottom line is that we have to be able to give our troops the \ncapability of a superior artillery system. That is where we are today.\n  We have a couple of alternatives. We know the House has language \nfully funding the Crusader. It might be that when we go to conference, \nwe will come out with something such as that. We don't know.\n  It is very important for us to recognize today that we have that \ndeficiency. We have to determine as Members of this body whether that \nis acceptable--that we are willing to send our troops into combat with \nan inferior system. I think we will find that it is not acceptable.\n  I again thank my chairman, Senator Akaka, for the way we have worked \ntogether, and for the subcommittee support in what we have done, even \nthough I still think it is deficient.\n  In the overall budget we had to deal with, we were not able to do two \nmajor things:\n  No. 1, improve on the problems we have right now, and not with \ninadequate systems;\n  And, No. 2, there are a lot of military construction projects that \nare still not addressed.\n  I am not saying this to criticize the President's budget. I am just \nsaying they have a bottom line and they have to live within it. There \nare still deficiencies.\n  I think we did the best we could in our committee. I commend Senator \nAkaka for the bipartisan way in which he and I have always worked \ntogether for the past 15 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend our colleague from \nOklahoma with regard to the budget amendment. On the Crusader, he has \nbeen in the very forefront and participated, I think, in almost all of \nthe discussions--fighting hard for the Army to at some point in time \nindicate what their preferences are and, second, to see that this void \nin the ability of the Army to provide the--let us just call it--\n``artillery fire,'' and have it replaced at the earliest possible time \nwith a system which can substitute many times over and more efficiently \nfor the current antiquated Paladin system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank Senator Inhofe for his passion in \ndealing with the issues before the committee. I thank him for his \nsupport and cooperation throughout our markup. It is truly an honor to \nwork with Senator Inhofe as we both seek to advance the readiness of \nour Armed Forces.\n  I also thank Senator Levin and Senator Warner. They both worked \ntirelessly to meet our committee actions.\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nThey provided great wisdom and guidance during our deliberations.\n  I rise today in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2003 and to highlight some of the major actions taken by \nthe Readiness Subcommittee in this year's bill.\n  This year, the committee had five goals:\n  No. 1, continue improvements in compensation and quality of life;\n  No. 2, sustain readiness;\n  No. 3, improve the efficiency of Department of Defense operations;\n  No. 4, improve the Department of Defense's capability to meet non-\ntraditional threats; and,\n  No. 5, promote transformation.\n  Our subcommittee focused on the first three of these goals.\n  To improve quality of life, the Readiness Subcommittee recommended an \nincrease of over $800 million to improve the buildings where \nservicemembers live and work, including a net increase of $640 million \nin new construction. We also provided an increase of $21 million for \npersonal gear for military members to improve their safety and comfort \nin the field.\n  To sustain readiness, the subcommittee made a number of \nrecommendations that are included in the bill. First and foremost, the \nbill protects the $10 billion the President requested for operating \ncosts of the ongoing war on terrorism, and has authorized the \nappropriation of these contingency funds once the President submits a \nrequest for specific uses for these funds to Congress. The subcommittee \nalso developed an initiative to enhance training opportunities for our \nArmed Forces to ensure they can make the most effective use of existing \ntraining assets. To do this, we established a fund that would allow the \nDepartment of Defense to purchase land, or easements on land, that \nwould protect training ranges. We also provided $126 million for \nimprovements to those ranges, including better targeting capabilities \nand infrastructure improvements.\n  To help to address longer term readiness challenges, the bill \nincludes an increase of $95.0 million for maintenance of ships and \nother Navy assets, and $138.6 million to maintain highly stressed \naircraft. And, we continue our efforts from last year to enhance the \nDepartment of Defense's coordination of anti-corrosion programs. \nStudies estimate that corrosion costs the Department up to $20 billion \nannually, and that corrosion continues to be a serious maintenance \nchallenge and manpower drain. We therefore recommended that DOD \ndesignate a senior official to oversee anti-corrosion plans and \npolicies, and added almost $30 million to fund those efforts and other \nanti-corrosion testing, research, and product applications.\n  To improve DOD management, the subcommittee recommended a number of \nprovisions to expand DOD's authority to acquire major weapon systems \nmore efficiently. With respect to services contracts, we built on last \nyear's legislation requiring improved management of the $50 billion DOD \nspends annually on services by establishing specific goals for the use \nof competitive contracts and performance-based contracting. These goals \nshould help ensure that the Department of Defense meets contract \nservices savings goals through specific management improvements rather \nthan through program reductions. The bill also requires DOD to develop \na comprehensive financial management enterprise architecture, and \naddresses recurring problems with the abuse of purchase cards and \ntravel cards by military and civilian personnel.\n  I believe this bill strongly supports the readiness of our forces, \nboth now and in the future. As the chairman of the Readiness and \nManagement Support Subcommittee, I commend it to my colleagues.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3899\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Levin, and to join my other colleagues in supporting it, \nbecause it provides the Army with the opportunity to fully analyze \noptions to provide organic indirect fire support. I am concerned by the \nmanner in which the Department of Defense has handled the decision to \nterminate the Crusader program because it is apparent to me that the \nArmy's views were not appropriately considered in this decision.\n  I have long supported the Army's efforts to transform itself into a \nlighter, more lethal force to meet the threats of the 21st century. I \nbelieve the Army is making considerable progress in its efforts and \ntrust in the positions that have been advocated for the type of \ntechnology and weapons necessary to sustain both the legacy force and \nthe objective force. My friend, Senator Inhofe, has made a good \nstatement on this issue and I certainly support him. In most \nsituations, I consider the Secretary of Defense to be the expert on the \nneeds of the men and women serving in the Armed Forces. I rely on his \nadvice and direction for what the Department needs to execute its \nmission of preserving our national security. A lot of my trust in his \nexpertise and the recommendations of his staff is based on my belief \nthat he relies upon those in the Department, both uniformed and \ncivilian, to determine what is best for the Department of Defense.\n  I am having a very difficult time with this issue because it seems \napparent to me that the Army is not being heard on this issue. It is \ndisturbing to consider that decisions on Army modernization and \ntransformation are apparently being made without timely input from the \nArmy. I believe it is imperative for the Army to be provided with the \nnecessary time to complete its study of the full range of options \navailable to provide organic indirect fire support. For this reason, I \nsupport Senator Levin's amendment.\n  Mr. President, the full committee and our subcommittee have worked \nhard on drafting this bill. It is a bill that our country needs. I ask \nthat my colleagues support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending \namendment. I am the ranking member of the Airland Subcommittee of the \nArmed Services Committee. On that subcommittee, I have had a great \nworking relationship with the chairman of that subcommittee, Senator \nLieberman. We, for now the sixth year that I have served in this \ncapacity, have always brought our portion of the Defense authorization \nbill together in a bipartisan way. We have worked together on every \namendment. We have either supported or opposed amendments on the floor. \nWe have never had a disagreement.\n  I am hopeful that will continue today because we have been working \nvery hard on trying to get a resolution to the issue that is before us, \nwhich is this Crusader issue.\n  Obviously, as Senator Akaka has just mentioned, the way the \nadministration has gone about canceling this program, as we began the \nmarkup of the Defense authorization bill, has made it very difficult \nfor us to try to make an adjustment in midstream. But we are working \nthrough that. In fact, we are in the process of active negotiations--\nSenator Lieberman and myself, with the Defense Department--to see if we \ncan come up with something that can accomplish the goals that have been \nlaid out by Senator Inhofe, Senator Warner, Senator Levin, and others, \nthat are vitally important to the future of the Army and their ability \nto be relevant in the wars of the future.\n  Let me first start out by saying I agree with the comments of Senator \nInhofe and Senator Warner--there may have been others, but they are the \nones I have heard so far--that we do need indirect fire or artillery \nfire in support of our troops on the ground; that if we are going to \nhave troops on the ground, we are going to have some sort of weapon \nthere to protect them and provide the fire support they need.\n\n  So the question is, Is what we have right now, as Senator Inhofe laid \nout, adequate? I think clearly the Army, in its evaluation of its \noptions going forward, believed what they had was not adequate. That is \nwhy they had Crusader in their budget. That is why they had the Future \nCombat System in their budget.\n  The administration has come in--looking at what I think are real \nproblems that the Army has--and decided the Crusader does not fit with \nthe future of the Army. It is not lighter, it is more lethal, but it is \ntoo darn heavy to be deployed in a realistic fashion in the wars that \nwe are going to be fighting in the future.\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\n  So they made a decision, frankly, the Army could not make. I say \n``could not make.'' They obviously did not make it. And I would argue \nthey could not make it. They have not been willing to make some of the \ntough decisions, in my opinion, that have led them to the problem we \nare facing today.\n  They have a big budgetary problem. Senator Lieberman and I have had a \nvariety of different hearings on a variety of different subjects \nthroughout the last 6 years, but every year we have a discussion of \nthis problem with the Army. This is the one recurrent theme that we \nhave had, which is the Army is not making the tough decisions to \neliminate this bow-away problem they are going to have in a few years. \nIn other words, they are not going to have enough money to fund all the \nprograms they believe they need.\n  We thought it was important they start making tough decisions to \nstart cutting programs. We even had some concerns about some of the new \nprograms they put in place during our 6-year tenure, such as the \nInterim Brigade Concept, but that is another story. We fought that, we \nlost, and we are willing to move on. The fact is, they did not have the \nmoney to do what was needed, to do what they wanted, what they believed \nwas needed.\n  What I think the Secretary of Defense did was look at that, as \nSenator Lieberman and I have looked at it over the years, and decided \nto act and to cut out a system they believed was not going to be \nrelevant based on the experience they have had over the past several \nmonths in Afghanistan, and prior to that in Kosovo. So they made a \ndecision.\n  I understand Senator Levin wants the Army to have more of the same. \nWith all due respect to the chairman--and I do respect him--I think the \nArmy has proven they cannot make these kinds of tough decisions. It is \nnot just within their capability to do that. They have gotten rid of a \nwhole bunch of little systems, but when it comes to the tough decisions \nthey have had to make, they have not been able to make them or they \nhave not been able to put a credible alternative forward to the Defense \nDepartment to keep systems going in an affordable way.\n  One example is Crusader. Crusader has three times the firing power of \nthe Paladin. Yet what they ask for are the same number of Crusaders as \nwe have Paladins. Yet the Crusader has three times the firing power.\n  You would think if you are being told your program is on the hot \nseat, that we may cancel this program, this should not be news to the \nArmy. The President of the United States, during the Presidential \nelections, mentioned Crusader as a program that he might cancel. So \nthey should be aware there is a problem.\n  They never offered a credible alternative to the Department of \nDefense to downsize the Paladin for the Crusader, to pay for it with \nforce reduction because you need less people if you have less units. So \nto make this a deal that could be workable, they were unwilling to make \nthat decision. They were unwilling to make that change because it \ninvolved force structure, and that is something the Army holds on to \ndearly.\n  So I would just argue that while I understand the concept of having \nthe Army have its say, I think the Army had plenty of opportunity to \nhave its say, and they were not at the table with credible proposals to \nmake this work.\n  So what Senator Lieberman and I have been trying to accomplish over \nthe past few weeks, once this came to light, is to see whether we can \nput something together. I think both Senator Lieberman and I have come \nto the opinion that the administration is right, that the Crusader \nprogram should be terminated.\n  I would add a caveat to that. The Crusader program has not yet been \nterminated. The Department of Defense has not terminated the contract. \nWhat does that mean? That means every single day that this contract \nstays in force--a contract we know the Defense Department is going to \nterminate--we are spending $1.5 million.\n  We are spending $1.5 million on a contract that we know is going to \nbe terminated. Of that amount, a half a million dollars has no useful \npurpose for any future defense project.\n  Let's understand what we are doing. Every day the Congress puts heat \non the Defense Department; both sides of the aisle and both Houses of \nthe Congress have been putting pressure on the Defense Department not \nto cancel this contract.\n  The President has said he is canceling this contract. The Defense \nDepartment says they are going to cancel this contract. I understand we \nare putting pressure on them not to do it right away for a variety of \nreasons: We are on the floor with the bill; the House is marking up \nover here; there are all sorts of reasons not to do it, not to offend \nCongress.\n  I tell you what offends this Senator is spending a half a million \ndollars a day for nothing. I understand the relationships on the hill \nand all the other things going on, but I think it is unconscionable to \nspend a half a million dollars a day on a contract we know is going to \nbe terminated because of congressional pressure from both bodies to \ncancel the contract. If you are going to cancel it, cancel it now. I \ncould take that money, 2002 money, and use it for some better purpose.\n  Secondly, when it comes to this program, what Senator Lieberman and I \nare concerned about is our ability to have fire support for our troops. \nWe have the Future Combat System. Under the President's proposal, they \nhave moved the Future Combat System. It is another gun, a Howitzer. It \nis smaller. We don't know what this thing necessarily looks like, but \nit is projected to weigh about 18 to 20 tons as opposed to the original \n60 tons for the Crusader which has been scaled down to 40 tons now. It \nis still a very heavy and cumbersome piece of equipment.\n  What they want and what the mission and vision of this military is is \nto be lighter, more deployable, quicker. Why? Because we will be \nresponding to these kinds of isolated events, and we need to be moving \nfaster.\n  It makes sense that we have this system because this 1963 Paladin \nsystem will not meet the needs of the Army of the future. So we need to \ndo this system. Hopefully everybody in the Chamber looking at the \nfacts, once they have an opportunity to do so, will agree with me that \nwe need this system. So what the President did in his proposal was move \nup. We eliminated Crusader. We moved up the Future Combat System, this \n18 to 20 ton gun, from being deployed in 2014 to being ready in 2010 to \n2011.\n  Now, what Senator Inhofe is arguing is--I think he is right--why \ndon't we see if we can pull it up even a little further, up into 2008, \nwhich is when the Crusader was going to be deployed in the first \nplace--see if we can move the Future Combat System up to 2008 so we can \ntake the Crusader out of the mix but fill it in with a more relevant \nsystem.\n  What does that do? You have to spend the money in 2008 but you don't \nbuy two systems. You buy one. You buy one that is more relevant to the \nArmy.\n  To me that makes a lot of sense. The question is, How do we get to \nthat? Can we afford to do that? We are going through those discussions \nright now. I hope we will have the opportunity.\n  What I asked my ranking member to convey was that we would have the \nopportunity to at least see if we could work out some solution before \nthis amendment came to the floor. The amendment came to the floor, and \nwe will have a vote, I understand, but I am hopeful we can continue to \nwork on this issue over the next week or so to see if we can come up \nwith a solution, working with the Army, with the Department of Defense, \nwith Members on both sides of the aisle who would like to see this \nmission accomplished.\n\n  It really comes down to more money. I know that is not a plentiful \nthing in this bill. Everybody wants more money. What we are looking \nat--to give some rough figures--is that the money that is in the \noriginal bill, in the President's request, was $495 million for the \nCrusader program in fiscal year 2003. The President has said we will \nspend $195 million of that, continuing to spend that money on \nartillery, on this gun system of the future, because there is a \ntechnology that we were working on with Crusader as a gun system that \nis applicable to the next gun system. So it is a technology that we \nwant to continue to move forward. So $195 million stays in a sense in \nthat area.\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\n  The rest goes into basically smart weapons. Why? Because the Defense \nDepartment believes these smart weapons are the future, that what we \ndon't need are big artillery rounds, dumb bombs being fired by big \ncannons and we don't know where they will hit, at least not with \nprecision. We know generally but not with precision. Why? There are \nlots of reasons. Frankly, one of them is political in the sense that we \nare becoming increasingly concerned about collateral damage. Smart \nweapons reduce collateral damage, civilian casualties. The smarter the \nweapons, the fewer the casualties. The weapons we were going to fire \nwith the Crusader were not designed to be smart weapons and, therefore, \nmore casualties to civilians.\n  There are other reasons with respect to precision. It is cheaper. It \nis more effective. There are lots of other reasons.\n  They made the decision for that reason. I support it. I support the \nallocation of those resources to more smart weapons.\n  With respect to the 495, I think it is properly committed. The \nadministration is very clear on that. Senator Lieberman and I believe \nstrongly that the allocation is the proper one. The question is, How do \nwe get from this artillery piece, moving it up from 2011 to 2008 so we \ncan have it in a more timely manner?\n  What we have found is, to be able to do that, we need an additional \n$173 million. That is a lot of money. But we have to make the decision, \nas a body, is it a wise expenditure of money to replace a 1963 vehicle \nthat, as Senator Inhofe said, you still have to pull with a cord. \nImagine that, we were doing that in the Civil War.\n  So we are going to replace this vehicle, which is slow, which is \nsmall, which does not have the firepower necessary to really protect \nour troops. Are we going to replace it, and what is the cost of our \ndoing so?\n  I have been working with Senator Lieberman and others with the \nDefense Department to see, No. 1, can we find some other money; and No. \n2, are there some costs we will save by putting this money forward in \nsavings to the contractor which we will terminate with the Crusader \nprogram.\n  We are terminating that program. When you terminate a program, there \nare costs associated with it. You just don't terminate and walk away. \nYou have damages that you have to pay because you canceled a contract \nthat you said you were going to fulfill. So there are damages. They are \nnegotiated damages. We don't have a handle on exactly how much. But my \nsense is that if we put additional money in a program to move forward \nthis other system and we make that money available, then there might be \nlower termination costs because the contractor necessarily isn't \nterminating all of their programs.\n  What we are trying to do is work through to see if we can't come up \nwith a solution that terminates the Crusader, as the President rightly \ndecided to do, so we can get rid of the program--we believe it is an \nobsolete program--fund the smart weapons we need to fund and about \nwhich the Defense Department is passionate--I agree with that--and at \nthe same time get a new gun system by 2008, which is what the Crusader \nwould have done in the first place, that is lighter and more capable, \ncertainly, than the existing system.\n  In a sense what we are trying to do is see if we can accomplish \neverything and save the Army a tremendous amount of money and not just \nhelp with funding this system but help with the other programs that the \nArmy doesn't have a whole lot of money for either, making them more \naffordable under the budget.\n  We are going to have to vote, I suspect, on the Warner amendment and \non the Levin amendment. If that is the case, fine, we may have to do \nthat. But I hope we can continue to work on this issue to see whether \nwe in the Senate can come up with a solution that accomplishes \neverything I have just laid out, which is what I think, from talking to \nMembers, is the objective for everybody.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Virginia if he has a \nquestion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Briefly, I want to ask a question. I thought the Senator \ngave a very interesting, forthright, and quite courageous assessment of \na situation that has prevailed for a very long time. I am not sure I \nfully agree with quite as strong an indictment of the Army.\n  Nevertheless, facts are facts. I remember joining Chairman Levin and \ngoing over to see Secretary Cohen years ago, shortly after General \nShinseki came into office, indicating it was the view of Senator Levin \nand myself that the funds were not there to achieve the magnitude of \nthe Army reorganization. I remember that meeting very well. I think \nSecretary Cohen basically acknowledged they would do what they could to \nfix it, and the rest is history.\n  The question I have to pose--and the chairman is here, and I will \nsuggest a hypothetical--if my amendment were to be accepted by a voice \nvote, we would then proceed to a vote on the chairman's amendment, the \nunderlying amendment. Does that help or impede the Senator's objectives \nas ranking member, working with his chairman to try to resolve that \nissue?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I don't believe that amendment prejudices anything we \nare doing. My understanding is, within the context of this amendment--\nmy hope is that we can continue to work on this, even as we are on the \nfloor, to see if we can come up with an amendment that lays out what we \nneed to do in 2003. I didn't get details, but there are other 2002 \nbudget issues. To accomplish this, we need to take care of that in the \nsupplemental. That is another issue. As far as 2003 is concerned, I am \nstill hopeful we can come up with something; whether it is on the floor \nor we can resolve it by the time the bill is finished, I don't know. I \nam hopeful we can include it if we can resolve it. I don't see anything \nin the amendment that prejudices it and trying to work it out in \nconference.\n  Mr. WARNER. Last night the Senator hosted, with Senator Lieberman, a \nmeeting with the Deputy Secretary and the Secretary of the Army, and I \nwas present. I thought the very clear explanation you made of the \ndifferent challenges of 2002, how they differ from 2003, was important. \nI think that would be vital for colleagues to understand--particularly \nin the context of your concern, which I share, about the million and a \nhalf a day being expended while the Congress works its way through this \nbill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate that. My understanding is that if we \nterminated the contract--it is a million and a half dollars a day. If \nwe terminated the contract today, there would be roughly $150 million \nunexpended in the program--I believe unobligated and unexpended from \nthe program. Again, these are rough numbers, and I don't want to hold \nthe Army to any particular number because these numbers have to be \nnegotiated between the Army and the contractor; but the estimate we are \ngetting is that roughly $100 million of that would go toward \ntermination costs for the contractor in 2002 dollars, which would leave \naside $40 million to $50 million, which could then be put toward the \ntechnology that is applicable to the Future Combat System.\n\n  So it gets us a start to try to move the Future Combat System from \n2011 to 2008. Once that starts, it will be helpful if we can continue \nto move it up with an additional $173 million in 2003, which will put \nus in a position in 2004 to get it in a timely way.\n  I know the chairman gets a million requests and there is not a lot of \nmoney out there, but $173 million, even in the Senate, isn't chump \nchange. I argue that when you are taking out a system--obviously a very \ncontroversial move--for $173 million in 2003, you can replace that \nsystem and get another system fielded in the same timeframe as the \noriginal one, which is more practical for the usage for the Army, and \nyou have accomplished something very significant.\n  That is the pitch I am making. If we could make that happen, I think \nit would be good for the Army, and I think it would be taking what is a \nvery difficult and troublesome situation that we have with Crusader and \nturning it into something very positive for everybody concerned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While the Senator from Pennsylvania is on the floor, let \nme comment on one thing he said about the unwillingness of the Army to \nmake the tough decision. The Army was in the middle of an analysis when \nit was\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\ncompletely truncated unexpectedly against the commitment and statements \nmade by the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense. So \nthey were in the middle of making an analysis. It is not as though they \nwere unwilling to make the analysis.\n  This is important. It is an analysis looking at seven different \nquestions, including what are the risks of proceeding versus the risks \nof canceling, the alternatives, what are the costs, and what is the \ncost effectiveness--all of these issues, under six combat scenarios. I \nthink the Senator would agree that these could be life-and-death \ndecisions. Whichever way you come out on these questions, these are \nlife-and-death decisions. The Army is in the middle of an analysis, \nwhich they were told at the end of April they should finish by May 30, \nand on May 6 the Secretary of Defense indicated they decided to \nterminate.\n  The analysis is important and it addresses many of the same issues \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania addresses. I know what he is after. We \nwant the best system we can possibly get as soon as possible. Relevant \nto that, surely, is the analysis of the Army looking at seven \nquestions, including force effectiveness, benefit of each alternative; \nthat is an issue that should be looked at, surely. We don't want to \nignore what is the force effectiveness benefit of each of the four \nalternatives. We want to look at the capability of each alternative to \nsupport--now I am reading the questions--the capability of each \nalternative to support a rapidly deployed force in a small-scale \ncontingency. That is one of the questions they are looking at. Six \ncombat scenarios.\n  People say: Gee, could the Crusader have been useful in Afghanistan? \nThat is one of six. What about in a desert situation when the Paladin \ncannot keep up with the vehicles it is supposed to be supporting? Is \nthat relevant? I know how deeply involved the Senator is and how \ncommitted he is to the same goal. These are important questions. To \nsimply, without any explanation, change course twice in 2 weeks, first \nsaying we are going to decide this by September 30, and then saying we \nare going to decide this by May 30, and then say I just decided--I will \nsoon yield the floor, but I assure the Senator from Pennsylvania that \nthe Army was in the middle of an analysis that was due by the end of \nthis May.\n\n  This amendment says we want that analysis finished--not just to check \non the decision of the Department of Defense to end the Crusader \nsystem, but also to help us decide where we want to go in terms of some \nof the expenditures about which the Senator was talking. It is not just \nan analysis that helps us decide what course to change from, but what \ncourse to change to.\n  That is why we put this provision in here for this analysis. I don't \nthink it makes a huge difference as to whether or not, frankly, we have \nan analysis and a period of wait or we have an analysis and then \nreprogramming. In either event, if the Department of Defense stays on \nits present course after the analysis, after the benefit of that \nanalysis, if they decide after receiving the Army's review of these \nseven questions and these six scenarios and the four indirect fire \nalternatives--if the Department of Defense decides they want to stay on \nthe current course, in that case they will not be prevented from doing \nso under either of the two alternatives--the first-degree amendment or \nthe second-degree amendment.\n  That is why I tell my friend from Virginia and our other colleagues \nhere to accept the second-degree amendment, with the understanding that \nwe would then proceed to a vote with the support of the Senator from \nVirginia on the first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may just respond, that is a procedure \nI would endorse. I thank my colleague. In that form, the Levin \namendment, as amended by Warner, would be consistent with the wishes of \nthe Secretary of Defense and the goals and, therefore, I think I can \nrepresent it has his support. I will verify that, but I am positive I \nproceeded on that course this morning, and I know of no communication \nthus far to me of any deviation.\n  The Levin amendment, as amended by the Warner second-degree, would be \nconsistent with the goals as established in the President's budget \namendment and is now being sought by the Secretary of Defense.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I inquire, I believe the Senator from \nPennsylvania lost the floor to Senator Levin, in which case, if the \nSenator stays in the Chamber for a moment, I will not be long. I wish \nto respond.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Pennsylvania did want an opportunity to \nrespond to some of my comments. If it is consistent with the needs of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma--I should have given that opportunity to our \nfriend from Pennsylvania--perhaps he can now have the opportunity.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be a minute. My criticism of the Army is not \nthat the Army was not studying this issue when asked to do so by the \nDefense Department in April. My criticism is the Army has not made a \ndecision for quite some time with respect to----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Who has the floor?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator from Oklahoma----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor, but \nthe Senator from Oklahoma yielded to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If at some point I can get back in.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate that. I will be quick because as hard as \nSenator Lieberman and I have worked, Senator Inhofe has worked 10 times \nas hard. I do not want to take up his time.\n  That has been my concern with the Army, that they have not made tough \ndecisions, not that they were not studying this issue at the request of \nDOD when they visited with them that they may be canceling this \nprogram. That is No. 1.\n  The reason I have some concerns with moving forward this study--by \nthe way, I understand the Army is already moving forward and studying \nthis; they are doing the study right now--is it is very clear to me the \nDepartment of Defense is canceling this contract. A study can go \nforward, but they are canceling the contract.\n  We can say we do not want you to cancel the contract. We can say a \nlot of things. But they are going to cancel this contract, and we are \nspending $1.5 million a day on a contract they are going to cancel. The \nPresident has been very clear about that.\n  We can get into a big fight. My problem is twofold. No. 1, I think \nthey are right. Even that aside, even if I think they are wrong, if we \nfight this thing out, if we have a big to-do, we are pushing this \nsystem back to gosh knows when we are going to get this artillery \npiece.\n  I am doing it this way: Did they do every procedure right? I think \nthe Senator from Michigan said it pretty well. They asked for an \nanalysis, and then a few days later they killed the program. I would \nargue that is not right.\n  Is it the right decision? I would make the argument it is the right \ndecision. Was it gotten in the right way? No, it probably was not \ngotten the right way, but it is the right decision, it is a decision \nthey made, and I think they are going to stick to it.\n\n  I am trying to see if we can craft something, in working with the \nArmy, to keep some continuity so we can bring an artillery piece on at \nan appropriate time to meet what the Army believes they need, and I \nwould agree with them to do it.\n  I will support this amendment. I will sit down. The reason I would \nhave problems supporting this in conference is if this is the position \nwe want to take in conference--I think it is vitally important and one \nof the reasons I wanted to deal with it on the floor--if we can find \nthat $173 million piece for next year and if we put this amendment in \nand say we will wait until the analysis, then there is no chance of \ngetting that money and bringing this system up.\n  That is the problem I have with this amendment. I think the Senator \nfrom Michigan has every good intention with this amendment. I have no \nproblem with what he is doing, but I think we need to continue to work \non this to\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\nsee if we can find a solution. If we cannot, I am willing to accept the \nSenator's amendment. I am willing to go to conference and even accept \nit at that point, but if we can do something to try to move this system \nforward, I think we should make every effort to do so. That is all I am \nsuggesting.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for 2 \nminutes for a quick response?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The suggestion of the Senator from Pennsylvania that some \n$170 million be added for some modification in the President's new \nbudget proposal is proof of the fact that the analysis is necessary \nbecause what the Senator is proposing is different now from the \nadministration's budget amendment. That is how fast these things \nchange. That is point No. 1.\n  It seems to me what Senator Santorum is arguing is exact evidence of \nthe fact that we need to complete the analysis which was truncated.\n  My second opinion: This is not a unilateral decision by the \nadministration. No expenditure of funds is unilateral. There is a House \nof Representatives. There is a Senate. The House of Representatives has \ndecided on a certain source of action, and in that course of action, \nthey do not want this contract canceled. We have to go to conference \nwith whatever we do. This is not just a decision that has been made and \nit is over. They should have had the analysis before they made the \ndecision. They did not. We should still have the analysis before we \ndecide what is the next course for these Future Combat Systems. It is \njust possible at least--possible--that when the analysis that was \nterminated prematurely is completed, that actually might affect the \nadministration's plans.\n  On both points I would have a difference with our friend from \nPennsylvania.\n  I yield the floor. The Senator from Oklahoma has been very patient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was given by Senator Dayton a list which \nI believe should be printed into the Record.

There is another \n     side to the argument based upon my experience as a commander \n     of infantry, armor and airborne units in peace and in war in \n     many parts of the world.\n       You posed the question of Crusader as a battle of a \n     visionary Secretary of Defense against backward Cold War \n     thinking generals, entrenched bureaucrats and members of \n     Congress interested only in jobs in their districts. \n     Secretary Rumsfeld did assert that he wanted to kill the \n     program so the money could be invested in new technologies \n     for a more modern force. He has not yet identified his vision \n     of the conflicts of the future nor of the technologies that \n     would lead us there quickly.\n       The Crusader is not a Cold War leftover. It was designed \n     and initiated after the Gulf War to address a long-standing \n     shortfall in the range and rate of fire over our known and \n     potential adversaries (Yes, Russian artillery has had a \n     longer range and a higher rate of fire than US artillery \n     since World War II and provided it to Iraq). Division \n     commanders from the Gulf War rated an improved howitzer as \n     the most important deficiency to be addressed. The 1960's \n     howitzer, upgraded several times, slowed the advance of our \n     forces since it couldn't keep up. You were right in saying \n     the old Paladin needed to be replaced but wrong in saying the \n     Crusader would be obsolete by the time it's fielded. There is \n     nothing identified nor started to replace the Crusader and \n     there probably won't be anything for years to come.\n       Eventually all this comes down to taking a risk. Trading \n     Crusader for some hopeful technology of the future puts the \n     risk on the ground soldier. If Secretary Rumsfeld is \n     fortunate and we have no unexpected conflicts before his \n     revolutionary force is fielded then it will be a risk worth \n     taking. If the next conflict (and we have a hard time \n     predicting them) involves some serious ground combat (Iraq?) \n     then the soldiers and not the bureaucrats nor generals will \n     feel the effects of the risk.\n       We can have a new revolutionary force in the future but we \n     need to retain a trained, ready and equipped force in the \n     interim. Both the Secretary of Defense and the Congress play \n     a role in this process. It should not be a battle between \n     them. Soldiers could suffer.\n           Sincerely,\n     John W. Foss,\n       Gen, US Army (Retired), Former Commander of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the XVII Airborne Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n     Editor:\n     Los Angeles Times\n       The op-ed article by Michael O'Hanlon on May 9, ``Killing \n     the Crusader,'' suffers many of the same ailments found in \n     many such writings; he is only half right. He is exactly\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\n     correct when he notes that the Crusader advanced artillery \n     system could help in a situation like Korea. I would quickly \n     add Iraq. In fact, potential hostilities in Korea or Iraq \n     only highlight the value of a versatile system such as the \n     Crusader.\n       His error comes in saying Crusader is designed just to slug \n     it out with the Soviet Union in Central Europe. Quite the \n     contrary is true; the lethality, versatility and 21st century \n     technology of this weapon makes it an imperative for \n     supporting our forces on any future battlefield.\n       As a nation we do not have the luxury of picking our \n     adversaries. Rather, recent history shows that America must \n     expect the unexpected. A case in point is Operation Anaconda \n     in Afghanistan, which would have benefited greatly from the \n     Crusader--which is highly mobile, can fire faster and farther \n     with extreme accuracy, and outdistances current artillery.\n       Likewise, all conflicts in the future will not involve neat \n     and clean battlefields where air power or other systems like \n     long-range rockets will be constantly available or useful. We \n     must have the firepower to take out air defenses, \n     communications, drive out entrenched enemies, provide lethal \n     cover for our ground troops, and operate in all types of \n     weather with either volume or precision fires.\n       Speaking from the perspective of a Marine and from our \n     nation's experience in Desert Storm, I know first-hand that \n     we must support troops on the ground with overwhelming \n     firepower under all conditions--including the times when air \n     power is not available. That, in precise terms, captures the \n     unpredictable threats of the new century that make Crusader \n     so absolutely essential.\n     Gen. Richard Neal,\n       Former Assistant Commandant, U.S. Marine Corps, Deputy \n     Director of Operations, Desert Storm.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 5, 1997.\n     Mr. Philip Odeen,\n     Chairman, National Defense Panel, Crystal Mall 3, Suite 532, \n         Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Sir: We have followed with interest your recent \n     comments about the need for a ``transformation strategy'' for \n     the Department of Defense and the nation's armed forces. We \n     understand your focus on trend lines and their impact on \n     force structure, personnel savings, readiness, and training. \n     It is with these points in mind that we write, to clarify \n     what we believe are some critical misconceptions about the \n     Army's advanced field artillery system and its contribution \n     to the future Army.\n       As you know, the Army is a leader in taking charge of its \n     future through near-term evolution to Army XXI and then \n     possible semi-revolution in Army After Next. The Army sees \n     Army XXI digitized, mechanized forces as it ``cord'' force, \n     while a more revolutionary light, super-mobile, elite \n     ``battle force'' might served a halting and fixing capability \n     in Army After Next. None of us knows how this concept will \n     finally play out, but we do see Crusader as an essential part \n     of any Army XXI and and AAN decisive fighting force.\n       The Crusader system is a technological leap-ahead, \n     achieving the first U.S. Army artillery overmatch since the \n     end of World War II. Its mobility unleashes the combined arms \n     team . . . a role that its predecessor, Paladin, cannot fill \n     . . . just as the Bradley fighting vehicle enabled the \n     maneuver force to exploit the mobility of the Abrams tank. \n     Crusader is an essential component of Information Dominance. \n     Fielding it allows us to fight with rapid, long-range fires \n     and to take maximum advantage of the digitization of the \n     maneuver force. This ``smart'' system knows where it is at \n     all times, computes its own fire missions, point the gun, and \n     fires the mission, under soldier supervision. No other system \n     approaches its ability to deal with the plethora of targets \n     generated in an information dominance environment.\n       Years of analysis, using varying threats and scenarios, \n     attest to the need for Crusader. Crusader is more than three \n     times as effective as the Paladin. With its technology \n     investment, the advanced field artillery system will provide \n     three times as much lethal fire support to the maneuver force \n     and survive three times as long as the system it replaces. \n     Its accuracy enhancements make it possible to achieve \n     effectiveness on a target-by-target basis by firing 32 to 50% \n     fewer rounds, depending on the nature of the target. In \n     comparison to other unique fire support means, like rockets, \n     Crusader is more economical by weight and cost. For example, \n     to achieve equal effects against a mechanized infantry \n     company, Crusader fires 30 rounds while MLRS fires seven \n     rockets. In terms of weight and cost of ammunition, Crusader \n     projectiles and propellant weigh 37% and cost 71% less than \n     the seven rockets. Analyses have shown that Crusader enhances \n     the contribution of both the cannon and rocket components of \n     the field artillery system.\n       Because Crusader exploits the capabilities of information \n     dominance and situation awareness, it enables the force to \n     engage more targets. In study after study, Crusader increases \n     overall force effectiveness by over 50%. This is an \n     unprecedented impact for a single weapon system. The awesome \n     contribution of Crusader, especially using precision \n     munitions, provides revolutionary gains in combat power that \n     challenge current maneuver-fire support assumptions.\n       You raised the potential for savings in force structure and \n     personnel through technology. The technology advances in \n     Crusader have enabled the Army, in anticipation of its \n     fielding, to already reduce the number of cannons per \n     battalion by 25% and the number of soldiers by 16%. When \n     Crusader is fielded, the Army will realize additional \n     manpower savings as every crew will be reduced in size to \n     three men who sit at cockpit-style workstations, are \n     supported by decision aids, and drive by wire. Automation has \n     removed the requirement for the crew to handle rounds and \n     propellant in firing and resupply.\n       These attributes have obvious strategic deployability and \n     logistical footprint implications. The force needs fewer \n     Crusaders, and those Crusaders kill many more targets using a \n     given amount of ammunition. Hence, the Army can deploy a \n     Crusader capability equal to Paladin's with 50% less \n     strategic and 38% less intratheater lift.\n       We see Crusader as vital to Army XXI and the mechanized \n     portion of Army After Next. Fielding Crusader clearly \n     addresses the issues you have raised, significantly \n     increasing force effectiveness while providing manpower, \n     sustainment, readiness and training cost savings over its \n     life cycle because of reduced personnel requirements, \n     automated systems, embedded training, and improving \n     reliability.\n         John W.

I write to you as a warfighter with \n     almost 40 years in uniform that includes battery level combat \n     command in Vietnam, command of the 101st Airborne Division in \n     the Gulf War, and 3 years at CENTCOM and numerous operations \n     to include Iraq, Somalia, and Ethiopian wars; as a former \n     Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Army with responsibilities for \n     managing the development of future Army systems and operating \n     under constrained budgets; as a Chairman of the Board and CEO \n     of a defense company headquartered in northern Virginia with \n     clear insights on the posture of our nation's industrial base \n     and finally, I write to you as native Virginian and you as my \n     Senator . . . a leader with a long career of public service \n     as Secretary of the Navy and leader in the SASC and Senate.\n       Failure to go forward with the CRUSADER howitzer program is \n     a national strategic mistake of proportions that principally \n     only Army and Marine leaders truly understand. Regretfully, \n     the issue in Washington today has become embroiled in \n     civilian control emotions and service in-fighting as each \n     postures for their future (roles and missions) while \n     recovering from years of budget downsliding. At the end of \n     the day, Congress is responsible for raising Armies and thus \n     my letter to you. I believe the following points are relevant \n     to the final CRUSADER decision:\n\n                               1. Balance\n\n       (A) There must be balance in our air and ground arm today \n     and tomorrow. Today, that means understanding the fog and \n     friction of war in ensuring that fires are always available \n     regardless of communication and intelligence failures, bad \n     weather or simply unavailability. Tomorrow, that means \n     understanding that our enemies will develop counteracting \n     strategies. We have a grand Air Force and my record shows I'm \n     a great supporter. But history is replete with examples of \n     enemy responses, whether it be enemy actions at Guadalcanal \n     impacting naval positioning and the continuous support of \n     committed marines (thus the dedicated Marine air arm today) \n     or the future, where the introduction of lasers on the \n     battlefield will undoubtedly impact the air delivery of \n     ordnance and other air platforms performing intelligence, \n     command and control, and air defense missions. Are we no \n     longer to have howitzers as a major contributor to the fight? \n     Balance . . . a requirement today and tomorrow.\n       (B) There must be balance between precision missiles and \n     high explosive (HE) precision and non-precision munitions in \n     support of soldiers and marines requesting ``close support \n     fires''. The battlefield today requires precision and massed \n     area fires delivered simultaneously over vast distances to \n     suppress enemy air defenses, prepare landing zones for \n     airborne and air assault forces, and defeat massed forces. \n     And at times our forces require diversified munitions and \n     continuous close fires to ``disengage'' from the enemy and \n     often this is a mix of smoke, HE, white phosphorus, \n     illumination and other munitions. And somewhere in all of \n     this is the need to understand costs. Bombs, missiles, and \n     howitzer delivered munitions each provide balance and are \n     needed. But when it comes to truly close continuous fires, it \n     is cannon field artillery delivered munitions that a soldier \n     or marine principally uses due to safety, the angle of fall \n     of the projectile, and their organic control.\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\n       (C) Currently allies and adversaries are rapidly developing \n     a mixture of missile and gun solutions that ensure balance. \n     European, Chinese, and middle eastern and Gulf armies are \n     increasingly procuring advanced self-propelled artillery. \n     Today the U.S. Army is comparatively far down (9th) on the \n     list of cannon artillery and our most advanced system (the \n     Paladin) is 40 years old. It is interesting to note, that our \n     Navy (which has been thru numerous examinations of guns \n     versus missiles) has the very essence of CRUSADER embedded in \n     its approach to the advanced gun system for the DD(X), and \n     our Marine Corps is vigorously enhancing its regiments with \n     advanced howitzers and HIMARS, and it has its own organic air \n     support. Balance!\n\n     2. Transformation, Modernization and Readiness, and deterrence\n\n       (A) CRUSADER is a transformation system and its fits \n     perfectly in the Army's Objective Force. It is a ``far \n     different'' system than that described only two years ago. \n     Its weight has been cut by a third; its crews save manpower, \n     its technology is unmatched. As such, the Army has already \n     changed its future manning and equipment documents to \n     realized these breakthroughs and capabilities by eliminating \n     tanks, personnel careers, howitzer sections and personnel \n     from its requirements. This CRUSADER howitzer is on time and \n     target in terms of its production milestones and is \n     performing magnificently in tests. Its cost as a major weapon \n     system is a modest $9-11 billion well below the cost of other \n     service systems.\n       (B) Many call for skipping a decade of systems. We have \n     already done that many times over. We will never field \n     systems if we continue to kill them just as they are ready to \n     go into full-scale production after years of work by our \n     industrial base. Some say, ``move the technologies to the \n     tech base or to a new FCS system'' ..., yet nothing really \n     exists except draft concepts on paper and vu-graphs. It will \n     be years before the next prototype system is available. Thus, \n     once again we delay modernizing the force introducing cost \n     readiness problems and, importantly, weakening our industrial \n     base. The wealth of engineering excellence assembled around \n     the CRUSADER program will be lost, rapidly impacting armored \n     vehicle industrial base capabilities which today principally \n     resides in only two companies. Deterrence has many \n     components. The presence of modernized heavy land forces and \n     a solid industrial base are not lost on our adversaries.\n       (C) Today, we all understand the advent of asymmetric \n     warfare. We predicted years ago that it was coming. \n     Nevertheless, we should not lose perspective that the future \n     will involve combinations of asymmetric, conventional, and \n     WMD actions. We should note the pictures of armored vehicles, \n     tanks, and artillery in the latest city fighting in the \n     Middle East. Skipping decades to meet threats of the future \n     briefs well. World events have never allowed us to do that \n     and there is not nearly enough money in the world to \n     transform entire Armies in short duration. Thus, we've always \n     modernized systems and parts of systems and then fought them \n     in high-low mixes of heavy and light forces and mixtures of \n     modernized and un-modernized systems based on the spectrum of \n     conflict. Today, it is Iraq, Korea and Afghanistan. Tomorrow \n     it could be Colombia, Iran, Taiwan, China, a different \n     emerging Russia or the entire set of Middle East nations. \n     Whoever would have even been close to predicting our \n     deployments from Desert Storm to Enduring Freedom during the \n     past 10 years? Deterrence is a major price of our national \n     strategy and CRUSADER'S role in support of Army forces is a \n     key visible ingredient to that strategy.\n       Finally, this decision has become a very personal at the \n     highest levels. Regretfully, it started with a Presidential \n     campaign debate with uniformed aides beating the agenda for \n     change, long before discussions with seasoned warfighters \n     would or could take place. Courage to admit that the CRUSADER \n     system has radically changed since that time, and that there \n     is a clear need for the system in an uncertain world (by our \n     leadership) would only raise one's respect for their wisdom. \n     The Army has always been transforming. Transformation in form \n     of revolutionary or evolutionary approaches will only survive \n     when wisdom dominates national security decision-making. This \n     is a dangerous, complex business. Wisdom is ``Balance'' \n     learned from history. Wisdom is understanding the \n     complexities of modernization and its impact on readiness and \n     deterrence. Wisdom is listening to warfighters and \n     professionals who have spend their lifetime fighting and \n     studying the art of war. CRUSADER cuts across all of these \n     issues today.\n       Thursday, you will speak at the graduation of the Class of \n     2002, at the Virginia Military Institute...many of these \n     graduates will very shortly be leading soldiers and marines \n     in ground combat. I hope they will be provided the \n     ``balanced'' fire support to do their job. I also hope they \n     will never have to lead our nation's youth in combat because \n     deterrence worked. The wise decision resoundingly supports \n     fielding CRUSADER as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. Binford Peay.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 16, 2002.\n       To the Members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of \n     Representatives:\n       The misinformation filling newspapers concerning the \n     Crusader program is troubling. Decisions to support military \n     transformation are key and must be reached through fact and \n     analysis.\n       Crusader is a smart gun. Its development began in 1995, \n     after the Cold War ended and Iraq was defeated. Crusader was \n     a key part of then Army Chief General Gordon Sullivan's \n     vision to digitize land forces around the power of the \n     microprocessor. Furthermore, Crusader has been specifically \n     redesigned for C17 deployability, refuting the popular myth \n     that it is too heavy for 21st Century operations. For \n     example, Crusaders could have been on the ground in \n     Afghanistan in less than 24 hours.\n       As we have heard repeatedly from the U.S. Army's \n     leadership, land forces need cannon artillery to provide \n     dedicated responsive fires in support of soldiers on the \n     ground around the clock, and in all weather. Precision \n     strikes from bombers, missile systems, and unmanned aerial \n     vehicles will complement, not substitute for Crusader's \n     capability. The decision to terminate Crusader should be \n     based on an analysis of alternatives using defined strategy \n     and scenarios, which includes a thorough assessment of cost \n     effectiveness and technology risk.\n       The Crusader program is on cost, on schedule, and exceeding \n     performance objectives. This system has already fired over \n     6,000 rounds and demonstrates ranges exceeding 40 kilometers, \n     rates of fire beyond 10 rounds per minute, and three times \n     the lethality of currently fielded systems. Crusader also \n     brings proven technologies in leading-edge robotics, sensor-\n     to-shooter architecture, crew cockpits, and advanced \n     materials.\n       The taxpayers of this nation have invested nearly $2 \n     Billion in the development of Crusader. At a minimum, this \n     model program deserves a thorough assessment before it is \n     canceled and America's investment is thrown away. More \n     importantly, the soldiers of today and tomorrow should be \n     assured that the decision to terminate Crusader is based on \n     compelling evidence that proposed alternatives will be there \n     to provide the same needed responsive precision fires on \n     future battlefields--we know not where, when, or under what \n     circumstances.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Frank C. Carlucci,\n\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n                                              General, USA (Ret.).\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me comment in response to some of the \nstatements made by my distinguished and very close personal friend with \nwhom I came to the Senate from the other body in 1994.\n  Mr. President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania stay here? I was \ngoing to respond to some of the comments he made. First, I state in the \nstrongest possible terms that there is no person I think more of than \nSecretary Rumsfeld. There has been a problem in this whole debate, and \nthat is that he is busy managing a war right now. He has other things \non his mind other than what our Future Combat System is going to be.\n  Consequently, while they said, yes, we want to cancel the program, \nwhatever the immediate motivation was, the Secretary made that \ndecision, and, quite frankly, I do not believe--in fact, I am certain \nof it--at the time the decision was made he did not take into \nconsideration the termination costs.\n  As recently as last night in the office of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, General Armbruster made the statement it would cost \nabout $290 million without a bridge. So we are talking about a very \nlarge amount of money.\n  I am concerned about $1 million today, $.5 million, $1.5 million, \ndepending on how one wants to calculate the delay. I do not want to \ndelay it. Let's keep in mind, the Senator from Michigan is correct when \nhe said the Army has been preparing to do this for a long time. The \nArmy has downsized in anticipation of having the capability that would \ncome with the Crusader. In a minute I will say it could be the Crusader \nor something that would give us a capability that would certainly \nsatisfy me as just one member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  There are a couple other issues I want to clarify for the record. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania made the statement that with something that \nhas three times the firepower, why don't they lower the expectations as \nto how many platforms they need.\n  I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, at one time they were talking \nabout 1,200 Crusaders. It is now down to 480 Crusaders. That is the \nmost recent. I also say at the same time that the firepower, the rate \nof fire, is not just 3 times greater, it is 10 times greater in terms \nof sustained fire. That is critical. We have already downsized the \nrequest to 480 from 1,200.\n  The cancellation of the Crusader most likely is going to happen. That \nis what the Senator has been saying, and I agree with the Senator from \nMichigan that the Secretary of Defense is\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\nnot going to do that on his own. If he had strong opposition in both \nthe House and the Senate, then there is a process whereby he would have \na difficult time doing that unilaterally, and I believe that is very \nproper. In this case, when you are talking about an alternative system \nthat might accomplish the same thing, this has been the compromise we \nhave been talking about now. The House was not talking about this. They \nwant to go full bore ahead with the Crusader.\n  We have said if what we want to accomplish is to have an artillery \ncapability by 2008, the same year the Crusader would have come on \nboard, it can be done in other ways. I have suggested another way would \nbe to say: Administration, you are right, but we need to get it down \nfrom 40 tons to 20 tons. We need to have something that is going to be \nfaster and lighter, that will still give us some superiority on the \nbattlefield and do it by the same year, 2008. That is a reasonable \nexpectation. I think most of the Senators on the committee would say \nthat would be a good alternative if that were done.\n  In order to do it by 2008--this is something nobody disagrees with--\nit is going to have to be done by using the same people who gave us the \ntechnology we have today, and we are going to have to use the same \ntechnology. To use that, it can be done, but we are going to have to \nconstruct something to allow that to be done. If we do not, and if we \nsay, all right, we are going to open it up for bids at the end of \nmilestone B, for example, then that is going to delay the process for a \nlong time, and most likely that team that gave us the technology of the \nfuture would be dispersed and working elsewhere. So it would be very \ndifficult.\n  The last thing I want to mention is the disagreement I have with the \nstatement of the Senator concerning the dumb bombs. Yes, we need the \nExcalibur, we need to have the MLRS, we need to have all the rocket \ntechnology that goes with it so we can be pinpoint accurate, but when \nit comes to cover, every general and every person in uniform coming \nbefore our committee has said, you have to have that, but you also have \nto have dumb bombs.\n  If Excalibur were fired right now, the cost of that would be $200,000 \nfor a round. It has to be fired out of something. We do not have \nanything to fire it out of right now. We would with the Crusader. We \nwould if we had this alternative we are suggesting so we would be able \nto use it. If we use MLRS, each round is $36,000. That has to be \nconsidered on the battlefield. But if you want to send a bunch of dumb \nbombs to give cover to our troops who are otherwise naked, that can be \ndone for $200 a round.\n  I contend--and I have heard such testimony from those in uniform--\nthat we have to have that capability. If we have to have that \ncapability, we are going to have to have all that capability in one \nunit. That is where FCS comes in. There are about five major components \nof FCS. Sure, the way I want to go would make sure we get the first \ncomponent, the artillery capability, by 2008. To do that, we would have \nto give it some degree of priority; $173 million additional would do \nthat. We have heard that testimony. At the same time, I want the other \ncomponents, too.\n  I will stand here and say, whatever influence I have on this \ncommittee, I am going to use that influence to get the rest of these \ncomponents to reach the Future Combat System that everybody is in \nagreement we want. The only disagreement we have is there are some who \nsay only the Crusader is going to be able to do this. I do not believe \nthat. I think we can do that if we keep the technology and the team \ntogether and do it in another vehicle.\n  Those are the areas I wanted to address. I have to say to my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, I really believe we want the same thing. We want \nthat capability by 2008, and we have ways of getting there. We may have \nto do it in conference. I think the Levin amendment is going to be \nimportant at this point to go ahead and get us in the right posture in \nconference, and I commit to everyone that I will work to achieve that \ngoal that both of us want.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Oklahoma. In \ncommittee, when this issue came up, we were not on the same side of the \nissue. I was clearly supporting the President's request and the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma was not, and I have found that in working with him, he \nhas provided a path out of this very difficult conflict. That is why I \ncompletely agree with the statements he has made, that there is an \nopportunity to try to accomplish everything that I think most members \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee believe need to be accomplished, \nwhich is to have a new system up by 2008, to save money in the Army \nprocurement project, which is badly underfunded, and at the same time \ntransition these technologies we have with the Crusader on to the \nFuture Combat System.\n  From my perspective, it comes down to an issue of money. It comes \ndown to an issue of whether we can find money in 2003, in this budget, \nin this authorization bill, to get together the concept demonstrator we \nneed. Hopefully, we can start this year with 2002 funds and move \nforward with the $173 million for next year. That is not going to be \neasy to do. I am not sure we are going to be able to accomplish this on \nthe Senate floor or we are going to be able to get this agreement. \nMaybe we even should not. Maybe this should be an issue we work out \nwith the House and do it in conference when we have more people who \nwill participate in it.\n  I will say, without the leadership of the Senator from Oklahoma on \nthis issue, I do not think the ability to accomplish all the things I \nlaid out would have been possible. The Senator from Oklahoma and I \nunderstand Fort Sill is in Oklahoma, and I understand a lot of the \nCrusader work was going to be done in Oklahoma. Also, I understand this \nis an issue where the Senator could have come out by saying, I am going \nto go down with the ship on Crusader and I am going to fight for the \nfolks back home in the sense that there are these jobs. But the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, I have found, has always been doing what is in the best \ninterest of the men and women in uniform.\n  What he has proposed is exactly that. It is not a homer kind of \nproposal. It is anything but that. It is a proposal of what is in the \nbest interest of the people who are in uniform, and I commend him for \nhis leadership. I commend him for his innovation. I am hopeful we can \nget our folks from the other side of the Capitol in the House to work \nwith us on this, and hopefully the administration will see the wisdom \nof taking an issue which is very divisive right now and being able to \nturn that very divisive issue, that could be very much a flashpoint, \nconfrontation point that can be very damaging to our men and women in \nuniform, by delaying any system for quite some time, and see this as an \nopportunity to be able to accomplish all we want to accomplish, which \nis to field the system, save the money, and have the capability we need \nto protect our men and women.\n  So I commend the Senator for his leadership and look forward to \nworking on this issue over the next weeks as we finish in the Senate \nand go to conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in order to try to facilitate the \nimportant debate we are having and bring it to some conclusion with \nregard to the desires of the chairman to have votes, the chairman and I \nhave discussed the following, and we would like to entertain thoughts \nfrom others: That the amendment of the Senator from Virginia in the \nsecond degree would be accepted by the chairman. He would presumably so \nstate. We then proceed to a rollcall vote on the chairman's underlying \namendment.\n  However, the distinguished Republican leader, Mr. Nickles, is engaged \nin something that is important he complete. I understand he can be \npresent by 2 p.m. because he, likewise, wishes to address this issue. \nSo on the assumption he can be present between 2 p.m. and 2:10 and that \nhis remarks would take no more than 15 minutes, could either the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma or the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania indicate to me, and therefore to the chairman, a reason we \nshould not then go to a vote shortly after the conclusion of the \nremarks by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Virginia yield?\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. What we want to do, as I indicated, is to have the vote at \n2 p.m. Senator Nickles, who is vitally interested in this matter, \nwishes to speak. We now have a chance and are preparing a unanimous \nconsent request to give Senator Nickles whatever time he needs and vote \nfollowing his remarks.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. OK.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, first, yes, that would be \nacceptable to me. Quite frankly, I would like the Levin amendment \nwithout the second degree. It gives the administration and our \ncommittees more authority than without the amendment. However, I \ncertainly would accept that and would want to agree to the votes.\n  My senior Senator from Oklahoma is here now and mentioned he wanted \nto be heard.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I ask the Senator from Virginia, and I \ndirect the question to the Senator from Oklahoma, we were going to have \nyou speak at 2 o'clock for a half hour; Is the Senator ready to give \nhis remarks now?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. Could the Senator be finished by 2 p.m.?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Definitely.\n  Mr. REID. We will have the staff look over the unanimous consent \nrequest and have a vote at 2 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague from Nevada. I am \npleased we will vote soon on the Levin amendment which I strongly \nsupport. I understand it will be modified by the Warner amendment, \nwhich is also acceptable to this Senator. I am not positive we needed \nit, but we want to make the administration happy.\n  What is most important is we provide our men and women in the \nmilitary, in any branch, in any division, with quality equipment, equal \nto or superior to our competitors. I hate to say this, but it happens \nto be factual. We are not superior to our adversaries or potential \nadversaries when it comes to artillery.\n  Fort Sill is the home of the artillery training base for the Army. A \ncouple of weeks ago I visited the base, as I have done several times. I \nsat in the Paladin, our latest artillery weapon, and fired it with our \nmen and women who were operating the cannon. I realized and was \nembarrassed at how obsolete it is. The chassis, the basic framework of \nthe wheeled vehicle that they were using, was built in the early 1960s. \nThe cannon was also loaded exactly as it was in the early 1960s. In \nfact, the cannon is loaded the same way Napoleon was loading cannons.\n  I was surprised, dismayed, and more than convinced we need to upgrade \nthe system. The Crusader serves as an update that modernizes the \nsystem. The Crusader has a mechanized, automated loading system. The \nPaladin came online in 1994, as if it was a new system. The chassis and \nthe loading mechanism is identical to what we had in the early 1960s. \nIt is the same method and mechanism during the time of Napoleon and the \nCivil War. The individual would manually load the projectile, which in \nthis system 155 millimeters looks like a big bullet. It is very \nawkward, very heavy, very cumbersome, and weighs about 100 pounds. It \nis manually lifted from the floor or off a rack, inserted on a loading \ndevice, and shoved into the barrel. Then they shove in some packing, \nbasically an explosive device, similar to powder. They shove it in \nmanually behind the projectile. They close the breech. They put in a \nfiring pin with a cord and yank it. It explodes and they open the \nbreech. They take a sponge and they swab the inside of the barrel to \nmake sure it is still not hot and will not have another premature \ndetonation.\n  That is the same method used in the Civil War. The first couple \nrounds they might be able to do about three a minute. After a couple of \nminutes, they can only do about one a minute because the barrel gets \npretty hot and they have to wear gas masks if they do very many because \nthey are in a closed environment and get exhaust fumes. If these masks \nare not worn, the fumes can be hazardous to the health of the women and \nmen operating the machines. In other words, this system is very \nobsolete. It needs to be replaced.\n  I started looking at our competitors. Not one country, not two \ncountries, several countries have a more efficient and more effective \nsystem.\n  I am not chairman of the Armed Services Committee and I have not \nserved on that committee. I have great respect for Senators Levin, \nWarner, and Inhofe, but I cannot think of any major weapons system \nwhere we are behind several countries in quality of equipment. I don't \nwant to find our planes are inferior to any other country. I don't want \nto find our ships are inferior to any other country. I don't want to \nfind our intelligence capability is behind any country. I don't want to \nfind our weapons, our guns, our cannons inferior to any country.\n  Unfortunately, in this case, our cannons are inferior. There are six \ncountries that have greater capability in what I call ground support \nand cannons than we do. Britain, South Africa, Russia, China, Germany \nall have cannon artillery systems superior to ours, some in refiring \ncapability, some in accuracy, some in speed.\n  We need a new system. The Army recognized this for a long time and \ncame up with the Crusader. The Crusader is far superior to every system \nI mentioned. The administration decided to cancel the Crusader. I don't \nagree with that decision. They made the decision that we needed \nsomething lighter. I can go with that as long as we still have a \nsuperior system to other countries, to our potential competitors and \neven our allies. I don't want our systems inferior to the Germans, \nSouth Africans--although they are allies--the Russians, and the \nChinese. I want us No. 1 militarily. You don't want to be in military \nconflict and find you are a close second. That is not good enough.\n  We need a superior system. The Crusader would be that. I know some \nare talking about maybe scaling down the Crusader. The Crusader was \noriginally 80 tons, and now 62, and now going to 40 tons. Some are \nsaying, see if we cannot take it down to 25, 27, or maybe 18 tons. I \ndon't know if that is possible or not. I hope it can be. I would love \nto see the Crusader be more mobile, wider, able to be deployed more \nrapidly in regions far and away, maybe in Afghanistan or other areas. I \nwould like to see the capability of this machine enhanced.\n  However, I want to make sure our men and women, if they use this \nsystem and it is superior, that it is safe, it is not a death vehicle \nor one where their lives might be jeopardized. It remains to be seen if \nwe can preserve this level of safety in a future combat system. The \nLevin amendment modified by the Warner amendment, allows us to \naccomplish something very important by taking this $475 million and \nsaying it will not be in the Crusader. Or we could keep that option as \nthe Crusader. But we are going to use these funds to closely support a \nfire system capable of protecting our men and women.\n\n  We are going to be consulting the Army, individuals who have \nexperience and expertise in this--which, frankly, was not done in the \ndecisionmaking process as far as canceling the Crusader. It is \nunfortunate that they were not consulted. I am offended by that \nprocess.\n  I hope the administration in the future will say if they are going to \nbe canceling the system they will contact the Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, former Chief of Staff of the Army, the Secretary of the Army, and \nlisten to their advice. That did not happen in this case.\n  Senator Levin was talking about how this would be reversed. You might \nremember a few months ago the administration had money for the Crusader \nin their budget. Now they have stated they are opposed to it.\n  We need to come up with something better. Regardless of what the \nreplacement may be, I want our military men and women to have a \nsuperior system that far exceeds what they have right now. I do not \nwant our men and women being trained in vehicles, in cannons that are \ninferior to anybody's. Period. That is the bottom line. It is not who \ndoes the contracting. It is not who makes it. It is not where they are \ntrained, not where it is fired, not where it is deployed. Our men and \nwomen have to have the best. Right now we do not have the best.\n  Under the Levin-Warner amendment, we are going to take that $475 \nmillion and, yes, we are going to have reprogramming capability, or \nconsultation, the Secretary can have his ability to change it, and we \nhave 30 days to review it, and it is going to be used for\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\nfire support. Presumably, we are going to come up with a better system \nthan we have right now. This is what I expect to be done.\n  I don't want to find out our men and women are still training in \ninferior systems 20 years from now. If we do not move fairly quickly, \nthat is exactly what they will be doing. Even if we stayed with the \nCrusader, that was going to be online in the year 2008, 5 or 6 years \nfrom now. The future combat system Senator Inhofe and others have \ntalked about can be on line in 2008. We need to be moving forward on \nthis rapidly. There is not a lot of time to waste, not when you think \nwe could be jeopardizing the lives of our men and women.\n  Somebody said maybe we don't need cannons, we can rely on air support \npower. That is not accurate. Talk to anybody in the military. Do you \nneed an army with tanks and guns? Yes. Do you need an army with weapons \nfor potential combat systems and close fire support? The answer is \nalways yes. Can the air always do it? No. Can the multiple-launch \nrocket system do it? Not always. Sometimes it can from greater \ndistances, but not close-in, not when you are talking about a few \nhundred yards, not when you are talking about a mile, not when you are \ntalking about real close-in support.\n  We need a cannon. We need close-in support. This $475 million \nreprogramming capability is for a future combat system. It could be \ncalled Crusader 2; it could be called Crusader 3. We have reduced the \nweight of the Crusader from 80 tons to 40 tons and still call it the \nCrusader. Now we are talking about taking it from 40 tons to 20-some \ntons. If that can do the job while having automatic load capability, \nhave superior user accuracy, have the speed to stay up with our tanks \nand armored personnel carriers--which right now we cannot do--if we can \ncome up with a lighter and more mobile system that can still protect \nour troops and provide the fire support that is so necessary--great. I \nwill strongly support it.\n\n  I hope and expect the reprogramming and the Army intelligence and \nArmy experts in this field will come up with a system that will work. \nBut they need to do it quickly. I hope and expect the leaders on both \nthe Armed Services Committee in the Senate and in the House will work \nto make sure that happens.\n  Presently, relying on the existing system is just not satisfactory. \nIt is not satisfactory for this Senator. I do not think it would be \nsatisfactory for the Department of Defense, either.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work to keep this money in artillery \nand in close fire support.\n  I also compliment my friend and colleague, Senator Inhofe, for his \nleadership. No one has invested more time on defense issues that I am \naware of, with maybe the possible exception of Senator Warner, than \nSenator Inhofe on this committee. And no one has invested more time in \nsupport of the Army than Senator Inhofe.\n  I also wish to compliment Congressman J.C. Watts because, likewise, \nhe has invested an enormous amount of time trying to make sure making \nsure our men and women in the Army have the best artillery around, not \njust protecting the jobs in Oklahoma. I think both Congressman Watts \nand Senator Inhofe are to be congratulated for their leadership, trying \nto make sure the Army as well as the Navy and Air Force and Marines \nhave equipment superior to any potential adversary we might confront.\n  I am happy to support the Levin amendment, modified by Senator \nWarner. I urge my colleagues to adopt it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to make a unanimous consent \nrequest, just for the information of our colleagues. I ask unanimous \nconsent the time until 2 p.m. today be for debate with respect to the \npending Levin and Warner amendments, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form, and at 2 p.m. the second-degree amendment \nbe agreed to, and without further intervening action or debate the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the Levin amendment, as amended, \nwith no other amendments in order prior to the disposition of the Levin \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that will be fine. I would like to make sure \nthat before 2 o'clock Senator Dayton has 5 minutes. That should be no \nproblem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota was assured of \nat least 5 minutes. I do not know if this time is divided equally or \nnot, but whatever time I have remaining, I yield 5 minutes of that time \nto the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I inquire as to the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that I might have 10 minutes to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, reserving the right to object, we are going to \nvote at 2; is that correct? I did want 3 or 4 minutes to speak on this \nissue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had a lot of people talking. We \ncertainly want the Senator from Alabama to have his time to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote be extended until 5 after 2; \nthat all the same orders will be in effect but for the 5 minutes, and \nthat the Senator from Minnesota be given 10 minutes and the Senator \nfrom Alabama, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Nevada \nfor the accommodation. I thank the Senator from Alabama as well.\n  Mr. President, I want to start by expressing my appreciation and \nadmiration to the chairman of our Armed Services Committee, on which I \nam privileged to serve along with the Senator from Michigan, and \nranking member, the Senator from Virginia. Both of them have been \noutstanding mentors and role models for me in the Senate.\n  The legislation which has been brought forward has my full support as \na member of the committee.\n  I note that the President proposed $396 billion for national defense \nfor the 2003 budget, a 20-percent increase in spending over the last 2 \nyears.\n  Is my understanding that the committee, which has been working very \nmuch on a bipartisan basis, provides after adjustments for the civilian \nand military retirement dollars, essentially the full amount that the \nPresident requested for all activities. It reflects the bipartisan \nsupport this committee has for strengthening our national defense--even \nbefore the tragic events of September 11, and certainly thereafter. As \nI said, it involves a very sizable increase in spending. It is \nsupported by this Senator, and by Senators on both sides of the aisle--\nin our committee and on the floor.\n  There are other aspects of the bill that I would like to address at a \nsubsequent time. But given the spirit of cooperation and support that \nhas been evidenced, in my view, consistently by the committee, by the \nchairman of the committee, and by its members to undertake these \nincreases and improvements on a cooperative basis--frankly, as others \nhave noted--the procedures by which the Crusader budget has been \nproposed to be eliminated is an unfortunate exception. As I say, it is \none that strikes me as really not warranted by the actions of the \ncommittee in any way whatsoever.\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\n  The President submitted a budget proposal to the Congress on February \n4 and called for $475.6 million to continue in the development of the \nCrusader. No cutbacks were proposed. There were no reservations \nexpressed about the project. The Crusader is on time, it is on budget, \nand it is to specifications. In the simulated tests so far, it has been \nright on target.\n  In the committee hearings, which the Armed Services Committee held \nquite extensively about the President's proposal for the year 2003, no \nreservations were expressed by anyone--not by the Secretary of Defense, \nnor the Deputy Secretary of Defense, nor the Joint Chiefs of Staff, nor \nthe military commanders. In fact, it was just the opposite. There was \nstrong and unqualified support for the commander.\n  I have asked a number of military leaders who have come to my office, \nand the incoming and outgoing Chiefs of Staff in Europe. I was at the \nNational Training Center in California last year, and I asked tank \ncommanders what they thought of the Crusader. They were unanimously \nenthusiastic about the Crusader. They were unanimously emphatic about \nthe need for the Crusader to strengthen our artillery.\n  The Secretary of the Army expressed similar support for those same \nreasons in testimony before the committee. We received testimony in \nMarch of this year before the committee by the Army Vice Chief of \nStaff. As reported in Defense Week the next day--on March 18 of this \nyear--he said ground forces attacking in Afghanistan could have used \nthe Crusader to pound al-Quaida redoubts in the mountains near Gardez. \nGeneral Keane told the panel on Thursday that, unlike some air-\ndelivered munitions, poor weather would not have stopped the Crusader's \nprecision fire. General Keane said they could have used the Crusader \nfor support of troops attacking in the mountains and have gotten the \nresponse of artillery fire at considerable range and distance they \ncould not with any of their other systems.\n\n  He went on to say if the Army had the Crusader today--meaning in \nMarch, in Afghanistan--perhaps three or four of them could have been \nused there. He said they could have kept the Crusader within the range \noutside of the immediate battle areas in secure areas. He said the \nPaladin, by contrast, would have to be positioned closer to the \nmountains and would need more forces to protect it.\n  To give Senator Inhofe and colleagues on that subcommittee a sense of \nthe Crusader's range and precision, General Keane said they could put \nit within the beltway outside of Washington, fire it in the air, and \nhit homeplate in Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n  After hearing all of this testimony and this unqualified support, the \ncommittee began its markup of the military budget and Department of \nDefense request. After about a week of rumors and innuendos, contrary \nrumors and denials of all of that, we received on the morning of the \nfinal markup session of the committee--on May 8 of this year--a copy of \na letter from Mr. Daniels, Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, to the majority leader, Senator Daschle, informing him of the \nadministration's decision to terminate the Crusader. We received \nnothing--this Senator received nothing--from the Secretary of Defense, \nand, as far as I know, no formal communication to the committee from \nthe Department of Defense. It was treated as though it was a budget \nadjustment. Since then, there has been this presumption that, of \ncourse, the committee will approve the administration's change of mind. \nOf course, we will all just reverse our course upon command. Of course, \nwe will just disregard all of the expert testimony we received over the \nlast months. Of course, we will disregard whatever research we have \ndone individually. And we will disregard our own views on the \nimportance of this program, and we will just follow into a lockstep by \npirouette 4 months after the budget has been submitted. Sixteen months \nafter taking office, the administration has figured out what it wants \nto do about this program--no consultation or discussion with members of \nthe committee, at least not with this Senator and most of the others \nwith whom I talked.\n  We were told in testimony that no consultation nor forewarning was \ngiven to the chairman and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nnor with the Chief of Staff of the Army, nor with commanders in \ntheaters such as Korea and Europe.\n  I am very much concerned and alarmed about the failure, if that is \nthe case--and it has not been refuted--to communicate and to consult \nwith the military leadership of this country.\n  Today, I heard that we are to be held responsible for delays--any \ndelays toward wasting taxpayers' money, if we haven't already approved \nof this proposed change. It costs $500,000 a day. That is the number I \nheard. That certainly is one that we not spend lightly.\n  We are proposing to approve a budget of over $1 billion a day on \nnational defense for fiscal year 2003--over $1 billion of taxpayers' \nmoney every day. We are going to use that money to defend our borders \nand our country. We are going to use that money to protect America's \ninterests, our influence, our values, and our way of life--and all over \nthe world. Ultimately and specifically, we are going to use that money \nto send American men and women--young men and women, in most cases--to \nplaces such as Afghanistan, far away, and put them right on the line \nwith their lives and families and children left behind. We owe it to \nthem to have them know they are going into those conditions with every \npossible advantage, means of force, means of domination, and with a \nmeans of coming home alive having accomplished their mission \nsuccessfully on behalf of our country.\n  I was in Afghanistan, along with some of my colleagues, in January. \nWe had lunch with members of the Armed Forces who are, as I say, young, \ndedicated, and enthusiastic. They gave up jobs. Those who are in the \nReserves voluntarily came out and are standing up for and fighting for \nour country.\n  When I get General Keane's testimony that the Crusader would make a \ndifference in protecting their lives, then I say that is the \nconsideration, that is the sole consideration, the overriding \nconsideration in whether or not to continue with Crusader.\n  Before this Senate decides and before this country decides to abandon \nthat system, I want to be assured--I want to be guaranteed--that we are \ngoing to have comparable firepower coming to their protection and their \ndefense when needed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The time of the Senator from \nMinnesota has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the underlying amendment offered by \nSenator Levin, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection for it being in order to \nask for the yeas and nays on the first-degree amendment at this time?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Levin and Senator \nWarner, Senator Inhofe, Senator Nickles, and Senator Dayton, who just \nspoke, for the work they have done to try to reach an agreement on the \nCrusader system that we can all live with and is the right thing to do. \nI believe we have made steps in that direction. I am proud to support \nthis amendment.\n  Let me just say a couple things about it.\n  I am a strong believer in doing what we need to do to defend our \nsoldiers and to defend our interests around the world. I did conclude \nthat the administration was correct that the $11 billion projected on \nthe Crusader was not the wisest investment of that $11 billion. It is \nnot considered to be a part of our Future Combat System that we look to \nestablish. It is an interim weapon system. It would drain $11 billion \nthat could help us create the Future Combat System that we are all \nstriving to achieve.\n  You have to make tough decisions. That is what we pay the Secretary \nof Defense to do. It is not an easy call. A lot of people believed in \nthis system and supported it for years and years. But we cannot expect \nthem, just on a dime, to come in--generals and so forth, our Defense \nDepartment officials and contractors--and to now say: Oh, yes, we need \nto cancel it.\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\n  That is why it is tough. But the Secretary of Defense understands \nthese issues deeply and wrestled with them. They said they wished it \ncould have been done smoother and maybe with more notice. Perhaps not \nquite as jerky in the process.\n  Well, everybody knew, and had known for a long time, that the \nDepartment of Defense was examining the Crusader system very closely. \nEverybody knew that many believed it was not the wisest use of $11 \nbillion. I am glad they made the call. It is a tough call, and I \nbelieve it is the right call.\n  I note, for example, many have cited it as a good weapon that could \nbe utilized in Korea where we do face a large number of tanks by the \nNorth Koreans, and that it might be utilized in that kind of combat. \nBut I note that the Army states their intent is not to even deploy the \nCrusader to Korea. It would not be on the ground in Korea. It would be \nmaintained in the United States as part of a Counterattack Corps. So it \nis not the kind of weapon we would be normally deploying in situations \nwhere you would expect we could have a pretty violent conflict that \ncould occur. I think we are doing the right thing. I believe the \nadministration deserves credit for that.\n\n  The administration also had to deal with some tough choices about \nfunding. We know we are not going to continue to see the kind of \nincreases that President Bush has fought for in the last 2 years in the \nDefense budget as we go along. We know these are not going to be \nsustained.\n  We had a $48 billion increase this year. A lot of that had to go for \nthe pay, retirement, and health care benefits we promised our men and \nwomen in uniform and our retirees. But we do know that we have to spend \nsome more money on capital, moving us to the Future Combat System, \nbuying the new equipment that will transform us, continually, to \nmaintain the greatest military force in the world.\n  One of the things we have to be honest about is that by 2008, 2009 or \n2010, we are going to be facing a train wreck in expenditures. We have \nthe V-22 Osprey coming on line, the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-22, \nother programs that have been in the works for many years, all of which \nare going to be hitting about that time period.\n  If we are not going to be able to sustain all of those weapons \nsystems, do we wait until 2006, 2005--after we have spent billions of \ndollars on them--to then decide we cannot complete them and that \nsomething else on line is better? I think not. The sooner we do it the \nbetter.\n  Let me just mention that the budget submitted by the Defense \nDepartment to use the money that would not be spent for Crusader are \ninvestments in strengthening the Army's capability and, indeed, are the \nbudget items that the Army requested if they did not have the Crusader.\n  They include $57 million for a Netfires missile system that could be \neffective for our troops on the battlefield; $195.5 million on indirect \nfire for the objective force--our objective that we seek to establish--\n$48.3 million for the Excalibur advanced system; $11.4 million for the \ntactical unmanned aerial vehicles--we need more unmanned aerial \nvehicles--$10.8 million for precision-guided mortar munitions--they \nwould be precision guided instead of the indirect fire mortar weapons \nwe have today. That can be done, and we can achieve that. They also \ninclude the guided multiple launch rockets that are precision guided; \nhigh-mobility artillery rocket systems; the Abrams tank engine, and \nother items that the Army requested.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank our leaders, Senator Levin and Senator \nWarner. I believe we are on the right track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Alabama has \nexpired.\n  All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, amendment No. 3900, offered by the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Warner, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3900) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3912\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, Senator Warner and I will now offer an amendment that \npermits retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-\nconnected disability to receive both military retirement pay earned \nthrough years of military service and disability compensation from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs based on their disability.\n  We offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Harry Reid, who has been \nthe leader in the Senate on this issue, Senator Bob Smith, who raised \nthis issue in our committee markup, and on behalf of the Armed Services \nCommittee. This is a committee amendment.\n  In the bill itself, before this amendment is even considered, there \nis a provision that we adopted in committee that goes a long way toward \naddressing an issue that many of us have been concerned about for a \nlong time--the inability of military retirees to draw their full \nretirement pay if they are receiving compensation from the Department \nof Veterans Affairs for a service-connected disability. We believe they \nare entitled to both.\n  The language that is already in the bill was limited by the funding \nallocation that was available to us. We got about half the job done in \nthe bill, but we are now offering this amendment which will finish this \nequitable assignment that many of us have taken on.\n  We believe we should authorize full concurrent receipt for these \ndeserving veteran retirees, and the amendment that we offer will do \nthat.\n  We did not do the whole job in the bill because we did not want to \nmake our bill subject to a point of order. We had a certain allocation \nof mandatory spending for this. We used it. That is the amount that is \nin the bill, and that is why in the bill we provide the concurrent \nreceipt of military retirement pay and veterans disability compensation \nby military retirees with service-connected disabilities that are rated \nat 60 percent disability or higher. That used up the allocation we had. \nBut many of us believe, and the committee believes, that we should do \nthis for all disabled military retirees. This amendment will do that.\n  If there is a point of order raised, we hope it will be waived. We \ndid not want to make our entire bill subject to a point of order, so we \ndivided it into two pieces.\n  Under the provision in the bill, the amount of retirement pay would \nbe\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\nphased in over a 5-year period beginning with 30 percent of the \notherwise authorized retirement pay in 2003 and increasing to 45 \npercent in 2004, 60 percent in 2005, 80 percent in 2006 and 100 percent \nin 2007.\n  Again, the provision already in the bill was drafted very \nspecifically to limit the cost to comply with the mandatory funding \nallocation that is contained in the budget resolution reported by the \nSenate Budget Committee. The language in the bill itself is not enough, \nin the judgment of the committee.\n  It is unfair to limit concurrent receipt of retired pay and \ndisability compensation to military retirees with a disability rated at \n60 percent or more. We cannot differentiate equitably and fairly from \nthose retirees who are 50 percent disabled, 40 percent disabled, or 30 \npercent disabled. They have all been disabled through their military \nservice to our Nation. It is also unfair to delay the receipt of full \ncompensation for 5 years. They are overdue for full compensation now. \nWe are losing 1,500 veterans per day in this country, and we should act \nnow.\n  I first commend Senator Harry Reid for his absolute commitment to \nthis issue, to resolving this inequity, to addressing this unfairness. \nYear after year he has eloquently and passionately persuaded this body \nto act in this way. He has succeeded in doing so. We have not been able \nto get this through conference. We are determined to make this effort \nagain.\n  I also note that during the committee markup of this bill, Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire proposed an amendment which would have permitted \nfull concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans' \ndisability compensation by all retirees eligible for nondisability \nretirement who have a service-connected disability, no matter what the \ndisability rating was.\n  Again, because this amendment of Senator Smith would have put our \nentire bill in violation of the budget resolution that was reported by \nthe Budget Committee, we asked Senator Smith to allow this amendment to \nbe offered on behalf of the committee when the bill reached the floor. \nThis would allow the full Senate to decide this issue. By majority \nvote, the committee agreed to this course of action, and this is the \namendment we are offering at this time.\n  The amendment we offer is essentially the same as S. 170, which is a \nbill initially introduced by Senator Reid of Nevada, who has been, \nagain, the true leader in this effort in the Senate. The Senate passed \nthis provision last year. Again, we were not able to bring it out of \nconference. We fought for this provision to the very end of the \nconference last year. It was one of the last two issues that were \nresolved in the conference between the Senate and the House. The House \nsimply refused to accept our provision, and we finally had to reach an \nagreement if we were going to have a Defense Authorization bill last \nyear.\n  We were able to enhance the special compensation last year in \nconference for the most severely disabled retirees, and pass a \nprovision on the condition that the President propose, and the Congress \nenact, legislation that would offset the costs of the initiative. The \nPresident did not propose that offsetting legislation, so the Senate \nonce again is taking the initiative to right this wrong.\n  Senator Reid's bill, S. 170, now has 81 cosponsors in the Senate. The \nHouse companion bill, H.R. 303, has 395 cosponsors. Senator Cleland, \nand Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, the chair and ranking member of the \nPersonnel Subcommittee, have been strong advocates for this bill. The \noverwhelming support in both the House and the Senate for these two \nbills is a clear indication we simply should not settle for the limited \nprovision in the bill as reported by the committee.\n  Enactment of this amendment would remove an injustice to disabled \nmilitary retirees. Military retirement pay and disability compensation \nwere earned and awarded for different purposes. Military retirement pay \nis awarded for a career of service to our Nation in the Armed Forces. \nDisability compensation is awarded to compensate a veteran for an \ninjury incurred in the line of duty. It is unfair for military \nretirees, who have earned both payments, not to receive them \nconcurrently. Veterans injured in the line of duty, who leave military \nservice and then serve a career as a Federal civilian employee, do not \nhave to forfeit any of their Federal civilian retired pay to receive \ntheir VA disability compensation.\n  I hope the Senate will adopt this committee amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I send our amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration on behalf of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3912.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide alternative authority on concurrent receipt of \nmilitary retired pay and veterans' disability compensation for service-\n                      connected disabled veterans)\n\n       Strike section 641, relating to phased-in authority for \n     concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans' \n     disability compensation for certain service-connected \n     disabled veterans, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 641.

Mr. President, I join with Senator Levin, Senator Smith, \nSenator Hutchinson, and Senator Reid in offering this amendment to S. \n2514.\n  The committee included in the bill a provision--section 641--that, \nover the next 5 years, would phase in elimination of the current \ndollar-for-dollar offset of military retired pay and veterans' \ndisability pay for those military retirees most severely in need--that \nis, those who have been determined by the Veterans' Administration to \nbe 60 percent or more disabled. I compliment Senator Cleland, Senator \nHutchinson, Senator Smith and the members of the Personnel Subcommittee \non bringing forward this timely, focused relief. The\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\nprovision in the underlying bill was drafted to be consistent with the \ndirect spending funding allocation contained in the budget resolution \nreported by the Budget Committee.\n  But as the leaders of the subcommittee would readily acknowledge, \nmore needs to be done. During the full committee markup, Senator Smith \nof New Hampshire proposed an amendment that would implement full \nconcurrent receipt immediately. This initiative, I note, is consistent \nwith S. 170, the legislation spearheaded by Senators Reid and \nHutchinson, which, at this point, has over 80 consponsors in the \nSenate. It also is similar to the legislation that Senator Reid, \nSenator Hutchinson and I introduced in March of this year, S. 2051, the \nRetired Pay Restoration Act of 2002, which sought to eliminate the \nconditions for implementation of full concurrent receipt previously \nincluded in last year's conference report.\n  However, many, many of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, \nhave joined in seeking to end this injustice impacting disabled \nmilitary retirees. Our shared goal? To ensure that an important class \nof disabled veterans--military retirees who have incurred service \nconnected physical or mental disability--are fairly and appropriately \ncompensated by the nation they served so well.\n  The administration has taken a very different view on this issue. In \nfairness, I think the Senate should be aware of the Statement of \nAdministration Policy on the underlying bill, which we received this \nmorning and which addresses the issue before the Senate.\n  This document states that the President's senior advisors will \nrecommend a veto if either section 641 or the proposed amendment before \nus now that would fully implement concurrent receipt is included.\n  I do not believe there is any member of this Senate who would assert \nthat military retired pay adequately compensates a severely disabled, \nretirement-eligible service member who is appropriately rated by the \nVeterans' Administration for service connected injuries and disability. \nPerhaps, over a century ago, when the military retirement system was in \nits infancy, the legislation requiring the offset accurately reflected \nthe legislative intent of the members. That is not the case today. The \nnumber of cosponsors for legislation that would repeal this law \nillustrates that it no longer expresses the will of the Congress. It is \nour responsibility to take appropriation action. We can not and should \nnot wait any longer for this to happen.\n  Before concluding, I want to recognize and thank the many veterans \ngroups in The Military Coalition who have been unwavering in their \nsupport for this legislation. I have met with and listened closely to \nrepresentatives from several of these organizations about their \nconcerns about concurrent receipt, and I particularly want to recognize \nthe American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Fleet Reserve \nAssociation, the Retired Officers Association, the Retired Enlisted \nAssociation, the Non Commissioned Officers Association, the National \nGuard Association of the United States, the Enlisted National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, the Disabled American Veterans, \nAmerican Veterans of World War II, Korean and Vietnam AMVETS, the \nAssociation of the United States Army, the National Military Family \nAssociation, the Air Force Sergeants Association, and the Vietnam \nVeterans of America for their support.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my \nranking member, Senator Warner, and Chairman Levin for their \noutstanding work on this bill and achieving a compromise which would \nallow us to bring to the floor this legislation that would provide \ncompensation for all veterans, not just a small number of them. It was \na difficult situation to deal with, and they handled it beautifully.\n  I also thank my friend and colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, for \nbeing the lead sponsor, the originator, of S. 170, which provides full \ncompensation for all veterans, no matter what the percentage of \ndisability. I am pleased and proud to have been a cosponsor of that \nlegislation. I also thank Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas for his \nleadership as well on this issue.\n  There are many Senators who have been involved in this legislation \nand who have worked tirelessly on behalf of veterans over the years, \nbut it has been a long and difficult road. Every time I talk to \nveterans, veterans will tell me they have been waiting and waiting for \nthis and they do not understand why the high numbers of cosponsorships \non the bills to provide this full compensation do not yield in the end, \nafter all the conference committees are finished, the passing of the \nlegislation. I think now we are going to see that happen finally.\n  My support for this legislation goes back to being a freshman \nCongressman in 1985, when a Congressman by the name of Mike Bilirakis \nof Florida had this legislation in the hopper. Concurrent receipt has \nthe support of just about every veterans organization in the country. I \nhave several letters from the American Legion, the VFW, the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, the Military Coalition, the Retired Enlisted \nAssociation, the Retired Officers Association, and even a letter from \nthe New Hampshire House of Representatives. I ask unanimous consent \nthat these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: The American Legion adamantly opposes Section \n     19 of House Concurrent Resolution 83 entitled: Concurrent \n     Retirement and Disability Benefits to Retired members of the \n     Armed Forces. This imprudent section requires the Secretary \n     of Defense to evaluate ``the existing standards for the \n     provision of concurrent retirement and disability benefits to \n     retired members of the Armed Forces and the need to change \n     these standards.''\n       This ill-advised section does not properly state the intent \n     of H.R. 303 and S. 170: To amend title 10, United States \n     Code, to permit retired members of the Armed Forces, who have \n     a service-connected disability, to receive both military \n     retired pay by reason of their years of military service and \n     disability compensation from the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs for their disability.\n       The Congressional Research Service, The Library of \n     Congress, completed an extensive report in April 7, 1995 \n     entitled: Military Retirement and Veterans' Compensation: \n     Current Receipt issues. This report is straightforward and \n     clearly addresses both sides of this debate. That probably \n     explains why both H.R. 303 and S. 170 continue to enjoy such \n     overwhelming bipartisan support. Today, 35 Senators and 287 \n     Representatives are steadfast cosponsors.\n       The American Legion adamantly supports legislation and \n     funding to permit retired members of the Armed Forces, who \n     also have a service-connected disability recognized by VA, to \n     receive both military retired pay and disability \n     compensation. Military retirees are the only retired Federal \n     employees who must offset their retired pay (dollar-for-\n     dollar) with VA disability compensation awarded them. \n     Penalizing military retirees for choosing to serve their \n     country for 20 or more years is not only an injustice to \n     those who have served, but also a tremendous deterrent to \n     those who may be considering a military career.\n       The American Legion strongly recommends the final Budget \n     Resolution include funding to pay for concurrent receipt \n     because it is the right thing to do. Thank you for your \n     continued leadership and support of veterans, especially the \n     service-connected, and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Steve A. Robertson,\n     Director, National Legislative Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    The Retired Enlisted Association--The Concurrent Receipt Debate\n\n\n              what is the ``concurrent receipt'' problem?\n\n       ``Concurrent Receipt'' refers to the dual receipt of \n     military retired pay and VA disability. Presently, a military \n     retiree must offset, dollar for dollar, from their retired \n     pay the amount they are receiving in VA Disability \n     Compensation.\n\n\n          what legislation is pending to correct this problem?\n\n       There are currently several bills pending before Congress, \n     which would work to correct this inequity by eliminating the \n     offset. That legislation is the following:\n       HR 44 (106th Congress), by Rep. Bilirakis (R-FL) provides \n     limited authority for concurrent payment of retired pay and \n     veterans' disability compensation for certain disabled \n     veterans. Was referred to Committee on National Security and \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs. This bill is similar to HR \n     303 and HR 65 with a smaller benefit for certain disabled \n     retirees. For disability rated as total--$300 per month; 90 \n     percent disability--$200 per month; 70 or 80 percent \n     disabled--$100 per month. Disability must have been granted \n     within 4 years of retirement date. This bill is a partial \n     measure to correct the concurrent receipt inequity. TREA \n     continues to support full receipt of retired pay\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\n     and veterans' disability compensation. Passed in FY 2000 \n     National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n       HR 303 (106th Congress), by Rep. Bilirakis (R-FL) to permit \n     retired members who have service-connected disabilities to \n     receive compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     concurrently with retired pay, without deduction from either.\n       S 2357 (106th Congress), by Sen. Reid (D-NV) to permit \n     retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-\n     connected disability to receive military pay concurrently \n     with veterans' disability compensation.\n       The Senate version of the FY 2001 NDAA included Sen. Reid's \n     amendment, however, the final conference report did not \n     include full concurrent receipt. The FY 2001 NDAA did include \n     a provision for Chapter 61 (Military Disabled Retired) with \n     20 or more year's service to receive the same special \n     compensation benefit as non-disabled retirees within 4 years \n     of retirement date. The effective date of payment is October \n     1, 2001.\n       Rep. Bilirakis has introduced HR 303 and Sen. Reid has \n     introduced S. 170 in the 107th Congress to completely \n     eliminate the offset. The House Bill currently has 192 co-\n     sponsors and the Senate Bill has 20 co-sponsors.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, February 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The Military Coalition, a consortium of \n     nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans \n     organizations, representing more than 5.5 million members, \n     plus their families and survivors, is grateful to you for \n     introducing S. 170--a bill to ease the inequity of the \n     current law that reduces uniformed servicemembers' earned \n     retired pay by any amount of disability compensation they \n     receive from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The current \n     100 percent offset imposes a very discriminatory penalty, \n     especially for those whose disability severely limits their \n     post-service earnings potential.\n       S. 170 would correct the current inequity whereby disabled \n     uniformed services retirees are forced to fund their own \n     disability compensation from their own retired pay. The \n     Military Coalition strongly agrees with you that each of \n     these compensation elements is earned in its own right--\n     retired pay for a career of arduous service in uniform and \n     disability compensation for pain and suffering and lost \n     future earnings resulting from service-connected \n     disabilities.\n       In many cases, members with decades of uniformed service \n     are forced to forfeit most or all of their military retired \n     pay to receive the same disability compensation paid to a \n     similarly disabled member with relatively few years of \n     service. This unfairly denies any compensation value for \n     their decades of service and sacrifice in the uniform of \n     their country.\n       In the last two years, Congress has enacted legislation \n     authorizing special compensation for certain severely \n     disabled retirees. This was a small but important first step \n     in recognizing the difference between a retirement for an \n     extended career of service and compensation for a disability \n     incurred as a result of such service. Your sponsorship of S. \n     170 this year takes this important issue the next, and final, \n     step.\n       We understand the cost of S. 170 is significant. But we \n     believe strongly that fair compensation for America's \n     disabled retirees is also a significant issue--one that has \n     been long overdue. The Military Coalition will be most \n     pleased to work with you in urging all members of Congress to \n     support the immediate enactment of S. 170.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Military Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           State of New Hampshire,\n\n\n                                    Office of the House Clerk,\n\n                                        Concord, NH, July 9, 2001.\n     Hon.

In your case, this \n     transposition failed to give you proper credit for your \n     cosponsorship of S. 170.\n       The printer has accepted responsibility for this serious \n     error, and will mail every TROA member in your state a prompt \n     and corrected cosponsorship summary.\n       Should you receive any correspondence from TROA members \n     based on the misprint in our magazine, please feel free to \n     provide them a copy of this letter to indicate TROA's \n     recognition and gratitude for your cosponsorship of S. 170.\n       Again, we regret this unfortunate error, and very much \n     appreciate your support for the concurrent receipt \n     initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael A. Nelson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Disabled American Veterans,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: Disabled veterans are deeply \n     disappointed by yet another move in Congress which will \n     jeopardize legislation to remove the unfair requirement that \n     veterans must surrender the military retired pay they earned \n     by reason of past service performed to receive compensation \n     for ongoing effects of service-connected disabilities. As \n     National Commander of the Disabled American Veterans, I write \n     to urge that you take all necessary action to ensure the \n     passage of one of the two companion bills H.R. 303 or S. 170, \n     or their equivalent in other legislation, rather than \n     substitute provisions included in H.R. 2586, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n       Provisions in H.R. 2586 to authorize ``concurrent receipt'' \n     of military retired pay and veterans' disability compensation \n     are accompanied by the equivalent of a ``joker clause'' that \n     renders the provisions inoperative unless the President \n     includes money in next year's budget to pay the cost of the \n     legislation and Congress then enacts legislation to take the \n     money from elsewhere in the Federal budget. In reality, this \n     provision in H.R. 2586 is of no effect. However, it will end \n     congressional action on real concurrent receipt legislation \n     in the form on H.R. 303 and S. 170.\n       The serious injustice in current law deserves a real \n     remedy, not another symbolic gesture. Currently, 360 members \n     of the United States House of Representatives have signed on \n     as cosponsors of H.R. 303, and 72 Senators have cosponsored \n     S. 170. To abandon this meaningful legislation in favor of \n     the hollow provision in H.R. 2586 is indefensible.\n       On behalf of those disabled veterans who have dedicated \n     their lives and sacrificed their health to make ours the most \n     secure and most prosperous nation on earth, I ask that you \n     individually act to ensure that our government honors its \n     obligation to provide them the retired pay they were promised \n     and earned and the disability compensation they are \n     rightfully due. Please let me know if these disabled veterans \n     can count on you to ensure real concurrent receipt \n     legislation--rather than in H.R. 2586--is enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            George H. Steese, Jr.,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This concurrent receipt issue centers \naround the ability of a military retiree to receive both military \nretired pay and their VA disability. The American Legion and VFW point \nout that the concept of concurrent receipts goes all the way back to \nwhen Congress passed a law prohibiting active-duty or retired personnel \nfrom also receiving these disability pensions. So military retirees are \nthe only Federal employees prohibited from receiving both retirement \npay and VA disability. This is an inequity.\n  I give a brief quote from a constituent by the name of Thomas Taylor \nwho wrote to me, and he said:\n\n       Dear Senator Smith: As a cosponsor of H.R. 303, or S. 170, \n     your help is now needed to stop making disabled military \n     retirees fund their own Department of Veterans Affairs \n     disability compensation from their military retired pay. \n     Retired pay is hard-earned compensation for the extraordinary \n     demands and sacrifices of a career in uniform. VA disability \n     compensation is for pain, suffering and lost future earnings \n     due to service-connected disability. The current retired pay \n     offset is so unfair it has been highlighted on national \n     network news.\n\n  That is so true. I am glad to support my constituent and millions of \nconstituents in this regard. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Taylor's \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Smith: As a cosponsor of H.R. 303 or S. 170, \n     your help is needed now to stop making disabled military \n     retirees fund their own Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n     disability compensation from their military retired pay. \n     Retired pay is hard-earned compensation for the extraordinary \n     demands and sacrifices of a career in uniform. VA disability \n     compensation is for pain, suffering, and lost future earnings \n     due to service-connected disability. The current retired pay \n     offset is so unfair it has been highlighted on national \n     network news.\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\n       You are among the 86 percent of representatives and 76 \n     percent of senators who express support for ending the \n     current offset. But actions speak louder than words. I depend \n     on you to ensure Congress backs up its cosponsorship support \n     with money in the FY 2003 Budget Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Thomas Taylor\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Retired pay and disability are separate. \nThat is a fact. Our veterans should not be penalized further merely for \nchoosing a career in the military, which is exactly what has happened. \nNondisabled military retirees pursue second careers after service to \nsupplement their own income, thereby justly enjoying the full reward \nfor the completion of the military career retirement, and then going to \nwork and earning extra money if they are able to do so.\n  In contrast, military retirees with a service-connected disability do \nnot enjoy the same full earning potential. Their earnings are reduced \nbased on the degree of service-connected disability. Some of the \ninjuries may be modest by some standards, and others have lost limbs or \nbeen paralyzed or suffered other injuries which severely limit their \nability to make a living.\n  This debate has gone on for a number of years. I will not go into all \nthe details as to the reasons these military retirees deserve this. \nThey have earned this. No veteran should ever be left behind. This \ncompromise assumes sufficient funding to accommodate an increase in the \nmilitary retiree pay that a veteran can collect.\n  The compromise reached before we came back with this legislation was \nthat only 60 percent would be compensated, not everyone. That is not \nfair. We had all of the Senators and Congressmen in both the House and \nSenate supporting the full compensation for everyone: Whether you had a \n10-percent disability or 100-percent disability, you got the dollars. \nThat was the underlying bill by Senator Reid.\n  Why does it appear suddenly we have come forth with an amendment or \nproposal that gives it to only a portion of the veterans? That is \nwrong.\n  If we go with the compromise which was proposed, 80,000 veterans will \nget the award, the disability compensation, but 450,000 to 600,000 will \nbe cut out.\n  Veterans were writing to me, and I am sure to many other Members, \nwith great justification, saying if all of the Senators--almost 80, \nmaybe 83 percent--support providing this for everyone and an \noverwhelming majority of the House Members support it, why in the House \nbill did we have a compromise that cut out 450,000 veterans? Why is it \non the same track in the Senate, cutting out 450,000 veterans? The \ntruth is, that is wrong; we should not do that.\n  I was exasperated, as was a constituent, Raymond Snow, who wrote this \nletter to me:\n\n       This mirrors provisions in the house FY03 Budget \n     Resolutions to authorize higher payments for disabled \n     retirees who are more than 60 percent disabled. This is just \n     nickel and diming the military retiree and not all Federal \n     employees. This is not a benefit. It is an entitlement and \n     should be treated as it is with all Federal employees.\n\n  That is the issue--to offer up a compromise, although it saves money. \nBut this is about being fair to veterans and being fair to those who \nserve. That compromise was unfair because it cut out 450,000 veterans. \nI ask, if you have a 50-percent disability or a 60-percent disability, \nwhy should the person with the 50-percent disability be cut out and get \nno compensation for his or her disability, and a person with 60 percent \nget it? The truth is, it should not be that. It is unfair to offer a \ncompromise that is different from what most Members of the Senate and \nthe House agree to. That is wrong, and that is why we are correcting \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of all \nthe cosponsors in the Senate of the Reid bill, S. 170.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                          Cosponsors of S. 170\n\n       Daniel K.

Another letter from a man from my home \nState, a Mr. Lutz, who said:\n\n       Eight out of ten members of the Senate have cosponsored S. \n     170 . . . which would permit retired members of the Armed \n     Forces who have service-connected disability to receive both \n     military longevity retired pay and disability compensation. \n     Last year, provisions from S. 170 were included in the \n     National Defense Authorization Act to authorize concurrent \n     receipt, but with the conditions that keep concurrent receipt \n     provisions from taking effect unless the President included \n     funding in his budget and Congress enacted other legislation \n     to offset the costs. Our members are deeply frustrated that \n     such a large majority of the Senate has cosponsored S. 170, \n     but still the injustice continues.\n\n  That is the point. What the Senate is doing now--and I congratulate \nSenator Warner and Senator Reid, Senator Hutchison, and Senator Levin \nfor their cooperation--we now have said this legislation, which \nprovides full compensation to 450,000 to 500,000 veterans who have a \ndisability and are retired, they get it both; whether the disability is \n10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent or 60 percent, they get the \ncompensation. We are not drawing lines, saying one injury was more or \nless important than another. We have taken the underlying legislation \nwe have supported overwhelmingly and said, we will put it in the Armed \nServices Committee bill and support this legislation. If there is a \npoint of order raised, we intend to be supportive.\n  I congratulate all Members in the committee who supported me. The \nvote was 24 to 1 in committee in support of Senator Reid's legislation \nto provide the full compensation. It is a committee amendment. I am \naware of that. However, there are other Senators who have asked to be \nassociated with the legislation. Today Senators Bingaman and Snowe \nasked to be associated with the amendment. I know many other Senators \nwho are not on the committee also feel the same.\n  In conclusion, we cannot allow Government to make mathematical \nassessments of battle wounds. Frankly, when the House Budget Committee \ndid what they did, that was exactly what they did.\n  I also venture a guess that not too many on that committee fully \nunderstand what it means to be in the military, as I have been in the \nmilitary, and many other Members in the Senate, to understand being \ncounted does not cut it when it comes to battle wounds received by \nveterans. You cannot draw a distinction, saying one person gets so many \ndollars because they have 60 percent disability and this person gets no \ncompensation because they have 50 percent disability.\n  That is outrageous and not well thought out by those who prepared it \nand then insisted on the language, although a majority of the House \nMembers supported the underlying bill that supported all. This is what \ncauses people to get turned off on the political process. To Senator \nLevin and Senator Warner and Senator Reid's credit, they have seen \nthrough that and offered this up as a committee amendment on behalf of \nall members of the Armed Services Committee, except one, and all of \nthose in the Senate who have supported this legislation.\n  I am pleased and proud, as one who lost his father in World War II, \nas one who served his country in Vietnam, along with my brother who \nalso served in Vietnam. We are a military family. I am pleased, \nhonored, and proud to\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\nsupport this legislation and to support this committee amendment and, \nhopefully, see this move through the conference where we will stand up \nto the House of Representatives and pass this legislation so all \nmilitary retirees who receive disability will get both disability and \nretirement. Whatever the cost, we need to bear that cost. They bore the \ncost for us when they served.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say, this is not my amendment, it is our amendment. \nThe committee has extended it forward, for which I am very grateful, on \nbehalf of the Senate, that this amendment was offered. This is the way \nI look at it. It is not my amendment. We started off a number of years \nago, working our way through this, to be at the point we are now. I am \nvery happy.\n  One of the things I was struck with on Memorial Day this year--it \nnever hit me like it did this year--over many years, three decades, at \nleast, I have been going to Memorial Day services. They have one big \nevent in Las Vegas and a number of others. The event is not as big as \nit used to be. Veterans are dying. World War II veterans are dying. \nThis Memorial Day, I looked out in the audience, and people I expected \nto be there were gone. That is what this amendment is all about. It is \nbringing the respect to these people who are gone, and those who are \nhere still living what they deserve. World War II veterans are dying at \nthe rate of more than 1,000 a day.\n\n  I cannot say enough on this Record to express my personal \nappreciation to Senators Levin and Warner because we have not been real \nsuccessful in years past. We have done OK but have not been completely \nsuccessful. You have fought, in conference with the House, to get us \nwhat we want. I will never forget how you fought.\n  I remember last year after we failed, we held a press conference, \ntalking about we are going to do better next year. And we have done \nbetter. This is next year and we have done better.\n  I appreciate Senator Smith talking about how fervently he feels about \nthis. I know that. I have served with him on the MIA/POW Committee. I \nknow how he feels about our military personnel.\n  Of course, regarding the two men who are the chairman and ranking \nmember of this committee, I wish, again, words were adequate for me to \ntell the American people how fortunate we are to have the two of them, \nthe Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Virginia, in effect, for \nthe Senate, representing the Senate, taking care of the service men and \nwomen of this country. That is what your obligation is--to make sure \nthose men and women of our Armed Forces who carry rifles and drive \ntrucks and serve food, who wear the uniform of this country are well \ntaken care of.\n  We can always do better, there is no question about that. But the two \nof you, I think, will go down in history as really directing this \ncountry in the way it should be.\n  In the last session, I introduced S. 170 entitled ``The Retired Pay \nRestoration Act of 2001'' to address, as has already been said here \ntoday several times, the 100-year-old injustice against over 550,000 of \nour Nation's veterans. This legislation, which would permit the retired \nmembers of the armed services with a service-connected disability to \nreceive military retirement pay while also receiving veterans' \ndisability compensation, now has 82 cosponsors.\n  I am proud of the veterans across this country, not only in Nevada \nbut all across the country, because veterans who do not have service-\nconnected disabilities have joined us in this fight for equity and \nfairness.\n  I have not asked Senator Levin, I have not asked Senator Warner or \nSenators Smith or Landrieu or Carper--but I could ask the question and \nI know I would get the answer that you have been overwhelmed with mail \nfrom veterans all over this country and veterans organizations, saying: \nIsn't it about time we took care of these veterans?\n  The House chose not to appropriate funds for this measure. On March \n21, 2002, I along with 26 cosponsors, introduced S. 2051, ``The Retired \nPay Restoration Act.''. It would repeal the contingency language the \nHouse inserted in the National Defense Authorization Act, and thus \nremove the condition preventing authority for concurrent receipt of \nmilitary retirement pay and veterans disability compensation from \ntaking effect.\n  My legislation allows those who have made sacrifices while serving \nour country to receive the benefits they deserve. This year the Budget \nCommittee--and I am so grateful to Senators Conrad and Domenici, \nchairman and ranking member of that committee, who included funding in \nthis budget that we are going to approve, hopefully--and will provide \nfunding for full concurrent receipt of Department of Defense retirement \nbenefits and veterans disability benefits to veterans who are between \n60- and 100-percent disabled as a result of their military service.\n\n  Also, this year the Armed Services Committee, chaired by Senator \nLevin and, as I have mentioned, the ranking member, Senator Warner, \nauthorized concurrent receipt of military retirement pay and veterans \ndisability rated 60 percent or higher. This goes a long way to correct \nthe injustice to those veterans who have served their country \nhonorably.\n  The inequitable legislation prohibiting the concurrent receipt of \nmilitary retirement pay and veterans disability compensation was \napproved by Congress shortly after the Civil War, when the standing \nArmy of the United States was very small. At that time, only a small \nportion of our Armed Forces consisted of career soldiers.\n  I have been working on this for a long time. Each year we get a \nlittle closer to achieving this goal of 100-percent compensation for \nour Nation's veterans. We are going to continue working on this. But we \nhave made it to this point for a lot of reasons. But I repeat, for no \ntwo reasons more important than Senators Levin and Warner.\n  I stand before the Senate today, indicating this amendment that the \ncommittee has introduced should be approved by all Senators--we have 82 \ncosponsors--once and for all taking care of the inequity that our \nNation's veterans have had to experience. Military retirement pay and \ndisability compensation are awarded for entirely different purposes. \nThe current law ignores the distinction between the two. Military \nretired pay is compensation veterans earn through the extraordinary \nsacrifices inherent in a military career. It is a reward promised for \nserving two decades or more under demanding conditions.\n  Veterans disability compensation, on the other hand, is to recompense \nfor pain, suffering, and loss of future earning power caused by \nservice-connected illness or injury. Few retirees can afford to live on \ntheir retired pay alone, and a severe disability only makes the problem \nworse by limiting or denying any postservice working life.\n  The U.S. military force is unmatched in terms of power, training, and \nability. Our Nation's status as the world's only superpower is due to \nthe sacrifices our veterans made during the last 100 years or more. \nRather than honoring their commitment, though, and their bravery, by \nfulfilling what I believe are our obligation, the Federal Government, \ntheir employer in the past, has chosen instead to perpetuate a \nlongstanding injustice. Simply, this is disgraceful and we must correct \nit.\n  Once again, our Nation is calling upon members of the Armed Forces to \ndefend democracy and freedom--in a different way, perhaps, but still to \ndefend democracy and freedom.\n  Today, about 1.5 million Americans dedicate their lives, every waking \nminute--some when they are not awake--to the defense of our Nation. I \nam sure they have many restless nights.\n  We must send a signal to these men and women currently in uniform \nthat our Government takes care of those who make sacrifices for our \nNation. We must demonstrate to veterans that we are thankful for their \ndedicated service. This is one way to do that. Career military retired \nveterans are the only group of Federal retirees who are required to \nwaive their retirement pay in order to receive their disability pay. \nAll other Federal employees receive both their civil service retirement \nand their VA disability with no offset. Simply put, the law \ndiscriminates against career military. It assumes wrongly, they either \ndo not need or do not deserve the full compensation they earn for their \nyears in uniform.\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\n  This inequity is absurd. How do we explain it to these service \npersonnel who have sacrificed their own safety to protect this great \nNation? How do we explain to other members currently risking their \nlives to defeat terror?\n  I have already mentioned the number of veterans we lose on a daily \nbasis. Every day we delay acting on this legislation means continuing \nto deny fundamental fairness to tens of thousands of men and women. \nThey will never have the ability to enjoy their well-deserved benefits \nunless we do something.\n  I received a copy today of a veto threat from the President saying \nthat if this is in the bill, the President will veto it.\n  I don't know the President of the United States as well as John \nWarner, the senior Senator from Virginia, but I know him as well as \nanybody else in this Chamber. I think this was not done by President \nGeorge W. Bush. This is staff directed. President Bush would not veto \nthis bill because of what veterans are going to get. This is coming \nfrom some bureaucratic apparatus. President George W. Bush would not \nveto this. If he did, he would be a much different person than I have \ncome to know.\n  I hope we will give this the proper action and just disregard it. The \nPresident will not veto this based upon this. If he did, I would be \nextremely disappointed and every veteran in America would be \ndisappointed.\n  This amendment represents an honest attempt to correct an injustice \nthat has existed for far too long. Allowing all disabled veterans to \nreceive military retired pay and veterans' compensation concurrently \nwill restore fairness to Federal retirement policy.\n  I have heard all kinds of excuses. Added to it now is this veto \nthreat, which I don't take seriously. Now it is time for veterans to \nhear our gratitude and to see results.\n  I again express my appreciation to the committee and Senators Levin \nand Warner for offering this as the committee amendment. That says it \nall. I hope we will respond overwhelmingly to support the committee \naction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority whip \nfor his comments.\n  Mr. President, part of my remarks is an exact lifting from the \nCongressional Record of last year when Senator Reid took the floor \nfollowing the adoption by the Senate of the conference report on the \nauthorization. Just three of us were here--Senators Reid, Levin, and I. \nWe talked about our commitment to bring this matter up again this year. \nIt was a remarkable colloquy. I read it again not long ago. It shows \nthe long period of time in which our distinguished colleague from \nNevada has fought so hard for the veterans, and particularly those who \nwere deprived of what I believe, of what Senator Reid believes, and I \nbelieve what a majority of the Senate believes they are entitled to.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Nevada for his very \nthoughtful and kind remarks, but most importantly for his undying \nleadership through the years, coupled with others--our colleague from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Hutchinson, whom I urged come to the \nfloor, and I believe he will be here shortly, and others.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a colloquy from 2001 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Congressional Record, Dec. 13, 2001]\n\n       Mr. Levin. I wish to very briefly take up other parts of \n     this bill, including one in which Senator Reid has been so \n     involved. I want to get to that point immediately because he \n     is in the Chamber now. I want to pay tribute to the effort he \n     has made to try to end what is a real unfairness in our law. \n     The unfairness is that our disabled veterans are not \n     permitted to receive both retired pay and VA disability \n     compensation. This is something that is unique to our \n     veterans--that they are not able to receive both the retired \n     pay plus the disability compensation, which they have been \n     awarded. It sounds unusual to say one is ``awarded'' \n     compensation for disability.\n       We had a provision in the Senate bill to address this \n     inequity. We would have allowed our disabled veterans, as \n     others in the Federal Government employ and others in \n     society, to receive both retirement and disability pay. The \n     House leadership was not willing to have a vote on the budget \n     point of order, which would have been made, which would have \n     authorized this benefit to be paid. So we were left with no \n     alternative.\n       Senator Warner and I were both there in conference, day \n     after day. We pointed out that Senator Harry Reid has been a \n     champion on this, and there are others in this body who have \n     pointed out the inequity in the provision that prohibits the \n     receipt of both retired pay and disability compensation.\n       At the end, we could not persuade the House to include this \n     provision and have a point of order contested in the House. \n     So what we ended up with was something a lot less than what \n     we hoped we would get, and that is the authorization for \n     these payments to be made, the authorization to end the \n     unfairness, but it would still require an appropriation in \n     order to fund them.\n       Mr. Reid. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n       Mr. Levin. Yes.\n       Mr. Reid. Madam President, I basically want to spread \n     across the Record of this Senate my appreciation to the \n     chairman and ranking member for the advocacy on behalf of the \n     American veterans regarding this issue. This is basic \n     fairness. Why should somebody retired from the military, who \n     has a disability pension from the U.S. military, not be able \n     to draw both? If that person retired from the Department of \n     Energy, he could do both.\n       We have debated this, and there is overwhelming support \n     from the Senate. It is late at night, but I want the Record \n     to be spread with the fact that I deeply appreciate, as do \n     the veterans, your advocacy. I want the Record to also be \n     very clear that the Senate of the United States has stood up \n     for this. The House refused to go along with us.\n       Also, I feel some sadness in my heart because we are going \n     to come back and do this next year. Sadly, next year there \n     are going to be about 500,000 less World War II veterans. \n     They are dying at the rate of about 1,000 a day. So people \n     who deserve this and would be getting this during this next \n     year will not because the average age of World War II \n     veterans is about 79 years now. So there is some heaviness in \n     my heart.\n       We are going to continue with this. I don't want anybody in \n     the House of Representatives to run and hide because there is \n     no place to hide. This was killed by the House. For the third \n     time, I appreciate Senator Levin and Senator Warner.\n       So although I support the conference report for H.R. 3338, \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, \n     I feel a sense of disappointment.\n       Once again this year, the conference report failed to \n     include a provision on an issue that I have been passionately \n     working on for the last couple of years. Namely, the \n     concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA disability \n     compensation.\n       Unbelievably, military retirees are the only group of \n     federal retirees who must waive retirement pay in order to \n     receive VA disability compensation.\n       Put simply, if a veteran refuses to give up their \n     retirement pay, the veteran must forfeit their disability \n     benefits.\n       My provision addresses this 110-year-old injustice against \n     over 560 thousand of our nation's veterans.\n       It is sad that 300-400 thousand veterans die every year. I \n     repeat: 300,000-400,000 veterans die every year. They will \n     never be paid the debt owed by America to its disabled \n     veterans.\n       To correct this injustice, on January 24th of this year, I \n     introduced S. 170, the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2001.\n       My bill embodies a provision that permits retired members \n     of the Armed Forces who have a service connected disability \n     to receive military retirement pay while also receiving \n     veterans' disability compensation.\n       The list of 75 cosponsors clearly illustrates bipartisan \n     support for this provision in the Senate.\n       My legislation is very similar to H.R. 303, which has 378 \n     cosponsors in the House. I'm thankful to Congressman \n     Bilirakis, who has been a vocal advocate for concurrent \n     receipt in the House for over fifteen years.\n       My legislation is supported by numerous veterans' service \n     organizations, including the Military Coalition, the National \n     Military/Veterans Alliance, the American Legion, the Disabled \n     American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America and the Uniformed Services \n     Disabled Retirees.\n       In October, I introduced an amendment identical to S. 170 \n     for the Senate Defense Authorization bill. The Senate adopted \n     my amendment by unanimous consent.\n       Unfortunately, the House chose not to appropriate funds for \n     this important measure.\n       This meant that the fate of my amendment would be decided \n     in a ``faceless'' conference committee.\n       It pains me deeply to see that my amendment was removed in \n     conference.\n       This is an old game played in Congress in which members \n     vote for an amendment to help veterans, knowing full well the \n     amendment will be removed at a later time.\n       When will decency replace diplomacy and politics when it \n     comes to the treatment of America's veterans.\n       Why won't members of the House of Representatives join \n     their Senate colleagues and right this wrong?\n       Why can't we do our duty and let disabled veterans receive \n     compensation for their\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\n     years of service and disability compensation for their \n     injuries?\n       We gather at a solemn moment in the history of our great \n     Nation.\n       On September 11th, terrorists landed a murderous blow \n     against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n       Right away, we saw the men and women of our Armed Forces \n     placed on the highest level of alert. American troops then \n     deployed to the center of the storm, set to strike against \n     the enemies of all civilized people.\n       Our Nation is once again calling upon the members of the \n     U.S. Armed Forces to defend democracy and freedom. They will \n     be called upon to confront the specter of worldwide \n     terrorism.\n       They will be called upon to make sacrifices.\n       In some tragic cases, they will be seriously injured or \n     even die.\n       Most believe that a grateful government meets all the needs \n     of its veterans, no questions asked.\n       I am sad to say this is not the case today.\n       I will continue this fight until we correct this injustice \n     once and for all.\n       Mr. Levin. I thank Senator Reid. He has been a champion of \n     this cause. He has fought harder than anybody I know to end \n     this inequity. The House leadership simply would not go along \n     with this. We had a choice: We would either have a bill or no \n     bill. That is what this finally came down to.\n       I believe Senator Reid got something like 75 cosponsors for \n     his provision. The Senate overwhelmingly supported this \n     provision. I hope we have better luck next year in the House.\n       In the meantime, what we have done is we have authorized \n     this, and perhaps our Appropriations Committee will be able \n     to find the means to fund this. But until next year, I am \n     afraid the number of veterans you have pointed out--perhaps \n     1,000 a day--will not get the benefits they deserve.\n       Mr. Reid. I am on the Appropriations Committee. I will work \n     toward that. I do want the Record to reflect my overwhelming \n     support for this legislation. I feel badly this provision is \n     not in it, but this is a fine piece of legislation on which \n     the two of you have worked so hard.\n       Mr. Warner. I also thank my distinguished colleague, \n     Senator Reid, for his leadership on this issue. We speak of a \n     disabled veteran. I have had a lifetime of association with \n     the men and women in the U.S. military. In my military \n     career, I was not a combat veteran. But I served with many \n     who have lost arms, legs, and lives. Those individuals, when \n     they go into combat and lose their limbs, or suffer injuries, \n     are somewhat reduced in their capacity to compete in the \n     marketplace for jobs and do all of the things they would like \n     to do as a father with their children and their families.\n       I take this very personally. I feel that some day the three \n     of us--and indeed I think this Chamber strongly supports it--\n     will overcome and get this legislation through. I thank the \n     Senator for his leadership. He is right that the World War II \n     veterans have died at a 1,000, 1,200, sometimes 1,400 a day, \n     and many of those are being penalized by this particular law. \n     So I thank the Senator and I thank my chairman. We shall \n     renew our effort early next year.\n       Mr. Levin. I want to say one thing publicly. I want to \n     again thank Senator Warner. As he often points out, we came \n     at the same time to this body. I have been blessed by having \n     him as a partner and a ranking member for the short few \n     months I have been chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \n     Nobody could have asked for a better partner than I have had \n     in Senator Warner. There are times, of course, that we don't \n     agree with each other, but there has never been a time I can \n     remember in 23 years where we don't trust each other.\n       There is nothing more important in this body than to be \n     able to look somebody in the eye and say that. That is \n     something I feel very keenly. Our staffs have been \n     extraordinary in their work. This has been a very difficult \n     bill.\n       In addition to thanking Senator Warner personally, I thank \n     our staffs for the work they have done. Every night when I \n     call David Lyles--every night--he is there with the staff \n     until 10 or 11 o'clock. I do not even call him after 11 \n     o'clock because that is when I go to bed, or at least I try \n     to. I am pretty sure he stays on after that. I know it is \n     true with Senator Warner's great staff, too.\n       Mr. Warner. Madam President, I thank my great chairman. He \n     succeeded me as chairman. We just moved one seat at the table \n     in our committee hearing room. I guess that was the only \n     change. Of course, other things took place.\n       As he says, the trust is there, the respect is there. We \n     travel. We just finished an extraordinary trip. We were the \n     first two Members of Congress to go into the area of \n     operations in Afghanistan, having visited our troops in \n     Uzbekistan, our troops in Pakistan and Oman, and then on up \n     into the Bosnia region where we visited our respective \n     National Guards who are serving there now.\n       I value our friendship. I look forward to hopefully many \n     more years working together. I thank my friend. We shall \n     carry forward. We do this in the spirit of bipartisanship on \n     behalf of our men and women in uniform of the United States. \n     We are here to do the people's business, and I say to the \n     Senator, we have done the people's business. We have been \n     aided in that effort by Judy Ansley, my chief of staff, \n     having succeeded Les Brownlee; and Senator Levin's wonderful \n     David Lyles, and Peter Levine. I use Senator Levin's lawyer's \n     legal brains as much as I use my lawyer's legal brains.\n       I thank our distinguished Presiding Officer, again, for \n     helping us here tonight. I again salute and commend my staff. \n     I am a very fortunate individual to be served so well in the \n     Senate. We share our staffs in many ways. They get along \n     quite well together.\n       Mr. Levin. Indeed, they do.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Nevada will \nyield for a comment.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nvery gracious compliments. As always, he seeks to give others more \ncredit than they are due. He is modest in terms of what he himself has \ndone. He has just simply been an invaluable leader on this issue. \nSenator Smith and others clearly played an important role. But I really \nwant to single out Senator Reid.\n  If we get this done this year--and I expect we will--despite that \nveto threat, it will be in large measure because the Senator from \nNevada, in his absolutely inimitable way, takes leadership of an issue \nthat makes a difference in the lives of tens of thousands and perhaps \nhundreds of thousands of veterans who have earned both of these \nbenefits.\n  I thank him for his gracious approach. I will tell him that we will \ncarry on this fight in conference, assuming this is adopted. We will \ncarry on the fight for part of it which was adopted in our bill--which \nis already there. I assure him that if we succeed, the veterans of this \ncountry will know who the principal leader was. Again, he is not alone. \nHe would be the first one to say that. Senator Smith, Senator \nHutchinson, and others are critically important in this effort. But he \nclearly is the leader. I thank him.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Biden be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nCantwell and Mikulski be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to be added as a cosponsor \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I extend my thanks to the majority whip \nand to the floor managers of the bill. Senator Reid cares very deeply \nabout this issue. I have known him for some time. We came to Congress \ntogether in 1982. We were classmates in the House of Representatives \nthat year. Mike Bilirakis of Florida has been a champion of this issue \nfor close to 20 years.\n  I served as Governor for 6 years with George W. Bush when he was \nGovernor of Texas. I do not know that I know him better than anybody \nelse on the floor. I know him reasonably well. I am not altogether \nsurprised that he would issue a veto threat on this issue. Before we go \nforward and approve it, I think that is clearly what is going to \nhappen. I don't believe he is doing this out of some sense of lack of \nrespect for the military. I clearly don't believe he would be doing \nthis out of a lack of respect for those who served and became disabled \nduring their service to their country.\n  I have not seen the veto message that Senator Reid placed in the \ntrash receptacle there. But it would be interesting to hear what the \nPresident's words actually were on the message. Does the Senator mind? \nIt is not very lengthy.\n  Mr. REID. I have pulled it out of the file.\n  Mr. CARPER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I preface this by saying I really do not think the \nPresident would do this. It is something that has overwhelmingly \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Rockefeller be \nadded as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has 82 cosponsors. It is in the budget, \nas I indicated in my opening statement. There is money for it in the \nproposed budget. There is money for it in this\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\ncommittee report. If somebody wants to vote against this, at least on \nthe President's veto threat, that is their right. Here is the answer to \nthe question.\n\n       The administration also believes that our current deficit \n     projections necessitate strict adherence to fiscal discipline \n     to ensure the quickest return to a balanced budget. The \n     Administration is concerned that an amendment may be offered \n     on the Senate floor that would expand this objectionable \n     provision even further. Should the final version of the bill \n     include either provision affecting concurrent receipt of \n     retirement and disability benefits, the President's senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Remember, they would recommend it. That is why it deserves to be in \nthe file.\n\n       Section 641 as currently drafted is contrary to the long-\n     standing principle that no one should be able to receive \n     concurrent retirement benefits and disability benefits based \n     upon the same service. All Federal compensation systems aim \n     for an equitable percentage of income replacement in the case \n     of either work-related injury or retirement.\n\n  Work related? Legs blown off? Shot in the stomach?\n\n       The administration's preliminary estimate is that Section \n     641 would increase mandatory outlays by $18 billion from 2003 \n     to 2012 and would also increase DoD discretionary costs for \n     retirement . . .\n\n  That is basically what it is.\n  I say to the Senator from Delaware, I had forgotten you had served as \na Governor with George Bush. I am sure you know him better than I. As I \nsaid, I think senior advisers would give him this and he would say: \nFind something else.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the majority whip for sharing that message.\n  I also had the privilege of serving on active duty in the military, \nin the U.S. Navy, when Senator Warner was Secretary Warner, Secretary \nof the Navy. And many of my colleagues, then and before and since, have \nbecome disabled and have retired in some instances, and a number of \nthem, frankly, would like to draw a disability pension, and they would \nlike to receive their retirement check as well.\n  The point in the President's veto message is this: We do not provide, \nanywhere in the Federal Government that I am aware of, for a person to \nreceive the disability payment and retirement check for the same years \nof service.\n  For a person who served on active duty and was disabled, and \nsubsequently took another job in the Federal Government, and earns a \npension, they may receive their disability check for the years they \nserved on active duty and were injured and then separately for their \nyears they served in another capacity in the Federal Government. But \nthe service is not for the same number of years.\n  What the President is saying in his veto message, just as his \npredecessors said, is: Should we make this exception? We, as Members of \nthe Senate, for those of us who served in the military, can actually \nearn service credit for the time we served on active duty. There is a \ndifference, though. We have to pay for it. It is not a gift. It is \nsomething we have to pay for in order to have our military service \ncount toward our pension as a Senator or a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I think the question the President is raising in his veto message is, \nIs it appropriate for us to say that a person who served in the \nmilitary on active duty, who was injured, should subsequently receive a \npension check, a retirement check, as well as a disability check for \nthe same number of years? That is the issue.\n  The other issue is this: How do we pay for this? For me, that is \nreally as important as the first question, maybe even more important. I \nhave been here a year and a half, and I am becoming increasingly \nconcerned that whatever sense of fiscal responsibility held sway here \nin the past is ebbing. I criticized President Bush for not providing \nleadership on the executive side for a balanced budget, for helping to \nlead us back into this situation where we now have looming deficits for \nas far as the eye can see. I have been critical of him on this point.\n  For him now to come before us and say, in the name of fiscal \nresponsibility, this is something we maybe ought not to do--I think it \nwould be hypocritical of me to ignore him for actually taking a stand I \nurged him to take in other areas.\n  I do not know about the rest of my colleagues, but when I see us \ncutting taxes and continuing to spend, and knowing that the money we \nare spending is money simply coming out of the Social Security trust \nfund, I do not feel good about that. And I do not see how any of us \ncould either.\n  The question of whether or not someone should be paid a military \npension and a disability check for the same time, same service, is one \nissue. But for me, a greater issue--I hope the chairman of the \ncommittee, the ranking member, or the Senator from Nevada can assure me \nthat we are going to pay for this, not taking money out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund. That is my question.\n\n  I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may respond to my dear friend, as the \nSenator indicated earlier, his service and my service in the Congress \nstarted at the same time. During that period of time, the Senator from \nDelaware has developed, deservedly, a reputation for being very \nfiscally frugal. I say that in the most positive sense. He is a person \nwho understands numbers and budgets. He is very concerned about that. \nAnd I appreciate his remarks about this.\n  I would say I am also concerned about the fiscal impact of anything \nwe do here. We have done a lot of things that cost a lot of money. We \nshould always be concerned about that. One of those who always does his \nbest to keep us on the straight and narrow is the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  I say that someone who served in the military enough years to retire \nand is disabled deserves both pensions. We can talk about time of \nservice and all that. I do not think that is any different from someone \nwho was disabled in the military and also retires from the Department \nof Energy or the Department of Interior. It is all Government service. \nI think the military retirees should have more attention rather than \nless. Our legislation, in my opinion, will take away the less attention \nthat these men--mostly men; now men and women--for the last 100 years \nhave received.\n  But I share with the Senator from Delaware problems we have \nbudgetarily. I say to my friend from Delaware, I was the first to offer \nan amendment on the balanced budget constitutional amendment that you \ncould not do that using Social Security surpluses. It got 44 votes. It \nalmost passed. But I do think my efforts in drawing attention to the \nfact that the constitutional amendment would have taken Social Security \nsurpluses was--I hope--enough or one of the reasons the constitutional \namendment was defeated.\n  So I look forward to working with the Senator from Delaware to try to \nsave money, to try to do things to balance the budget, as we had a \nbalanced budget not long ago. As you know, I say to my friend through \nthe Chair, last year we had a surplus of $4.7 trillion over 10 years at \nthis time. That is gone.\n  But having said that, I have not lost any of my fervor or passion for \nthis amendment. This is something we have to do. The Senator from \nDelaware certainly has been a leader in other areas in this, trying to \nfocus on how else we can save money. I know that the Senator from \nDelaware--with his wide-ranging experience in State and Federal \nGovernment, including being Governor of his State for two terms, and \nhaving served for a long time in the House of Representatives, and now \nserving in the Senate--can help us find ways to save money and not have \nto hurt those who I think are very deserving veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before our distinguished colleague from \nDelaware departs the floor, I would like to ask a question of him. He \nis a modest man, but I hope he will provide some insight.\n  When I was privileged to come to the Senate 24 years ago, nearly \nthree-quarters of the Members of the Senate had, at one time or \nanother, worn the uniform of their country. Because the world has \nchanged so much since that period of time, and so forth, very few \nMembers today have had the opportunity, really, to serve, and therefore \nit is now--where it was 70 to 75 percent--down to 30 percent.\n\n[[Page S5754]]\n\n  But I would like to just ask a question because many are studying \nthis Record and following this colloquy.\n  I have always believed, Mr. President, fellow Senators, that the \nmilitary service is an inherently dangerous profession and that any \nindividual--man or woman--who accepts those risks--in the course of my \nremarks, which I will eventually make, I will cover this in greater \ndetail. But my recollection of our distinguished colleague from \nDelaware, when I was privileged to be the Navy Secretary, was in naval \naviation. It was during the period of the cold war.\n  But, I say to the Senator, perhaps you would share with us, frankly, \nwhat went on in your mind every time you took off, every time you \nlanded. Your missions, at that time, as I recall, were basically in the \nantisubmarine operation. You may not have been fired upon, but the \nsimple act of flying that plane every day, together with your crew, was \none of danger, one of risk.\n  We saw an extraordinary rendition on television last night of that \nplane that was involved in firefighting. The wings collapsed. In the \ncourse of my period--I do not claim to be any hero or anything else, \nbut I certainly have witnessed a lot of harm that has been inflicted, \none way or the other, to the men and women who have worn the uniform.\n  I ask the Senator from Delaware, does he share my basic thesis that \nit is an inherently dangerous business, not only to the individual but, \nindeed, for the families who will await their return every day?\n  Mr. CARPER. When I was on active duty in the Navy, I was 21 years old \nand served until I was 25. We served three tours in Southeast Asia. Our \naircraft was the P-3 which we used to track Soviet nuclear submarines \nin the oceans of the world. When we were in Southeast Asia, our job was \nto track shipping traffic in and out of Vietnam. I flew a lot of low-\nlevel missions. I loved the Navy. The Senator loved the Navy as well. I \nserved for 23 years active and reserve duty. Four years before that, I \nwas a Navy ROTC midshipman. I loved the mission. I was young. I had no \nfamily. I could not wait to get in that plane. I could not wait to take \noff, and I loved being part of my squadron.\n  This was a time in my young life when we felt we were invincible. We \nknew we weren't, but we sure felt that we were. I served the country, \nas I know you did, because I loved my country. I would do it all over \nagain if given the opportunity.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am sure you witnessed operational accidents in those \ninstances that you saw on active duty probably as I did when I was a \nground officer in the aviation unit in Korea. But some of those who \nshared the tents with me never came back. Some were operational. I \nremember our commanding officer, a tried and trusted combat veteran \nfrom World War II. His name was Al Gordon. His plane took off on a \nmission and burst into flames. He crashed not a few miles distant from \nour field. Again, accidents happen with great frequency. It is a \ndangerous business for all those involved. They accept those risks, \nexpecting those of us in Congress to support them and their families \nsuch as the purport of this legislation.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if I could ask one question to the \nchairman and manager of the bill, then I will stop. I listened, when I \nwas presiding, to the chairman explaining the amendment and explaining \nhow this benefit would be paid for. I have to tell you, I did not \nunderstand the rationale for offering this amendment outside of the \nbill, why it was not included as part of the bill. I did not understand \nwhy it is subject to a budget point of order.\n  Would the chairman explain how we propose to pay for this benefit? \nThat is my question: How do we propose to pay for it?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is an allocation in the budget resolution for \nmandatory spending. That allocation was utilized inside of our \nauthorization bill because we believe that 60 percent disability should \nnot be a dividing line, that there is not a logic to that, and that \neverybody who has a disability should be able to receive concurrently \nboth retirement and disability pay. We have a committee amendment which \nwill achieve that.\n  If we had done this inside of the bill itself, if we had put this \nlanguage we now offer in the committee amendment inside of the bill \nitself and brought it to the floor, the whole bill would have been \nsubject to a point of order. We decided to reduce the risk of that \noccurring by offering a committee amendment for that part of the \nfunding which is above the allocation in the budget resolution.\n  Mr. CARPER. My basic question for the committee chairman is, How do \nwe pay for this benefit?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The same way we pay for the bill, for anything else we do \nin this, anything else that Congress authorizes and appropriates money \nfor.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With the permission of my ranking member, since we will \nboth be here anyway, I wonder if I could ask unanimous consent, since \ntwo of our colleagues on the committee have been here waiting, whether \nthe Senator from Louisiana could be recognized after this matter is \ndiscussed, with Senator Reid perhaps responding, and then the Senator \nfrom Arkansas being recognized immediately after the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. REID. If I could reserve the right to object, I have spoken to \nthe Senator from Louisiana. I believe Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas \nis the final speaker on this underlying amendment.\n  We could dispose of this amendment within the next little bit. And if \nwe could do that quickly, I don't know, if I could ask through the \nChair the Senator from Arkansas how long he wishes to speak on this \nmatter.\n  The Senator from Arkansas indicates he would take about 5 minutes. \nSenator Landrieu has indicated she has a longer statement. Senator \nHutchinson could speak. Senator Warner could say whatever he needed to \nsay.\n  Mr. LEVIN. After Senator Landrieu is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. We would pass it before she is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If that is agreeable to the Senator from Louisiana, I \nwould then ask that she be recognized for 5 minutes on the amendment \nitself; then that Senator Hutchinson be recognized; then Senator Warner \nfor his remarks after disposition of this amendment; and that Senator \nLandrieu then be recognized.\n  Mr. REID. If I could interrupt, your very able ranking member has \nindicated that if we could have these two 5-minute speeches, we would \nmove to passing this amendment. Then he is going to be on the floor of \nthe Senate a lot so he could speak on this.\n  Mr. WARNER. I can speak following passage of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Landrieu be recognized \nfor 5 minutes to speak on the amendment and Senator Hutchinson be \nrecognized to speak for 5 minutes on the amendment and then we will \nvote on the amendment. That would be by a voice vote. Then it is my \nunderstanding Senator Landrieu wants to be recognized after that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. For at least 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Warner has made a brilliant suggestion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Another brilliant suggestion.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we adopt this amendment right now, then have the \nspeeches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWellstone be added as cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3912. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3912) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate an opportunity to say a \nword\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\non this amendment that we just voted on and then to present some \ninformation about the underlying bill in reference to the Subcommittee \non Emerging Threats and Capabilities.\n  Let me begin by thanking the chairman of our committee, our most able \nchairman and our most able ranking member, for their extraordinary and \nbipartisan work on the underlying bill. Let me also thank them for \njoining their forces and their talents and their persuasive skills to \nput forward the amendment that we just discussed in some detail.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment just adopted. I believe \nit is something we most certainly should do. It is a shame we have not \ntaken this action previous to this year. There are 25 million veterans \nwho have served our Nation proudly and bravely. Only 2 percent, about \n550,000 veterans, quite a large number but a small percentage, have \nbeen disabled on the battlefield, have received serious injuries in \nmany cases; in some cases, minor injuries, but in all cases, relative \nto the service, and many of those were received on the battlefield.\n  In Louisiana, that is about 12,000 men and women who have served \nproudly and bravely, about 3 percent. While there is a cost associated, \nas has been discussed by both our chairman and our ranking member, and \nnoted by the Senator from Nevada who has led this fight over many \nyears, while there is a cost associated, it is a cost that this budget \nand this Nation and this economy should bear for the small percentage \nof veterans who were disabled when serving the Nation so they don't \nhave to be shortchanged in their retirement because they have also \ngiven up a limb or two, or a bodily function that prevents them from \nliving in a way that many others enjoy. It is the least we can do, and \nI am only sorry it took us this long to get to this point.\n\n  I agree with the Senator from Nevada that I think the President would \nnot veto this very well-put-together bill over this issue. I think he \nwill, in the end, join with members of the Democratic Party and the \nRepublican Party to support the extension of this benefit and to fix an \ninjustice that is in the payment and compensation scheme and plan for \nthis Nation.\n  Again, only 2 percent of the veterans have received injuries that \ncaused them to be disabled--legally designated as disabled--and they \nare simply asking, since they joined up, signed up, put the uniform on, \nand were injured in the line of duty and it caused them to be disabled \nso they are unable to be productive because they gave their physical, \nmental, and spiritual contribution so that the rest of us could be \nproductive, the least we can do is to say you don't have to be \nshortchanged in your retirement. We are happy and proud and it is our \nhonor and duty to provide you with your disability and your retirement, \nboth of which you have earned.\n  So while I appreciate the comments of the other Senators who have \nquestioned how we might afford it, my question is, How can we not \nafford it? Why haven't we done this before? I am proud to support the \namendment, and I hope we will be able to have a good negotiation with \nthe House and the President to support the men and women in uniform who \nwere hurt, many seriously, and have given great sacrifice, while \nkeeping the rest of us safe. At least we can give them a full \ndisability check and a full retirement check.\n  I want to speak for approximately 15 minutes on the underlying bill. \nParticularly, I want to speak as it relates to the Subcommittee on \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities, which is the subcommittee I now \nchair with my most able and very good partner, the Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Roberts.\n  Douglas MacArthur said that in war there is no substitute for \nvictory. We are engaged in a war right now unlike we have ever been \nengaged in before. We have never really fought a war such as the one we \nare fighting today. We are in the process in this underlying \nauthorization bill, which funds our Department of Defense at the \nhighest level ever--the highest level in many years--and we are in the \nprocess of shaping our defenses and our offenses to fight this new kind \nof war.\n  In this war, our enemies are not wearing uniforms of a recognized \nstate; they are not using conventional weapons or a conventional means \nof attack. They are using weapons of mass destruction, which they did \non September 11, by taking several of our own airplanes and filling \nthem with fuel and turning them into flying bombs and flying them into \nsome of the greatest buildings and symbols here in America on a Tuesday \nmorning when the Sun was shining. They didn't attack men and women in \nthe military; they attacked civilians. They attacked innocent men and \nwomen and children who were unprepared for what was happening to them, \nand they could never have really been prepared for such a horrible and \nhorrific attack.\n  These are fanatics, people who are cowards; these are terrorists, \nmurderers, and people who are going to use weapons of mass destruction. \nThey have proven so because they have used them, and they will continue \nto use whatever weapons they can get their hands on to wreak havoc here \nin America and to our allies as well.\n\n  I just received word that there has been yet another suicide bomb \nthat hit Jerusalem within the last few hours.\n  I have to say this because my children just finished school this \nyear. My 10-year-old and 5-year-old celebrated their last day of school \na couple weeks ago. I can't tell you how difficult it was to read the \narticle about yet another suicide bombing that occurred in Jerusalem \njust yesterday morning, where 19 people were killed. The description of \nthat event in the New York Times was that the bus was full of \nschoolchildren. The bus was full of workers going to work. I cannot \nimagine the pain of a parent putting a child on a bus, and they are on \nthe way to school with their books and in their uniforms, and then the \nparents are called to come collect the body parts a few hours after \nthey put their child on a bus. That is terrorism. That is what we are \nfighting.\n  That is what this bill is funding. This is what we have to have a \nvictory over. Israel is in a battle for survival. We are not in the \nsame position, obviously, and not in the same sort of vulnerable \nsituation; nonetheless, this is the new kind of war.\n  If we don't strengthen our military, if we don't support new \nstrategies, new defenses, focus on intelligence and on getting the \ncoordination of our intelligence so we are not caught off guard in the \nfuture, if we fail, stumble, or delay in trying to rearrange some of \nour strategies, we will let our people down and not give them the \nprotection they deserve in this war against murderers and cowards and \nfanatics.\n  I am proud to stand here to represent for a few minutes our \nsubcommittee, the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, which \nwas formed a few years ago for this exact purpose, to help our military \nthink differently about these new threats, about the new ways we are \ngoing to fight these wars. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the \nleadership of the chairman from Michigan and the ranking member from \nVirginia in supporting our efforts to help give our military the \nsupport they need.\n  We will achieve victory. There is no question about that. America \nwill continue to lead our allies and we will be, year in and year out, \ndecade in and decade out, victorious because we will be able to meet \nthese challenges. In this bill we are discussing we have taken some of \nthe first steps.\n  Well before September 11 our subcommittee explored these new threats, \nsuch as terrorism, the use of weapons of mass destruction, which not \nonly are going to face our men and women in uniform as they fight in \nfaraway places but also our civilians. Our civilians are well aware of \nthese threats. There is general fear and anxiousness, understandably, \nnow in the Nation. They are depending upon us to provide the framework \nfor this new defense.\n  Our committee worked to authorize the critical programs that are \ncreating these new capabilities that will help to make this \ntransformation possible. Again, we focused on combating terrorism, \nchemical and biological defenses, which we have come to know and \nunderstand much more in these last few months--how we must be prepared \nto fight against these new weapons, as horrible as they are.\n  Our committee also wants to support in a full way our Special \nOperations Command, which is a relatively small force, but an \nextraordinary force, a very brave force--something that was\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\ncreated by this Congress to meet these new demands and the new threats \nand which is executing spectacularly in Afghanistan. Our committee and \nthis subcommittee support their work.\n  The nonproliferation program, which is to try to help identify and \nstop the proliferation of nuclear materials through the Department of \nDefense and Department of Energy is part of our mark, as well. And I \nfeel very strongly, as I know the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin \ndoes, that we need to keep up the research development and testing and \nevaluation in the science and technology account in our military \nbudget.\n  Let's not lose sight that this war is not only going to be won with \nmuscle but won with a lot of brains. It is going to be won because we \nare on the cutting edge of new technology in every aspect.\n  In order to get those new technologies to the battlefield, we have to \ninvent them. The way we invent them is research, research, research. We \ncannot undermine the research in this budget.\n  S. 2514 recommends additional funding in each of these areas that are \nintended to support this subcommittee's objectives and all the \nobjectives as outlined by Senator Levin. I will take a few minutes to \ngo through a few of them.\n  The President's budget request included $7.3 billion for combating \nterrorism, and another $2.7 billion for combating terrorism items in \nthe emergency response fund. This bill supports the President's \ninitiatives, as well as $30 million for additional research and \ndevelopment that we think is crucial to achieving some of the goals we \nhave outlined.\n  In response to the unsettling results of a recent GAO report on \nmilitary installation preparedness for incidents involving weapons of \nmass destruction, this bill includes a provision that directs the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive plan to improve the preparedness of \nthese installations.\n  Also in light of continued confusion about the Department's role--and \nunderstandable confusion. We have not fought a war on our own homeland \nsince the Civil War. We have been positioned to fight overseas, to \nprotect our perimeters thousands of miles away. Now our military has to \nthink: Is that the right strategy and, if not, what role should we play \nwith our local law enforcement and local police protection?\n  It is not a simple question, and our bill directs the Department and \nthe Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed report on how DOD should \nbe fulfilling this new homeland mission so that we can help them come \nto the right conclusions regarding this new state of affairs.\n  In the area of nonproliferation, for too long our programs with \nRussia and the former Soviet Union were, in my opinion, \nmischaracterized. Many people characterized this as wasteful foreign \nspending. Since September 11, I hope we have come to realize that \nfunding these programs should be in the forefront as a means to \neliminate the spread of weapons of mass destruction. This is not \nwasteful foreign spending.\n  It is out of self-preservation that we seek to make these programs \nrobust and effective to prevent weapons of mass destruction from \nfalling into the wrong hands because we have seen the result.\n  I want to read a quote from a distinguished former chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, Sam Nunn, who led this committee beautifully \nfor so many years. Senator Nunn said shortly after September 11:\n\n       The terrorists who planned and carried out the attacks of \n     September 11 showed there is no limit to the number of \n     innocent lives they are willing to take. Their capacity for \n     killing was limited only by the power of their weapons.\n\n  Intelligence and field reports from Afghanistan point to al-Qaeda's \ndesire to acquire weapons of mass destruction. We have seen much more \nof that in the news lately. But the visions of Senators Nunn and Lugar \na decade ago have limited the terrorists' weapons and capability of \nkilling because they started before the headlines, before the attacks \nof September 11 putting programs into place because of their vision. \nThis committee wants to support that vision and make it more robust, \nand we have.\n  Accordingly, Congress and the President must continue to push forward \nin nonproliferation programs. This underlying bill is not perfect, but \nit puts us well on the way and honors the work that Senator Nunn and \nSenator Lugar accomplished, again, prior to September 11.\n\n  Among the legislative provisions, we have also included support of \ngranting permanent authority, which the President asked for, for the \nPresident to waive on an annual basis the preconditions to implementing \nthe Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.\n  We have also included Senator Lugar's bill that will provide \ndiscretionary authority to the Secretary of Defense to use CTR funds \noutside the former Soviet Union, which is very important as we have \ndiscovered that maybe our whole problem is not going to be only \nconfined to former Soviet Union states but, unfortunately, now other \nstates. We have to have a robust plan for containment and cooperation, \nand Senator Carnahan's bill encourages the Secretary of Energy to \nexpand the cooperative program beyond traditional weapons grade \nmaterial.\n  These are two essential components to build on the legacy and the \nwork that Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn have so beautifully done over \nthe years.\n  I wish to comment on two more areas, Mr. President. As I mentioned, \nin science and technology, the President's budget included $9.9 billion \nfor S programs. This is both good and bad news. It is only 2.6 \npercent of DOD's budget. It is the lowest percentage since fiscal year \n1992. Although the dollar amounts have increased because the overall \nDefense Department bill has increased, it is not near the goal of 3 \npercent, which is where we want to be, and it is a less percentage than \nlast year. So the trend lines are not going in the most positive \ndirection.\n  I hope we can continue to work in this area because this is important \nto our subcommittee and to our entire committee, and I think it is \nimportant to give the support to our military so we can be not only the \nstrongest but the smartest. We are going to be working on that as well.\n  In chemical and biological weapons, I visited the Army's infectious \ndisease research laboratory at Fort Detrick. It was a very fine day we \nspent touring that facility. I was taken aback by the hard work and \ndedication of the civilian and military researchers who are working to \ndevelop the defenses and cures we need to fight these new biological \nweapons.\n  I should note for all Senators that this laboratory, the U.S. Army \nMedical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, USAMRIID, did the \nanalysis of the anthrax that was sent to the Senate of the United \nStates last year. In addition to their work, they analyzed more than \n15,000 samples of anthrax and other biological agents, using facilities \nthat are very small and overcrowded. I believe if I took anyone from \nLouisiana or elsewhere to visit this facility, they might be very \nsurprised to see the cramped quarters. They would be proud of the \nextraordinary work, but they would be surprised to see the cramped \nquarters in which we are asking people to operate when this threat is \nreal, this threat has happened, this threat will probably happen again.\n  There is money in this budget to upgrade those facilities, and I am \nproud to be a part of that.\n  Of course, it is important to the Maryland Senators because this \nfacility is in Maryland, but it is important to our whole Nation. I am \nproud to be leading that effort to give us the finest lab facilities to \ndeal with these new threats. We did not have to do this in World War \nII. We did not have to do this in Vietnam. We have to do it now. Our \nscientists are on the front lines, our lab technicians are on the front \nlines, and this bill needs to reflect the new realities.\n  We also fund a number of innovative projects for chemical and \nbiological defense including improved sensors, decontamination \ntechnologies, and equipment and promising nanotechnologies. But it also \nincludes provisions to allow defense labs to cut the red tape, adopt \nmore business-like practices so they can be more competitive in \nattracting the finest technical talent and doing the best technical \nwork for the Department and for the Nation.\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\n  One final point: Over the last few years, our subcommittee has \nrequested that the Department perform a careful evaluation of their \ntesting and evaluation facilities. The reason is we want to make sure \nwe are testing all these new weapons systems, new technologies, so that \nwhen we get them to the battlefield, they actually work.\n  We want to make sure the right incentives are in this bill to have \ngood and robust testing. The procedure we are using now to explain in \nthe most simplified way is that they are not the right incentives in \nplace to have the right kinds of testing because the testing budget is \ncompeting with the production budget.\n  So we have put in a proposal that hopefully will not create a new \nbureaucracy and not take discretion away from the services. We do not \nintend to slow down getting new technologies. We want to make sure we \nare doing our taxpayers a good service by making sure we are testing \nbefore the battlefield in a way that helps us save taxpayer money and \ngives our soldiers and sailors what they need to fight effectively. \nThat is a very important component.\n  Finally, in special operations, I say again that this force is doing \nextraordinary work. They only have 1.3 percent of this whole budget, \nbut they are basically the ones we see on the news every night fighting \nal-Qaida in the caves and in the desert, everywhere, over ground, \nunderground, in the air, on the battlefield, protecting us and hunting \ndown these murderers, cowards, and terrorists, wherever they are.\n  We are proud that we are recommending $96.1 million to Special \nOperations Command to make sure they can address their training and \npressing equipment needs for the forces, the new radios that we saw on \nthe news, the emitter radios. When the special operations were riding \nhorseback, they were calling down the strikes from our bombers and our \nfighters, and that was a result of the work our subcommittee did in a \nbipartisan way to provide our warfighters on the battlefield with what \nthey need to get the job done, thinking outside the box, and we are \nreally proud of the work they have done.\n  In addition, besides good communications equipment and good training, \nthese special operations forces, because of the human intelligence now \nthat is required, need much more foreign language training, more \nsophisticated sort of schoolwork, to make sure that our fighters are up \nto the task, and we are really working with foreign operations to \nprovide them funding for the new kind of training, particularly foreign \nlanguage, that is going to be necessary for all of our military in the \nfuture as we find ourselves operating in very different circumstances, \nin different countries with different cultures, trying to understand \nvery complicated geographic, cultural, and religious conflicts.\n  Over the past year, and in fact well before September 11, this \nsubcommittee has looked at the new threats, such as terrorism and the \nuse of weapons of mass destruction, that will face our military and our \nNation in the 21st century. It has worked to authorize the critical \nprograms in the Departments of Defense and Energy that are creating the \nnew capabilities that will transform the military to help it meet and \ndefeat those threats.\n  Chairman Levin's guidelines for the Armed Services Committee in \ndeveloping our legislation included two themes where this Subcommittee \nfocuses much of its work:\n  Promote the transformation of the armed forces to meet the threats of \nthe 21st century.\n  Improve the ability of the armed forces to meet nontraditional \nthreats, including terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.\n  As the subcommittee is responsible for monitoring emerging threats \nand helping ensure that our military has the capabilities needed to \nrespond to those threats, this subcommittee's jurisdiction includes the \nfollowing: research, development, test and evaluation, RDT, including \nscience and technology, S accounts, Special Operations Command, \ncombating terrorism, counter-drug programs of DoD, nonproliferation \nprograms of DoD and DOE, and chemical and biological defense.\n  This bill recommends additional funding or legislative provisions in \neach of these areas that are intended to meet the objectives of Senator \nLevin's proposed guidelines. I will describe our major efforts in each \nof these areas.\n  The President's budget request included $9.9 billion for science and \ntechnology programs. Unfortunately, this is only about 2.6 percent of \nDoD's budget, the lowest share since fiscal year 1992, and far short of \nSecretary Rumsfeld's goal of 3 percent of the total budget, which would \nbe more than $11 billion.\n  This subcommittee has oversight over the majority of S programs \nwithin the Defense Department.\n  This bill recommends significant increases for the Department of \nDefense's research and development budget, as compared to the \nPresident's budget request. In particular, I want to note that there \nare recommendations to increase the science and technology budget \nrequest by over $170 million. There are significant increases for: \nCombating terrorism and weapons of mass destruction; Army \ntransformation, including funding $100 million of Army unfunded \nrequirements in science and technology; technologies to reduce the \neffects and costs of corrosion on ships and aircraft; fundamental \nscientific research at national labs and universities; and cyber \nsecurity, including continuing the important information security \nscholarship program championed by Senator Warner.\n  This bill includes legislative provisions to address the issue of \nspeeding the transition of defense technology from the laboratory into \nthe hands of warfighters. This will give our troops the most advanced \ntechnology available more rapidly and improve the return on our S \ninvestments. They will also help our small businesses get prompt and \nfair evaluations by DOD of their technology ideas for combating \nterrorism.\n\n  During the past year, I visited the Army's infectious disease \nlaboratory at Fort Detrick, MD. I was taken aback by the hard work and \ndedication of the civilian and military researchers there, who are \nworking to develop the defenses and cures that we need to fight the \nthreat of biological weapons. I am pleased that the bill also includes \nprovisions to continue the Senate's efforts to improve the quality of \nour nation's defense laboratories. This legislation reauthorizes and \nexpands a number of pilot programs previously established by our \nsubcommittee under Senator Roberts. The programs allow defense labs to \ncut red tape and adopt more business-like practices so they can be more \ncompetitive in attracting the finest technical talent and doing the \nbest technical work for the Department.\n  The bill includes a provision recommended by Senator Lieberman that \nestablishes a coordinated, joint Defense Nanotechnology R Program. \nThis legislation will ensure that the Department invests sufficiently \nand wisely in this revolutionary technology area, and plans the program \nstrategically from the start so that new nanotechnologies can be used \nby our warfighters as soon as possible.\n  The bill includes a provision requiring the Secretary of Defense to \ncarry out a program to identify and support techological advances that \nare necessary to develop vehicle fuel cell technology for use by the \nDepartment of Defense. The program is to be conducted in cooperation \nwith the Secretary of Energy, other appropriate federal agencies, and \nprivate industry, with at least half of the total cost of the program \nto be borne by industry. The program, which is authorized at $10 \nmillion, will also focus on critical issues for fuel cell vehicles such \nas hydrogen storage and development of a hydrogen fuel infrastructure.\n  There are a number of other funding provisions throughout the bill, \ntotaling over $50 million, that support increased development or use of \nrevolutionary and advanced technologies such as hybrid electric \ntechnology, advanced batteries and fuel cells.\n  Three years ago, the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee \ninitiated a provision requiring a task force of the Defense Science \nBoard (DSB) to report on the state of the Department's test and \nevaluation facilities. The DSB report, issued in December 2000, \nconcluded that ``the T process is not funded properly, in phasing or \nin magnitude.'' As a result, ``testing is not being conducted \nadequately'' and ``there is growing evidence that the acquisition \nsystem is\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\nnot meeting expectations as far as delivering high quality, reliable \nand effective equipment to our military forces.''\n  The annual report of DOD's Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation, DOT, for fiscal year 2001 endorses the views of the \nDefense Science Board, concluding that: ``The acquisition process fails \nto deliver systems to the warfighter that meet reliability and \neffectiveness requirements.'' In other words, DOD's Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation and the Defense Science Board have both \nconcluded that the Department's systematic underfunding of test and \nevaluation has resulted in a situation where we cannot give our troops \nthe assurance they deserve that weapons systems will function the way \nthey are supposed to in combat conditions.\n  This bill includes a series of provisions designed to reverse this \nsituation by implementing the recommendations of the DSB and the \nDirector of OT The most important of these provisions would address \nlongstanding funding shortfalls in the T infrastructure accounts, as \nrecommended by the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation and the \nDefense Science Board, by requiring the Department to: (1) fund the T \ninfrastructure through direct appropriations, rather than through \nsurcharges on T ``customers''; and (2) establish a central T \n``resource enterprise'' to handle this infrastructure funding.\n\n  The first provision would transfer roughly $250 million of testing \nfunds from individual programs to separate T accounts to achieve \ndirect funding. The money would still pay for the same things, but out \nof different accounts: the programs from which the money was \ntransferred would benefit from a reduction in the rates that they are \ncharged for testing (to be achieved by eliminating overhead charges). \nBecause the new funding approach would reduce the prices charged to T \ncustomers, the Director of OT and the DSB believe that this approach \nwould reduce the current disincentive to testing.\n  The second provision would improve the ability of the test and \nevaluation facilities to compete for limited funds by giving them a \nhigh-level advocate within the Department. We share the view of the \nDirector of OT and the DSB that we owe it to our men and women in \nuniform to ensure that the weapons systems that they carry into battle \nwill work as intented in an operational environment. Adequate testing \nof weapons systems is not an abstract concept: lives depend upon it. \nFor this reason, the committee would implement the recommendations of \nthe Director of OT and the report of the Defense Science Board task \nforce on test and evaluation capabilities.\n  The President's budget request included $4.9 billion for the Special \nOperations Command SOCOM, keeping their budget steady at 1.3 percent of \nthe overall defense budget. The bill under consideration recommends \nadding $96.1 million to the SOCOM request to address training \nshortfalls and pressing equipment needs of the forces, such as radios \nfor Army Special Forces and night vision goggles for Navy SEALs.\n  About half of this additional funding was offset by a combined $13.7 \nmillion transfer of fiscal year 2002 funding as requested by the \nCommand for the Advanced SEAL Delivery System program, which faces \nnumerous problems, and a reduction in premature fiscal year 2003 \nfunding for procurement of a second mini-submarine.\n  The committee's bill fully funds the research and development \nassociated with the program, and recommends that about a fourth of the \nprocurement funding be released only after the Secretary of Defense \nreports to the committee on how remaining technological, schedule and \ncost challenges associated with building the mini-sub will be \naddressed.\n  In addition, the bill includes a provision directing the Comptroller \nGeneral to examine Special Operations Forces' foreign language \nrequirements, training and means of achieving and retaining language \nproficiencies.\n  The President's budget request included $7.3 billion for combating \nterrorism and another $2.7 billion for combating terrorism items in the \nDefense Emergency Response Fund, DERF. S. 2514 would authorize the \nportion of the budget request under our jurisdiction and add some $30 \nmillion for research and development programs aimed at combating \nterrorism.\n  In response to the unsettling results of the GAO report that the \ncommittee required in last year's bill on military installations' \npreparedness for incidents involving weapons of mass destruction, we \nhave included a provision that directs the Secretary of Defense to \ndevelop and submit a comprehensive plan to improve the preparedness of \nmilitary installations to deal with WMD incidents. The plan will \ninclude a strategy with clear objectives and resource requirements, as \nwell as a performance plan for achieving and measuring implementation.\n  Finally, in light of continued confusion about the Department's role \nand strategy for defending the homeland, the bill directs the Secretary \nof Defense to submit a detailed report on how DOD should be and is \nfulfilling its homeland defense mission.\n  With respect to counter-drug activities, in addition to authorizing \nthe budget request of $849 million, the bill provides an additional $25 \nmillion for the National Guard counter-drug State plans. This \nadditional funding is of specific interest to many Senators.\n\n  The bill fully funds the budget request for both the DOD Cooperative \nThreat Reduction programs and the related programs at the Department of \nEnergy, including a $15 million increase for the DOE nonproliferation \nresearch and development work. There are several legislative provisions \nthat have been included to support these nonproliferation programs:\n  At the administration's request, we included permanent authority for \nthe President to waive, on an annual basis, the pre-conditions to \nimplementing the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. There is \nlegislation to support the administration decision to transfer the \nprogram to eliminate plutonium production in Russia to the Department \nof Energy from the Department of Defense. We included Senator Lugar's \nbill that would provide discretionary authority to the Secretary of \nDefense to use CTR funds outside of the Former Soviet Union; and We \nalso have Senator Carnahan's bill that would direct the DOE to explore \nways to secure nuclear materials and improve nuclear plant security \nworldwide.\n  This bill funds a number of innovative projects for chemical and \nbiological defense, including improved sensors, decontamination \ntechnology and equipment, and promising nanotechnology. It also \nincludes a reduction to the budget request for a one-year spike in \nchem-bio defense funds that Department officials acknowledge are not \nexecutable and not well defined.\n  The bill authorizes the full funding requested by the Defense \nDepartment for chemical demilitarization, almost $1.5 billion fir \nfiscal year 2003. It includes a legislative provision that would \nprovide the funding in a Defense Department account, as required by \nlaw, rather than in an Army account, as the budget request did.\n  I am proud to be associated with this bill and want to thank the \nchairman, ranking member, and especially my ranking member, Senator \nRoberts, and all the members of my subcommittee for working together to \nproduce this legislation. I believe that it takes a great step in \ntransforming our military to face an uncertain future and a host of \never-changing threats. I strongly support this bill and urge the Senate \nto pass this legislation.\n  It is my pleasure to serve as chair of this important subcommittee. \nIt was great working with Senator Roberts and the other Members. I \nagain thank Senator Levin for his leadership because this Emerging \nThreats Subcommittee is important to be part of the front line of \nhelping reshape our military and provide the protection that our \ntaxpayers and our citizens expect in this new war against people who \nare cowards, fanatics, and murderers, who do not wear a uniform and who \nhave decided they are not going to attack people in uniform but they \nare going to attack innocent men, women, and children. So we need to be \nprepared for the future, and I think we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Arkansas yield for 30 seconds?\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. He has been very patient, and I very much appreciate his \nyielding to me.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu for her absolutely invaluable contribution \nas chairman of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee. This subcommittee, \nunder her leadership, and under the leadership of Senator Roberts \nbefore her, has seen what has been coming and has been doing everything \nwithin its power to put resources into defeating the new emerging \nthreats, the terrorist threats we face. Her leadership has been \nabsolutely superb. I thank her very much for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I likewise say to our colleague who serves on the Armed \nServices Committee, we appreciate her work. I think she gave a well-\ndelivered statement from the heart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconcurrent receipt amendment. I thank Chairman Levin for ensuring it \nwas a committee amendment. It came out with the full endorsement and \nstrong support of the committee.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, for his \ncommitment to concurrent receipt and how engaged he has been on \nensuring that this finally becomes a reality. And a special thanks to \nSenator Reid, with whom I have been privileged to work on this \nimportant issue. We introduced S. 170, the Retired Pay Restoration Act. \nLast year, we offered this amendment to the Defense authorization and \nsaw it pass overwhelmingly on the floor of the Senate. Truly, Senator \nReid has been the champion of this issue. I believe we are on the verge \nof a real victory on this, and I commend him for his commitment and his \ndiligence, year in and year out.\n  The word ``injustice'' has been used a number of times in regard to \nthe issue of concurrent receipt. I think it is the right word to use \nand it is the right context in which we put this vote. Military \nretirees are the only group of Federal retirees who are forced to fund \ntheir own disability benefits. That is the issue. Military retirees are \nthe only group of Federal retirees who have to fund their own \ndisability benefits. The Senator from Louisiana rightly pointed out \nthat we are dealing with only a portion of our veterans, about 400,000 \ndisabled military retirees, who must give up their retired pay in order \nto receive their VA disability compensation. For those 400,000, it is \nthe most important issue of the day--it impacts their daily lives. I \nsuggest to my colleagues that it is a far bigger issue than those \n400,000. As the ranking member on the Personnel Subcommittee, I have \nseen how important issues like concurrent receipt are to the \nrecruitment and retention of our men and women in uniform.\n\n  The kind of message that our Government sends, the kind of dynamic we \ncreate, is reflected in issues such as this. When military retirees are \ntreated in a discriminatory way, when they are treated with less \nrespect than other Federal retirees, the message to the American \npeople, the message to our young people who are considering what career \nto go into, is sent that we do not truly value them. We may say the \nwords and we may salute them and we may honor them, but if we do not \nhonor them in policy, then we are not honoring them as we should.\n  I want to share with my colleagues excerpts from two letters I \nreceived in recent days from my constituents. One is from a veteran in \nHarrison, AR, who said:\n\n       It is a matter of fundamental fairness that we provide our \n     disabled military retirees with the pay they have earned and \n     rightfully deserve. I am sure it has been brought to your \n     attention numerous times that retired Federal employees \n     receive VA disability compensation concurrent with Federal \n     retirement pay. Why are military retired treated differently?\n\n       That is the question--why are they treated differently?\n  Then there is a letter from a veteran from Mulberry, AR, who wrote:\n\n       The purpose of VA disability compensation is to defray the \n     effects of lost earning potential caused by injuries and \n     sickness incurred while defending our country. Retirement pay \n     is based wholly on the number of years of dedicated service. \n     The two pays are entirely separate and should be mutually \n     exclusive.\n\n       That is exactly the case. The offset that has existed is an \n     injustice. It is unfair. We have an opportunity to rectify \n     that this year.\n  I know there are thousands of veterans right now watching C-SPAN who \nare following this debate and are doing so with a sense of cynicism. \nThey have seen this debate before, and they have seen the vote of the \nSenate before. They have seen the Senate vote to end the 110-year \ninequity on concurrent receipt, only to see it dissolve and disappear \nin the course of the conference negotiations. The House has not seen to \ntake the step we have taken, and so there will be again the \nnegotiations that will go on between the House and Senate.\n  I say to my colleagues, to the veterans of this Nation, and to our \nretired military, I pledge, through the conference committee that will \nexist, to continue to fight on this issue until the fundamental \ninequity that exists in current law has been eliminated, once and for \nall, for all of America's heroes. I am committed to full concurrent \nreceipt and to fight for that until our veterans get what they have \nearned, and I urge my colleagues to fight for that as well as we go \nthrough the continuation of this process in the coming weeks. I thank \nthe chairman. I thank Senator Warner for this time and for the \nopportunity to express my strong support for the amendment that has \nbeen agreed to.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank our colleague from Arkansas. He \nhas worked long and hard on this issue for a number of years. He is a \nvery valued member of the Armed Services Committee, particularly as it \nrelates to personnel issues, in the area in which the Senator spent \nmuch time.\n  Senator, we are doing our duty. I thank the Senator.\n  I add a few observations of my own about this legislation. I deferred \nmy comments so others could proceed because I was going to remain on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, everyone at a time such as this draws on personal \nrecollections. I had an opportunity to briefly discuss with our \ndistinguished colleague from Delaware his own experiences in the \nmilitary. I draw on my modest experience in the military to derive the \nsupport I give to this particular piece of legislation. I have said on \nthis floor many times that I would not be in the Senate today, \nprivileged to represent my State these 24 years now, had it not been \nfor the opportunities accorded me by brief tours of active service and \na period of some 10 years in the Reserves in the military, together \nwith opportunities I had in the Naval Secretariat after 5 years, 4 \nmonths, during that critical period of our history when our men and \nwomen were engaged in Vietnam, as well as elsewhere in the world in the \ncold war.\n  For those brief periods I served in the closing months of World War \nII, as a 17-year-old sailor, really in the training command only, I \nhave vivid memories of the streets of America, lined with men and women \nin uniform, coming and going to the battlefields of the Pacific and \nEurope, and particularly those who had returned from the battlefields \nshowing the scars of war.\n  As the chairman pointed out, that particular generation of World War \nII are passing on today in numbers exceeding 1,000 each day of the \nyear. This legislation, should it become law--and I am optimistic it \nwill become law; certainly the underlying provision in the committee \nbill which the Presiding Officer and others worked on--will touch a few \nof the World War II generation.\n  As the years passed on and I had the opportunity to have a brief tour \nof duty in Korea, again, as simply a ground officer with the First \nMarine Air Wing, I had occasion to observe those on the field of battle \nand experience the losses. That is emblazoned in my memory forever.\n\n  Then in the Navy Secretariat from time to time we would go to \nVietnam. We are now honored in this Chamber with a very distinguished \nveteran of that period as the active chairman of the committee. I \nvisited many of those in the aid stations and otherwise who had borne \nthe brunt of war. Therefore, it is with sheer joy that I participated \nwith my colleagues today, just one in\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\nthe ranks, to try to get this amendment passed.\n  The numbers of veterans organizations which work in this is long and \nlengthy that I and other Members of the Senate visited with in the \ncourse of our independent work on this particular piece of legislation, \nas well as what we did in the committee structure. It is remarkable \nwhen you deal with those organizations. They are men and women of \nhumility, proud they had the opportunity to wear the uniform of the \nNation, and they come out of a sense of duty to try to provide for \nthose who have gone before us on active duty and those who are on today \nand those who will follow in the generations to come.\n  As I pointed out in my colloquy with the Senator from Delaware, while \nmy most vivid memories are associated with those who bore the brunt of \ncombat and war, many bear the scars of arduous training. Think of how \nmany accidents we have had associated with the training in parachutes, \nthe training in aviation, the operation exercises. Many of our \nexercises, people may not recognize, are conducted under live fire \nconditions, by necessity, to harden those who someday may face the \nreality of a combat zone.\n  I was with the distinguished Senator from New York visiting those who \ncame back from the battlefields in Afghanistan who had borne the brunt \nof combat and suffered the injuries, to visit them and thank them for \ntheir duty for this Nation and the cause of freedom. I somehow believe \nthis is just a fulfillment of an obligation that we have had long \noverdue. I join those who will move every possible way we can to see \nthat this becomes the law.\n  I thank so many colleagues who have taken time today to speak to this \nparticular issue. Their motivations are pure of heart, simply to do \nduty. We have done it and we have now seen this opportunity. The Senate \nhas met that opportunity, by the vote which we have witnessed and \nagreed to this.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3900\n\n  Mr. President, earlier I offered a second-degree amendment to the \nLevin amendment.\n  Under the Levin amendment, the Secretary of Defense is required to go \nthrough a reprogramming process which, by its very nature, is \nindeterminate in time.\n  No one can predict the certainty of how quickly a measure can get \nthrough four committees. That has to be done in order for the Secretary \nto spend funds, to fully implement the President's Crusader budget \namendment which set forth the purposes for the use of the funds.\n  I come back to the word ``fully.'' Had any one of those committees \nnot--for whatever reason, even reasons unrelated to the Crusader \nissue--acted affirmatively on the reprogramming request, then the \nSecretary would not have the ability to fully expend those funds \nconsistent with the objectives laid down in the President's budget \namendment.\n  Also, it is a long process, the reprogramming process, and the \noutcome has a certain degree of uncertainty. If any committee vetoes \nthe reprogramming, the Secretary would not be able, again, to fully \nimplement the budget amendment. He would be able only to implement \nthose programs contained under the future combat system; whereas, under \nmy amendment, the Secretary has more flexibility. Thirty days after \nnotification to the Congress, under my amendment, the Secretary can \nmove funds to all and fully implement the objectives of the President's \nbudget amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, who \nis a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, be added as a \ncosponsor on the concurrent receipt amendment offered by the chairman \nand myself, and that the consent be granted prior as if to the taking \nof the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to either request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner for his tremendous \nservice to this country and the Nation, particularly in uniform, and \nthe magnificent contribution he makes daily to the deliberations of the \nArmed Services Committee. We could not do it without him. His \ncontributions are such that they enable the committee to do its work in \na fashion which I think most of the Members of the Senate would \nsupport.\n  This is the 6th year that I have served on the Personnel Subcommittee \nof the Committee on Armed Services. I am privileged to chair this \nsubcommittee. As I look back over the past 5 years, we have done a lot \nto improve the pay and benefits for our service men and women. Every \nyear, we responded to the concerns of our service members and their \nfamilies.\n  We heard our service members say that their pay was inadequate and \nnot competitive with the civilian market. We responded by approving pay \nraises that total over 20 percent over the five years, and put into law \na provision that requires pay raises at least a half percent above \ninflation through fiscal year 2006.\n  We heard the pleas of our service members that they were not fully \nreimbursed for off-post housing expenses. We responded by removing the \nrequirement that members pay 15 percent of housing costs out-of-pocket \nand authorized an increase in the basic allowance for housing in order \nto reduce out-of-pocket housing expenses to zero by fiscal year 2005. \nWe also directed the Secretary of Defense to implement a program to \nassist members who qualify for food stamps with a special pay of up to \n$500 a month.\n  We heard the concerns about the Redux retirement system. We responded \nby authorizing service members to choose between the traditional high \nthree retirement system, or to remain under Redux with a $30,000 bonus. \nWe also authorized our military personnel to participate with other \nFederal employees in the Thrift Savings Plan.\n  We heard concerns about health care for our active duty members and \ntheir families. We responded. We enacted provisions that improved the \nquality of health care and access to health care providers. We \nauthorized TRICARE Prime Remote for families of active duty personnel \nassigned where military medical facilities were not available. We \neliminated copayments for active duty personnel and their families when \nthey received care under the TRICARE Prime option.\n  We heard the military retirees when they called our attention to the \nbroken promise of health care for life. We started with a series of \npilot programs which included access to the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program, a TRICARE senior supplement, and Medicare subvention. \nUltimately, we found an even better answer, TRICARE for Life. Under \nthis program, TRICARE pay virtually everything the Medicare does not \npay. This is the best health care program for Medicare eligibles in the \nUnited States. We are really proud of this program.\n  We responded to concerns of our absentee military voters by passing \nlaws making it easier for military personnel and their families to vote \nin Federal, state, and local elections.\n  By the way, Mr. President, in that TRICARE for Life Program we \nincluded a program that I think is extremely valuable for military \nretirees, the U.S. Government is picking up the cost of the biggest \nout-of-pocket expense for our military retiree families, and that is \nthe cost of prescription drugs. I just wish we could do that for every \nsenior family in America.\n  For our military recruiting and retention ebbed and flowed during \nthis 5-year period. We responded by authorizing special pays and \nbonuses as well as innovative recruiting initiatives. We also passed \nlaws that will require high schools to give our military recruiters \naccess to students directory information and the same access to \nstudents as the schools give to colleges and potential employers.\n  I know that we recruit individuals and retain families. Both \nrecruiting and retention are improving. Just a few years ago, the \nservices reported great challenges in meeting recruiting goals, and \nservice members were leaving at alarming rates. I would like to think \nthat the improvements in benefits that I just described helped to turn \nour recruiting and retention around. I understand that the downturn in \nthe economy and the terrorist attacks on our Nation also contributed to \nthe increase in the desire to serve our nation.\n  This year, like the last five years, we have attempted to respond to \nthe needs\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\nof our service members and their families. In the bill now before the \nSenate we do several things.\n  We recommend authorization of the active duty end strength requested \nby the administration. This includes an increase in end strength of \n2,400 for the Marines. I am convinced that the other services need an \nincrease in end strength as well. We simply cannot continue to increase \nour military commitments without increasing the end strength of our \nArmed Forces. They are already stretched too thin. I intend to offer an \namendment to increase the end strength of the Army, Navy, and Air Force \nfor next year, and will propose a plan to address the needs of the \nservices over the next 5 years.\n  We cannot fight a war on the cheap and we cannot fight a war without \npeople.\n  For the fourth year in a row, we propose a significant pay raise \nabove the rate of inflation for military personnel. We recommend an \nacross the board pay raise of 4.1 percent which is a half percent above \nthe increase in the Employment Cost Index, and an additional targeted \npay raise for certain experienced mid-career personnel that will result \nin pay raises ranging from 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent beginning in \nJanuary, 2003. We also extend the special pays and bonuses that are so \nimportant for recruiting and retention.\n  Full time manning support is one of the top readiness issues of the \nReserves. All of our TAGs have talked to us about the shortage in full \ntime support in the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard. For the \nsecond year in a row, the Administration failed to budget for the ramp \nup contained in an agreed upon plan to bring full time manning in the \nArmy Reserve and the Army National Guard up to minimal levels over an \n11-year period. We address this shortfall by increasing the full time \nmanning end strength by 1,761 personnel as the second installment of \nthe 11-year plan.\n  We authorize the service secretaries to pay an incentive pay of up to \n$1,500 per month to members serving in certain difficult to fill \nassignments. We encourage the Department to use this assignment \nincentive pay to address some of the concerns about military personnel \nserving tours in Korea.\n  We are finally able to authorize concurrent receipt of military \nretired pay and veterans' disability compensation for retirees with 20 \nor more years of military service with disabilities rated at 60 percent \nor more.\n  I understand the figure is now zero percent disabling and above. This \nis an incredibly high watermark in terms of service of this body to \nthose who have served, and particularly those who are service-connected \ndisabled and who also are military retirees with 20 or more years of \nservice.\n  I understand that our posture here is, even though the Armed Services \nCommittee reported out legislation that this Defense authorization bill \ngrant current receipt of disability compensation and military \nretirement--receipt concurrent for those who are 60-percent disabled or \nmore--that this body by unanimous consent has agreed to actually lower \nthat figure so that all of our military retirees with 20 years of \nactive duty service or more, zero percent disabled or greater, will now \nbe able to receive disability compensation and military retirement at \nthe same time. I think that is only just.\n  We have our assistant majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, to thank \nfor that. He has been pushing for this for many years.\n  Our proposal will phase in this effort. But with this Defense \nauthorization bill today we will not be phasing it in; it will be \nreality, in the Senate's point of view.\n  This provision was carefully drafted, in consultation with veteran \norganizations and with members of the committee.\n  We authorize a National Call to Service provision initiated by \nSenator McCain that would require individuals enlisting in the military \nunder this program to serve on active duty for 15 months after the \ncompletion of initial entry training. That would encourage our citizens \nto participate in military training somewhat. It is not universal \nmilitary training, but it is an incentive to become familiar with the \nmilitary. And I think it is an excellent proposal by Senator McCain and \nSenator Bayh. It is called National Call to Service.\n  If an individual comes on active duty, train, and then serve 15 \nmonths, what do they receive in addition to that for compensation?\n  They could elect one of the following incentives: No. 1, a $5,000 \nbonus; No. 2, a student loan repayment of up to $18,000, which is quite \nsignificant; No. 3, a 12-month educational allowance at the Montgomery \nGI bill rate; or, No. 4, a 36-month educational allowance at two-thirds \nof the Montgomery GI bill rate.\n  I think this is one of the most insightful programs to come along in \na long time. I heartily endorse it.\n  We increase the maximum end strength for each of the military \nacademies from 4,000 to 4,400 cadets or midshipmen.\n  I think this is an excellent provision and one that we need.\n  We provide $55 million to address the severe aviation training \nbacklog in the Army to train pilots from Guard and Reserve units \ntransitioning to new aircraft and to train active duty pilots in their \ncombat aircraft before reporting to their units.\n  We direct the Secretary of Defense to review personnel compensation \nlaws and policies applicable to our Reserve components, including the \nretirement system to determine how well they address the demands placed \non the Guard and Reserve personnel.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee and the \nPersonnel Subcommittee for their support.\n  I especially thank Senator Hutchinson for his support and work. His \nhard work has made this a truly bipartisan effort on behalf of our \nmilitary men and women and their families. I appreciate all that he has \ndone and what he has contributed.\n  The bill we bring before the Senate today is a good bill that will go \na long way toward improving the lives of our servicemembers and their \nfamilies. I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this \nsignificant legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Feingold). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask permission to address the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is a great privilege for me \nto serve on the Armed Services Committee with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia, who, as head of the Personnel Subcommittee, has just laid \nout all of the strengths of this particular piece of legislation with \nregard to the personnel of our Armed Services.\n  We all can be so proud of our men and women in uniform. I have been \nto Afghanistan twice since the first of the year--the first \ncongressional delegation to go into Afghanistan after September 11. In \nfact, they would not even take us in in the daylight. We went in under \ncover of darkness, lights out, no runway lights, all landing with night \nvision equipment because of the security for nine Senators on that \ntrip.\n  What I encountered was not only the harsh reality of the climate--\nthat bitter cold--but our first instructions were, when getting off the \nairplane: Don't dare step off the tarmac. The sergeant who escorted me \nthrough the darkness, in fact, explained that, having to traverse the \ntrail over 30 times, his buddy was the unlucky one and had his foot \nblown off.\n  Seeing the faces of those young men and women--then, that first week \nof January, and 2\\1/2\\ months later--I saw how resolute they were, how \nthey had tasted military success, how they knew that their cause was \njust, and how they were absolutely resolved in winning because the \nstakes are so high for our country and for the rest of the free world.\n  I have come to the floor to speak on this legislation because I am \nconstantly inspired by my colleague from Georgia, the very life that he \nlives daily, which is an inspiration to this Senator, as are the \nsacrifices he made\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nfor his country as a young man, which has led him to a style of living \nthat all of us cannot imagine and yet he accommodates and he overcomes \nevery day. That is a great inspiration to all of us.\n  So is it any wonder I am loving my time in the Senate, when I have \ncolleagues I can look up to, such as the senior Senator from Georgia, \njoined by this wonderful committee that is quite bipartisan in its \napproach to these legislative matters. It is a great privilege for me \nto come and speak about him personally, and to come and speak and lend \nmy name in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am floored by the wonderful and \ngracious remarks of the Senator from Florida, my dear friend, Mr. \nNelson, my colleague on the Armed Services Committee, my colleague on \nthe Commerce Committee. He is most effusive in his praise of me. But he \nis absolutely correct when he praises the service of our young men and \nwomen in harm's way.\n  There is a marvelous book out now, ``We Were Soldiers Once and \nYoung.'' I was a soldier once and young, and I can only look with \nadmiration, great respect, and tremendous heartfelt pride at the young \nmen and women out there now. The service men and women are young, they \nare talented, they are trained, they are committed, and they are doing \na great job for the United States.\n  If this bill is a tribute to anything, it is not a tribute to me or \nto anybody on the Armed Services Committee or even to this Senate, but \nit is a tribute to them and their hard work on behalf of all of us.\n  So I thank the Senator from Florida for his effusive praise, but \nlet's just reserve those kinds of words for another day. Today, we are \ntalking about dealing with the needs of our service men and women who \nmake it possible for us to have this open and free debate here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the Levin/\nWarner amendment No. 3912.\n  I am pleased the Senate is addressing the issue of concurrent receipt \nof military retirement benefits. Under current law, military retirees \ncannot receive both full military retirement pay and full VA disability \ncompensation. Instead, retirement payments are reduced by the amount \nreceived in disability compensation. Changing the law to allow for \nconcurrent receipt of benefits is an issue of basic fairness because \nboth military retirement pay and VA disability compensation are earned \nbenefits. Retirement pay comes after at least twenty years of dedicated \nservice in the Armed Forces and VA disability is earned as a result of \ninjury during time of service.\n  I have been working with South Dakota veterans and my colleagues in \nthe Senate for several years to fix this problem. Last year, the Senate \nadopted an amendment to both the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution and \nto the fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization bill to include funding \nto correct this problem. Unfortunately, despite strong support in the \nSenate, the language to allow concurrent receipt was removed from last \nyear's budget resolution during the conference with the House of \nRepresentatives. In the defense authorization bill, Congress agreed to \nallow concurrent receipt, but only if the administration included \nauthorizing legislation as a part of the fiscal year 2003 budget \nrequest. I was very disappointed to discover that the President's \nfiscal year 2003 budget request did not include provisions for \nconcurrent receipt.\n  Although I am pleased the Senate is going to take care of our \nmilitary retirees with the passage of this amendment, I remain \nconcerned about the Bush administration's continued opposition to \nconcurrent receipt. Just recently, the Bush administration released a \nstatement criticizing the concurrent receipt provision contained in the \nfiscal year 2003 Defense authorization bill. I have sent a letter to \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget asking him to \nreconsider the Bush administration's position. Simply state, at a time \nin which we are asking more and more from the men and women serving in \nthe military, we should be looking for ways to encourage them to make a \ncareer in the military by improving benefits and assuring them they \nwill be taken care of in retirement.\n  I appreciate the Senate Armed Services Committee's leadership on this \nissue, and look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on \nbehalf of our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3915\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3915.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate began its debate on budget \ndiscipline on the supplemental appropriations bill, but we left our \nwork undone. Today, we are here to finish the job.\n  On the supplemental appropriations bill, the Senate debated a 5-year \nbudget process extension that my colleague, Senator Gregg, and I \noffered. Regrettably, that amendment failed on a tie vote. The Senate \nalso began to debate an amendment by Chairman Conrad that would have \nextended some of the budget process for a more limited time. That \namendment fell on a point of order.\n  We are left, therefore, with a budget process that expires on \nSeptember 30 of this year, less than 3\\1/2\\ months from now. Unless we \nact before then, the process will fail to constrain the government from \ndeficit spending. And unless we act, the process will fail to protect \nthe Social Security trust funds from being used to fund other \ngovernment spending.\n  Thus, Senator Conrad and I have come to the floor with a compromise \nproposal. Our amendment would extend exactly the same budget processes \nthat Chairman Conrad's amendment would have, in exactly the same way. \nSo the Senate will have no reason to dispute the way in which our \namendment enforces budget discipline.\n  But our amendment would also do something that Chairman Conrd's \namendment would not have done. The amendment that Chairman Conrad \noffered on the supplemental appropriations bill had no caps on \nappropriated spending. Now we understand that Chairman Conrad and \nSenator Domenici intended to offer an amendment that would create \nenforcement for 1 year, this year, pretty much as a budget resolution \nwould, but were unable to offer that amendment.\n  But just 1 year of constraint on appropriated spending means \nabsolutely no restraint on next year's budget resolution. At a minimum, \nwe ought to put some constraint on how much spending we can put into \nnext year's budget. If we do not put any constraint on the coming \nyear's budget resolution, then we are not doing what we need to do to \nrein in the deficit and protect Social Security.\n  And that's what our amendment would do. We would do everything that \nthe Conrad amendment would do, exactly as the Conrad amendment would do \nit. But then our amendment would have 2 years of caps on \nappropriations, instead of just 1. We would require next\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\nyear's budget resolution to live by a cap, as well.\n  Now, for the first year, the numbers we use for our amendment are, as \nbest as we can determine, what Chairman Conrad and Senator Domenici \nwould have offered had they had the chance on the supplemental \nappropriations bill. We have simply followed the numbers that Senator \nDomenici distributed at that time. They are pretty much the same as the \nbudget resolution numbers that we proposed in our earlier amendment, \nexcept that an adjustment is made to smooth out fluctuations in the \nhighway trust fund.\n  For the second year, we continue to use the numbers in the budget \nresolution reported by the Budget Committee on March 22. We have sought \nto employ the most neutral numbers that we can find.\n  We have sought, therefore, to focus the debate on a single issue: \nShall we have budget constraint for next year's budget resolution, or \nwill we have no constraint at all?\n  In March, the Congressional Budget Office projected that, with the \nPresident's budget levels, we are headed for a deficit of $121 billion \nin 2003 and a deficit just a few billion dollars short of $300 billion, \nif you don't count the Social Security surplus.\n  And for this fiscal year, 2002, just last Friday, CBO issued a report \nsaying:\n\n       The total budget deficit for the first eight months of \n     fiscal year 2002 was $149 billion . . . a sharp reversal from \n     the $137 billion surplus recorded for the same period in \n     2001. So far this year, receipts are more than $80 billion \n     below CBO's baseline projections, and CBO now expects the \n     deficit for the entire fiscal year to end up well above $100 \n     billion.\n\n  And in Saturday's papers, CBO Director Dan Crippen was quoted saying \nthat the unified budget deficit for 2002 could reach $150 billion.\n  Once again, the government is using the Social Security surplus to \nfund other parts of government. That is something that many Senators \nfrom both parties fought for most all of the 1990s. It is something \nthat we should continue to fight.\n  This is a critical test for us. Are we serious about protecting \nSocial Security, even in these difficult times? Especially after 9-11, \nthe American people have a right to know that we are being especially \ncareful with their dollars, that we can keep track of them, and that we \nare truly putting our priorities straight--with the war on terrorism at \nthe top, but also guaranteeing the safety and security of Social \nSecurity.\n  This is a modest budget process proposal, Mr. President. It is the \nleast that we should do, and I urge my colleagues to join us in this \neffort. Let us extend the budget process for at least 2 years, and do \nwhat we can to protect Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell, be added as a sponsor of the pending first- \nand second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to stand and commend my colleague, \nSenator Feingold, for his initiative with respect to the budget \ncircumstance facing the country and the Congress. Senator Feingold has \ncrafted an amendment that represents a compromise on the question of \nthe budget for this year. It is critically important that we adopt a \nbudget for this year, and it is also important that we have the budget \ndisciplines extended.\n  I hope my colleagues realize what we face. In the absence of an \nextension of the budget disciplines, the budget points of order, the \npay-go provisions all expire on September 30. That would mean the \nthings we have used to control spending and to exercise fiscal \ndiscipline are gone. They are gone. That means that as we go through \nthe appropriations process, we would not have the allocations to the \ncommittees that are enforced by 60-vote points of order to prevent \nspending from going out of control. We would not have those same 60-\nvote points of order to protect against additional tax reductions that \nwould threaten the fiscal condition of the country. And we would not \nhave the provisions that allow us to protect Social Security. All of \nthose provisions expire at the end of September.\n  Mr. President, that is what Senator Feingold is before us offering \nnow--an extension of those provisions, an extension that has been \nworked out with very detailed, bipartisan discussions over an extended \nperiod of time.\n  Senator Feingold has played a very constructive role in that regard. \nHe did not end there with the amendment that he is offering. He also \nhas offered budget caps for this year and next year. My judgment is \nthat we ought to adopt spending caps for this year and next year, and \nthey ought to be at levels that are realistic so they can really be \nenforced. What we have learned in the past is if you set unrealistic \nspending caps, they are then broken with impunity and we wind up \nspending much more money, digging the deficit hole deeper.\n\n  Let me just emphasize that the spending number that Senator Feingold \nhas set out in this amendment is exactly the same number that the \nPresident of the United States sent us for the budget for this year. \nThe number he has included for next year as a spending cap takes that \namount and increases it by something over 3 percent. That is the number \nthat was in the report of the Senate Budget Committee to our colleagues \nin the full Chamber. Those are responsible numbers. They allow and \naccommodate the very large increases in spending asked for by the \nPresident for defense and homeland security. All the rest of the \nspending would actually be reduced from the so-called baseline.\n  Now, that is a responsible budget outline. It accommodates fully the \nPresident's request for increases for defense and homeland security, if \nthat is the wish of the Senate and the wish of the House. But it \nprovides a budget discipline that is going to be badly needed here if \nwe are to recover because the harsh reality that we confront is that \nlast year when we were told there were going to be nearly $6 trillion \nof surpluses over the next 10 years, all of that money is gone; there \nare no surpluses. In fact, our reestimates indicate that instead of \nsurpluses, we face some $600 billion of budget deficits over the next \ndecade.\n  Mr. President, it is more serious than that. It is really far more \nserious than that because those numbers lump together the trust funds \nand the other funds of the Federal Government. If one takes out the \ntrust funds, if one takes out, for example, the Social Security trust \nfund, what one sees is an ocean of red ink over the next decade--\nhundreds of billions of dollars of nontrust fund deficits this year and \nnext year and all of the years to the end of the decade. Instead of a \n$160 billion budget deficit this year, if one segregates the Social \nSecurity trust fund, if one protects the Social Security trust fund, it \nwill be $320 billion.\n  Next year, the budget deficit, instead of being $200 billion, will be \n$370 billion. That is the depths and the dimensions of the fiscal \ndeterioration that has occurred in just 1 year.\n  These are not just numbers on a page. These are numbers that reflect \na larger reality with enormous economic implications for this country. \nI hope our colleagues are listening. I hope our colleagues are thinking \nvery carefully about the path we have embarked on, where this is all \nheaded, because I want to warn our colleagues that none of this adds \nup. It does not come close to adding up. It is critically important \nthat we adopt an extension of the budget disciplines that will help \nkeep this from further exploding out of control.\n  It is absolutely critical that we agree to a budget for this year \nand, as Senator Feingold has offered, a budget for next year as well, \nwith enforceable caps, with provisions that will allow this Chamber to \ndiscipline spending and revenue and, yes, protect Social Security. \nAbsent these disciplines, absent a budget, I believe we are headed for \na very difficult ending to this session.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from North Dakota--and I also applaud, \nas\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\nhe did, the Senator from Wisconsin for offering this amendment--without \nthe budget talk that people outside this Chamber perhaps don't \nunderstand, is it correct that the Senator from Wisconsin and the \nSenator from North Dakota are saying that what the Senate needs is a \nbudget so that we can keep spending down to certain limits as to what \nthe 13 subcommittees can appropriate, so that there will be, as there \nhave been for many years, some discipline in what we do with spending? \nDoes this amendment do anything more than what I just described?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. I think the Senator stated it well. This provides, \nNo. 1, a budget for this year and a budget for next year and caps \nspending at those amounts. The number for this year is the number the \nPresident sent us, $768 billion. It is not the same policy the \nPresident sent us, but it is the same total amount of spending that the \nPresident sent us. In addition to that, there are the various budget \ndisciplines that expire at the end of September that Senator Feingold \nis extending in his amendment.\n  I might say, I know Senator Feingold worked this out on a bipartisan \nbasis. There were other Senators on the other side of the aisle who \nwere involved with negotiating this amendment. I can tell you there \nhave been many discussions with Members on both sides with respect to \nthe number and with respect to a continuation of the budget \ndisciplines. This was not something that was done in a partisan way or \njust on one side of the aisle. This is the result of lengthy \ndiscussions over an extended period of time with Senators on both \nsides.\n  Mr. REID. Can I ask the Senator another question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. Why would someone not want this Congress to have budget \ndiscipline? Why would someone want freewheeling spending, spend \nanything you can; why would someone want that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. There are a number of reasons that are possible for \nsomebody to be in opposition to a continuation of the budget \ndisciplines. One would be they want to spend more money. Another \npossibility is they want more tax cuts that are not paid for. Both of \nthose are possibilities. A third possibility, with respect to the \nbudget disciplines, is that they have another idea for budget \ndiscipline. I suppose that is a possibility.\n  With respect to the actual number, they might disagree. They might \nsay they want less spending or they want more spending, but I say to my \ncolleagues, whatever their disposition is with respect to that, let's \nvote. Let's decide. Let's move this process forward, but let's do it in \na way that is timely. Let's get a budget in place before the \nappropriations process starts. Let's do that. We have an opportunity to \ndo that now. Let's get those budget disciplines extended before we \nstart the appropriations process; otherwise, we are courting chaos.\n  Mr. REID. Can I ask one additional question? It is my understanding, \nhaving spoken with the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from \nWisconsin, that both Senators would agree to a limited time that this \nmatter would be debated. This is not something on which the two \nSenators are wanting extended debate. The Senator from North Dakota \nwould agree to a reasonable period of time and have a vote; is that \nright?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I certainly would, but I think, in fairness, the question \nshould be directed at my colleague. He is the author of this amendment. \nI would certainly be willing to do whatever the Senator from Wisconsin \nis willing to do. I would certainly accept a reasonable time limit.\n  Mr. REID. I have already spoken with my friend from Wisconsin, and I \nknow he is not concerned about an extended debate. He gave a brief \nstatement, as we heard it in the last few minutes. I hope, I say to all \nof my colleagues, we can set a reasonable period of time tomorrow. I \nknow we are not going to be able to work much later tonight, but that \nwe would set a time for some reasonable debate and move forward. I hope \nwe can do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, I say to the Senator from Nevada, I certainly \nthink limited debate time will be acceptable. This is similar to the \napproach we tried to bring up on similar proposals on other bills. \nMembers of the Senate understand this.\n  The reason I rise at this point is to thank the Senator from North \nDakota for his kind words, but also in many ways the Senator from North \nDakota is sort of my mentor on these issues of the budget. Before I \ncame here, I watched him focus on balancing the budget in a sincere \nway, taking political risk with relation to it.\n  In the 10 years I have been here, many of them on the Budget \nCommittee, time and again I have seen his proposals, his genuine \nattempts to either get us to a balanced budget as fast as possible or \nto figure out some way to make absolutely sure that we do not borrow \nfrom Social Security, which is something he and I both abhor.\n  That is exactly what this is about. Yes, it sometimes sounds like \ntechnical budget talk, but it really is whether or not there is going \nto be an open bank account for Congress to take money out of Social \nSecurity--that is what it is about--without any rules, without any \ncaps, without any discipline. That is what we are discussing. Sure, it \ncomes out in the form of a lot of documents and a lot of papers and a \nlot of numbers, but what it is about is whether or not Members of this \nbody are truly committed to stopping the practice of borrowing from \nSocial Security and getting us back to a balanced budget as fast as \npossible.\n  The Senator from North Dakota and I spent just about every day for \nmany years trying to get us to the point where we were not borrowing \nfrom Social Security. A lot of people thought that could not happen, \nbut we made it, working together with our colleagues, often both \nparties and under President Clinton. We made it. We were there for a \nwhile.\n  The only way we can get there again is by finding a way to extend \nthese budget caps and keep these budget rules in place because, without \nthem, I really do fear many of the alternatives Senator Conrad \nmentioned will come to the fore, and the result will be a huge hole.\n  There is already a significant hole being developed, a significant \ndeficit that actually reminds me of the kinds of numbers I first saw \nwhen I came here. I ran on this issue of whether we can balance the \nbudget, and the deficits we are starting to look at for a 1-year period \nare beginning to resemble the deficits I was complaining about when I \nfirst had the chance to run for the Senate and challenge what was going \non in Washington in the 1980s.\n  I thank the Senator. I am pleased we could come together in this \namendment. It is not everything I would want ideally, but it is a \nsignificant step in the right direction, and it will provide some \ndiscipline, not only in this fiscal year that is coming up but in the \nfollowing fiscal year. I thank him very much for his cosponsorship of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Wisconsin and the \nSenator from North Dakota leave the floor, when we look at these \nstaggering numbers, we had a surplus last year at this time of close to \n$4.7 trillion. It is gone now.\n  We had staggering numbers in 1986, as an example, when Senator Conrad \nand I were first elected to this body. The Senator from North Dakota \nran on the platform that he thought something should be done about \nthese deficits, and unless something was done, he would not run again, \nand he followed through on that. It was politically a very courageous \nthing to do. As fate would have it, things worked out that he could \ncome back.\n  We have been able to manage these staggering yearly deficits. We have \nhad surpluses in recent years, so it is not as if we are asking for the \nimpossible, but we need discipline to do it. We will not have \ndiscipline without this budget resolution.\n  It is unfortunate, as we have heard said so many different times, \nthat these tax cuts have put us in a real quandary: $4.7 trillion, 50 \npercent of it is the tax cut; 25 percent of it, approximately, is the \nwar; the rest of it is other economic issues and other policies of this \nadministration. We are in deep trouble economically.\n  I do not know why anyone would oppose what is being attempted by the \nauthor of this amendment and the author of the second-degree amendment.\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\nThis is something that needs to be done for the good of the country. If \nthere were ever anything that was for the security of our Nation, it is \ngetting the financial house back in order. It is not back in order, and \nit will go downhill if we do not do something to cause us to have \nbudget discipline.\n  I am not going to prolong the debate tonight other than to say I am \ngrateful--the people of Nevada are grateful--for the work done by these \ntwo Senators.\n  I hope we will be joined by people of good will on the other side to \nsee if we can come up with a resolution. There is no question that this \nstarted out as a bipartisan amendment. I am disappointed it is not \noffered on a bipartisan basis tonight. But the two Senators have \nspoken. They have the spirit of bipartisanship. There is nothing \npartisan at all about this amendment. I hope we can move forward on it \nand complete it tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from \nWisconsin for his initiative. I was not involved in the development of \nthis amendment. The Senator from Wisconsin negotiated this amendment \nwith one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They \nproduced this amendment. They believed this was a way to advance a \nreturn to fiscal discipline. They believed putting caps on spending for \nthis year and next and restoring the budget discipline was a critical \nfirst step.\n  This is not the budget resolution I passed through the committee. It \nhas similar elements, but it has additional budget discipline, an \nentire additional year of spending caps. I believe this is critically \nimportant to our fiscal future.\n  I think the amendment that was negotiated by Senator Feingold and one \nof our colleagues on the other side of the aisle represents the best \nchance we have this year of moving this country back towards fiscal \nbalance. This will not solve the problem. It will prevent the problem \nfrom getting worse, and it will move us in the direction of restoring \nfiscal discipline. It is a critical first step.\n  My own judgment is, next year, when hopefully the economy is on \nstronger ground, we will put in place a multiyear plan to balance the \nbudget without using Social Security funds. That is going to take a \nmultiyear effort. The hole has been dug so deep as a result of the tax \ncut, which is the biggest culprit, combined with the economic slowdown, \ncombined with the attack on the country, combined with underestimations \nof the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. All of those elements have cooked \nthis stew. Unless we respond, our country is going to get in deeper \ntrouble.\n  Last week, we had to pass a massive increase in the indebtedness of \nthe United States. The President is asking for the second biggest \nincrease in the indebtedness of our country in the history of the \nUnited States. That is how serious the situation is. I hope our \ncolleagues will join with an effort to get us back on track.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Defense \nauthorization bill, we all know that this legislation is extremely \nimportant for our country. Around the world, the members of our armed \nforces are engaged in an ongoing and all-important battle against \nterrorism.\n  Our men and women in uniform are serving with great skill and courage \nin defense of our freedom. They endure long hours and hazardous, life-\nthreatening challenges. They do so with awe-inspiring spirit and \ndetermination that has made us all proud and that keeps our country \nfree.\n  I know I speak for all of us when I express our vast appreciation and \nrespect for these courageous men and women. It is an essential priority \nfor all of us in Congress to ensure that they have the resources needed \nto carry out their missions. Recruiting, training, and equipping the \nbest possible force is the cornerstone of our Nation's military \nstrength and superiority.\n  The Armed Service Committee has produced a strong and effective bill \nto see that our military is well-prepared to face the challenges of the \n21st century. The funds authorized for fiscal year 2003 demonstrate our \nstrong commitment to the Nation's defense. The U.S. military is the \nmost capable fighting force in the world and this bill is well designed \nto maintain that strength.\n  This legislation also builds on the steps we have taken in recent \nyears to improve the quality of life of our armed forces. The 4.1 \npercent pay increase is the fourth consecutive year that the committee \nhas authorized a significant pay raise above the rate of inflation.\n  The bill also maintains support for reducing out-of-pocket housing \nexpenses from 11.3 percent to 7.5 percent, with the goal of reducing \nthem to zero by fiscal year 2005. Additionally, the bill adds $640 \nmillion above the President's budget request for military construction.\n  In recent years improvements in TRICARE and prescription drug \nbenefits have dramatically improved the quality of life for service \nmembers, retirees, and their families. This bill also addresses the \nquality of life issue by providing $35 million to public school systems \nthat serve large numbers of military children and children with severe \ndisabilities.\n  The bill also directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a \nquadrennial review of the quality of life of our service members. For \nmany years, we have emphasized a quadrennial review of our defense \nstrategy. Under Personnel Subcommittee chairman Max Cleland's \nleadership, we have now recognized that the morale and well-being of \nour service members is vital to an effective national defense.\n  As chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, I have consistently \nadvocated a strong Navy-Marine Corps team as a major part of the \nNation's defense. This bill supports the President's budget request for \nshipbuilding. We have also worked hard in the committee to provide \nadditional funds for advanced procurement of Virginia Class attack \nsubmarines, Arleigh Burke Class destroyers (DDG-51) and San Antonio \nClass amphibious transport dock ships (LPD-17). These funds do not buy \nadditional ships, but they will contribute to solving the shipbuilding \nshortfall that is a great concern to our committee.\n  The committee has resisted efforts to fund additional ships through \nreductions in the Operations and Maintenance accounts. The Army, Navy, \nAir Force, and Marines need these funds to carry out their day-to-day \noperations, maintenance and training.\n  Instead, the committee rightly focused on providing modest increases \nto the shipbuilding accounts from the missile defense fund. After \nreviewing the administration's proposal, we found that a small \nreduction in this fund is justified. We believe this proposal is the \nbest way to sustain the readiness of our armed forces to conduct their \nfull range of operations and missions.\n  The bill also improves the ability of the armed forces to meet non-\ntraditional threats, including terrorism and weapons of mass \ndestruction. Overall, $10 billion is provided for combating terrorism. \nSignificantly, the bill authorizes the Secretary of Defense to expand \nthe Cooperative Threat Reduction program beyond the countries of the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  A major priority in our defense strategy continues to be the ability \nto deter a potential adversary. If deterrence ultimately fails, we must \nbe prepared to fight and win future conflicts. The $300 million added \nby the committee to the science and technology budget brings the \nDepartment of Defense closer to the goal of devoting 3 percent of all \ndefense funds to the cutting edge technology that can bring us new \nsystems and more effective deterrence.\n  Key discussions by the Department of Defense and Congress on past \ndefense budgets contributed significantly to the outstanding \nperformance of our armed forces in Operation Enduring Freedom. Now more \nthan ever, we must think creatively about the future and do all we can \nto enhance our readiness and our technological edge to meet the \nchallenges we will face. I urge the Senate to approve this legislation \nas an important part of that effort.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am again offering an amendment \nthat would correct the long-standing injustice to the widows or \nwidowers of our military retirees. The proposed legislation, which \nreflects the language of S. 145 which I introduced on January 23, 2001, \nwould immediately increase for surviving spouses over the\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\nage 62 the minimum Survivor Benefit Plan, SBP, annuity from 35 percent \nto 40 percent of the SBP covered retired pay. The bill would provide a \nfurther increase to 45 percent of covered retired pay as of October 1, \n2006.\n  As I outlined in my many statements in support of this important \nlegislation, the Survivor Benefit Plan advertises that if the service \nmember elects to join the plan, his survivor will receive 55 percent of \nthe member's retirement pay. Unfortunately, that is not so. The reason \nthat they do not receive the 55 percent of retired pay is that current \nlaw mandates that at age 62 this amount be reduced either by the amount \nof the Survivors Social Security benefit or to 35 percent of the SBP. \nThis law is especially irksome to those retirees who joined the plan \nwhen it was first offered in 1972. These service members were never \ninformed of the age-62 reduction until they had made an irrevocable \ndecision to participate. Many retirees and their spouses, as our \nconstituent mail attests, believed their premium payments would \nguarantee 55 percent of retired pay for the life of the survivor. It is \nnot hard to imagine the shock and financial disadvantage these men and \nwomen who so loyally served the Nation for many years experience when \nthey learn of the annuity reduction.\n  Uniformed services retirees pay too much for the available SBP \nbenefit both, compared to what we promised and what we offer other \nFederal retirees. When the Survivor Benefit Plan was enacted in 1972, \nthe Congress intended that the Government would pay 40 percent of the \ncost to parallel the Government subsidy of the Federal civilian \nsurvivor benefit plan. That was short-lived. Over time, the \nGovernment's cost sharing has declined to about 26 percent. In other \nwords, the retiree's premiums now cover 74 percent of expected long-\nterm program costs versus the intended 60 percent. Contrast this with \nthe Federal civilian SBP, which has a 42 percent subsidy for those \npersonnel under the Federal Employees Retirement System and a 50 \npercent subsidy for those under the Civil Service Retirement System. \nFurther, Federal civilian survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay \nwith no offset at age 62. Although Federal civilian premiums are 10 \npercent retired pay compared to 6.5 percent for military retirees, the \ndifference in the percent of contribution is offset by the fact that \nour service personnel retire at a much younger age than the civil \nservant and, therefore pay premiums much longer than the federal \ncivilian retiree.\n  Although the House conferees thwarted my previous efforts to enact \nthis legislation into law, I am ever optimistic that this year we will \nprevail. I base my optimism on the fact that the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2001 included a Sense of the Congress \non increasing Survivor Benefit Plan annuities for surviving spouses age \n62 or older. The Sense of the Congress reflects the concern addressed \nby the legislation I am introducing again today.\n  Since I introduced S.145, 37 of my colleagues joined as cosponsors to \nthe bill. I hope they will join me in speaking in support of this \nimportant legislation and the Senate will adopt this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5767-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Regarding the Middle East, I make two points, although \nin a few minutes it is hard to give justice to what is happening.\n  First, yesterday was a horrible day not just for Israel and Israelis \nbut for Israel's neighbors, as well: The murder of 19 innocent people, \nand God knows how many were injured. Some of those people, young men \nand women, were teenagers. Murder is never legitimate. That is what \nthis is. This is terroristic murder of innocent people.\n  It is not for me, as a Senator, to come to the floor and say the \npeople of Israel or supporters in the United States are not to have \nindignation. We should condemn it. I condemn it on the floor of the \nSenate. I condemn it.\n  Second, Prime Minister Rabin said when confronted with terrorist \nattacks, something like: We will go after the terrorists; we will \ndefend ourselves, and we will go forward with the peace process--in \nother words, we are not going to let the extremists, Hamas terrorists \nand others, completely destroy the peace process or completely prevent \nus from getting back on a political track. It is extremely important.\n  I support what has been courageous work of Secretary of State Powell. \nI believe the Secretary is right in what I think he is proposing; that \nis that our Government has to play a positive and proactive role. We \ncannot zig and zag. It cannot be a contradictory policy. We should be \nstrong in our condemnation of the terrorism, of the murder of innocent \npeople, and we also should be a part of the denunciation and the \nenunciation of a political goal that goes in the direction of two \nstates, side by side, people living side by side with one another, in \nsecure borders.\n  Ultimately, that is what is going to happen. The question is, How \nwide and how deep a river of blood has to be spilled beforehand? I know \nthe dynamics are swirling around in terms of domestic politics, but I \nbelieve it is extremely important the President, the administration, \nstep forward with our support and be clear in our condemnation and be \nclear in the call for demands of reform within the Palestinian \nAuthority and the rest. But at the same time we should not come away \nfrom the role we can play in laying out a political goal, laying out \nthe goal of two states side by side and trying to bring the parties \ntogether.\n  With the status quo, the present course, more Israeli children and \nPalestinian children will die. There have been innocent Palestinians \nwho have died, innocent Palestinians who also have, unfortunately, been \nkilled, though never deliberately. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It is extremely important that this administration lay \nout this goal. It is extremely important the President be strong. It is \nextremely important we condemn the violence but we also be part of the \npolitical process.\n  I believe the vast majority of people, Israelis and their neighbors, \ndo not want to see this continuing killing of innocent people. Enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5767-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 30, \n2001 in San Diego County, CA. A 51 year-old Sikh woman was attacked by \ntwo men who stabbed her twice in the head and threatened to kill her. \nAs she was sitting in her car, the two assailants pulled up next to her \non a motorcycle, opened her door, and one of them yelled, ``This is \nwhat you get for what your people have done to us. I'm going to slash \nyour throat.'' The attackers fled when another car approached the \nscene.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5767-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5767-S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CIVIL SERVICE REFORM AND THE RIGHTS OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as we consider proposals for creating a \nDepartment of Homeland Security to protect our Nation's borders and \ncritical infrastructure, we must not forget the 170,000 federal \nemployees who will staff this new agency.\n  This new department should not be used as a vehicle to advance broad \nchanges to existing laws that would\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\nerode the rights and benefits now accorded to these federal workers. \nNor should personnel decisions related to the agency be done in secret. \nCongress, along with employee unions and management associations, must \nbe a part of the creation of the new department and any changes to \ntitle 5.\n  The President's proposal for the homeland security department calls \nfor enhanced management flexibilities in hiring, compensation, and \nworkforce management. The challenges that such flexibilities would \naddress are not new, and despite the belief that drastic personnel \nchanges are needed, we should not forget that today's federal \ngovernment faces many of the same workforce challenges as in the past. \nReal solutions for civil service reform require strong leadership from \nthe top down and a commitment to the federal merit system and the \nemployees it protects.\n  Some 25 years ago, the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978 \nresponded to the same issues confronting our government today. Much \nlike today, there were serious concerns that government red tape \nhindered managers from effectively recruiting, developing, retaining, \nand managing federal employees. Similar to current proposals, the CSRA \nfocused on enhancing the accountability of the federal workforce, while \nit increased management flexibilities and streamlined hiring and firing \nprocedures. The act made it easier for managers to address employee \nperformance.\n  The act also established the principles of openness and procedural \njustice that define the civil service today. It created the Merit \nSystem Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel to protect \nthe rights of federal employees. The Federal Labor Relations Authority \nwas created to oversee labor-management practices.\n  The act provided a statutory basis for the collective bargaining \nrights of federal workers. It prohibited reprisals against employees \nwho expose government fraud, waste and abuse.\n  The Federal Government was strengthened as an employer as a result of \nthe CSRA. Today, the federal civil service merit principles serve as a \nmodel for equal employment practices to both the private sector and \nforeign governments. With nearly half of the current Federal workforce \neligible for retirement in the next 5 years, we must take care that we \ndo not create an atmosphere where the Federal Government becomes the \n``employer of last resort.''\n  Those in the Federal workforce demonstrate strong accountability and \nloyalty every day--not just to their employer--but to their country. On \nSeptember 11, the Federal workforce responded with courage, dedication, \nand sacrifice, reminding us that we are all soldiers in the war against \nterrorism.\n  As chairman of the International Security, Proliferation, and Federal \nServices Subcommittee, I will work to ensure that the rights of federal \nemployees are preserved and accountability is maintained. These rights \ndo not pose a threat to our national security and should never be used \nas a litmus-test for the patriotism of the Federal workforce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5768-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I voted for S. 2600, the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act of 2002. But I did so with reservations.\n  I recognize the need for a Federal backstop for terrorism insurance, \nand although I believe the way this bill is designed is flawed, it is \nbetter than the status quo. Insurers are not making enough terrorism \ninsurance available in key areas and rates are rising astronomically \nbecause insurers cannot count on a Federal backstop to possible losses \nin the event of another terrorist attack.\n  I would have preferred that we create a risk-sharing pool that would \nnot have placed so heavily a burden on the taxpayer. In a risk-sharing \npool, insurance companies would pay a percentage of their premiums into \na pool. In the event of an attack, affected companies could pay claims \nout of the pool after each meets its individual responsibility for \ncovering losses. If the pool were ever depleted, then the government \nwould lend the pool the money to cover remaining claims. In that way, \nthe taxpayer would eventually be made whole. The structure we are \napproving today will put the taxpayer on the line for losses as soon as \na company's individual retention level is met. And the taxpayer will \nnever be paid back.\n  In addition, I am also concerned about the lack of consumer \nprotections in the bill. Not only does the bill fail to provide Federal \nprotection from price gouging, it preempts States from protecting \nconsumers through the prior approval process. The Foundation for \nTaxpayer and Consumer Rights in California and the Consumer Federation \nof America have raised concerns that long-standing State systems for \nprotecting consumers will be thrown out the window.\n  I worked on an amendment to replace the State preemption language in \nthe bill with language stating that terrorism insurance rates shall not \nbe subject to a waiting period greater than 60 days under any State \nlaw. This would have allowed California and 21 other States to retain \noversight for prior approval over increases in terrorism insurance \nrates while also making sure that the insurance is made available \nquickly.\n  In a colloquy on the issue, Senator Dodd has committed to working \nwith me as this bill goes to conference. As a result, I did not offer \nmy amendment. But given the number of Americans involved, the taxpayer \nexposure to risk, and the leverage that insurers will have over \nconsumers, I believe we must allow States to protect consumers.\n  Though I voted in favor of moving this process forward, I will remain \nvigilant throughout the rest of the process and hope to see \nimprovements in the legislation made in the conference committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5768-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5768-S5769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BROADBAND FOR RURAL AMERICA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments today to \ntalk about a topic that is critical to the future of my home State of \nSouth Dakota and indeed, many other rural areas around the country. The \ntopic is access to advanced telecommunications and information services \nor what is commonly referred to as ``broadband.''\n  Those who have been following the broadband debate the last few years \nhave probably heard more than they want to hear about the subject. As \nis often the case in Washington, policy debates get caught up in the \nextreme rhetoric of various interests vying for some legislative or \nregulatory advantage. And, unfortunately, the Washington debate, and \nbroadband is no exception, seems to drift far from the real issue that \nneeds to be addressed.\n  For example, the debate over broadband services, at least the debate \none sees in the radio and newspaper ads in this town, would lead one to \nbelieve that the broadband problem is a question as to whether or not \ncable companies or phone companies will dominate in their competitive \nstruggle for urban customers. I think it is great that in some parts of \nthe country, such as major cities like Washington, DC, many businesses \nand residential consumers have cable companies and phone companies \nvying for their business. This is good for those who live in areas \nwhere a choice for broadband service is available.\n  Where I come from, however, the luxury of a choice or any choice does \nnot exist when it comes to access to broadband services. Access to \nbroadband services in many rural areas, including parts of South \nDakota, is a real challenge. From my perspective, the broadband debate \nso far has\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\nreally missed the mark and is not focused on the real challenge: how to \nensure that all areas of the country have access to broadband services.\n  Despite some claims to the contrary, broadband access is not a luxury \nitem, like a Mercedes Benz. It has become a necessity in the \ninformation age. For rural States like South Dakota, broadband access \nis literally going to mean whether or not some of our small communities \ncan survive in the new global economy where one's ability to access \ninformation and communication services will determine success or \nfailure. While South Dakota will always be an important agricultural \nState, we know that we need to have the same access to advanced \ntelecommunications and information services as the rest of the country. \nIf we become a second-class society when it comes to broadband, we are \nmore likely to be left behind. We will have less opportunity to keep \nour young people in the State and have less opportunity to create jobs \nand generate business activity.\n  The good news is that there is really no reason why rural America has \nto lag behind the advances in telecommunications in other parts of the \ncountry. But, in order to ensure that we have the same opportunities as \nthose in urban and suburban areas, we have to overcome the unique \nchallenges of covering great geographic distances and the high costs of \ndeploying networks in the prairie states.\n  Well, help is on the way and we have begun to make some progress \ntowards establishing policies and programs that will help ensure that \nrural America is not left behind.\n\n  First, the recently enacted farm bill contained provisions that \nestablished a new low-interest broadband loan program for rural areas. \nA generation ago, The Rural Electrification Act established low-\ninterest loan programs to enable small town cooperatives and \nindependent phone companies to emerge and provide telephone service and \nelectrical service in the rural and remote areas of the country. As a \nresult, we now have ubiquitous and affordable telephone service. Now \nthat we are moving into the next generation of telecommunications \nservice, i.e., broadband, we need to build upon that model of success. \nThus, the Senate demonstrated leadership in the Farm Bill debate this \npast year and we managed to pass the most significant broadband \nlegislation to date. We provided $100 million for low-interest \ngovernment loans for broadband deployment in rural areas over the next \nseven years. This is going to be very helpful to South Dakota and other \nrural areas, and I am very pleased that we managed to secure the \npassage of this landmark legislation.\n  However, the job is far from complete. The broadband debate needs to \nmove forward and there are several areas that need to be addressed \nbefore any of us can honestly say that we have done enough to ensure \nthat broadband is going to be deployed throughout the United States.\n  Some of my colleagues have introduced legislation that addresses the \nbroadband issue from various fronts, and I do see merit in the various \napproaches.\n  Senator Rockefeller for example has introduced S. 88, the Broadband \nInternet Access Act. This important legislation would provide tax \ncredits to companies that deploy broadband service to rural America. I \nam a cosponsor of S. 88 and worked with Senator Baucus and others to \ninclude this legislation in the stimulus package passed by the Finance \nCommittee. It is unfortunate this package was not adopted by the \nSenate; however, I will continue to work with my colleagues to secure \npassage of S. 88.\n  Another colleague, Senator Breaux, has introduced legislation that is \nintended to address the regulatory inequity between cable and telephone \nbroadband systems. The Breaux-Nickles legislation, in my judgment, also \naddresses a legitimate issue. The problem with our current circumstance \nis that the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, has decided that \ncable broadband services should not be regulated but that telephone \nbroadband services should be regulated. This does not make much sense \nto me. In fact, this circumstance seems to run counter to the technical \nneutrality policy that Congress adopted in the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct. It seems to me that similar services should be treated in similar \nfashion when it comes to government regulation. It does not make much \nsense to say that on the one hand, broadband services delivered by a \ncable company should not be regulated, i.e., are not required to \nprovide access to competitors and do not contribute to universal \nservice, and on the other hand subject broadband service provided by \ntelephone companies to regulations that require open access to \ncompetitors and mandatory universal service contributions.\n  As we debate this issue to determine the appropriate level of \nregulation, we must be certain that we have parity between competitors. \nI still have much to learn about all the implications of the Breaux-\nNickles legislation, but I do know that it does address an important \nissue, the disparity of regulation between cable and telephone \nbroadband services.\n  Yet another colleague, Senator Hollings, has introduced a bill that \nbuilds upon the success of the farm bill and would redirect some of the \nexisting telephone excise tax money into a broadband investment fund. \nThe money in that fund would make even more low-interest loans and \ngrants available for broadband deployment in rural areas. His bill \nwould also support needed research into new generation broadband \ntechnologies, especially those that can help bridge the digital divide \nin rural areas. I think his legislation is very thoughtful and I agree \nwith the notion that we do indeed need to invest more into loans and \ngrants for rural broadband. His bill is, in my judgment, part of the \nsolution.\n  I realize that there are some strongly held positions on various \nsides of the broadband debate when it comes to the regulatory \nquestions. The Congress will need to examine these issues and I am \nconfident that the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation will continue to debate the various pieces of \nlegislation that have been introduced. I also know that there are some \napproaches where we seem to have a consensus, namely the idea that we \ncontinue to provide low-interest loans and that we maintain the \nuniversal service system that has helped to make phone service \naffordable. For my part, I intend to engage in these debates from the \nperspective of how rural America is going to participate in the digital \nage. Rural South Dakota is my biggest concern and I hope that my \ncolleagues who are working hard on these issues will listen and work \nwith those Senators, like myself, who come from rural states to address \nour unique concerns.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important \nissues, I thank my colleagues for their leadership in this area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5769-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5769-S5770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL GEORGE PETER NANOS, JR., COMNAVSEA\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Vice Admiral George Peter Nanos, Jr., United States Navy. Vice \nAdmiral Nanos will retire on Monday, 1 July 2002, after 35 years of \nfaithful service to our nation.\n  Hailing from Bedford, New Hampshire, Vice Admiral Nanos is a graduate \nof the U.S. Naval Academy. At the Academy, he was awarded the 1967 \nHarry E. Ward Trident Scholar's Prize. Following graduation, he spent \ntwo years at sea as Antisubmarine Warfare and Gunnery Officer on USS \nGlennon (DD 840) before entering Princeton University, where he earned \na Ph.D. in physics in 1974.\n  Returning to sea, Vice Admiral Nanos served as Engineer Officer \naboard USS Forrest Sherman (DD 931) and as Materiel Officer on the \nstaff of Destroyer Squadron Ten. From 1978 to 1982, he was the manager \nfor Technical Development in the Navy's High Energy Laser Program \nOffice (NAVSEA PMS 405). He then served as the Combat Systems Officer \nin Norfolk Naval Shipyard while also training to become an Engineering \nDuty Officer. He returned to sea yet again as Chief Engineer for the \naircraft carrier USS America (CV 66). While on America, he participated \nin Operation Eldorado Canyon and helped to ensure the successful launch \nof naval airstrikes against\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\nLibya after that country was linked to a terrorist bombing of a West \nBerlin discotheque, which killed 1 American and injured 78 people. \nFollowing this tour, he was assigned as the Deputy Director, Warfare \nSystems Engineering in the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command.\n  In 1988, Vice Admiral Nanos reported to Strategic Systems Programs, \nserving consecutively as Head of the Navigation Branch, head of the \nMissile Branch, and Director of the Technical Division. In June 1994, \nhe assumed duties as Director, Strategic Systems Programs, responsible \nfor all aspects of the Navy's Fleet Ballistic Missile Weapon Systems.\n  In May 1998, Vice Admiral Nanos assumed his rank and duties as \nCommander, Naval Sea Systems Command, the Navy's largest acquisition \norganization. Throughout the past four years, he has been responsible \nfor the design, engineering, procurement, integration, construction, \nin-service support, and maintenance of the Navy's ships, shipboard \nweapons, and combat systems.\n  Vice Admiral Nanos' service education includes U.S. Naval Destroyer \nSchool at Newport, Rhode Island; Engineering Duty Officer basic and \nmid-career courses; the Senior Officer Ship Materiel Readiness Course \nat Idaho Falls, Idaho; and the Program Management Course at the Defense \nSystems Management College, Fort Belvoir, Virginia. His specialty as an \nEngineering Duty Officer is ordnance and weapons systems acquisition.\n  Vice Admiral Nanos successfully led the Command through a brilliant \ntransformation of NAVSEA'S business practices in executing complex \nacquisition and Fleet maintenance and modernization responsibilities. \nHe expertly managed the resizing, recapitalizing, and realignment of \nthe personnel and technical resources devoted to designing, building, \nrepairing, and modernizing ships and their weapons systems. Displaying \nbold vision, innovation, and superb leadership, he instituted far-\nreaching quality initiatives that forged a highly focused, reenergized \nworkforce. These have transformed the Command into a unified \ncorporation that provides world-class technical, acquisition, and life-\ncycle support leadership to America's Navy. His contributions have had \na direct and lasting impact on the overall readiness, effectiveness, \nand survivability of the United States Armed Forces.\n  Vice Admiral Nanos' superb leadership, exceptional integrity, \nengineering expertise, and tireless devotion to duty reflect great \ncredit upon him and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the \nUnited States Naval Service. He has done a superb job in leading the \nNaval Sea Systems Command to fulfill its mission: Keeping America's \nNavy #1 in the World.\n  Although Vice Admiral Nanos has worked diligently to increase the \nefficiency and effectiveness of naval and marine shipbuilding \ncapabilities throughout the United States, he has often shown his \ndedication to and respect for the men and women of the Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard team. He recently visited the Shipyard to personally \ncongratulate and thank the Shipyard team for their record-setting work \non two submarines: A record-setting depot maintenance period on USS \nMiami, followed by a record-setting engineering refueling overhaul on \nUSS City of Corpus Christi. Thanks in part to his vision, the Shipyard \nretains its important military-industrial capabilities and continues to \nprovide critical jobs for the region.\n  Vice Admiral Nanos' innovation has ensured the success of the Naval \nSea Systems Command and the United States Navy's ships well into the \n21st Century. He is an individual of uncommon character and his \nprofessionalism will be sincerely missed. I am proud, Mr. President, to \nthank him for his honorable service in the United States Navy, and to \nwish him fair winds and following seas as he closes his distinguished \nmilitary career.\n  I suspect Vice Admiral Nanos will continue his adventures, and will \nbring much credit to his name, as well as our government and our \ncountry. He is a true American hero, and his direct contributions to \nour military will long be remembered with heartfelt gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5770-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A TRIBUTE TO ALONZO FRANKLIN HERNDON\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, shortly after the turn of the 20th \ncentury, Alonzo Franklin Herndon, a former slave, founded the Atlanta \nMutual Insurance Association, which would later become the Atlanta Life \nInsurance Company. Today, Atlanta Life holds assets of over $200 \nmillion, operates in 17 states, and stands as one of the largest \nAfrican-American owned and operated financial institutions in the \nNation.\n  Born on a farm near Social Circle, GA, in 1858, Herndon's beginnings \nwere anything but auspicious. He spent his early life in field labor \nand sharecropping. However, he ultimately learned the barbering trade \nand flourished. By the turn of the century, he owned and operated the \nworld renowned Crystal Palace barbershop on Peachtree Street in \ndowntown Atlanta. By the time he founded the Atlanta Mutual Insurance \nAssociation, Alonzo Herndon was one of the wealthiest African-Americans \nin the Nation.\n  Alonzo Herndon's vision for his company transcended conventional \ncorporate thinking. Mr. Herndon was not only worried about the bottom \nline, but about the health and livelihood of African-Americans \nthroughout the Atlanta area. The Atlanta Mutual Insurance Association \nwas formed after Mr. Herndon purchased a small benevolent association \nfor $140, and acquired and reorganized two other companies in September \nof 1905. By providing sick and death benefits to African-Americans for \naffordable weekly assessments of 5 to 25 cents, the Atlanta Life \nInsurance Company defined corporate responsibility to the community.\n  Today, we honor the Atlanta Life Insurance Company on the occasion of \ntheir founder's day birthday celebration. Specifically, we join Atlanta \nLife in honoring the barber profession, without which Alonzo Herndon \nwould not have been able to create the Atlanta Life Insurance Company. \nMoreover, we look forward to the 2005 Founder's Celebration \ncommemorating the 100th anniversary of Atlanta Life's founding. In an \nage where corporate malfeasance is too often in the news, it gives me \ngreat pride to celebrate a company that has succeeded financially \nwithout compromising its values. I wish the Atlanta Life Insurance \nCompany many more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5770-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5770-S5771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n   THE RISK OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION CREATED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF \n    WEAPONS-USABLE FISSILE MATERIAL IN THE TERRITORY OF THE RUSSIAN \n                 FEDERATION BEYOND JUNE 21, 2002--PM 93\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

The most recent \nnotice continuing this emergency was published in the Federal Register \non June 14, 2001, (66 FR 32207).\n  It remains a major national security goal of the United States to \nensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons \npursuant to various arms control and disarmament agreements is \ndedicated to peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and \nprotected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern.

A bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the expansion of the \nadoption credit and adoption assistance programs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nmake the adoption tax credit permanent. Last year, Congress passed and \nPresident Bush signed into law the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act. This act contains many and much needed tax relief \nprovisions for the American people. However, because of procedural \nrules in the Senate, this new law sunsets and expires after December \n31, 2010.\n  The legislation I introduce today makes permanent a tax provision in \nthat law, that being the adoption tax credit. If we do not pass this \nextension, and the adoption tax credit sunsets, then this tax credit \nwill be cut overnight from a maximum of $10,000 to $5,000. Families who \nadopt special needs children will no longer receive a flat $10,000 \ncredit, and instead, they will be limited to a maximum of $6,000. As \nwell, families claiming the credit may be pushed into the AMT, \nAlternative Minimum Tax. And the income caps will fall from $150,000 to \n$75,000 so that fewer families will be eligible for the credit.\n  There are over 500,000 kids in publicly funded foster care right now \nwaiting to be adopted. And there are even more in the private system. \nLet's help them find loving homes. Let's make it easier for families to \nadopt, not throw up barriers. If the adoption tax credit is cut to the \nprior law level of $5,000, many families will not be able to afford \nadoptions. And therefore less children will be welcomed into what they \nwant the most, a real family. And adoptions are not cheap. Some \nlicensed private adoption agencies charge fees ranging anywhere from \n$4,000 to $30,000.\n  Earlier this month, on June 4, the House of Representatives passed \nthis permanent extension of the adoption tax credit by a vote of 391 \nyeas to 1 nay. I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate recognize \nthe importance of moving on any legislation to permanently extend this \ntax credit, whether it be the House's bill we consider or this bill I \nam introducing today. Those kids without parents, and those parents \nwithout kids deserve to see this adoption tax credit set into law for \ngood. We owe it to them all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD:\n  S. 2644. A bill to amend chapter 35 of title 31, United States Code, \nto expand the types of Federal agencies that are required to prepare \naudited financial statements; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD.

A bill to establish the Director of National Intelligence as \nhead of the intelligence community, to modify and enhance authorities \nand responsibilities relating to the administration of intelligence and \nthe intelligence community, and for other purposes; to the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Intelligence \nCommunity Leadership Act of 2002. This legislation creates the position \nof Director of National Intelligence to lead a true intelligence \ncommunity and to coordinate our intelligence and anti-terrorism efforts \nand help assure that the sort of communication problems that prevented \nthe various elements of our intelligence community from working \ntogether effectively before September 11 never happen again.\n  While this bill will certainly not solve every problem within the \nintelligence community, I believe it to be a necessary first step \ntowards getting our intelligence house in order.\n  The National Security Act of 1947, which created the bulk of our cold \nwar era national security apparatus, created both the Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and the Director of Central Intelligence, \nof which the CIA is but one component, as two positions occupied by one \nperson.\n  As Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the person in this \nposition is the CEO of the Agency charged with collecting human \nintelligence, centrally analyzing all intelligence collected by the \nU.S. government, and conducting covert action.\n  As head of the intelligence community, which also includes the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the National \nReconnaissance Office, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the \nintelligence-gathering elements of the FBI, as well as others, this \nperson is responsible for coordinating a multitude of agencies and \nharnessing their efforts to secure the overall needs of U.S. national \nsecurity.\n  Although this structure served as well enough in the cold war, it is, \nin my view, far from perfect, and, put\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\nbluntly, I do not believe that giving both jobs to one person makes \nsense.\n  Moreover, just as the particular needs of the superpower rivalry of \nthe cold war drove the national security structure and apparatus put \ninto place by the National Security Act of 1947, so, too, should the \nintelligence and anti-terrorism challenges that our country now faces \nin the post-9-11 world drive the creation of new national security \nstructures adequate to the new challenge.\n  The President, in proposing the creation of the Department of \nHomeland Security has addressed part of this challenge. But the \nadministration's plan does not do enough to address the need to better \ncoordinate our intelligence and anti-terrorism efforts.\n  To start to address these problems the Intelligence Community \nLeadership Act of 2002 splits the current position of Director of \nCentral Intelligence, currently held by one individual, who is tasked \nwith running the CIA and the intelligence community as a whole, into \ntwo positions: a Director of National Intelligence, DNI, to lead the \nIntelligence Community and a Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency to run the CIA.\n  It may appear somewhat paradoxical to argue that in order to assure \ncloser and better coordination within and across our intelligence \ncommunity the current position of the Director of Central Intelligence \nshould be split, but this is, in fact, the case.\n  As a practical matter, the demands of these two full time jobs on the \ntime and attention of any person, no matter how skilled in management, \nare overwhelming.\n  Indeed, running the intelligence community and running the CIA are \nboth important enough to be full time jobs.\n  That was true before September 11, and it is especially true after \nSeptember 11.\n  Even if one person could handle both jobs and reconcile the inherent \nconflicts, there would remain the perception that he or she is favoring \neither the community or the Agency.\n  That is not a formula which is well-suited to lead to a seamless and \nfully integrated intelligence community providing optimum analytic \nproduct to national decision makers or assuring that critical \nintelligence missions are properly allocated and resourced.\n  Specifically, then, this legislation would create the new position of \nDirector of National Intelligence, DNI, a new independent head of the \nintelligence community with the proper and necessary authority to \ncoordinate activities, direct priorities, and create the budget for our \nnation's national intelligence community.\n  The DNI would be responsible for all of the functions now performed \nby the Director of Central Intelligence in his role as head of the \nintelligence community, a separate individual would be Director of the \nCIA.\n  Nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and serving a \nten-year term, the DNI would be insulated from the vagaries of politics \nand specifically empowered to create the national intelligence budget \nin conjunction with the various intelligence agencies within our \ngovernment.\n  The DNI would be able to transfer personnel and funds between \nintelligence agencies as necessary to carry out the core functions of \nthe intelligence community, without the need to seek permission from \nindividual agency heads.\n  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, DCIA, freed from the \ndouble burden as head of the intelligence community, would then be able \nto concentrate on the critical missions of the CIA alone: Assure the \ncollection of intelligence from human sources, and that intelligence is \nproperly correlated, evaluated, and disseminated throughout the \nintelligence community and to decision makers.\n  The critical policy and resource decisions of the President's \nproposed Department of Homeland Defense will only be as good as the \nintelligence which informs those decisions.\n  Whatever the other preliminary lessons we may draw from the ongoing \ninquiry into the September 11 attacks, one thing is perfectly clear: we \nneed to better coordinate our intelligence and anti-terrorism efforts.\n  If the new Department, and the President and Members of Congress, are \ngoing to be able to get the sort of intelligence we need to both \nsafeguard our citizens and protect American national security \ninterests, we need to address the structural problems that exist today \nwith our intelligence community.\n  I believe a first step in finding a solution to this problem is \nrelatively simple, enact legislation that would require the head of the \nintelligence community and the head of the CIA to be two different \npeople.\n  That is what this legislation would do, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me both on this legislation, and in considering other reforms \nwhich may also be necessary to reformulate of intelligence community to \nmeet the challenges of the new era.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2646. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish the National Transportation Modeling and Analysis Program to \ncomplete an advanced transportation simulation model, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat I believe will go a long way in helping to reduce congestion and \nimprove safety and security throughout the Nation's transportation \nnetwork. Today I am introducing the National Transportation Modeling \nand Analysis Program Establishment Act, or NATMAP for short.\n  The purpose of this bill is to authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to complete an advanced computer model that will \nsimulate, in a single integrated system, traffic flows over every major \ntransportation mode, including highways, air traffic, railways, inland \nwaterways, seaports, pipelines and other intermodal connections. The \nadvanced model will simulate flows of both passenger and freight \ntraffic.\n  Our transportation network is a central component of our economy and \nfundamental to our freedom and quality of life. America's mobility is \nthe engine of our free market system. The food we eat, the clothes we \nwear, the materials for our homes and offices, and the energy to heat \nour homes and power our businesses all come to us over the nation's \nvast transportation network. Originating with a producer in one region, \nmaterials and products may travel via any number of combinations of \ntruck, rail, airplane and barge before reaching their final \ndestinations.\n  Today, the Internet connects the world electronically. But it is our \ntransportation network that provides the vital interconnections for the \nmovement of both people and goods domestically and around the world. \nAccording to the latest statistics, today our transportation industry \ncarries over 11 billion tons of freight per year worth about $7 \ntrillion. Of the 3.7 trillion ton-miles of freight carried in 1998, 1.4 \ntrillion went by rail, 1 trillion by truck, 673 billion by domestic \nwater transportation, 620 billion by pipeline, and 14 billion by air \ncarrier.\n  Individuals also depend on our transportation system, be it passenger \nrail, commercial airline, intercity bus, or the family car, for \nbusiness travel or simply to enjoy a family vacation. Excluding public \ntransit, passengers on our highways traveled a total of 4.2 trillion \npassenger-miles in 1998. Another 463 billion passenger-miles traveled \nby air carriers. Transit companies and rail lines carried another 50 \nbillion.\n  We are also interconnected to the world's transportation system, and, \nas I am sure every Senator well knows, foreign trade is an increasingly \ncritical component of our economy. Our Nation's seaports, international \nairports, and border crossing with Canada and Mexico are the gateways \nthrough which passengers and cargo flow between America and the rest of \nthe world. The smooth flow of trade, both imports and exports, would \nnot be possible without a robust transportation network and the direct \nlinks it provides to our international ports of entry.\n  It should be clear that one of keys to our continuing economic \nstrength rests on a transportation system that is safe, secure and \nefficient. Today, we are fortunate to have one of the best \ntransportation networks in the world, and I believe we need to keep it \nthat way. However, we are starting to see signs\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\nthat portions of the system are beginning to strain under a dramatic \nincrease in traffic. For example, according to the Department of \nTransportation, from 1980 to 2000, highway travel alone increased a \nwhopping 80 percent. Between 1993 and 1997, the total tons of freight \nactivity grew by over 14 percent and truck activity grew by 21 percent. \nIn the future, truck travel is expected to grow by more than 3 percent \nper year, nearly doubling by 2020.\n\n  Meanwhile, the strong growth in foreign trade is putting increased \npressure on ports, airports, and border crossings, as well as \ncontributing to congestion throughout the transportation network. \nAccording to DoT, U.S. international trade more than doubled between \n1990 and 2000, rising from $891 billion to $2.2 trillion.\n  Congestion and delay inevitably result when traffic rates approach \nthe capacity of a system to handle that traffic. I do believe increased \ncongestion in our transportation system is a growing threat to the \nnation's economy. Delays in any part of the vast network lead to \neconomic costs, wasted fuel, increased pollution, and a reduced quality \nof life. Moreover, in the future new security measures could also cause \nincreased delays and disruptions in the flow of goods through our \ninternational gateways.\n  To deal with the ever-increasing loading of our transportation \nnetwork we will need to find ways to use the system more efficiently as \nwell as to expand some critical elements of the system. However, in \nplanning for any improvements, it is essential to examine the impact on \nthe whole transportation system that would result from a change in one \npart of the system That's exactly the goal of the bill I am introducing \ntoday.\n  By simulating the Nation's entire transportation infrastructure as a \nsingle, integrated system, the National Transportation Analysis and \nModeling Program will allow policy makers at the state, regional and \nnational levels to evaluate the implications of new transportation \npolicies and actions. To ensure that all of the possible interrelated \nimpacts are included, the model must simulate individual carriers and \nthe transportation infrastructure used by each of the carriers in an \ninterdependent and dynamic system. The advantage of this simulation of \nindividual carriers and shipments is that the nation's transportation \nsystem can be examined at any level of detail, from the path of an \nindividual truck to national multi-modal traffic flows.\n  Some of the transportation issues and questions that could be \naddressed with NATMAP include: What infrastructure improvements result \nin the greatest gains to overall system security and efficiency? How \nwould the network respond to shifts in population or trade flows? How \nwould the system respond to major disruptions caused by a natural \ndisaster or another unthinkable terrorist attack? What effect would \ndelays in the system due to increased security measures have on traffic \nflow and congestion?\n  Preliminary work on an advanced transportation model has been \nunderway for several years at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As I'm \nsure most Senators know, Los Alamos has a long and impressive history \nin the development of computer simulations of complex systems, \nincluding the recent completion of the TRANSIMS model of transportation \nsystems in metropolitan areas. The development of TRANSIMS for FHWA was \noriginally authorized in TEA-21.\n  The initial work at LANL on NATMAP, funded in part by DoT, DoD, and \nthe lab's own internal research and development program, demonstrated \nthe technical feasibility of building a nation-wide freight \ntransportation model that can simulate the movement of millions of \ntrucks across the nation's highway system. During this initial \ndevelopment phase, the model was called the National Transportation \nNetwork and Analysis Capability, or NTNAC for short. In 2001, with \nfunding from the Federal Highway Administration, LANL further developed \nthe model and completed an assessment of cargo flows resulting from \ntrade between the U.S. and Latin America.\n  These preliminary studies have clearly demonstrated the value to the \nnation of the NATMAP comprehensive modeling system. I do believe that \nthe computer model represents a leap-ahead in transportation modeling \nand analysis capability. Indeed, Secretary of Transportation Norm \nMineta, in a letter to me dated April 9 of this year, had this to say \nabout the effort: ``The DOT agrees that NTNAC shows great promise of \nproducing a tool that would be useful for analyzing the national \ntransportation system as a single, integrated system. We agree that \nNTNAC would provide DOT with important new capabilities to assess and \nformulate critical policy and investment options and to help address \nhomeland security and vulnerabilities in the nation's transportation \nnetwork.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Secretary Mineta's letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              The Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jeff: Thank you for your letter of January 30 \n     expressing your strong support to continue the development of \n     the National Transportation Network Analysis Capability \n     (NTNAC). The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office \n     of Policy and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) have \n     been working closely with Los Alamos National Laboratory to \n     develop this tool.\n       During 1998, Los Alamos National Laboratory developed a \n     prototype NTNAC with funding provided by the DOT ($50,000 \n     from the Office of the Secretary's Transportation Policy \n     Development Office), the U.S. Department of Defense \n     (TRANSCOM's Military Transportation Management Command), and \n     the Laboratory's own internal research and development \n     program. This effort demonstrated the technical feasibility \n     of building a national transportation network that can \n     simulate the movements of individual carriers (trucks, \n     trains, planes, water vessels, and pipelines) and individual \n     freight shippers.\n       During 1999, FHWA provided $750,000 to further develop \n     NTNAC and to complete the study ``National Transportation \n     Impact of Latin American Trade Flows.''\n       The DOT agrees that NTNAC shows great promise of producing \n     a tool that would be useful for analyzing the national \n     transportation system as a single, integrated system. We \n     agree that NTNAC would provide DOT with important new \n     capabilities to assess and formulate critical policy and \n     investment options and to help address homeland security and \n     vulnerabilities in the Nation's transportation network.\n       However, the Department's budget is very limited. It would \n     be difficult to find funding to continue the project this \n     year. If funding should become available, we will give \n     priority consideration to continuing the NTNAC development \n     effort.\n       Again, I very much appreciate your thoughts on the \n     importance of continuing the development of NTNAC. If I can \n     provide further information or assistance, please feel free \n     to call me.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Norman Y. Mineta.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The bill I am introducing today establishes a six-year \nprogram in the Office of the Secretary of Transportation to complete \nthe development of the advanced transportation simulation model. The \nprogram will also support early deployment of computer software and \ngraphics packages to Federal agencies and States for national, \nregional, or statewide transportation planning. The bill authorizes a \ntotal of $50 million from the Highway Trust Fund for this effort. When \ncompleted, NATMAP will provide the nation a tool to help formulate and \nanalyze critical transportation policy and investment options, \nincluding major infrastructure requirements and vulnerabilities within \nthat infrastructure.\n  Next year Congress will take up the reauthorization of TEA-21, the \nsix-year transportation bill. I am introducing this bill today so my \nproposal can be fully considered by the Senate's Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and by the Administration as the next authorization \nbill is being developed. I look forward to working with Senator \nJeffords, the Chairman of EPW, and Senator Smith, the ranking member, \nas well as Senator Reid, the Chairman of the Transportation, \nInfrastructure, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee and Senator Inhofe, the \nranking member, to incorporate this bill in the reauthorization of TEA-\n21.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require that activities carried out by the United \nStates in Afghanistan relating to governance, reconstruction and \ndevelopment, and refugee relief and assistance will support the basic \nhuman rights of women and women's participation and leadership in these \nareas; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill for myself \nand Senator Durbin that would ensure that U.S. funded activities in \nAfghanistan support the basic human rights of women and women's \nparticipation and leadership in all areas of society, development, and \ngovernance. Importantly, it also specifies that direct aid should be \ntargeted to the Ministry of Women's Affairs, which will play a critical \nrole in the new government.\n  Women in Afghanistan have made significant progress since the Taliban \nwas removed from power last year, but there is still a long way to go \nbefore women are restored to the place they held in society and \ngovernment before the Taliban took power in 1996.\n  As I told Chairman Karzai when I visited the country in February, if \nhe is truly to restore the people's faith and confidence in the Afghan \ngovernment, women cannot be excluded from the reconstruction process. \nThe recent loya jirga did make some strides in the right direction. \nEleven percent of the participants were women, although only 20 of the \n180 total women were elected--with the rest being appointed. Also, the \nMinister of the Women's Affairs Ministry, Sima Simar, was one of the \ntwo Deputy Chairs of the loya jirga. Yet, clearly, much remains to be \ndone before Afghan women will fully rebuild their health, their \neducation, their welfare, their security, and their self-dignity.\n  Before the Taliban, Afghan women enjoyed both stature and freedom. In \nfact, many Americans may be unaware that Afghan women were not only \nwell educated, they constituted 70 percent of the nation's school \nteachers, half the government's civilian workers, and 40 percent of the \ndoctors in the hospital.\n  We are all now aware that with the rise of the Taliban, the lives of \nAfghan women dramatically changed. Women were banished from the \nworkforce. They were not allowed to earn an living or to support \nthemselves or their family, even if they were the sole family \nbreadwinner. Tens of thousands of women widowed by decades of war had \nno option to provide for their families. Many turned to begging and \nprostitution.\n  Girls could not attend school and women were expelled from \nuniversities. In fact, incredibly, women were prohibited from even \nleaving their homes at all unless accompanied by a close male relative, \neven in the event of a medical emergency for themselves or their \nchildren. These women were under house arrest, prisoners in their own \nhome.\n  And, if that wasn't bad enough, they were prisoners within \nthemselves. The Taliban went to great and inhumane lengths to strip \nwomen of their sense of pride and personhood. Afghan women were forced \nto wear a burqa, a head to toe covering, to make them invisible to the \nworld. And for those who dared tread upon or flout these laws, \npenalties for violations of Taliban law ranged from beatings to public \nfloggings and executions--all state sanctioned.\n  Of course, the Taliban is gone now. Women are slowly returning to \nschool and to work. They are beginning to return to their homes from \nrefugee camps. Some are even taking part in the new Afghan government. \nBut problems still exist.\n  Afghan women still make up 75 percent or more of the refugees and \ninternally displaced in camps, urban areas, and villages. Afghan women \nstill do not have access to sufficient primary health care services, \nincluding pre- and postnatal care, leading to one of the highest \nmaternal mortality rates in the world. And it is believed that more \nthan 90 percent of Afghan women are illiterate, which disqualifies them \nfrom participation in government.\n  Every member of society has a role to play in rebuilding, and the \nrole of women is especially important. Throughout Afghanistan's years \nof war, it was women who were responsible for food, shelter, and other \nbasic human needs. Now, during Afghanistan's massive redevelopment, \nimpowering women is critical to improving education, primary health, \nand overall development. Women must be taught the skills they need and \nbe given access to the necessary resources to take control of their own \nlives and in turn foster full redevelopment of their country.\n  The United States has been a leader in assisting Afghanistan, in \nfact, the\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\nUnited States is the largest single provider of assistance to the \nAfghan people, making substantial contributions to emergency relief and \nhumanitarian efforts. While we have done much for Afghanistan, \ncompleting our mission there will require more. Strong and continued \nsupport from the United States will ensure that the advances made by \nAfghan women since the fall of the Taliban will continue and grow, \nrather than recede.\n  By requiring that United States assistance funds to Afghanistan \npromote access for Afghan women to health, education, development, \ngovernance, and security, this bill will help ensure the prosperity and \nhuman rights of all Afghan people. As I've said repeatedly, we are \nabsolutely right to help Afghanistan build for the future, because as \nwe've discovered, we cannot hope for security here until we lay the \ngroundwork for stability there. And we cannot have true stability there \nif women are left out of the equation.\n  This bill directs that assistance go to support the Ministry of Women \nand Children's Affairs, an important new ministry that is essential for \nreestablishing women's human rights, ensuring that women are included \nin all development efforts, and delivering critical legal, health, \neducation, and economic services to women throughout Afghanistan.\n  The bill also calls for a portion of United States development, \nhumanitarian and relief assistance to be channeled to local Afghan \norganizations so that these organizations, with an already developed \nexpertise, can achieve results quickly as time is of the essence. Local \nwomen's organizations are delivering critical services and have the \nknowledge and experience to assist the United States in delivering \neffective relief aid. These groups need our support.\n  The bill also directs financial assistance to build a health \ninfrastructure to deliver high-quality comprehensive health care \nprograms, and an education infrastructure for primary through higher \neducation for Afghan girls and boys, vocational training for women and \nmen, and retraining for former combatants. Education is the heart of \nprogress and nowhere is this more critical than in Afghanistan.\n  Finally, the bill ensures that all United States training of the new \nAfghan police and security forces include training on the protection of \nhuman rights, especially for women, whose rights have been violated for \nso long. This must end and training for this will give the new \nauthorities the training and knowledge to help stop it.\n  The potential for prosperity in Afghanistan will only be realized \nwhen, as in the United States, both men and women have an opportunity \nto participate and contribute. That is what this bill is all about, \nensuring that women have the access needed to participate and \ncontribute in all aspects of rebuilding their country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Frist, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Gramm, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 2648. A bill to reauthorize and improve the program of block \ngrants to States for temporary assistance for needy families, improve \naccess to quality child care, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with my \ncolleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, to introduce the Personal \nResponsibility, Work and Family Promotion Act of 2002.\n  This legislation is based on President Bush's plan to strengthen \nwelfare reform, and on the bill already passed by the House of \nRepresentatives over one month ago.\n  The 1996 welfare reform law expires this year, and it is important \nthat the Senate work quickly to strengthen one of the most successful \nreforms we have seen in decades. The results are clear: Welfare reform \nhas been enormously successful. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, \nfrom 1996 to 2000, the number of mothers participating in TANF, \nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families, decreased by about 50 percent; \n2.3 million fewer children live in poverty today than in 1996, Heritage \nFoundation. The poverty rate for African-American children has fallen \nto the lowest point in U.S. history. Employment of young single mother \nhas nearly doubled, and employment of single mothers who are high-\nschool dropouts has risen by two-thirds. And this, amidst arguments \nmade in 1996 that this law would seen millions of people into poverty.\n  While this is good news, and shows the importance or reforms enacted \nin 1996, we will have work to do. Significant numbers of welfare \nrecipients are still not employed and on their way to self-sufficiency. \nThat is why I am here today. I join with Senator Sessions to introduce \nthe President's welfare reform plan.\n  This legislation maintains the important features of the 1996 welfare \nreform law. It emphasizes the themes of work, State flexibility, \nmarriage, and child well-being. Our goal for every family on welfare is \nto lead them to self-sufficiency.\n  While States have made great improvements in moving recipients to \nwork, much more needs to be done. This legislation requires that each \nwelfare recipient would have an individual plan devised for them that \nmaps out their plan to self-sufficiency. Recognizing that everyone has \ndifferent barriers in gaining employment, these individual plans would \naddress the specific needs of each individual and provide opportunities \nfor meaningful activity.\n  Recipients would be required to participate in activities for 40 \nhours per week, simulating the work week of the typical American. This \n40 hours is composed of 24 hours of actual work, and 16 hours of work-\nrelated activities, such as job search, training, education, drug \ntreatment, marriage and relationship counseling, and parenting \neducation. And states are required to increase their work participation \nrates with modest increases each year. By 2007, States must have 70 \npercent of recipients participating in work.\n  We have added an important provision in this legislation to ensure \nthat the work requirements stay strong. Due to credits that states can \nreceive under current law, many work participation rates are \neffectively close to 0 percent. This bill requires that by 2007, states \nhave 55 percent of their caseloads working, irrespective of credits \nthat the State receives for moving recipients to work. This is an \nimportant provision that ensures that states are actually focusing on \nwork. With the strengthening of these work requirements, we also \nprovide significant new flexibility for states. States may apply for a \nnew State flex program, allowing them to improve service delivery to \nrecipients across various programs.\n  TANF is not the only program that benefits low-income persons. Food \nstamps, workforce investment programs, Federal housing programs, and \nadult education programs all serve similar populations, yet program \nrequirements are often different. The differences in the administration \nof these programs often deters caseworkers and recipients from knowing \nabout all the programs available to them. This state flex program would \nallow a state to apply to the appropriate Cabinet secretaries for \napproval. States must continue to serve the same general population, \nbut they could devise a more cohesive approach to delivery of services \nand program eligibility. Waivers could only be granted to proposals \nthat are likely to improve the quality of the programs involved, and \nstates must have specific objectives in their proposal. Regular \nreporting to Congress is included to maintain proper oversight. This \nnew flexibility will provide a real opportunity to serve low-income \npopulations seamlessly and without conflicting and cumbersome program \nrequirements.\n\n  This bill also provides a modest new investment in supporting healthy \nmarriage. A child born and raised outside of marriage will spend an \naverage of 51 percent of his childhood in poverty. However, a child \nborn and raised by both parents in an intact marriage will spend only 7 \npercent of his childhood in poverty.\n  While one of the goals of welfare reform is to encourage the \nformation and maintenance of two-parent families, this issue has gone \nlargely unaddressed. This legislation authorizes $200 million in \nfederal funding to reverse the trend of out-of-wedlock births. States \nmay use funds for various purposes, including marital preparation \nprograms, high school courses\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\nabout the benefits of healthy marriage, and relationship counseling. \nStates will have the flexibility to use the program or programs that \nthey determine work best for them.\n  Children raised by single parents are 5 times more likely to live in \npoverty, 2-3 times more likely to show behavioral problems, and twice \nas likely to commit crimes or go to jail. Marriage and family formation \nprograms will not force anyone into marriage, but will provide people \nwith the tools to improve their relationships, both at home, and in the \nworking world.\n  Finally, important TANF funding would be maintained. Despite an \nunprecedented decline in the caseload, this legislation maintains TANF \nfunding at $16.5 billion a year. In addition, the supplemental grants, \nwhich are important to my home state of Arkansas, are also \nreauthorized.\n  This legislation provides an additional $1 billion in child care \nfunding. Mandatory funding for the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant would increase to almost $3 billion over the next 5 years.\n  While this bill increases mandatory funding for child care, I am \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee to reauthorize and improve the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant. That process is moving forward, and I hope \nthat these two both the TANF issues in the Finance Committee, and the \nchild care issues in the HELP Committee, will be merged when they are \nconsidered before the full Senate.\n  I hope that the Finance Committee takes this legislation into \nconsideration as they work to formulate a plan. I believe that the \nPresident's plan has strong support, as evidenced by the quick action \nin the House of Representatives, and I encourage my colleagues to join \nme in this effort to improve upon the impressive results in welfare \nreform that we have seen so far. More remains to be done, however, in \nour quest of working towards independence.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President. I rise today along with my colleague, \nSenator Hutchinson, to introduce legislation to reauthorize the 1996 \nwelfare reform law. Based on the President's welfare improvement \ninitiatives, including promoting independence through work, State \ninnovation and promoting health marriage and family foundation, this \nbill builds upon the success of the 1996 welfare reforms. Since \nCongress passed welfare reform in 1996, welfare rolls have fallen \ndramatically. Poverty has declined across all categories. Child hunger \nhas declined. More single mothers are employed and their income is \nstill increasing. Out-of-wedlock births have begun to level off. And \nmore children are growing up in married households. By tying welfare to \nwork, the 1996 reforms succeeded in making people self-sufficient and \nindependent. Yet there is still more that needs to be done.\n  Our bill will continue to promote independence through work by \ngradually increasing the work participation standards and allowing \nworkers to use up to 16 hours a week for activities to prepare them for \nthe workforce including education and training, substance abuse \ntreatment, and job readiness assistance. These 16 hours will enable \nwelfare recipients to not only find employment, but to open up \nopportunities to become independent and self-sufficient.\n  States need the resources and the flexibility that will allow them to \ncontinue to help families leave welfare for work. This legislation will \nimplement the President's ``state flexibility waivers'' which allow \nstates to integrate anti-poverty programs from different federal \ndepartments.\n  Senator Hutchinson and I, as members of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee will continue to work with our colleagues \nto develop meaningful and comprehensive child care legislation to \ncomplement the welfare reform bill. I believe that we must work hard to \ncreate child care programs that focus on school readiness and an end to \nthe welfare cycle.\n  Part of this legislation includes $200 million in grants to states \nfor marriage promotion. One of President Bush's top priorities this \nyear has been to remove the financial penalties against marriage within \nthe welfare system and to provide services and supports to couples who \nchoose marriage for themselves. Our bill will assist them in acquiring \nthe knowledge and skills necessary to form and sustain healthy, loving \nand protective marriages. Study after study has shown the \nunquestionable benefits marriage has on our society.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to passing meaningful \nwelfare reform legislation that continues to improve upon the welfare \nreforms of 1996 and gives states the resources and flexibility they \nneed to help families become stronger and more self-sufficient. I thank \nmy colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson for his work and \ndedication to welfare reform, and I thank President Bush for his vision \nand his dedication to getting this done.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 2649. A bill to provide assistance to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic \nin developing foreign countries; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Frist in \nintroducing this important legislation to help in the international \nbattle against the AIDS pandemic. AIDS is the fourth leading cause of \ndeath in the world. This disease ends lives, destroy families, \nundermines economies, and threatens the stability and progress of \nentire nations.\n  We in America know the pain and loss that this disease cruelly \ninflicts. Millions of our fellow citizens, men, women, and children, \nare inflected with HIV/AIDS, and far too many have lost their lives.\n  While we still seek a cure to AIDS, we have learned to help those \ninfected by the virus to lead long and productive lives through the \nmiracle of prescription drugs.\n  But this disease knows no boundaries. It travels across borders to \ninfect innocent people in every continent across the globe.\n  We have an obligation to continue the fight against this disease at \nhome. But we should also share what we have learned to help those in \nother countries in this life-and-death battle. And we must do all we \ncan to provide new resources to help those who cannot afford today's \ntherapies.\n  We must carry the fight against AIDS to every corner of the globe, \nand the legislation that I am introducing with Senator Frist today is a \nstep in that direction.\n  The International AIDS Treatment and Prevention Act provides new \nlegal authority and funding to our Nation's strongest health care \nagencies to join the global battle against AIDS. It promotes models of \ncommunity-based care that reach the real people affected by this \ndisease; better access to the research and therapies needed to prevent \ntransmission of this deadly disease; and most importantly, funds \nresearch and treatment models to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS from \nmothers to their infants including the family support services \nnecessary to stem the orphan crisis.\n  Governments can make the difference in battling this epidemic. When \ngovernments in poor countries have been provided resources to fight the \nspread of AIDS, infection rates have dropped 80 percent. With this \nlegislation, the United States will do its part to support countries to \nturn the corner of AIDS on their own.\n  I am pleased that the administration is increasing funding for the \nfight against the global AIDS epidemic, and together with this \nlegislation, we can truly lead the international community in the fight \nagainst the greatest public health threat of our times.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy today \nto introduce the International AIDS Treatment and Prevention Act. This \nlegislation is another important bipartisan step in our global battle \nagainst AIDS and other infectious diseases. The international crisis of \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria threatens the entire world. We have \ndone much here at home through Ryan White and other programs. We must \nshow we can lead the world against these scourges as well. This \nmorning, President Bush again underscored this administration's \ncommitment, and his personal commitment, to reducing the spread of\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\nHIV/AIDS and demonstrating consistent, compassionate U.S. leadership in \nthis global struggle.\n  When I first came to the Senate eight years ago, HIV/AIDS was a \nlittle understood or recognized problem. In that time I have traveled \nfar from the Senate floor. I have been on seven different medical \nmission trips to Africa, most recently, in January, to Uganda, Kenya \nand Tanzania.\n  The trips have helped reveal to me the impact that one single virus--\nHIV--is having on the destruction of a continent. Not a family. Not a \ncommunity. Not a State. Not a country. An entire continent.\n  The statistics of this plague are shocking. Each year, three million \npeople die of AIDS, one every ten seconds. Twice that many, 5.5 \nmillion--or two every ten seconds--become infected. That is 15,000 \npeople a day. Even more tragically, 6,000 of those infected each day \nare between the ages of 15 and 24. Ninety percent of those infected do \nnot know they have the disease. There is no cure. There is no vaccine. \nAnd the number of people infected is growing dramatically.\n  The disease toll is incalculable. Thirteen million children have been \norphaned by AIDS. Over the next ten years, the orphan population may \nwell grow to 40 million equivalent to the number of American children \nliving east of the Mississippi River. I had the privilege of visiting \nwith Tabu, a 28-year-old prostitute, who was leaving Arusha to return \nto her village to die. She stayed an extra day to meet with us. I will \nnever forget her cheerful demeanor and mischievous smile as we met in \nher small stick-framed mud hut, no more than 12 feet by 12 feet. Her \ntwo sisters are also infected; a third sister has already died. Tabu \nwill leave behind an eleven-year-old daughter, Adija.\n  Not only do HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria produce over 50 \npercent of the deaths due to infectious diseases each year, they have \ncomplex disease patterns that result in facilitating each other's \nspread. By weakening the immune system, infection with HIV increases \nsusceptibility to both tuberculosis and malaria. Furthermore, the \nincreasing number of multi-resistant tuberculosis cases is largely \nattributed to resistance developed in HIV-infected patients. Finally, \nin treating severe anemia that commonly accompanies illness due to \nmalaria, untested blood transfusions create a method of HIV/AIDS \nspread.\n  At home in Tennessee, or even here in Washington, DC, Uganda and \nTanzania feel very far away. But the plague of HIV/AIDS and the chaos, \ndespair and civil disorder it perpetrates only undermines the chance \nfor democracy to flourish. Without civil institutions, there is \ndisorder.\n  Last year in South Africa, one of every 200 teachers died of AIDS. In \na recent study in Kenya, 75 percent of deaths on the police force were \nAIDS-related. HIV-related deaths among hospital workers in Zambia have \nincreased 13 fold in the last decade. These losses devastate local \neconomies. Botswana's economy will shrink by 30 percent in ten years; \nKenya's by 15 percent. Family incomes in the Ivory Coast have declined \nby 50 percent, while health care expenditures have risen by 4000 \npercent.\n  Africa has lost an entire generation. In Nairobi, Kenya, I visited \nthe Kibera slum. With a population of over 750,000, one out of five of \nthose who live in Kibera are HIV/AIDS positive. As I walked the crowded \npathways sandwiched between hundreds of thousands of aluminum shanties, \nI was amazed that there were only children or elderly individuals. The \ndisease had wiped out the parents the most productive segment of the \npopulation teachers, military personnel, hospital workers, and law \nenforcement officers. African orphans therefore lack teachers, role \nmodels and leaders. This leaves them vulnerable to criminal \norganizations, revolutionary militias, and terrorists. Terrorism and \ncrime could become a way of life for a young generation.\n  Africa is not alone. India, with over 4 million cases of HIV/AIDS, is \non the edge of explosive growth. China is estimated to have as many as \n10 million infected persons. The Caribbean suffers from one of the \nhighest rates of infection of any region in the world. Eastern Europe \nand Russia report the fastest growth of AIDS cases. These nations are \nthe next generation in the AIDS crisis they present an opportunity for \nintervention and success if we act quickly and decisively.\n  Due to the social, economic and political destructive effects of this \ndisease, I'm devoting much of my time to this issue, and in particular, \nto the impact of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Just as our great nation is the \nleader in the war on terrorism, we must continue to lead the fight \nagainst AIDS in order to build a better, safer world.\n  There is perhaps no greater global issue than the spread of deadly \ninfectious disease. As President Bush said today, the United States \nmust lead the fight in this international crises. We must now provide \nthe leadership to confront the global HIV/AIDS, malaria, and \ntuberculosis epidemics. History will record how we respond to the call.\n  We fight this battle in two ways: by improving primary prevention and \nexpanding access to treatment. Until science produces a vaccine, \nprevention through behavioral change and awareness is the key. And once \nagain, cultural stigmas must be overcome. Through a combination of \ncomprehensive national plans, donor support and community-based \norganizations, we can make progress. We know that prevention and \ntreatment go hand and hand, and that the necessary infrastructure must \nbe present in order to delivery care.\n  I have already introduced legislation with Senator Kerry--the U.S. \nLeadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2002. \nThis act would direct the President to work with foreign governments, \nthe United Nations (UN), the World Bank, and the private sector to \nestablish the Global AIDS and Health Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria, \nand tuberculosis. This fund would provide grants to governments and \nnon-governmental organizations for implementation of effective and \naffordable HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs. Additionally, \nthis legislation requires a comprehensive American strategy for \ncombating these infectious diseases, enhances programs targeted toward \nempowering women, links debt relief to implementation of health \nprograms, extends military to military prevention activities and \nestablishes an incentive program for American clinicians to provide \ntheir expertise abroad.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Kennedy and \nothers is a companion to the Foreign Relations bill. This bill codifies \nand expands current authorities of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, to participate in appropriate HIV/AIDS prevention, \ntreatment, care, and support activities in resource poor nations that \nare experiencing an HIV/AIDS crisis. Coupled with S. 2525, the United \nStates Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of \n2002, this legislation would provide a better coordinated, enhanced \nU.S. response to the global pandemic of HIV/AIDS.\n  Under The International AIDS Treatment and Prevention Act of 2002, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to implement \nHIV, tuberculosis, and malaria prevention, treatment, care and support \nservices principally through the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and, where appropriate, with the assistance and technical \nexpertise of the Health Resources and Services Administration, (HRSA) \nthe Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health \n(NIH). The Secretary is also granted the authority to alter or renovate \nfacilities in foreign countries as is necessary to conduct programs for \ninternational health activities and to establish family survival \npartnership grants for the provision of medical care and support to HIV \npositive parents and their children.\n  This legislation, coupled with the S. 2525, represents an important \nstep forward in our response to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. \nHistory will judge how we as a nation--how we as a global community--\naddress and respond to this most devastating and destructive public \nhealth crisis we have seen since the bubonic plague ravaged Europe over \n600 years ago.\n  The task looms large, but by uniting with leadership and dedication \nfrom all--we will succeed in counteracting the devastation of HIV/AIDS \nand stop its advance.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5781-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 288--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT NEW \n HAMPSHIRE RESIDENTS KEN CURRAN AND GEORGE McAVOY BE HONORED FOR THEIR \n    INITIATIVE ON BEHALF OF THE TAXPAYER AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE \n    CONSTRUCTION OF THE MOORE RESERVOIR CAUSEWAY IN LITTLETON, NEW \n                               HAMPSHIRE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S.

Res. 122\n\n       Whereas the status quo on Cyprus remains unacceptable;\n       Whereas a just and lasting resolution of the Cyprus \n     problem, on the basis of United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions, must safeguard the security and fundamental \n     rights of all citizens of Cyprus, Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-\n     Cypriots alike;\n       Whereas Cyprus is among the leading candidate countries for \n     accession to the European Union, in recognition of its \n     commitment to free markets, human rights, democracy, and the \n     rule of law;\n       Whereas the European Union guarantees to all its citizens \n     the indivisible universal values of human dignity (supporting \n     fair and equal treatment of all), freedom (right to security, \n     marriage, family, among others), equality (celebrating \n     cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity), solidarity \n     (protecting workers' rights and providing social security), \n     citizens' rights (voting), and justice (holding a fair \n     trial);\n       Whereas membership in the European Union will guarantee \n     each citizen of Cyprus important legal, civil, and human \n     rights, as well as the means and legal recourse necessary to \n     secure the full application of these fundamental individual \n     rights, and to promote the respect of cultural diversity and \n     traditions;\n       Whereas membership in the European Union will bring \n     significant benefits to both the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-\n     Cypriot communities, including new economic opportunities, \n     access to new markets, a freer exchange of goods and \n     services, balanced and sustainable development as well as the \n     free movement of persons, goods, and services and capital;\n       Whereas the European Council in its Summit Conclusions of \n     December 1999, in Helsinki, stated that ``a political \n     settlement [of the Cyprus problem] will facilitate the \n     accession of Cyprus to the European Union . . . [i]f no \n     settlement has been reached by the completion of accession \n     negotiations, the Council's decision on accession will be \n     made without the above being a precondition'';\n       Whereas both the United States and the European Union in \n     their summit statement on the New Transatlantic Agenda of \n     June 14, 2001, pledge to continue to work together to support \n     the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General to \n     achieve a comprehensive settlement with respect to Cyprus \n     consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions and to continue to work toward the resumption of \n     talks;\n       Whereas resolution of the Cyprus problem is in the \n     strategic interests of the United States, given the important \n     location of Cyprus at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and \n     Asia; and\n       Whereas resolution of the Cyprus problem is also consistent \n     with American values, as enshrined in the rights guaranteed \n     by the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees \n     the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the unacceptable status quo on Cyprus must be ended and \n     the island and its people be reunited, in a bizonal, \n     bicommunal federal Cyprus, on the basis of United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions;\n       (2) the accession of Cyprus to the European Union would act \n     as a catalyst for the solution of the Cyprus problem without \n     the latter being a precondition for accession;\n       (3) membership of Cyprus to the European Union should be \n     strongly supported;\n       (4) all Cypriots be urged to support and encourage efforts \n     to bring Cyprus into the European Union; and\n       (5) the various agencies of the United States Government \n     should pursue vigorously and as an issue of high and urgent \n     priority new initiatives that will help promote and achieve \n     reunification, reconciliation, stability, and prosperity on \n     Cyprus.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution for \nmyself and Senators Biden and Sarbanes expressing support for Cyprus' \nmembership to the European Union, EU.\n  After 27 years Cyprus remains a divided nation. As it works to \ncomplete final negotiations with the EU, Cyprus will have met all the \ncriteria required of an EU member nation. It is expected that an \nofficial invitation for membership will come this December, with \naccession in 2004. As an EU member, the entire island of Cyprus will \nsee economic benefits. As long as the Turkish-Cypriots recognize this \nfact, both they and Greek-Cypriots will be on the path towards further \neconomic growth and integration with Europe. All Cypriots will have \naccess to new markets, a freer exchange of goods and services, balanced \nand sustainable development as well as the free movement of persons, \ngoods and services, and capital. But EU membership is not only about \neconomic prosperity, it is also about human rights. The EU guarantees \nits members' citizens human, legal and civil rights as well as the \nmeans and legal recourse necessary to secure the full application of \nthese fundamental individual rights.\n  Last year Congressman Bilirakis introduced this legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives to show that body's support for Cyprus' \naccession to the EU. We are introducing this legislation today to put \nthe Senate on record as well. Since January, Cypriot President Clerides \nand Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash have been meeting in direct talks \nto seek a resolution of the division of Cyprus. Although the fact that \nthese meetings are taking place is a positive sign, a solution must not \nbe a precondition to EU membership. In fact, the EU Council made this \npoint in the Helsinki Summit in December 1999, when it stated that ``a \npolitical settlement will facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the \nEuropean Union . . . [i]f no settlement has been reached by the \ncompletion on accession negotiations, the Council's decision on \naccession will be made without the above being a precondition''.\n  Cyprus' EU membership will be, and has been, a catalyst for the \nsolution of the Cyprus problem. This fact is reflected in the almost 40 \ndirect meetings between President Clerides and Denktash have taken \nplace so far this year. If it were not for Turkey's desire to be an EU \nmember, knowing that other EU members could block this goal, it is \nquestionable whether these talks would even be taking place. That, \nalong with improved economic prosperity and guaranteed human rights, is\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\nwhy it is vital that the Senate go on record as supporting Cyprus' EU \nmembership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5782-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3897.

Mr. President, I speak on behalf of the pending \namendment. I strongly support it and would like to finally see this \nissue brought to a successful conclusion after many years.\n  I first introduced legislation on concurrent receipt back in 1992, \nagain in 1993, again in 1995, and again in 1999. In 1999, I introduced \nlegislation that became law as a compromise measure that paid special \ncompensation pay for severely disabled military retirees with \ndisabilities greater than 50 percent.\n  Here we are in 2002 with an opportunity to finally rectify a problem \nthat has plagued our veterans, and to rectify it once and for all for \nall military retirees who have become disabled during their military \nservice.\n  We have an opportunity to show a measure of our gratitude to these \nbrave men and women who are serving our Nation as we speak in a time of \nwar that all of us agree may be of very long duration.\n  The existing law, as it stands, is simply discriminatory and wrong. \nConcurrent receipt is at its core a fairness issue. Present law simply \ndiscriminates against career military people who have been injured or \ndisabled in the conduct of their duties while in defense of this \nNation.\n  I want to emphasize the important aspect of this issue to all of my \ncolleagues.\n  Retired veterans are the only group of Federal retirees who are \nrequired to waive their retirement pay in order to receive VA \ndisability compensation. I want to repeat that. This record must \nreflect the importance of this legislation to correct a gross and \nunfair discrimination against our veterans. Retired veterans are the \nonly group of Federal retirees who are required to waive their \nretirement pay in order to receive VA disability compensation.\n\n  In my view, the two pays are for very different purposes: one for \nservice to the country and the other for physical or mental pain and \nsuffering which occurred in that service to the country.\n  When I first drafted concurrent receipt legislation as ranking member \nof the Personnel Subcommittee, it was cosponsored by my dear friend, \nand former chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, Senator John Glenn, \nin 1992. If he were here today, he would speak as passionately as he \ndid during those years in favor of this legislation.\n  The Retired Pay Restoration Act has received strong bipartisan \nsupport in Congress with 396 cosponsors in the House and 82 cosponsors \nin the Senate.\n  The Military Coalition, an organization of 33 prominent veterans' and \nretirees' advocacy groups, supports this legislation, as do many other \nveterans service organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nAmerican Legion, and Disabled American Veterans.\n  For the brave men and women who have selected to make their career \nthe U.S. military, they face an unknown risk. If they are injured, they \nwill be forced to forego their earned retired pay in order to receive \ntheir VA disability compensation. In effect, they will be paying for \ntheir own disability benefits from their retirement checks.\n  We have a unique opportunity this year to redress the unfair practice \nof requiring disabled military retirees to fund their own disability \ncompensation. Sixty percent is not enough. We need full funding for all \nmilitary retirees. It is time for us to show our appreciation to the \nmen and women who have suffered so much for our great Nation.\n  If we went back and looked at the legislative history of the \nlegislation we passed in 1999, I think a review of the debate and \ndiscussion of that legislation would show that we wanted to cover all \nveterans, but there simply was not enough money. So we drew the line at \nseverely disabled military retirees with disabilities greater than 50 \npercent, with the full intention of expanding that to all veterans.\n  Why did we select 50 percent? It was an arbitrary selection because \nwe knew that over time we would expand it. The reason why we drew the \nline where we did was simply for budgetary reasons.\n  Again, it seems to me, the argument against it is only one; that is, \nwe cannot afford it because it is too large a hit to the budget.\n  I would argue that perhaps we have our priorities a bit skewed if we \nare not going to take care of our veterans as our first priority. So I \nhope we can convince the administration of the justice and fairness \nbehind this proposal. I hope we can get it resolved to the benefit of \nour men and women who have served.\n  I point out that this is an issue not only for veterans who have \nretired and feel inequity, but the active duty members of our military \nare also aware of this situation.\n  So I speak strongly on behalf of the amendment, as one who has been \ninvolved in it, as I said, for nearly 10 years. We have achieved \npartial success now. I hope we can achieve complete success and make \nall veterans eligible for this program and they not have to give up \ntheir retirement pay in order to receive VA disability compensation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/19/senate-section/article/S5790-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
