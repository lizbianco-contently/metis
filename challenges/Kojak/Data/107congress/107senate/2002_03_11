Life never can \nbe the same again. The vivid, haunting images of the shocking attack by \nterrorists flash on the screen of our memory: the horror of the Trade \nCenter towers crashing down; a crushing inferno filled with loved ones \nand friends; a gaping hole in the Pentagon torn by an airliner turned \nmissile; a downed airplane in Pennsylvania kept from its destination \nhere in the Capitol by heroes and heroines.\n  Six months later there has been some healing of our grief, a great \nrebirth of patriotism, and an indomitable resolve to win the war \nagainst terrorism. Most important of all is our confrontation with \nevil, death, and tragedy. These have made us reevaluate our priorities \nand once again put You first in our lives, our families second, our \nloyalty to our beloved Nation third, and our work and careers and the \nthings money can buy last of all. We've vividly seen the shortness of \nlife and the length of eternity.\n  On this 6-month anniversary of September 11, we turn our hearts to \nthose who lost loved ones, especially the families and friends of the \nfirefighters and police officers who made the supreme sacrifice. This \nwill not be an easy day for them. Bless them with Your perfect peace \nand Your courage. Hear our prayer for our military engaged in the war \nagainst terrorism. We are united, we are one, we are Americans! And You \nare our Lord and Saviour.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

National Power Plant Operations Technology and \n     Education Center.\n       ``(a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a \n     National Power Plant Operations Technology and Education \n     Center (the ``Center''), to address the need for training and \n     educating certified operators for electric power generation \n     plants.\n       ``(b) Role.--The Center shall provide both training and \n     continuing education relating to electric power generation \n     plant technologies and operations. The Center shall conduct \n     training and education activities on site and through \n     Internet-based information technologies that allow for \n     learning at remote sites.\n       ``(c) Criteria for Competitive Selection.--The Secretary \n     shall establish the Center at an institution of higher \n     education with expertise in plant technology and operation \n     and that can provide on-site as well as Internet-based \n     training.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment to \nestablish a national energy technology training and education center. \nThis amendment is critical, because, as of yet, no comprehensive \neducation program exists for electric system operators. Meanwhile, our \nenergy sector and electricity grid are becoming increasingly complex.\n  These changes in the electric industry and changes in electricity \nmarket structures require educated, highly-skilled operators and \ntechnicians. In addition, electric system operators are essential to \nreliable and safe generation, transmission, and distribution of \nelectric power. Education programs that provide training specific to \nthe electric industry are rare, because of the way the industry has \nbeen structured and because, for example, most transmission system \noperators are promoted from within and trained on the job, rather than \nhaving had formal training.\n  One goal of an energy training center, such as the one this amendment \nwould create, would be to provide quality education programs for \nworkers who often are unable to participate in college programs, due to \ntheir shift hours or other reasons. These programs would be offered via \nthe Internet, for example, to accommodate these workers. The programs \noffered through this Energy Center would be directly related to the \nindustry, to ensure that a pool of multi-skilled workers are trained to \nmeet the future needs of the industry.\n  The energy industry needs an Internet program to train power plant \nand other technicians to be experts in the various aspects of the \nenergy industry. To respond to this growing need, a certificate and \ndegree program is being developed in collaboration with regional \ntransmission representatives, utility experts, the Electric Power \nResearch Institute, and others. The objectives of this program are (1) \nto prepare well-trained electricity system operators who can adapt and \nbe productive in power plant and process plant technologies and \nenvironments; (2) to provide anywhere, anytime learning opportunities \nthrough Internet courses for presently employed personnel who are \nunable to leave their workplaces to attend courses and/or are \nrestricted by 12-hour work shifts or location in relation to the \neducational site, and (3) to provide an associate degree option in this \nfield.\n  Over the next 10 years, the demand for electric power is expected to \nincrease by approximately 25 percent. Constraints on electric \ntransmission line capacity will result in additional transmission line \nconstruction and improvements that will increase the need for skilled \nline workers. Due to technological advances, line operators will \ncontinue to need to update their knowledge base. Moreover, we will need \nspecially trained people to ensure the continued reliability of our \nenergy infrastructure.\n  The Energy Center would:\n  Work in conjunction with the North American Electric Reliability \nCouncil to promote flexible continuing education opportunities for \nsystem operators to help maintain their required certifications;\n  Offer flexible education opportunities related to the security of the \nelectric industry infrastructure and emergency preparedness;\n  Provide flexible education offerings directly related to the \ngeneration, transmission and distribution sectors;\n  Provide national communication to the electric industry by hosting \nconferences, forming national advisory boards, and facilitating chat \nrooms and web-casts; and\n  Provide simulation opportunities for students to operate \nsophisticated control stations and distributive control systems in a \nsupervised environment.\n  This is an amendment to which I believe both sides will agree. We \nhave had discussions with both sides. As I indicated, I will wait until \nlater to ask that it be voted on. I don't believe it would require a \nrecord vote.\n  This amendment would establish a national energy technology training \nand education center. Changes in the electric industry, and especially \nchanges in the electricity market structures, require a different set \nof skills, a different education for operators and technicians of \nelectric powerplants. In addition to trying to establish that, we would \nestablish an energy training center, which would provide quality \neducation programs for workers who were often unable to participate in \nother programs that would give them the kinds of disciplines that are \nnecessary in this new energy climate.\n  Let me talk more generally about the energy bill on the floor of the \nSenate. I spoke last week at some length about it. The energy bill \nincludes four pieces. First, we need to produce more energy. All of us \nagree on that. We are going to have a disagreement on the issue of \nANWR, but there is no disagreement over whether we should or whether we \nneed to produce more energy. The answer is yes, of course, we must.\n  We have had votes on the floor in recent months on the subject of \nopening up portions of the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida for \nadditional energy production. I voted for that. We have also had \ndiscussions and votes and other legislative consideration in other \nareas to enhance incentives for the production of oil, natural gas, and \ncoal to be used in an environmentally sensitive way to extend America's \nenergy supply. We have to do that.\n  The point is, if that is all we do when we come to the floor of the \nSenate in March of 2002, just to increase the supply of energy, this \ncountry will be consigned to a strategy that I call ``yesterday \nforever.'' Twenty-five years ago, when we debated energy, this is what \nwe discussed; 25 years from now, when we debate energy, this is what we \nwill discuss. It is a ``yesterday forever'' strategy--just dig and \ndrill, dig and drill, and somehow, that represents America's policy. \nThat is not enough.\n  Digging and drilling is important. It is important to do it, and it \nis important to do it the right way, but there is much more to be done. \nSo production, No. 1.\n  Second, conservation. We waste an enormous amount of energy in our \ncountry. We need a title in this energy bill, which is included in the \nbill that is now on the floor of the Senate, that\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\ntalks about conservation--conservation in a range of areas.\n  One important area in this legislation that will be controversial \nwill be a new SEER standard for air-conditioners, called SEER 13. We \nwill have people try to knock that out, but the fact is conservation \nmeans conservation in transportation, conservation with respect to \nefficiency of appliances, and a whole range of areas by which you can \nsave a barrel of oil. A barrel of oil saved is just the same as a \nbarrel of oil produced. So it is important for us, it seems to me, to \nbe concerned about those areas.\n  We also need to be concerned about additional production of energy \nfrom renewables and limitless sources of energy. That includes \nbiodiesel, biomass, wind energy, and a range of others--especially \nsomething I am very interested in, called fuel cells.\n  When I talked about ``yesterday forever,'' I talked about the fact \nthat the automobile has not changed in a hundred years. You still pull \nup to the tank and put the hose in the tank and pump gas. They did it \n100 years ago, and we do it now. The internal combustion engine still \nsucks gas and uses oil. The fact is, we have some interesting work on \nthe horizon suggesting to us, perhaps for the first time, that there \nwill be significant changes. An article in Energy Tech Online by Drew \nRobb is titled ``Houston, We've Got a Solution; Fuel Cells Come Back to \nEarth.'' It talks about much of the initial fuel cell research that was \nfunded by NASA, and although the technology of fuel cells showed \nenormous promise, sky-high costs kept any commercial interest pretty \nmuch as low ebb. Then, in the 1990s, investment poured in as a method \nof reducing toxic emissions and greenhouse gases, and we began to see \nsome real progress. Commercial interests--many which are in the \ndevelopment of funding for fuel cells--now come from the transportation \npower generation and oil suppliers.\n  I drove a fuel cell vehicle on the grounds of the Capitol Building \nsome months ago. It did not make any noise. It did not have an internal \ncombustion engine. It used oxygen and hydrogen that combine to create a \nfuel supply by which this automobile moved, and it pushed water vapor \nout the back end.\n  That is a pretty good deal, it seems to me: A fuel cell engine, and \nthe effluent from the back end of that automobile is water vapor.\n  Does all of that make sense? It does to me.\n  DaimlerChrysler, for example, plans to spend over $1 billion in the \ncoming years on fuel cell research. In April of last year, it unveiled \nits hydrogen-powered car called NECAR 4, based on the Mercedes A \nseries. They developed a prototype hydrogen fuel cell, which is one-\nthird the size of previous versions. Ford, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, and \nothers are pursuing similar projects.\n  The reason I talk about the fuel cell is because it is one of those \nnew technologies that offers the promise of unlimited, clean, quiet, \nsafe, and low-cost energy for the long term. It just makes sense for us \nto move in that direction if we can.\n  How do we do that? As I said, we have been putting gas in our \nautomobiles the same way for a century. Just because every debate in \nthe Senate for 25 years has been a debate about doing more tomorrow \nthat which we did yesterday--that is not a debate, that is just a \nthoughtless policy.\n  I come from a State that produces a fair amount of energy. We produce \noil, coal, some natural gas. We also have the capacity to produce a \nsubstantial amount of wind energy. Last Friday's vote in the Senate to \nextend the production tax credit for wind energy and renewables is very \nimportant. Taking the energy from the wind and using it to turn the \nblades of a new technology turbine, create electricity, and have that \nelectricity course through transmission lines and be sent to somewhere \nin the country that needs it is a very important step in changing our \nenergy mix from an overreliance on natural gas, oil, and coal to a \nreliance as well on limitless and renewable energy supplies.\n  One of the amendments we are going to be discussing in the Congress \nin the next week or so will be what is called the renewable portfolio \nstandard. That is creating an aspiration or a goal on the part of this \ncountry to have a certain percent of our energy needs coming from \nrenewable energy sources by the year 2020.\n  If we have a renewable portfolio standard of 10 percent, utilities \nwill be required to sell 10 percent of their electricity from renewable \nenergy by the year 2020. That makes good sense to me. We will have \npeople in the Chamber of the Senate who think it is not a good idea. I \nthink they are wrong.\n  Recently, I was in that part of the world that has so much \ninstability. I was in central Asia. I was in the ``stans'' countries--\nAfghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan. One only has to go to the Middle \nEast and central Asia to understand how fragile our energy supply is in \nthis country. A substantial amount of our energy, 57 percent, comes \nfrom imported oil. A substantial amount of that comes from the Middle \nEast and central Asia.\n  If, God forbid, a terrorist tonight after midnight found a way to \ncreate an act of terror against the energy supply that comes from the \nMiddle East, our economy would be flat on its back tomorrow morning. It \nis just that simple.\n  Shouldn't we be concerned about that? Of course. The answer is yes. \nToday is the 6-month anniversary of the terror that was visited upon \nthis country on 9-11 last year. We have talked a lot in these last 6 \nmonths about American security, national security, and it is important \nto understand that national security also means energy security.\n\n  When you take a look at what is happening in the Middle East today, \nlook at what is happening in central Asia, then ask yourself: Does it \nmake sense for the biggest, the strongest, the largest economy in the \nworld to be this overly dependent on energy supplies from the Middle \nEast and central Asia? The answer is no.\n  How do we decide to change that? We pass legislation that has some \nreal bite to it in a number of important areas. One of them is, as I \nmentioned, renewable portfolio standards by which we describe that we \nwant the generation of electricity in our country in the future to come \nincreasingly from renewable and limitless sources of energy.\n  We can do this if we decide we want to do it, or we can just slip \nback into the same comfortable debate we have had decade after decade.\n  Will Rogers once said: When there is no place left to spit, you \neither have to swallow your tobacco juice or change with the times. On \nenergy there is really no place left. It is an indelicate way, perhaps, \nof describing our situation, but anyone who understands it understands \nwe have a requirement to do this differently.\n  It is our obligation now to make a difference with respect to energy \npolicy. This is not the best time to be debating energy. I bought \ngasoline yesterday for $1.08 a gallon. In fact, go to a gas station \nthese days and buy a gallon of gas or buy 4 quarts of water. They sell \nwater now in quart jars in the cooler. It will cost you more to buy the \n4 quarts of water than it will a gallon of gasoline. It says a little \nsomething about priorities, I suppose. But it is not a great time to be \ndebating an energy bill when gasoline costs less than water at a gas \nstation.\n  Nonetheless, we would be ill advised as a Senate to believe this is a \ngood time for America's energy supply because somehow the prices are \nlow and that reflects stability for the future. It does not.\n  We must pass an energy bill now. In this next several-week period, it \nis the right thing for this Congress to pass a comprehensive energy \nbill. It ought not be a bill like that which the House of \nRepresentatives passed which, as I said, is a yesterday forever policy. \nIt ought to be legislation that is balanced, that has all four pieces: \nEncouraging additional production, encouraging additional conservation, \npaying attention to additional efficiencies, and providing incentives \nfor additional renewable and limitless supplies of energy.\n  All four of those elements are part of a comprehensive and smart \nenergy policy for this country. It is not a smart energy policy to do \nas the House of Representatives did and simply say we rest our future \non the basis of increased production. That is not a smart energy \npolicy.\n  Senator Bingaman and my colleagues on the Energy Committee have \nworked\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\non this legislation. It has some significant points of disagreement, no \nquestion about that. ANWR will be hotly debated. My colleague from \nAlaska has a passionate feeling about that, as do some others. CAFE \nstandards will be passionately debated, and the Senate will make \ndecisions about both of them.\n  In the longer term, the question of whether we succeed for this \ncountry in developing an energy policy that moves this country ahead, \nreduces its dependence on foreign sources of energy, and increases this \ncountry's energy and national security will depend on whether we pass \nlegislation that is balanced in all four areas I have mentioned.\n  At the start of my presentation, I offered an amendment. It is now \npending. I believe it will be accepted by both sides at some point when \nthey have considered other legislation.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for allowing me to proceed. He has \nsomething like 564 charts or close to that. I suspect he will be making \na long presentation on a subject about which he is very passionate.\n  Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alaska, I have visited \nAlaska. It is a wonderful State. We might have disagreements about \ncertain production in Alaska, but I think he certainly speaks \naggressively on behalf of his view of those issues. I do think he is \nright on the point that we must produce more. The question is not \nwhether; the question is how do we produce more and where do we produce \nmore.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Feinstein). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In response to Senator Dorgan regarding his amendment \nwhich covers powerplant operator training, the amendment establishes, \nas he has noted, a national center to address the need for training and \neducational activities of operators of electric generator plants.\n  I think we would all agree we can improve this even though operators \nhave been trained in the past. But I want to emphasize the amendment \nwould improve the training of the operators and their ability to do \ntheir job safely and efficiently. Therefore, I have no objection to the \namendment. My only concern is we have some norm that is reasonable in \nthe training, but I want to assure the Senator we will accept the \namendment in the spirit of moving along on the energy bill.\n  I want to comment on several aspects of amendments which we are going \nto be taking up very soon. There are a couple of points I want to \naddress specifically. One is the Akaka Hawaii oil study which makes \ntechnical changes to the study language which is contained in section \n1702 of the original Daschle bill. It requires the Department of Energy \nto assess the economic implications for Hawaii of its dependence on oil \nas a resource for most of its energy needs.\n  I remind my colleagues the oil that Hawaii receives comes from \nAlaska. It comes in U.S. ships because the Jones Act mandates the \ncarriage of commodities between two American ports has to be on a U.S. \nvessel. So this is a significant contributor to the American merchant \nmarine inasmuch as it must use a U.S. vessel built in a U.S. yard with \nU.S. crews for the benefit of Hawaii.\n  I want to assure the Senator from Hawaii that the amendment has been \ncleared by both sides. It is an amendment of a technical nature. It \nspecifically requires the Department of Energy to assess the economic \nimplications of the dependence on oil as its principal source of energy \nfor the Hawaiian Islands. I have indicated I support the amendment.\n  We should all be concerned about the economic dependence of our \nStates on imported oil. Hawaii uses about 99.8 percent of its \nelectricity needs generated from oil. Of the 50-plus million barrels of \noil consumed in Hawaii, it comes primarily from Alaska. There is some \nthat is imported as well, but the imported oil comes in foreign ships \nwith foreign crews. As a consequence, the State Department indication \non tourism indicated the transportation fuel prices caused \nsubstantially high impacts on the Hawaiian economy. Higher fuel means \nhigher airplane tickets. Higher energy costs means higher hotel bills.\n  So I agree with my friends from Hawaii, we should investigate our \noptions to ensure energy security. I know the Senator from Hawaii has \nbeen working on the strategic petroleum reserve in case there are \ninterruptions because of Hawaii's dependence on imported fuel, and I \nsupport that.\n  There is also an amendment we can accept, and that is the Bingaman \nU.S.-Mexico energy technology cooperation. This amendment authorizes \n$23 million over the next 5 years for projects to improve energy \nefficiency and reduce environmental impacts of economic development \nalong the U.S.-Mexican border. It is the same as a bill approved by the \nSenate in the 106th Congress. I am pleased to join with Senator \nBingaman in supporting this.\n\n  The program improves environmental quality and protection of public \nhealth along the southern border with Mexico, and it prompts energy-\nefficient, environmentally sound, and economic development. As we \naddress transboundary problems like air pollution and climate change, \nwe are going to need these kinds of partnerships with other nations \nobviously, sharing the recommendations of Members from those States \nthat join our southern border. Clearly, they know what is in the best \ninterest of their area and their State. As a consequence, I respect \nthat and, hence, support the Bingaman U.S.-Mexico energy technology \ncooperation.\n  We have another amendment we will be taking up tomorrow, and it is \nthe Feinstein energy trading market oversight. I think we are going to \nprobably be having some spirited discussions on this amendment. I am \nanxious to learn a little more from the Senator from California. As I \nunderstand, the amendment could potentially disrupt both the electrical \nand natural gas trading markets. I hope that would not be the case, and \nperhaps this could be brought out in the debate, but if it is the case \nit could lead to significant increases in the price of electricity and \nnatural gas to consumers throughout the country. It could also lead to \nenergy price and supply problems on the level--I would hope not--of the \nCalifornia disaster of last year. It seems to have a nationwide \napplication.\n  I want to emphasize these could be cases because, frankly, we do not \nreally know. The amendment has materialized without any hearings, \nwithout any witnesses, without any testimony from the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission and the SEC or the Justice Department. So we do \nnot have any real analysis.\n  We do not know what problem this amendment is trying to fix. On the \nother hand, I look forward to the debate. Perhaps we will be \nenlightened by the Senator from California. We do not know if this \namendment actually fixes the problem, let alone recognizes the problem. \nWe do not know if this amendment has the right problem. So we look \nforward to some clarification.\n  One thing is clear, if this amendment is intended to prevent another \nEnron from occurring, in my opinion it will not work. Enron's collapse \nhad nothing to do with the energy trading business. It was triggered \nwhen Enron's other business activities raised questions of accounting \nirregularities and conflict of interest among the company's executives. \nIn other words, Enron's bankruptcy was not the result of unregulated \nenergy trading. It was the result of Enron's bad judgment, bad \naccounting practices, a fundamental lack of honesty, and a loss of \ninvestors' confidence.\n  Even if this amendment had been adopted 10 years ago, I do not see \nhow it would have done anything but recognize the free market would \ndictate an environment where Enron still would have collapsed.\n  Many other honest and legitimate energy trading businesses have done, \nand are continuing to do, the very same kind of energy trading in which \nEnron was engaged. They have not gone bankrupt.\n  We all want information disclosure, and good corporate management. We \nall want to fix the problem and prevent\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\nanother Enron from occurring, we want to protect the stockholders and \nemployee pension funds, and not inadvertently sow the seeds of an even \ngreater problem.\n  Let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Let us make sure we \nknow what is being done. Let us fix the problem that needs to be fixed. \nLet us not make the problem worse.\n  This amendment preferably should be introduced as legislation. \nHearings should be held, with testimony from the FEC, the Commodities \nFuture Trading Commission, the Department of Justice, and others. The \ncommittee of jurisdiction should consider testimony, weigh the \nevidence, and report a well thought out bill that really fixes the \nproblem. I would encourage that we become enlightened because it is \nrather inconsistent to recognize that some of these bills that have not \nhad a full evaluation could be dropped in conference, and that is not \nfair to anybody, particularly those who have worked so hard and \npresented responsible legislation.\n  So let us not just satisfy a pile-on, so to speak, to do something \nregardless of whether it works or not. Our $200 billion a year electric \npower system is too important to toy with. Confidence in our future \ntrading businesses is too important not to fix it properly, assuming \nthere is something that needs to be fixed.\n  As a consequence I remain open and yet somewhat guarded in my \nevaluation of whether this amendment is going to do anything other than \npile on more criticism for the manner in which the Enron failure \noccurred.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues, and staff particularly, that \nwhen Enron collapsed two things did not happen. First, we didn't see an \nincrease in electric rates. Second, we didn't see a decrease in supply.\n  The conclusion we can draw is, clearly the system worked. There was a \ntransition where the open market simply picked up the volume that Enron \nwas trading and transferred that over to other organizations to \ncontinue that function. I would hate to have seen a situation occur \nwhere you would have to get approval from FERC on who would pick up \nthat additional responsibility after Enron's failure, as opposed to the \nclear and workable process that filled the vacuum left by Enron. When \nEnron failed, we didn't see price increases, and we didn't see a \nshortage of supply.\n  I have a couple of other points I want to bring up relative to where \nwe are going with this legislation. I doubt very much we are going to \nget anything introduced today on CAFE, although I had hoped that might \noccur. I gather the principals are still in the process of some \ndiscussion.\n  I would like to comment briefly on the electric provisions pending in \nthe Daschle legislation. I think we need to recognize that the process \nis going to require a good deal of input from Members and staff because \nit has not had the evaluation associated with a committee function. \nThere was not an opportunity where a committee could meet and come out \nwith a bipartisan opinion on various aspects of this complex piece of \nlegislation. We are reconciling our different views on electricity, but \none of the things to keep in mind is this industry is not broken. The \nEnron collapse is something else. Again, I add that the industry is not \nbroken. It functions. We have not seen a shortage. We are not seeing \nprice increases. There are those who suggest if it is not broken, why \nfix it? Sometimes Congress is the one fixing things, even when they are \nnot broken.\n  Let me first observe that there are ongoing discussions and \nreconciliation of various views on electricity. I am hopeful and \noptimistic that these discussions will bear some fruit.\n  I would like to discuss the existing provisions in the pending \nDaschle bill as written. The current provisions exemplify the \nfundamental philosophical differences between authors of this provision \nand what I believe is a bipartisan majority of the Senate.\n  First of all, the authors of the electric provision want more Federal \nGovernment participation and control by Federal regulators, which, in \nmy opinion, micromanages the marketplace and preempts State regulation \nwith Federal regulation--you have different regulations, not \nderegulation. Again, think about it--you have different regulations, \nnot deregulation, and, further, to have the Government pick winners and \nlosers rather than trusting the consumers to the obligation of the free \nmarket.\n  There is one reason why these provisions do not have any committee \nblessing. The real reason, of course, is we haven't had any committee \nhearings. We haven't had any markups. We haven't reported anything out.\n  That is the way the majority leader directed it, and he, kept the \ncommittee from proceeding with its responsibility of holding hearings \nand voting out action.\n  I believe the bipartisan majority of the Senate wants electricity \nreform, wants legislation which specifically protects consumers, that \ntries to streamline regulation rather than making it more complex, and \nwants to enhance the competition while preserving State authority.\n  Further, it ensures the reliability of the grid, allows regional \nflexibility, and promotes renewable energy and other types of \ngeneration.\n  I am going to talk a little bit about renewable energy. There is a \ngreat deal of concern and interest in the aspects of renewable energy. \nI am going to take one example, which is something that is exciting to \nmany of us; that is, the potential solar panels being utilized. Of \ncourse, you have to have some sunlight. In the winter in my State of \nAlaska, it is dark a good deal of the time. So a solar panel would not \nnecessarily get you very far.\n  As we look at the contribution of solar energy in relationship to \noil, you have to look at an equivalent of what kind of footprint it \nwould make. Here is a chart that shows 2,000 acres of solar panels that \nproduces the energy equivalent of 4,464 barrels of oil a day. You have \n2,000 acres that would be covered solid with solar panels. That would \nbe two-thirds of the State of Rhode Island.\n  Two thousand acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would \nproduce roughly 1 million barrels of oil per day. I think that gives \nyou a little comparison, if you will, of the footprint associated with \nrenewables in the sense of a meaningful and significant contribution. \nIt is important. We want to continue to look toward the renewables in \nthe future. But we should recognize that there is a legitimate \ntradeoff.\n  We are going to debate ethanol, and it is certainly a significant \nrenewable source of energy. It comes from corn, primarily. If we were \nto take 2,000 acres of ethanol farmland and plant corn, we would \nproduce the equivalent of 25 barrels of oil a day from 2,000 acres. \nTake 2,000 acres of ANWR and it will produce 1 million barrels of oil a \nday.\n  To produce a million barrels of oil, it would take corn fields \ncovering the entire States of New Mexico and Connecticut. You would \nhave to plant all the acres in the State of my friend, Senator \nBingaman, in corn, plus all the acreage in Connecticut to get 1 million \nbarrels of oil. In Alaska, you could get 1 million barrels of oil from \nANWR's 2,000 acres.\n  I have one more renewable energy source that might get the attention \nof some of my colleagues. In the State of the current occupant of the \nchair, the senior Senator from California, there is a wind farm located \nbetween Banning and Palm Springs in San Gorgonio. She is quite familiar \nwith it. I have been through there many, many times. I don't know how \nmany windmills there are on this wind farm, but it is significant. Some \nsuggest it is a Cuisinart for the birds because while flying low they \noccasionally have a problem getting through there. On the other hand, \nhigher flying birds don't have that problem.\n  The point is, you can look at it and say it is a pretty picture, or \nyou can say that there is a rather dramatic footprint that has its own \nattraction, but I think it is important to look at the equivalent \nenergy.\n  I understand this particular area is a little over 1,500 acres of \nwind generators, but 2,000 acres of wind generators produce the energy \nequivalent of 1,815 barrels of oil. Yet 2,000 acres of ANWR produces 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. It would take about 3.7 million acres of \nwind generators--or all of the landmass of Connecticut and Rhode \nIsland--to produce as much energy as the 2,000 acres of ANWR.\n  My point in going through this demonstration is to identify that \nwhile renewables are important, they are simply not the answer for the \nvolume of\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\nenergy we use to move America, whether it is in our automobiles, our \nplanes, our trains, and so forth, and that there is a significant \nfootprint associated with renewables. As indicated, for example, the \nwind does not blow all the time.\n  So as we look at various aspects associated with the electric portion \nthat covers renewables, I think we have to keep in mind, indeed, there \nis a tradeoff.\n  The philosophical difference is apparent when you compare the \nelectric legislation I had introduced earlier this year with the \npending Daschle bill.\n  My legislation was bipartisan. It was S. 388. We had three electric \nprovisions: We had PUHCA, we had PURPA, and we had reliability. The \nPUHCA and PURPA repeal provisions promote competition by reducing \nFederal interference with the marketplace.\n  The electric reliability provision protects consumers by creating an \nindustry-run, Government-overseen electric reliability organization \nthat has clear enforcement authority. Consumers will continue to be \nfully protected because, first, the States will continue to regulate \nretail rates, and, second, FERC will continue to regulate wholesale \nrates, which I feel quite comfortable with and which has worked quite \nwell, in my opinion.\n  Let me identify some of the provisions in the majority leader's \nelectricity title which creates new Federal authority or preempts State \nauthority.\n  Section 202 expands FERC's jurisdiction over utility mergers and \nacquisitions.\n  Section 203 gives FERC new authority to restructure the electric \npower industry with no guidance--absolutely none--from Congress.\n  Section 205 gives FERC authority to order the construction of new \ntransmission lines and to order the sale of electricity on its own \nmotion.\n  Section 206 gives FERC new authority over publicly owned utilities to \norder open access transmission. Although this section exempts all but \nthe largest publicly owned utilities, we all know what happens in \nconference to those exemptions once the principle has been established.\n  Section 207 gives FERC new authority to establish and enforce \nelectric reliability standards, notwithstanding the fact that FERC, in \nmy opinion, does not have the expertise in this area.\n  Section 256 prevents States' consumer protection provisions if they \ngo beyond or are different from Federal consumer protection provisions \nestablished by the Federal Trade Commission.\n  Section 263 places a Federal mandate on the Federal Government to \npurchase renewable energy even if it is too costly or not available. \nMind you, if it is too costly or not available, it still provides a \nFederal mandate on the Federal Government to purchase renewable energy. \nI have a hard time with that--even if it is too costly or not \navailable.\n  Section 265 imposes a Federal Btu tax in the form of what I consider \nan unrealistic, unachievable renewable portfolio mandate, which will \ncost consumers an estimated $12 billion next year.\n  Madam President, I could mention other provisions, but I think you \nget the sense of my concern.\n  But just as important as what is in Senator Daschle's electric title, \nis what is not in it. There are no incentives to build new \ntransmission. We know our transmission lines are choking. There are no \nincentives to build significant new generation. Instead, the majority \nleader's bill places our future in the hands of conservation and \nrenewable energy. Turn off the lights; put a windmill in your backyard.\n  I have long had three principles for good electric legislation: We \nshould deregulate where we can; we should streamline where we cannot \nderegulate; and we should not interfere with States' efforts to protect \ntheir own consumers.\n  The electricity provision of Senator Daschle's bill, in my opinion, \nfails on all three principles. Moreover, it does not do anything \nsignificant to encourage the construction of new electric generation or \ntransmission.\n  Over the past several years, we have seen significant electric supply \nproblems in various parts of this Nation due to inadequate generation \nof transmission. This became particularly acute in California and \nresulted in price spikes and electric blackouts.\n  California is often cited as being on the leading edge of our future, \nand in many ways that is true. Yet I am worried. If you think the \nFederal Government can fix all the problems, then you should like the \napproach taken by the Daschle electric title. If you are like me, you \nwould be somewhat worried about this approach.\n  I mentioned earlier the need for bipartisan efforts in this regard. \nThat would have been the case had the majority leader allowed the \nEnergy Committee to initiate and complete its work. In fact, we had the \nchairman's mark on electricity pending before us when the majority \nleader preempted the committee.\n  The Energy Committee has held 20 hearings on electricity in the 106th \nand 107th Congresses. Last year, the committee even held several days \nof business meetings exploring and marking up energy legislation. And \nlast Congress, the Senate, in an overwhelming, bipartisan effort, \nunanimously passed reliability legislation.\n  Regrettably, all that effort was thrown out the window when the \nmajority leader stripped the Energy Committee of its jurisdiction and \nput energy legislation directly on the Senate calendar.\n  I hope we are able to create an energy policy that enhances domestic \nenergy supply, makes the supply more reliable and affordable, and \nreduces our dependence on imported oil. We need to foster a regulatory \nand investment climate that encourages new energy sources of all types. \nWe are going to need them all. We are going to need oil. We are going \nto need natural gas. We are going to need nuclear. We are going to need \ncoal, electricity, and certainly renewables.\n  We need to encourage the construction of energy infrastructure, \nincluding transmission lines. I think that is what the administration \nstands for. That is certainly what I stand for. I know that is what the \nAmerican people expect Congress to do.\n  So I look forward to working with Senator Bingaman and other Members \nas we address an objective, from our opinion, to take a bill that is \nnot of our liking and to change it by amendments, and work to get this \nbill into conference, because it is one of the priorities of the \nadministration and certainly one of the priorities, I know, of Senator \nBingaman and myself.\n  Madam President, I am going to take a few minutes to enlighten \nMembers on the concern over several articles that appeared in the \nWashington Post and the New York Times over the weekend that I think \neither blatantly misrepresent the facts in relation to the issue of \nopening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to responsible oil and \ngas development or, indeed, are simply conscientious lobbying efforts \nto twist factual information to represent the editorial policies of \nvarious newspapers, specifically the Washington Post and New York \nTimes.\n  In Sunday's edition of the New York Times, it illustrates the height \nof misinformation that has clouded this debate. This is a picture that \nwas taken from the New York Times of March 10. It is rather interesting \nto read this article because it is so inaccurate that one wonders just \nwhat kind of reporting and research was done.\n  This was March 10, the Sunday edition, and it shows an extraordinary \narea under a title that reads ``Oil Industry Hesitates Over Moving Into \nArctic Refuge.''\n  When one looks at this, one has to reflect on what they are looking \nat because it says directly above the picture: Oil Industry Hesitates \nOver Moving Into The Arctic Refuge.\n  This picture we are seeing says: Drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge could soon be legal, but it is far from certain how \nmuch oil may be found if exploration proceeds.\n  The only problem is, that is not the 1002 area of ANWR that might be \nopened to responsible development. This is perhaps somewhere in the \nBrooks Range. It shows a valley, it shows mountains. It shows an \nextraordinary landscape. But it is very misleading because it is not \nthe 1002 area. It is not the 1\\1/2\\ million acres in question.\n  This is the area in question. This is what it looks like on a clear \nday.\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\n  I have been up there. This is my State. I live there. You have what \nthey call whiteouts where the wind and snow blow and you can't see the \nsky. It is all white. If the New York Times chose to put that as \ndepicting the 1002 area, I would not have an issue. That is what it \nlooks like; 10\\1/2\\ months of the year there is ice and snow on the \nground. The Arctic Ocean is open for 40 days a year ice free. That is \nall.\n  I am very disappointed that the New York Times did not show an actual \nportrayal and just threw a picture in of mountains and suggested this \nis the area being debated.\n  It is important Members who are watching at least have some idea. \nThis Coastal Plain is the green area. That is the 1002 area. That is \nthe area where we are considering to whether open for oil and gas \nexploration. It consists of 1.5 million acres. Then this area down \nbelow, the wilderness area, is about 8.5 million acres. And the area in \nthe dark buff color is about 9 million acres. I suspect this picture \nmight have been taken somewhere in the refuge down below where the \nmountains are because that is the mountain area. I have said this area \nis 19 million acres, the size of the State of South Carolina.\n  I also take issue with some of the narrative because they totally \nmisrepresent reality. I will just read from the sixth paragraph:\n\n       Oil companies and industry experts say it is cheaper and \n     more promising right now to exploit large reservoirs of oil \n     elsewhere in the world. And it is easier: many companies fear \n     that drilling in the wilderness area . . .\n\n  There will be no drilling in any wilderness area, none whatsoever. \nThis is a refuge. It is not a wilderness area. The Coastal Plain up \nthere is the area in question. So when they characterize this as \ndrilling in wilderness, it is a total inaccuracy. They should be taken \nto task for it.\n  Let me show a couple more pictures relative to this ANWR area, what \nit generally looks like relative to what is there. We have one village \nup there called Kaktovik where real people live. This is the only \nvillage in the 1002 area and ANWR. You can see the Arctic Ocean out \nthere in the white, covered with ice. And that is the way it is most of \nthe year. This is in the spring. Again, I reflect on the reality that \nthis doesn't look at all like the picture we had previously shown of \nthe mountains because there are no mountains in the 1002 area. It is a \nCoastal Plain. It does not look like that. If you can somehow generate \nor pull out the Coastal Plain or an ocean anywhere near that area, \nobviously I will stand corrected.\n  We have other pictures. This is some of the village activities and so \nforth. I think it is important to note how inaccurate some of this \ninformation is.\n  I would oppose any amendment that would open the wilderness area of \nANWR to oil development. But that is really not what this debate is \nabout. As I have indicated, the 1002 area of ANWR is situated on the \nshores of the Arctic Ocean. It is several thousand miles from the lower \n48. Somebody asked me how many visitors visited ANWR last year. Roughly \n1,100 people have gone up to see for themselves. It is a remote area, \nand it has certainly been the target of frequent misinformation.\n\n  There are some cuddly polar bears that we occasionally see in ads. \nThis is one of them. This was run in the Washington Post. This is \nsomething that appeared on May 15, 2001. It shows Phillips Petroleum's \noperation on the north shore, a very small footprint. That particular \nfacility is producing about 100,000 barrels a day, which puts it in the \ntop dozen of fields in the United States.\n  The picture says: A polar bear and her cubs at rest in Alaska's \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. That picture was taken near Barrow, \nroughly 900 miles further west. It is kind of interesting. I have never \nheard an environmentalist acknowledge what has been one of the greatest \nsaviours of the polar bear; and that is, they are marine mammals and, \nunder Federal law, they cannot be taken as trophies. You can go to \nCanada and Russia and take a polar bear, but you can't take one in \nAlaska. The Natives that live there occasionally take a few for \nsubsistence, but very few. So for all practical purposes, they are \nprotected. To suggest that some action associated with oil and gas \nmight disturb their denning habits, is misleading, there is no \nscientific proof to prove that. I rest my case that the greatest \ncontribution to the lifestyle of the polar bear in Alaska is that we \ncan't shoot them.\n  The interesting thing about this picture of the mountains is that it \nnever even attempts to show anything like a Coastal Plain of ANWR or \n1002 area.\n  The New York Times is in the business of selling papers and probably \nit looks a lot prettier to see those mountains than that blank white \nchart we just showed which is the way it looks a good deal of the time \nin a whiteout. As a matter of fact, you don't go out for a walk. You \ncan get totally disoriented.\n  One of the posters we have was supposed to show caribou in \nundisturbed ANWR. But what they didn't tell you, the photo was taken on \nthe roof of a building in the small village of Kaktovik. That is the \npicture. That shows the Coastal Plain going back into the wilderness \nareas where the mountains are. The mountains back there are very \nbeautiful. That is somewhere in the area of 60 to 90 miles away from \nthe Coastal Plain. Again, it is a matter of trying to orientate people \nwith some degree of accuracy. If you are evidently from the New York \nTimes, you are not necessarily interested in accuracy. You are \ninterested in simply communicating a point of view which represents the \neditorial policy of the newspaper.\n  On the Coastal Plain, winter lasts most of the year. As a matter of \nfact, it is dark for 56 straight days. There is no sunlight. So clearly \nthat would not do very well up there. It is not pristine. It is a harsh \nenvironment, and has a uniqueness and beauty all its own; but there are \nbuildings, an airport, schools, and a radar installation.\n  We have written a letter in the hopes that we can correct the \ninaccuracies associated with the New York Times article, and we think \nit makes sense to ensure our energy security by coming up with \nsolutions. We have the technology to do it safely. What we need is a \ndebate based on facts, not fiction, and the reality of what is and what \nisn't ANWR. Again, I refer to the chart that shows what it looks like \nmost of the time. This isn't what the Times pictured.\n  I would like to address the fact that the Secretary of the Interior \nalso touched on the issue of accuracy in the debate on ANWR and \ndirected a letter to Mr. Tom Brokaw, of ``NBC Nightly News,'' among \nothers. She enclosed a tape--which they were free to use--showing the \nNorth Slope of ANWR in the winter, the only time when energy \nexploration would be allowed under the President's plan. The video was \nproduced for Arctic Power, an organization funded primarily by Alaskans \nand our State government. She indicates she thinks it is important that \nyou have a factual idea from the video of the actual part of ANWR being \ndiscussed so the viewers can have a more accurate understanding of the \nissue.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2002.\n     Mr. Tom Brokaw,\n     NBC Nightly News,\n     New York, NY.\n       Dear Tom: As the U.S. Senate debates President Bush's \n     bipartisan national energy strategy over the next several \n     weeks, I encourage NBC Nightly News to report about the \n     President's initiative to allow environmentally sensitive \n     energy production in the far north slope--commonly called the \n     1002 Area--of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       Enclosed is a betacam tape, which you are free to use, \n     showing the north slope of ANWR in the winter--the only time \n     when energy exploration would be allowed under the \n     President's plan. The video was produced for Arctic Power, an \n     organization funded primarily by the Alaska State government.\n       I think it is important that you have video of the actual \n     part of ANWR being discussed, so that your viewers can have a \n     more accurate understanding of the issue. Frequently during \n     the energy debate, I have watched television programs feature \n     video that resembles ANWR's Brooks Range. This area is \n     designated wilderness in the central portion of the Refuge--\n     and is not the area proposed for energy development.\n       Winter-only exploration in ANWR is just one example of the \n     President's commitment to impose the toughest environmental \n     standards ever applied to oil production. For example, the \n     administration will also require the use of ice roads that \n     melt away in the spring and protect the tundra.\n       Morever, the administration will require directional \n     drilling and smaller production\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\n     pads, so that energy exploration can be accomplished \n     utilizing just 2,000 of the 1002 Area's 1.5 million acres. \n     These stringent requirements must be adopted so we can reduce \n     our dependence on foreign oil and protect ANWR's habitat and \n     the wildlife that call it home.\n       Please call Interior Department communications at 202/208-\n     6416 with further questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gale A. Norton.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, I want to make reference to some of the refuges \nbecause some people make an automatic mental transfer that somehow this \nis a refuge. Therefore, there should not be any exploration occurring \nor any activity of any kind. This chart shows activities associated \nwith oil and gas in various refuges. In California, there are four \nrefuges that produce oil and gas. We only have one in our State of \nAlaska, the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. There are nine in Texas and \nthere are many in Louisiana. These are specific ones. In California, we \nhave the Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, the Sacramento \nNational Wildlife Refuge, Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge, and the \nSutter National Wildlife Refuge, where oil production is taking place \nand some of them are involved in various other discoveries, such as \ngravel, desalinization, and so forth. So, again, saying we are somehow \ninitiating an action in Alaska that is unique and unfounded doesn't \nface the sense of reality.\n  I will conclude by making a reference to the Washington Post and New \nYork Times then and now. As I have already indicated, the editorial \npolicy of the Washington Post is not in support of exploring in ANWR.\n  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record, the Washington \nPost editorial December 25, April 23; April 4, 2001, 1987, and 1989, to \nbe followed by editorials from the New York Times, March 2001, January \n2001, April 1987, June 1988, and March 1989.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 23, 1987]\n\n                    In Alaska: Drill, but With Care\n\n       Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an untouched \n     and fragile place that supports rare mammals and myriad \n     species of birds. It is also the most promising untapped \n     source of oil in North America. Should America drill for it?\n       What Congress decided, in 1980, was not to decide. It \n     ordered a long study. The assessment is now in, and for \n     Interior Secretary Hodel the decision isn't even close: \n     leasing drilling rights to oil companies is ``vital to our \n     national security'' because it ``would reduce America's \n     dependence on unstable sources of foreign oil.''\n       Mr. Hodel is guilty of oversell. A single discovery can't \n     save us from increasing dependence on Persian Gulf oil but \n     the potential economic benefit of development--perhaps tens \n     of billions of dollars of oil--outweighs the risks. The \n     unanswered question is whether environmentalists and \n     developers can cooperate to minimize damage to the refuge.\n       The Interior Department estimates that between 600 million \n     and 9.2 billion barrels of oil are recoverable from a 20-by-\n     100-mile strip along the Arctic coast. But no matter how \n     carefully done, development of the coastal strip would \n     displace animals and scar land permanently. Tracks of \n     vehicles that crossed the tundra decades ago are still \n     visible. No one knows whether the caribou herd that bears its \n     young near the coast would stop reproducing or simply move \n     elsewhere.\n       Adversaries in this battle view development as ecological \n     catastrophe or energy salvation. Outsiders can wonder why \n     such apocalyptic fuss. An unusual environment would surely be \n     damaged, but the amount of land involved is modest and the \n     animals at risk are not endangered species. A lot of oil \n     might be pumped, but probably not enough to keep America's \n     motors running for an entire year. Ultimately, policy makers \n     must weigh the dollar value of the oil against the intangible \n     value of an unspoiled refuge.\n       The most likely net value of the oil after accounting for \n     costs and assuming a future world price of $33 a barrel, is \n     about $15 billion.\n       How much an untouched refuge is worth is anyone's guess--\n     but it's hard to see how it could realistically be judged \n     worth such an enormous sum. If America had an extra $15 \n     billion to spend on wilderness protection, it wouldn't be \n     spent on this one sliver of land.\n       That doesn't mean, however, that developers should be \n     permitted to treat the refuge as another Bayonne. Elaborate, \n     necessarily expensive precautions are needed to contain the \n     disruption. Human and machine presence can and should be kept \n     to a bare minimum until test wells are completed. Dense \n     caribou calving grounds should be left alone until the \n     animals' response to change is gauged.\n       A decade ago, precautions in the design and construction of \n     the 1,000-mile-long Alaska pipeline saved the land from \n     serious damage. If oil companies, government agencies and \n     environmentalists approach the development of the refuge with \n     comparable care, disaster should be avoidable.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 2, 1988]\n\n                       Risks Worth Taking for Oil\n\n       Can Big Oil and its Government regulators be trusted with \n     the fragile environment of Alaska's Arctic Wildlife Refuge? \n     Congress, pressed by the Reagan Administration to allow \n     exploratory drilling in what may be North America's last \n     great oil reserve, has been wrestling with the question for \n     years. Then, last month, opponents' skepticism was heightened \n     by a leaked report from the Fish and Wildlife Service saying \n     that environmental disruption in the nearby North Slope oil \n     fields is far worse than originally believed.\n       The North Slope development has been America's biggest test \n     by far of the proposition that it is possible to balance \n     energy needs with sensitivity for the environment. The public \n     therefore deserves an independent assessment of the \n     ecological risks and an honest assessment of the energy \n     awards.\n       No one wants to ruin a wilderness for small gain. But in \n     this case, the potential is enormous and the environmental \n     risks are modest. Even if the report's findings are \n     confirmed, the likely value of the oil far exceeds plausible \n     estimates of the environmental cost.\n       The amount of oil that be recovered from the Wildlife \n     Refuge is not known. But it seems likely that coastal plain, \n     representing a small part of the acreage in the refuge, \n     contains several billion barrels, worth tens of billions of \n     dollars. But drilling is certain to disrupt the delicate \n     ecology of the Arctic tundra.\n       Some members of Congress believe that no damage at all is \n     acceptable. But most are ready to accept a little \n     environmental degradation in return for a lot of oil. Hence \n     the relevance of the experience at Prudhoe Bay, which now \n     yields 20 percent of total U.S. oil production. Last year, \n     Representative George Miller, a California Democrat and \n     opponent of drilling within the refuge, asked the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service to compare the environmental impact \n     predicted in 1972 for Prudhoe Bay with the actual impact. The \n     report from the local field office, never released by the \n     Administration, offers a long list of effects, ranging from \n     birds displaced to tons of nitrous oxide released into the \n     air.\n       According to the authors, development used more land, \n     damaged more habitat acreage and generated more effluent than \n     originally predicted. The authors also argue that Government \n     monitoring efforts and assessment of long-term effects have \n     been inadequate.\n       It's important to find out whether these interpretations \n     are sensible and how environmental oversight could be \n     improved. The General Accounting Office, a creature of \n     Congress, is probably the most credible agency to do the job.\n       But even taken at face value, the report's findings hardly \n     justify putting oil exploration on hold.\n       No species is reported to be endangered. No dramatic \n     permanent change in ecology are forecast. Much of the \n     unpredicted damage has arisen because more oil has been \n     produced than originally predicted. Even so, the total \n     acreage affected by development represents only a fraction of \n     1 percent of the North Slope wilderness.\n       The trade-off between energy and ecology seems unchanged. \n     If another oil field on the scale of Prudhoe Bay is \n     discovered, developing it will damage the environment. That \n     damage is worth minimizing. But it is hard to see why \n     absolutely pristine preservation of this remote wilderness \n     should take precedence over the nation's energy needs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From The New York Times, Mar. 30, 1989]\n\n                  Oil on the Water, Oil in the Ground\n\n       Does the Exxon tanker spill show that Arctic oil shipping \n     is being mismanaged? Should the industry have been better \n     prepared to cope with the accident? Should the spill deflect \n     President Bush from his plan to open more of Alaska to oil \n     exploration?\n       Six days after the Exxon Valdez dumped 240,000 barrels of \n     crude into the frigid waters of Prince William Sound, \n     questions come more easily than answers. But it is not too \n     early to distinguish between the issue of regulation and the \n     broader question of exploiting energy resources in the \n     Arctic. The accident shouldn't change one truth: Alaskan oil \n     is too valuable to leave in the ground.\n       Exxon has much to explain. The tanker captain has a history \n     of alcohol abuse. The officer in charge of the vessel at the \n     time of the spill was not certified to navigate in the sound. \n     The company's cleanup efforts have been woefully ineffective. \n     Local industries, notably fishing, face potentially \n     disastrous consequences, and the Government needs to hold the \n     company to its promise to pay. More important, Washington has \n     an obligation to impose and enforce rules strict enough to \n     reduce the risks of another spill.\n       That said, it's worth putting the event in perspective. \n     Before last Friday, tens of thousands of tanker runs from \n     Valdez has been completed without a serious mishap. Alaska \n     now pumps two million barrels through the pipeline each day. \n     And it would be almost unthinkable to restrict access to one-\n     fourth of the nation's total oil production.\n       The far tougher question is whether the accident is \n     sufficient reason to slow exploration for additional oil in \n     the Arctic. The\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\n     single most promising source of oil in America lies on the \n     north coast of Alaska, a few hundred miles east of the big \n     fields at Prudhoe Bay. But this remote tundra is part of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and since 1980 Congress has \n     been trying to decide whether to allow exploratory drilling.\n       Environmental organizations have long opposed such \n     exploration, arguing that the ecology of the refuge is both \n     unusual and fragile. This week they used the occasion of the \n     tanker spill to call for further delays while the damage from \n     the Exxon Valdez spill is assessed.\n       More information is always better than less. But long delay \n     would have a cost, too: Prudhoe Bay production will begin to \n     tail off in the mid-1990's. If exploration is permitted in \n     the refuge and little oil is found, development will never \n     take place and damage to the environment will be \n     insignificant. If development does prove worthwhile, the \n     process will undoubtedly degrade the environment. But the \n     compensation will be a lot of badly needed fuel.\n       Environmentalists counter that, at most, the refuge will \n     add one year's supply to America's reserves. They are right, \n     but one year of oil is a lot of oil. The 3.2 billion barrels, \n     if found, would be worth about $60 billion at today's prices, \n     enough to generate at least $10 billion in royalties for \n     Alaska and the Federal Government. By denying access to it, \n     Congress would be saying implicitly that the absolute purity \n     of the refuge was worth at least as much as the forgone $10 \n     billion.\n       Put it another way. Suppose the royalties were dedicated to \n     buying and maintaining parkland in the rest of the nation--a \n     not unthinkable legislative option. Would Americans really \n     want to pass by, say, $10 billion worth of land in order to \n     prevent oil companies from covering a few thousand acres of \n     the Arctic with roads, drilling pads and pipelines?\n       Washington can't afford to assume that the Exxon Valdez \n     accident was a freak that will never happen again. But \n     neither can it afford to treat the accident as a reason for \n     fencing off what may be the last great oilfield in the \n     nation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 4, 1989]\n\n                        Lessons of the Oil spill\n\n       Because of the gigantic oil spill off Alaska, conventional \n     wisdom declares, this country is now going to restrict oil \n     drilling much more tightly. Maybe so. But you will notice \n     that conventional wisdom isn't sayng anything about cutting \n     down on the consumption of oil. Americans have organized \n     their lives in ways that require 700 million gallons a day of \n     it, and they do not welcome suggestions to use less. But if \n     less oil is to be produced here in the United States, more \n     will have to come from other countries. The effect will be to \n     move oil spills to other shores. As a policy to protect the \n     global environment, that's not very helpful.\n       The immediate cause of the Alaskan spill was slack and \n     solvenly management by Exxon. It is a familiar story. A \n     highly demanding industrial operation, set up with great care \n     and many safeguards, had been running smoothly so long that \n     people began to relax and get careless. Something similar \n     happened at Three Mile Island, the reactor accident 10 years \n     ago, which the conventional wisdom currently cites as a \n     parallel case to the Alaskan shipwreck. The nuclear industry \n     reacted with a vigorous improvement of both equipment and \n     training. The same thing is likely to happen on the West \n     Coast tanker routes.\n       But that's not quite what the conventional wisdom means by \n     drawing the parallel. Its point is that Three Mile Island did \n     much to turn the country against nuclear power, just as it \n     expects the disaster in Prince William Sound to turn the \n     country against further drilling in Alaska, particularly in \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and perhaps in any new \n     sites off the Pacific Coast as well.\n       Because the United States has stopped building reactors, it \n     is now more reliant than ever on coal to generate its \n     electricity--which means pumping enormous volumes of \n     pollution into the atmosphere. The country cut back on \n     nuclear power, but it didn't cut back on its demand for \n     electricity--which is now rising half again as fast as the \n     government's forecast.\n       All of the technologies for producing energy are \n     unforgiving. They punish incompetence savagely. That \n     frightens people. The conventional wisdom is now turning \n     against oil drilling, just as it has turned against nuclear \n     power and will turn against coal with its implications of \n     acid rain and a changing climate. But that same conventional \n     wisdom has not turned against the idea that energy for the \n     consumer should be plentiful, reliable and cheap.\n       The first lesson of the oil spill is that it's time for \n     this country to get serious about energy conservation. The \n     second is that, since energy production is dangerous and even \n     a company as well equipped as Exxon can't be counted on the \n     maintain discipline, the government will have to do more of \n     it--and Exxon will have no one to thank but itself. The \n     lesson that conventional wisdom seems to be drawing--that the \n     country should produce less and turn to even greater \n     imports--is exactly wrong.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 23, 1987]\n\n                          Caribou vs. Motorist\n\n       It's the Caribou versus the motorist, again. Secretary of \n     the Interior Donald P. Hodel has recommended opening part of \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil \n     drilling. That was what the oil companies hoped he might do. \n     A predictable shriek has gone up from the defenders of the \n     refuge. The decision is up to Congress.\n       Environmental quarrels always seem to generate billowing \n     exaggeration. Another major oil discovery in Alaska would \n     certainly be convenient, postponing the effects of the \n     decline in Prudhoe Bay production that the government expects \n     within the next year or so. But it's not quite so vital as \n     Secretary Hodel suggests. With or without more Alaskan wells, \n     oil production in this country is likely to stay on a \n     downward trend.\n       As for the caribou, however, oil drilling seems very \n     unlikely to be the dire threat to them that their friends \n     here in Washington claim. While the two cases are not \n     entirely comparable, the Interior Department points out that \n     the number of caribou around Prudhoe Bay, 60 miles west of \n     the refuge, has tripled in the 19 years since oil operations \n     began there. The aesthetic objections to oil drilling may be \n     substantial, but the caribou do not seem to share them.\n       Preservation of wilderness is important, but much of Alaska \n     is already under the strictest of preservation laws. The area \n     that Mr. Hodel would open to drilling is 1.5 million acres, \n     running about 100 miles along the state's north coast near \n     the Canadian border. He points out that adjacent to it is an \n     area five times as large that remains legally designated as \n     wilderness, putting it off limits to any development \n     whatever.\n       Human intrusion on the scale of oil exploration always \n     makes a difference in a landscape. But that part of the \n     arctic coast is one of the bleakest, most remote places on \n     this continent, and there is hardly any other where drilling \n     would have less impact on the surrounding life.\n       Drilling in the Arctic Refuge is not crucial to the \n     country's future. But there is a respectable chance--about \n     one in five, the department's geologists say--that \n     exploration will find enough oil to be worth producing \n     commercially. That oil could help ease the country's \n     transition to lower oil supplies and, by a small but useful \n     amount, reduce its dependence on uncertain imports. Congress \n     would be right to go ahead and, with all the conditions and \n     environmental precautions that apply to Prudhoe Bay, see \n     what's under the refuge's tundra.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, the editorial in the Washington Post \nindicates that we can't drill our way out of our ties to the world oil \nmarket. Well, I agree with that. They further state that they feel we \ncan generate from conservation what we would potentially recover from \nopening ANWR. It is kind of interesting to see what they said back in \n1987. I will read a portion of it. The Washington Post, April 23, 1987:\n\n       Preservation of wilderness is important, but much of Alaska \n     is already under the strictest of preservation laws. . . .\n\n  We have 56 million acres of wilderness in our State.\n\n       But that part of the arctic coast is one of the bleakest, \n     most remote places on this continent, and there is hardly any \n     other place where drilling would have less impact on the \n     surrounding life. . . .\n       That oil could help ease the country's transition to lower \n     oil supplies and . . . reduce its dependence on uncertain \n     imports.

Their response was rather interesting. They \nindicated they thought President Bush was too forward in pushing the \ndevelopment of a national resource on domestic areas of the United \nStates and, therefore, they were in opposition. I didn't accept that, \nbut that is the rationale they gave me.\n  The New York Times is also very interesting because back in 1987, \nApril, they said:\n\n       Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . . . the most \n     promising untapped source of oil in North America.\n       A decade ago, precautions in the design and construction of \n     the 1,000-mile-long Alaska pipeline saved the land from \n     serious damage. If oil companies, government agencies and \n     environmentalists approach the development of the refuge with \n     comparable care, disaster should be avoidable.\n\n  June 2, 1988:\n\n       . . . the potential is enormous and environmental risks are \n     modest . . . the likely value\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\n     of the oil far exceeds plausible estimates of the \n     environmental cost.\n       . . . the total acreage affected by development represents \n     only a fraction of 1 percent of the North Slope wilderness.\n\n  They did a little licensing there because it is not wilderness.\n\n       But it is hard to see why absolutely pristine preservation \n     of this remote wilderness should take precedence over the \n     nation's energy needs.\n\n  The last was March 30, 1989:\n\n       Alaskan oil is too valuable to leave in the ground.\n       The single most promising source of oil in America lies on \n     the north coast of Alaska, a few hundred miles east of the \n     big fields at Prudhoe Bay.\n       Washington can't afford . . . to treat the [Exxon Valdez] \n     accident as a reason for fencing off what may be the last \n     great oilfield in the nation.\n\n  I went up to New York and asked the editorial board why they changed \ntheir position and that, too, was rather enlightening. They said, well, \nthe editor of the editorial board had been transferred to California \nand, as a consequence, they had changed their position because they had \na change of the editor of the editorial board.\n  It is interesting to see how these major newspapers change their \nopinions on national issues, and one can only guess at what the \nmotivation was. We will have to leave that for another day and perhaps \nanother explanation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial called ``A Better Energy \nBill,'' which appeared in the Washington Post today, also be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          A Better Energy Bill\n\n       As the Senate opened debate on an energy bill last week, \n     the White House fired a shot across its bow. The bill on the \n     Senate floor is not comprehensive energy legislation, said \n     the Office of Management and Budget, because it doesn't do \n     enough to increase domestic oil production, failing in \n     particular to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \n     drilling. The administration opposes the higher automobile \n     fuel efficiency standards that are in the bill, and it \n     objects to a provision that would require facilities that \n     emit large quantities of greenhouse gases to register those \n     emissions. The administration is right that the House and \n     Senate are heading in different directions, but it's wrong on \n     the relative merits. The pro-conservation tilt of the Senate \n     bill makes it the better measure.\n       It's possible neither version will become law. While all \n     sides agree on substantial sections of the legislation, \n     divisions over Arctic drilling and fuel economy are deep. \n     Even if the Senate can pass a bill, it is likely to be so \n     different from the House version that a conference committee \n     will have trouble bridging the gaps. The issues that were \n     driving debate when President Bush put his energy plan \n     together last year have faded: Prices for oil and natural gas \n     are down, and California no longer is suffering from rolling \n     blackouts. Since Sept. 11 the rallying cry is national \n     security. But it's worth remembering that both drilling in \n     Alaska and auto fuel efficiency standards would take years to \n     bear fruit. And neither the House bill nor the measure now \n     before the Senate would make the country energy independent. \n     Imported oil now provides 57 percent of U.S. needs; left \n     unchecked, imports are expected to make up two-thirds of \n     consumption by 2020. The energy measures aim to reverse that \n     trend, but the best either side predicts from the range of \n     measures in either bill is to bring imports back under 50 \n     percent of consumption, not eliminate them. As long as the \n     economy and most modes of transportation rely on oil, America \n     will remain economically tied to the world oil market.\n       But it makes ecological sense to reduce dependence on oil, \n     foreign or domestic, and on other fossil fuels, so there's \n     merit in the Senate bill's emphasis on conservation, new \n     technology and new sources of energy. Raising auto fuel \n     efficiency standards, unchanged since 1985, would help. So \n     would the bill's proposed tougher efficiency standards for \n     new air conditioners and its demand that, by 2020, 10 percent \n     of electricity come from renewable sources; several states \n     already have used this kind of requirement to boost \n     generation from wind and other renewable sources. As debate \n     opened Wednesday, Alaska's Sen. Frank Murkowski broadly \n     described these initiatives as an ``unacceptable intrusion of \n     the federal government into the marketplace.'' But they're no \n     more of an intrusion than the Republicans' tax breaks for \n     drilling. The difference, as Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman \n     (D-N.M.) said, is that his bill's incentives seeks to bring \n     about change that wouldn't occur otherwise. The Republican-\n     favored approach renders more profitable activity that likely \n     would take place anyway, or (as in the case of Alaska) \n     encourage activity that we'd be better off without.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that letters \nto the editors of the Washington Post and New York Times dated today \nalso be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     The New York Times,\n     New York, NY.\n       To the Editors: I was deeply concerned by the misleading \n     photograph that accompanied your recent article discussing \n     the safe exploration of oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge (ANWR).\n       The presence of such a large mountain range in your picture \n     tells me that the photograph is not located in the area of \n     ANWR discussed in the story. In fact, it is probably more \n     than 75 miles off the mark.\n       This would be not unlike using a photo of the Philadelphia \n     skyline for an article about New York City. At the very \n     least, it's like using a picture of the Meadowlands for a \n     story about JFK International airport. They are simply not \n     interchangeable because they are two very different places.\n       Fewer than 1,000 visitors a year have a chance to see for \n     themselves what is--and what isn't--ANWR. This remoteness \n     makes the ANWR debate the frequent target of incorrect \n     information and inaccurate portrayals.\n       ANWR is composed of 19 million acres--an area the size of \n     all of South Carolina. The 17.5 million acres that is off-\n     limits is the actual home to the mountains and wildlife that, \n     during a brief spring, make for some of the picturesque \n     photos we've seen. Let me be clear--this is not the area \n     where oil exploration will occur.\n       If allowed, oil exploration will be limited to a flat, \n     barren portion of the 1.5 million acre coastal plain--a \n     section set aside for the express purpose of oil exploration \n     because of the tremendous oil reserves geologists believe \n     exist there.\n       To help ensure our nation's energy security, we must make \n     certain that our energy solutions begin and end here at home. \n     We can do that by recognizing the vast energy resources that \n     exist on our shores and that our technology and ingenuity can \n     ensure their safe recovery.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                   Senator Frank H. Murkowski,\n\n                                     Ranking Member, Senate Energy\n     and Natural Resources Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n     The Washington Post,\n     Washington, DC.\n       To the Editors: I do not disagree with your statement that \n     ``as long as . . . most modes of transportation rely on oil, \n     America will remain economically tied to the world oil \n     market'' (``A Better Energy Bill'', March 11, 2002). We \n     should reduce our dependence on oil and especially foreign \n     oil. The comprehensive energy plan proposed by President Bush \n     and passed in the House includes a number of proposals to \n     spark the development of alternative fuel and help reduce our \n     future use of oil.\n       But I disagree with your assertion that the safe \n     exploration of domestic energy resources in Alaska is \n     ``activity that we'd be better off without.'' Geologists tell \n     us that ANWR is believed to have more oil than all of Texas' \n     proven reserves--enough to end more than 30 years of Saudi \n     Arabian imports. American technology and ingenuity will \n     ensure its safety recovery with a minimum amount of \n     disturbance--just 2,000 acres.\n       Domestic oil from ANWR has, in fact, been supported by this \n     paper before. In 1987, the Washington Post editorialized that \n     oil from ANWR ``. . . could help ease the country's \n     transition to lower oil supplies'' and that it could ``. . . \n     reduce its dependence on uncertain imports.'' Again in 1989, \n     the Post said ``The lesson that conventional wisdom seems to \n     be drawing--that the country should produce less and turn to \n     even greater imports--is exactly wrong.''\n       What has happened since 1989? We fought a war over oil in \n     the Gulf. Our dependence on foreign oil has increased. The \n     Middle East has grown more unstable. And never before in our \n     history have we gained a greater appreciation of national \n     security and the impact of ensuring our energy security.\n       Domestic energy production must be part of the Senate's \n     efforts to construct a national energy plan. Any plan that \n     fails is no solution at all.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                   Senator Frank H. Murkowski,\n\n                                     Ranking Member, Senate Energy\n     and Natural Resources Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In conclusion, Madam President, I think we deserve \nbetter from two of our leading newspapers than to have such gross \ninaccuracies perpetrated on the American public in the interest of news \nor formulating public opinion. I do not mind taking my licks as long as \nit is a fair portrayal, but when it is an unfair portrayal or it is \njournalism that reflects simply a prevailing attitude and ignores the \nfacts, the only thing I can do is call it to the attention of Members \nand the public in the interest of fairness.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a portion of the Sunday New York Times \nwhich factually mischaracterizes the issue of ANWR be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 9, 2002]\n\n         Oil Industry Hesitates Over Moving Into Arctic Refuge\n\n                          (By Neela Barnerjee)\n\n       More than three decades ago, the world's largest energy \n     companies led the charge to drill for oil on the North Slope \n     of Alaska. But now, as the debate rages over opening the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, those \n     same companies remain surprisingly silent.\n       Drilling in the Arctic refuge, which has already been \n     approved by the House, has become a touchstone issue for the \n     Bush administration, and the issue promises to produce a \n     nasty fight in the current debate over the energy bill in the \n     Senate. Publicly, the biggest multinational petroleum \n     companies, like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and \n     ChevronTexaco, back the Bush administration's assertion that \n     developing the oil in the Arctic refuge is critical to the \n     American economy. But privately, many large companies say the \n     prospect, solely on business terms, is not terribly \n     attractive.\n       ``Big oil companies go where there are substantial fields \n     and where they can produce oil economically,'' said Ronald W. \n     Chappell, a spokesman for BP Alaska, which officially \n     supports opening the area to drilling. Using the acronym for \n     the refuge, he continued, ``Does ANWR have that? Who knows?''\n       Oil companies and industry experts say it is cheaper and \n     more promising right now to exploit large reservoirs of oil \n     elsewhere in the world. And it is easier: many companies fear \n     that drilling in the wilderness area may be blocked by \n     persistent litigation, or that a future president or Congress \n     could put the refuge out of bounds once more.\n       ``There is still a fair amount of exploration risk here: \n     you could go through eight years of litigation, a good amount \n     of investment, and still come up with dry holes or uneconomic \n     discoveries,'' said Gerald J. Kepes, the managing director \n     for exploration and production issues at the Petroleum \n     Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm for oil \n     companies. ``It's not clear that this is quite the bonanza \n     some have said.''\n       Supporters and opponents alike of drilling in the Arctic \n     refuge have noted the reticence of the largest multinational \n     oil conglomerates on the issue. ``They are not present at \n     all,'' a Senate aide said.\n       Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said that the \n     administration believed that oil companies would be \n     interested in exploration if the refuge is opened to \n     drilling. ``What's important is that we have this option due \n     to the vast potential to reduce our reliance on foreign \n     sources of energy,'' she said.\n       The fight over oil drilling in the refuge has flared in \n     Congress every few years, and so far, opponents of drilling \n     have kept the area off limits. Now, proponents of drilling \n     smell the sharpest whiff of victory ever.\n       They still face an uphill battle. The energy bill narrowly \n     passed last year by the House included a passage permitting \n     oil exploration in the refuge. But in the Senate, two \n     Democrats, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph I. \n     Lieberman of Connecticut, have threatened to filibuster any \n     amendment on drilling, meaning that proponents will have to \n     muster at least 60 members to force a vote. Given the \n     deepness of the divisions, the entire energy bill could \n     unravel if both sides tug hard enough at this single issue, \n     Congressional aids and energy industry executives said.\n       The battle centers on drilling on the coastal plain of the \n     refuge, a narrow ribbon of land that stretches about 110 \n     miles along the Beaufort Sea. Environmentalists and wildlife \n     biologists say that in the summer, the coastal plain teems \n     with caribou and millions of migratory birds. Drilling for \n     oil there, they argue, would ruin one of the few pristine \n     wilderness areas left on the planet.\n       Those who back drilling are varied and formidable, \n     including a bipartisan array of politicians from southern and \n     western states, nearly the entire political establishment of \n     Alaska and several labor unions, led by the Teamsters. They \n     contend that the coastal plain is a snowbound wasteland, and \n     the oil there could be developed with little environmental \n     damage. They say the coastal plain's reservoirs hold about 16 \n     billion barrels of oil, or enough to meet the country's \n     appetite for petroleum for a little more than two years.\n       The oil companies themselves, however, are less certain of \n     how much oil lies below the coastal plain. No precise data \n     about the amount of oil in the plain is publicly available. \n     In the 1980's BP and what then was the Chevron Corporation \n     drilled an exploratory well on private land owned by native \n     tribes that is inside the refuge, but BP said that those \n     results were a proprietary secret. The United States \n     Geological Survey estimates that at oil prices around $20 a \n     barrel, the amount of oil that could be recovered \n     economically from the federally controlled part of the \n     coastal plain is 3.2 billion barrels.\n       Of course, companies face severe difficulties in developing \n     oil fields overseas, from the rough winters in the North Sea \n     to the endemic corruption in Nigeria to the long-running \n     civil war in Angola. But the size of the discoveries and the \n     relative cheapness of exploiting them often make the \n     investments worthwhile. Within each oil company, prospects in \n     the Arctic refuge would be measured against fields elsewhere. \n     A political mandate to explore the region, executives of \n     several major oil companies said, would not necessarily \n     compel them to rush into the area.\n       ``All our Alaska projects need to compete worldwide with \n     other Phillips projects,'' said Dawn Patience, a spokeswoman \n     in Alaska for Phillips Petroleum, the largest oil producer on \n     the North Slope. ``And it does come down to economics.''\n       The calculus includes the usual factors like the cost of \n     producing oil and shipping it to market. But drilling in the \n     Arctic refuge holds significant political risks that would \n     lead to delays and with that, higher costs, oil company oil \n     officials said.\n       ``There will be tremendous debate or delays due to \n     litigation,'' an executive with a major oil company said. \n     ``All that has to go into the assessment of whether that \n     project would be economically viable.''\n       Still, there would be pressure on companies already working \n     in Alaska, like BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips, to bid for \n     leases if the area is opened to drilling. The state, which \n     issues so many of the permits oil companies need to work in \n     Alaska, might take their indifference as a slap in the face, \n     said environmentalists and some industry executives.\n       At the same time, smaller companies, particularly those \n     looking for a foothold in Alaska, might be willing to take on \n     the risks and aggressively pursue drilling in the refuge. \n     ``Smaller companies are involved in fewer places, and what is \n     a marginal opportunity for us is a big opportunity for an \n     independent,'' the executive with the major oil company said. \n     ``This is not a huge priority for us.''\n       Even without lawsuits by environmentalists, the earliest \n     any oil from the wildlife refuge would make it to market is \n     2010, industry executives said. But development efforts could \n     drag out well beyond that date. ``To protect the refuge,'' \n     said Deborah Williams, executive director of the Alaska \n     Conservation Foundation in Anchorage, ``national \n     environmental law firms and Alaskan environmental groups will \n     find every opportunity to challenge drilling.''\n       Oil companies know too well how projects can atrophy within \n     a web of litigation and political resistance. They hold \n     hundreds of leases for places where they cannot drill because \n     of litigation, Congressional action or a change of \n     presidential administration. Among them are Bristol Bay in \n     Alaska, the western and eastern seaboards of the United \n     States and the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.\n       The champions of drilling in the refuge are the State of \n     Alaska and the unions. In fiscal 2001, 82 percent of the \n     unrestricted funds in the state budget came from the \n     petroleum industry, which is also a major employer. But oil \n     production on the North Slope has fallen by half since its \n     peak of two million barrels a day in 1988, said Mark D. \n     Myers, director of the State Division of Oil and Gas.\n       And as oil production dwindles, so might revenues and jobs. \n     ``The primary reason is job creation,'' said Jerry Hood, a \n     Teamsters union energy specialist. The Bush energy policy, \n     Mr. Hood said, ``is, frankly, a way to re-employ American \n     workers.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I see my friend from New Mexico, the \nchairman of the committee, with us today. I ask him if he knows what \nbusiness we might take up today.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response to my friend from Alaska, \nmy understanding is the leader intends that we remain in session until \napproximately 5 o'clock and then go out of session. I do have one \namendment that I believe has been cleared related to U.S.-Mexico \ntechnology cooperation which both myself and Senator Domenici have \nsponsored. It has passed the Senate before. I hope to do that by voice \nvote in the near future.\n  Then, as I say, the intent is to recess the Senate around 5 o'clock. \nThen tomorrow morning, it is my understanding the majority leader \nintends to have a vote at 10:30. I am not sure the subject of that \nvote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, if I may respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe the Akaka amendment has been accepted by \nthis side and the U.S.-Mexico amendment offered by Senator Bingaman, \nand Senator Dorgan has spoken on an amendment which we have no \nobjection to on our side, but we are still clearing it at this time. I \nsuspect that can be accepted, but I have to hold off. I anticipate that \ntomorrow we will go to Senator Feinstein's amendment, which I believe \nis pending. Then I hope we might get to CAFE.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I certainly agree with what my \ncolleague has said. Unless there is other business at this particular \nmoment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2990\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I call up for consideration amendment \nNo. 2990 dealing with U.S.-Mexico energy technology cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this amendment is one I offered on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Domenici. It is an amendment that was \nadopted by the 106th Congress. It merely tries to ensure maximum \npossible cooperation between our two countries along our common border \non issues related to health and energy production and to ensure that \nthe Department of Energy environmental management technologies are used \nto help clean up serious and pressing public health problems along the \nborder.\n  This is an amendment that I believe has strong support on all sides. \nI believe it has been cleared on both sides. I urge it be adopted.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we have agreed to it on our side, and \nI urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? \nThere being none, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2990.\n  The amendment (No. 2990) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Madam President, I rise to discuss an event that happened \nlast week in which I was very disappointed. It was a hearing we had on \nthe FAIR Act or private contracting of Government activities where it \nis appropriate under what is called the FAIR Act, which was passed in \n1998.\n  This was to have been a committee hearing about how you can best do \nwhat has been a policy for a very long time; that is, to take those \nactivities within the Federal Government which are not integral to the \nGovernment and give the private sector a chance to bid and do those \nkinds of things.\n  Even though it has not been implemented as it could be and should be, \nit has been the policy for a very long time--20, 25 years--to do that, \nto take those things that are not specifically and inordinately Federal \nactivities that could be done and could be done more efficiently by the \nprivate sector. So in 1998, we passed a bill called the FAIR Act which \nrequired that there be an analysis of all the Government activities in \nmost of the agencies, determine which of those would be eligible for \noutside contracting, and then move forward on that.\n  I had hoped to testify before the committee. It turned out that I was \nnot available, and also, they thought they had a balance. As I read \nabout it--and I have a couple things I want to put in the Congressional \nRecord--it turned out not to be a balanced hearing at all. It turned \nout to be kind of a pro-union rally in which they accidentally had to \nhave it at a time when practically all the Government unions were \nmeeting here. So they had about 250 members there, which is fine except \nthey didn't have a balanced approach to the program.\n  I was advised that the hearing was going to be evenly balanced, and \nit couldn't have been more unbalanced, according to what was written \nabout it. It was regarding the Government contracting. This is a very \nimportant issue to me for several reasons. One is, it is the most \nefficient way to get some of the jobs done that are available to be \ndone in the Federal Government. The other is, I am one who thinks it is \na good idea to reduce and hold down as low as possible the numbers in \nthe Federal Government and allow the private sector to do all those \njobs that can be done by the private sector. And that was the idea of \nthe FAIR bill which was signed into law in 1998.\n  Again, it was designed to identify positions within the Federal \nagencies that are not inherently governmental. For about 50 years we \nhave had a policy that said basically: It will not start or carry out \nany commercial activities to provide a service or product for its own \nuse if such product or service can be procured from private enterprise \nthrough ordinary business channels.\n  That has been the notion that, in my view, has not been implemented \nnearly as it might be. Nevertheless, it is the concept, and it is a \ngreat concept. Unfortunately, this hearing indicated that several of \nthe members who were there certainly don't want to find any ways--to \ngenerally quote them--that we would diminish the size of Government, \nthat we would put at risk any Federal jobs. The fact is, this seldom \nputs at risk Federal jobs.\n  What it does is, as new jobs come up, new programs and projects come \nup that are not inherently governmental. Then they can be put out to \nthe private sector and, indeed, be competitive.\n\n  Conceptually, I certainly agree with this. I am surprised to find a \nnumber of members who were at the hearing who apparently do not agree \nwith that and don't agree that the private sector ought to be able to \ncompete at all with the Federal Government. They were very precise \nabout that.\n  I do not agree with that. We were able to pass a bill with a number \nof hearings last year, Chairman Thompson and his committee. He was \nthere, by the way, and said some pretty reasonable things about it. \nThis was widely heard last year and passed very strongly.\n  It requires the Federal agencies to list commercial jobs. Inventories \nshowed in 1999, kind of the initial inventory, that nearly 1 million \nFederal employees are engaged in commercial activities. These are \nservices that can be found in the yellow pages from small businesses \nand firms throughout the country. Under the Clinton administration, the \nFAIR Act inventory served as no more than a list. Nothing was ever done \nabout it. So last year, the Bush administration announced it was \nrequiring all Federal agencies to convert 5 percent of the jobs listed \nin the FAIR Act as public and private competition or contract to the \nprivate sector.\n  In the course of the hearing, of course, the witnesses they had said \nthe percentages were not necessarily the only percentages that could be \nconsidered. But the fact is, it did begin for the first time a planned \neffort to point out those kinds of jobs that could be in the private \nsector. I know this is fiercely denied and opposed by those who want \nmore Government, who want to actually spend more and have larger \nGovernment. That is not really what this is all about.\n  The fact is, we do need to find a way to have an inventory, to find a \nway to have an opportunity for the private sector to look into those \njobs--not all the jobs, of course, only those that are inherently not \ninvolved as governmental functions.\n  I hope we can go back to the core of what that bill is about. And \nthat is the objective way, not putting at risk public employees but \nfinding, as these jobs are created, that there is a place to be able to \ndo that in the private sector.\n  I am hopeful we can continue to explore that, as, in fact, it is a \nlaw. Therefore, I would like very much to be able to pursue that. I \nwant my friends on the committee to know I, for one, fiercely oppose \nthe idea to gut the FAIR Act, and I want to make that point and \ncontinue to pursue it as time goes by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1726-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1726-S1727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COLONEL ROBERT S.

Hart, \nCommander, 403d Operations Group. Unfortunately, Colonel Hart's service \nto his country ended on February 16, 2002 when he unexpectedly passed \naway.\n  Colonel Hart entered the Air Force in 1973 through the Air Force \nReserve Officer's Training Corps program. His early assignments \nincluded Williams Air Force Base, AZ, and Charleston Air Force Base, \nSC, where he finished his active duty career in October 1979. He \nentered the Air Force as a pilot and continued to fly throughout his \ncareer. He joined the Air Force Reserve in July 1980. In 1981 he was \nthe Chief of Standardization for the 300th Military Airlift Squadron, \nCharleston Air Force Base, SC. From 1992 to 1998 he was the Aircraft \nOperations Officer for the 701st Airlift Squadron at Charleston Air \nForce Base. For the first half of 1998 he was the Airlift Operations \nOfficer for the 707th Airlift Squadron also at Charleston Air Force \nBase; the remainder of 1998 to December 1999, he was the Commander of \nthe 707th Airlift Squadron. He joined the 403d Wing in December 1999, \nwhere he was the commander of the 403d Operations Group. As the \ncommander of the 403d Operations Group, he was responsible for the \ntraining and mission execution of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance \nSquadron, the 815th Airlift Squadron, and the 41st Aerial Port Squadron \nat Keesler Air Force Base, MS; and, the 96th Aerial Port Squadron at \nLittle Rock Air Force Base, AR.\n  Colonel Hart was born in Abilene, TX.

He was a true Citizen \nSoldier, always ready to answer his nation's call. On behalf of a \ngrateful nation, I ask you to join me, my colleagues in the senate and \nColonel Hart's many friends and family in saluting this distinguished \nofficer's many years of selfless service to the United States of \nAmerica. I know our Nation, his wife Karen, and his family are \nextremely proud of his accomplishments. It is fitting that the U.S. \nSenate honor him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1727-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred February 24, \n2002 in Santa Barbara, CA. A gay man, Clint Scott Risetter, 37, was \ndoused in gasoline and set on fire while he was sleeping. The \nassailant, Martin Thomas Hartman, 38, confessed to the murder, and said \nthat the victim ``deserved to die'' for being gay. Hartman is being \ncharged with murder, arson, and a hate crime in connection with the \nincident.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1727-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1727-S1728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE PIPELINE SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I rise in support of amendment No. 2979 \nto S. 517, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, which will \nenhance the safety of our interstate pipeline systems. As you may \nrecall, the Senate passed this legislation last February as one of the \nfirst orders of business of the 107th Congress. This bill is the \nproduct of over 3 years of work and recent compromise and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support.\n  The aim of the bill is to ensure the safety and security of natural \ngas and hazardous liquid pipelines. I appreciate the considerable \nnumber of hours that went into creating this bill by all of the \nparties. I also am satisfied by the spirit of compromise that infused \nthe parties' diligent efforts. As a result of their cooperative work we \nhave a bill that reaffirms our efforts to oversee the safety of gas and \nhazardous liquid pipelines effectively without interfering with the \npipeline operators and owners ability to provide service to our nation \nand without compromising national security.\n  Last Congress, the Senate passed an almost identical version of this \nbill by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the bill was \nnot passed by the House of Representatives under the expedited \nprocedures of suspension of the rules, because it did not pass with a \ntwo-thirds majority, although a majority supported the measure, 232-\n158.\n  Last February, the Senate again approved this bipartisan legislation, \nyet we are still awaiting action by the House on this measure. Today, \nwe are offering this legislation as an amendment to S. 517 in an effort \nto focus attention on this important safety matter and work toward \nreconciling our legislation with the House of Representatives. I hope \nthat we can continue to work with all of the interested parties as the \nlegislation moves though the legislative process.\n  Over the past few years, we have experienced two major pipeline \naccidents, one in Bellingham, WA, and the other near Carlsbad, NM. \nWhile these tragic accidents happened, we need to take all necessary \nsteps to ensure that other accidents are not waiting to happen. I think \nthat this legislation will increase the tools available to OPS to \nensure that our pipeline system is as safe as possible. I would ask \nthat OPS use the tools that we provide to ensure the appropriate level \nof oversight of pipeline safety practices.\n  While there were many who worked with Senators McCain and Hollings on \nthe Commerce Committee to ensure passage of pipeline safety \nlegislation, I would like to recognize, in particular, the efforts of \nSenators Murray and Bingaman. Senator Murray doggedly pursued changes \nto increase the level of safety and public participation in pipeline \nsafety, and she worked closely with other Commerce Committee members to \nensure a reasonable and fair compromise. Senator Bingaman was \ninstrumental in helping bolster the bill's provisions on research and \ndevelopment, in fact, he authored provisions to focus our research on \nprogressive areas that will help us develop better systems of early \ndetection, and to ensure that we can avoid accidents such as those that \noccurred in Bellingham, WA, and near Carlsbad, NM.\n  A floor amendment which was accepted during consideration of S. 235 \nlast February mandates a 5-year integrity inspection period for \npipelines. Since passage of the S. 235 last February, I understand that \nstudies, conducted by Batelle and Energy and Environmental Analysis, \nInc., indicate that a 5-year period for integrity inspections will \ncause significant impacts on natural gas consumers as a result of \npipeline capacity reductions resulting from such a short inspection \nperiod. I want to bring these studies to the attention of my colleagues \nas we prepare to move this important piece of pipeline safety \nlegislation to conference.\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\n  Lastly, I would like to address one change to the legislation since \nSenate passage last year. Since September 11, we have all recognized \nthat the way the Government has done business may change due to \nsecurity concerns. In the past, we have made efforts to expand the \namounts of information made available to the public, including \nencouraging electronic access to more data and information on \npipelines. Today, we must balance the concerns of national security \nwith the needs of law-abiding citizens who live and work alongside \npipelines. We have included language which, in my opinion, fairly \naddresses the concerns of the public in obtaining pipeline safety \ninformation and enables the Government to safeguard information which \ncould be used to do harm or for terrorist activities.\n  This bill is good legislation. It will require greater safety and \noversight of our Nation's pipeline system. The bill also allows for a \ngreater degree of public participation in the process of pipeline \nsafety, without jeopardizing national security, updates the penalties \nthat would be levied for misconduct and provides whistle blower \nprotection for employees who reveal misconduct. The bill also provides \nfor Federal investment in research which will help us be more efficient \nand effective in providing a safer and more secure system. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1728-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1728-S1729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO FATHER MYCHAL F. JUDGE\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I submit the following \nstatement of Peter James Johnson, Jr., delivered at the funeral mass \nfor Father Mychal F. Judge in New York City on September 15, 2001, for \nprinting in the Record to commemorate the 6-month anniversary of the \nmany lives so tragically lost on September 11.\n  The statement follows:\n\nRemarks Prepared for Delivery by Peter J. Johnson, Jr., at the Funeral \n    Mass of Rev. Mychal Judge, O.F.M., Fire Department of New York, \n Chaplain, September 15, 2001, St. Francis of Assisi Church, New York \n                                 City,\n\n       Your Eminence, Cardinal Egan, President Clinton, Senator \n     Clinton, Mayor Dinkins, Mr. Controller, Mr. Public Advocate, \n     Family, Friends, Firefighters and Friends.\n       ``Don't worry about me. Help the thousands.'' Mychal says \n     to us.\n       I see him kneeling gently, hear him speaking in a firm and \n     lilting whisper, his large hands making reassuring contact \n     with a dying firefighter, his warm eyes focused and loving \n     and deep, communicating the wisdom of almost seventy years \n     and the spirituality of a millennium. Enveloped in the \n     unshakeable concentration of the prayers he knew and lived so \n     faithfully, shrouded in his own mystical but practical \n     Catholic belief, oblivious to the risk of harm that rained \n     from the sky, he died as he lived, trying to save a life, to \n     save a soul in our City on a sunny, not so perfect September \n     morning. Friar's friar, firefighter, warrior for the Lord and \n     New Yorker--I can't help believing that Erin and Dymphna, \n     your beloved Emmet, who wanted to be a priest at the age of \n     four, our beloved Mychal--in the swirling and fiery wind \n     tunnel of the majestic twin towers, helmet off in respect to \n     our creator, lifted his lovely tenor voice and uttered a \n     final Alleluia as he rode the winds aloft, smiling broadly as \n     he shot one final mortal glance at what his model St. Francis \n     of Assisi called ``burning sun with golden beam and silver \n     moon with softer gleam.''\n       Father Mike, it's not that we hardly knew ya that makes you \n     leaving this earth so hard. It's that we all knew you so well \n     and depended on you so much that hurts so much.\n       Though you were neither a husband nor a father, you became \n     a model for husbands and fathers. Though you never trained on \n     a hose on a fire or experienced the pain of being a \n     firefighter's widow, you became a model for firefighters and \n     the widowed. Though up until recently you never felt the \n     anxiety of sickness, you became a guide for the sick. You \n     taught us that the St. Francis Prayer was not merely a \n     bookmark but a living, speaking roadmap for our daily lives \n     as New Yorkers. We saw your greatness up close and personal. \n     But we respectfully ask why were you so strong?\n       As Father Pecci pointed out last night at the wake service \n     maybe it was the countless windows and shoes you polished and \n     shined on Dean Street in Brooklyn as a child. Or was it the \n     constancy and strength of example of your mother who balanced \n     the needs of a dying husband, a house and three young \n     children in the Depression?\n       I have not seen your sisters Erin and Dymphna for some \n     time. So I asked Dymphna last night, what made Mychal great? \n     She said it best: ``With Michael there were no narrow truths. \n     There was only wide open possibility.'' As I stepped outside \n     onto 32nd Street near Penn Station last night to get some \n     air, I was struck by the wide world of possibilities that \n     Mychal lived in. I noticed how much more alive the street has \n     become in just in twenty-four hours. A saxophone could be \n     heard--``Amazing Grace''--the musician played. The smell of \n     fried food in the air. Taxis racing down the street. Men and \n     women laughing in conversation near a parked delivery truck. \n     Mychal would say ``How marvelous. What a strong and dynamic \n     people we are!'' And I looked at the faces on the street \n     behind us. In Mychal's words: ``Peter look at these faces. \n     Brown and black and yellow and white. Such good minds, such \n     strong hands, such hard workers.''\n       ``Such a resilient city. There is nothing like a New \n     Yorker. We're back.'' In that moment I had an understanding \n     of the incessant activity that Mychal often heard from his \n     room on 31st Street. The same vitality that so energized him \n     even when he was bone tired from caring for the families of \n     the victims of Flight 800 when he would answer the phone or \n     pager and respond to an emergency to support a stricken \n     firefighter.\n       And that was Mychal too. He naturally saw the very best of \n     himself in others. And in a strange way we slowly but surely \n     began to see a little bit of Mychal in all of us. His dynamic \n     strength, his good mind and his strong hands were always in \n     evidence. Whether he was helping lift his dear friend \n     paralyzed hero Detective Steven McDonald onto a rough stone \n     road in Northern Ireland, to go another ten miles on the path \n     to peace and reconciliation. Or riding Splash Mountain at \n     Disney with Conor McDonald, who helps serve the mass. Or at \n     the bedside of his friar friend forever, Patty Fitzgerald, in \n     an Israeli hospital--fifty years of friendship on Saturday. \n     Or anointing the forehead of a sick man with aids in a small \n     Chelsea studio apartment. Or arm in arm with our missing hero \n     Patty Brown, comforting the family of hero firefighters like \n     the late Captain John Drennan in a New York Hospital burn \n     unit, Mychal was equally at home in the brown robe and \n     sandals of a friar or the uniform of a New York City fire \n     officer and always in an encouraging and positive way \n     motivating us to do bigger and better things.\n       He was comfortable visiting President and Senator Clinton \n     or President and Mrs. Bush in the East Wing of the White \n     House, the portico of Gracie Mansion with Mayors Koch, \n     Dinkins and Giuliani and the Cardinal's Residence with the \n     late Cardinal O'Connor and now Cardinal Egan.\n       But he was really at home in a Times Square shelter for \n     single mothers conducting Midnight Mass on Christmas eve, \n     cradling a small plastic doll in its role as the baby Jesus \n     or in a firehouse kitchen helping reunite a couple whose \n     marriage was strained by the job. This church is full of \n     families he united. Being at Ground Zero--wherever it was--\n     was his life, and his death.\n       Mychal loved Christ and loved his family and yes, he loved \n     us, the people of New York. This morning we unfortunately see \n     only his casket. But I dreamt the other night of Mychal, \n     walking and walking and walking; I guess the constant motion \n     of his life: In a power walk from 31st Street and Seventh \n     Avenue to Coney Island and the Atlantic Ocean, in his crisply \n     pressed uniform on a blustery Saint Patrick's day waving, to \n     the crowd like a matinee idol, hands outstretched to hug our \n     children for a moment, flashing a knowing, almost shy smile \n     and then jogging back to the line of march. Walking the \n     streets greeting on a first name basis the homeless and \n     friendless, many of whom wore the Christmas and birthday \n     gifts that many in this congregation wrapped so nicely for \n     Mychal to wear. He loved to watch the fireworks, a ride on a \n     fire boat, a thick deep piece of apple pie with ice cream. \n     Both most of all, he loved the call to service, the romance \n     of duty, the necessity of honor. He was a bridge between \n     people. Friars and firefighters, Christians and Jews, able \n     and disabled. He grafted spirituality onto our Bill of \n     Rights.\n       You see, Mychal was proud to be an American. Not in the \n     quaint sense of a Norman Rockwell painting or in your face \n     flag waver, although flag waving is good too.\n       I recall two connected events to demonstrate his palpable \n     pride. I urged Mychal to become the Fire Chaplain, to fill \n     late Friar Father Julian Deeken's large shoes. Shortly after \n     he assumed his duties, there was a report of a ship run \n     aground, and yes, even a landing of Chinese nationals with \n     guns, according to the Park Police, in the Rockaways. I was \n     an honorary firefighter and pro bono adviser to Mayor \n     Dinkins, and so Mychal called me, said he would be by to get \n     me in a few minutes and we took off in the middle of the \n     night.\n       Just as we started to get to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, \n     the radio started to crackle with confirmation of a large \n     ship aground with passengers in the water. Mychal gunned the \n     Chevy, hit the lights and sirens, both which reflected and \n     reverberated off the tunnel walls. I felt like I was in the \n     middle of Studio 54. I said ``Mike, what are you doing? Slow \n     down.'' He looked straight ahead laughed and said: ``No this \n     is good. I'm not sure what we've got here but we can do good \n     things together.''\n       I'll never forget what we saw that chilly morning. \n     Helicopters in the air. A large broken ship battered by the \n     waves off shore and a beach full of shaking, shivering and \n     soaked Chinese men who had paid dearly and almost with their \n     lives to reach the safe haven of\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\n     America. They did not speak a word of English and he did not \n     speak Chinese, but it did not deter Mychal. Within a few \n     minutes he was handing out blankets, coffee and telling \n     jokes. And they laughed. An immigration officer warned him of \n     the dangers of disease from the men--tuberculosis, hepatitis. \n     Mychal said thank you, ignored the warning and continued on \n     as he was inclined to do. We returned home to Manhattan later \n     that morning and ate an enormous breakfast, ``Mychal, you're \n     a bright guy. They could be very sick.'' To which he replied: \n     ``When I travel half way round the world I get a blanket and \n     a cup of coffee. They're our guests and they deserve no less. \n     They only want what we were born into.'' As usual Mychal had \n     done good things.\n       Maybe we know why: A few days after July 4th, our daughters \n     Blanche and Veronica, eight and six, received a handwritten \n     note addressed to them. Blanche recognized the \n     distinctive note paper and handwriting and read to her \n     sister at the kitchen table: ``Friday evening, July 6, \n     2001, 10:00 p.m. My dearest Blanche and Veronica Felicity. \n     Earlier this evening I walked to the new walk along the \n     Hudson-Little West 12th Street to the Battery. It is a \n     wonderful promenade and a great place for Bladers--Someday \n     both of you will be most proficient at that and you'll be \n     there often'' And they will.\n       The letter continued: ``I sat and gazed at Lady Liberty--so \n     majestic with her torch burning brightly and thought of the \n     great feelings of joy and happiness and hope that my mother \n     and father experienced when they saw her as their boat came \n     into New York Harbor--it was their dream come true. 1921--oh \n     so long ago. They had no idea of all the blessings and a few \n     sorrows that lie ahead of them. They were so brave and had \n     such faith and trust in God, that, that he brought them to \n     these shores and that he would care for them.''\n       The note paper and the distinctive penmanship were those of \n     Mychal Judge, friar and firefighter. And it was then when I \n     heard our oldest daughter read these simply eloquent words to \n     our youngest daughter that I began to understand Mychal's \n     rush to the Rockaways.\n       As he and the late Captain Grethel and late Firefighter \n     Weinberg raced down Seventh Avenue did Mychal think about his \n     little rollerbladers, Blanche and Veronica? Did his mind rush \n     back to pleasant barbecues and lasagna dinners in Northern \n     New Jersey? Did he think of the woman who came to this church \n     and presented Father John Pierce with a tiny American flag in \n     honor of Mychal who had guided her so well when she lost her \n     son last year or of Erin or Dymphna and the prospect of a \n     trip to see them in Maryland, reading books and just talking? \n     Of the people he had not yet met who would need his services \n     at the friary that day upon his return? Of how he could be \n     made an instrument of peace or consolation or harmony?\n       Or as he pondered the blazing twin towers and the desperate \n     New Yorkers ending their suffering by jumping sometimes arms \n     linked from the inferno, did he try to summon and recreate \n     the innocent but great feelings of joy and happiness and hope \n     that his parents felt when they saw the Lady in the Harbor?\n       We'll not know the answer on this earth. But we do know \n     that Mychal died as he lived and as his parents lived--\n     bravely, having such faith and trusting God and loving this \n     land that God made.\n       Mychal, you taught so many of us that we can only be \n     enslaved, victimized or terrorized by our demons if we so \n     consent. In the coming months we will call upon your memory \n     and your inspired example of faith, sacrifice and \n     determination and rely upon your prayers to help strengthen \n     and console and raise all of us up. Today, from the well of \n     our sorrow filled with the bitter tears of our loss, we will \n     tend to our garden, emboldened by the faith and trust in God \n     you exemplified and from which the joy and happiness and hope \n     you aspired to will flower again. In an even more resplendent \n     but Mychal Judge less American century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1729-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COL. CYRIL R. RESCORLA\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, on the 6-month anniversary of a \nterrible tragedy, I wish to honor a man whose unfaltering courage and \ngenerous spirit showed the world the best of humanity, Colonel Cyril \nRichard Rescorla.\n  On September 11, our Nation was attacked in ways none of us ever \nthought possible. Many Americans have been affected profoundly by these \nevents, and I grieve with all of those who have lost loved ones. At the \nsame time, I have been heartened to see, in the midst of such \ndestruction and despair, a nation united.\n  On that fateful day, Colonel Rescorla led thousands to safety before \nhis own death in the south tower of the World Trade Center. But valiant \nservice to his country was nothing new to Rick, as he was known to his \nfamily and friends. A decorated veteran, he served in Vietnam as a \nplatoon leader in the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, inspiring awe in \nfellow soldiers and earning the reputation of a ``battlefield legend.'' \nAs a testament to his bravery, Rick's image is forever immortalized on \nthe cover of We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young, the book by \nLieutenant General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway that has been \nmade into the recently released movie ``We Were Soldiers.'' Unwavering \nin even the most horrific situations, Rick gave his men courage in \nbattle, and provided comfort and safety to his civilian colleagues in \nboth attacks on the World Trade Center.\n  As Vice President for corporate security at Morgan Stanley Dean \nWitter & Co., Rick devised the evacuation plans for the World Trade \nCenter and, in the 1993 bombing, ensured that everyone had evacuated \nbefore he would leave the building. A testament to his selfless \ngenerosity, Rick's colleagues are sure he would have been the last \nperson out of the building on September 11 if the situation had been \ndifferent.\n  Rick's altruism extended into every corner of his life. As husband, \nfather, son, friend, and teacher, Rick faced even chronic illness with \nhumility and valor. His life serves as a model of heroism.

As the first female \nhead of both the State bar association and the State Ethics Commission, \nshe was a pioneer for women in the legal profession. Her brilliant \ncareer and life came to an end far too early, at the age of 56.\n  Marilyn Seichter earned her law degree from the University of \nConnecticut in 1970, and went on to practice family law for 25 years as \na partner with the law firm of Hyman, Cantor, Seichter and Klau in \nHartford. She spent her career fighting for women, children and \nfamilies in Connecticut.\n  In 1971, fresh out of law school, she joined a team of lawyers in \nbringing an abortion rights case against the State of Connecticut. This \ncase had a profound influence on the Supreme Courts decision in Roe vs. \nWade. Later in her career, she represented the National Organization \nfor Women in a lawsuit to stop newspapers from distinguishing between \njobs for men and jobs for women in help wanted sections.\n  Marilyn Seichter's accomplishments include serving as president of \nthe Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund, and as a member of an \nad hoc committee to advise Governor Ella Grasso on judicial \nappointments.\n  I would like to express my condolences to her sister-in-law, \nJacqueline Seichter; her niece, Deborah Seichter; her nephew, Daniel \nSeichter; and her grandnephew, Jacob Seichter; as well as her many \nclose friends and admirers. She was truly one of Connecticut's \ntreasures, and she will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1729-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1729-S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THAKSIN'S THIN SKIN\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the crackdown on foreign \nreporters in Thailand is both troubling and disheartening. While I am \npleased with the decision of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to allow \nreporters from the Far Eastern Economic Review to remain in Thailand, \ndamage to that country's reputation as a democratic enclave in a \nneighborhood of oppressive regimes has already been done.\n  The task now before the Prime Minister is to rebuild the confidence \nof the world's democracies--and in particular America--that he respects \nthe rule of law and freedoms of speech and thought.\n  As former chairman and now ranking member of the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have tried to encourage a variety of \nindependent media programs throughout Southeast Asia and the former \nSoviet Union. In fact, I have been proud to dedicate funding to a \nprogram run by Western Kentucky University's award winning school of \njournalism which provides professional training to foreign journalists. \nI would suggest that there are some Thai government officials who would \nbenefit from Western's tutelage on the import of a free and open press \nin a democracy.\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\n  I know not all Thai politicians and officials agree with Mr. \nThaksin's heavy-handed approach to the media. And I know that the \npeople of Thailand, while deeply concerned about the economy, do not \nwant to lose the freedoms they enjoy. They are keenly aware of the \nplight of their more unfortunate neighbors in Burma, Cambodia, and \nLaos.\n  This brouhaha was completely unnecessary, and was pre-empted, as an \neditorial in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week pointed out, by \nPrime Minister Thaksin's ``thin skin.'' Mr. Thaksin needs to abandon \nhis efforts to control the press and concentrate instead on leading his \ncountry. I find it hard to believe that the Prime Minister is only \ndiscovering that politics is a contact sport.\n  I encourage my colleagues to continue to follow events in Thailand, \nand I extend my appreciation to the Senator from North Carolina for \nspeaking forcefully on this issue early this week. I add my voice to \nthe growing chorus of concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1730-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MIAMI HURRICANES 2001 COLLEGE WORLD SERIES CHAMPS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I rise today to \nwelcome the 2001 University of Miami Hurricanes' baseball team to \nWashington, DC. In June of last year the Hurricanes won their fourth \nnational championship, beating the Stanford Cardinal in the College \nWorld Series.\n  They are joined on their trip to Washington by the school's football \nteam, who you may remember won the 2001 national football championship \nwith a stunning victory in the 88th Rose Bowl. The efforts of both \nteams are being recognized with ceremonies at the White House, as well \nas here on Capitol Hill.\n  The Hurricanes' baseball team completed its stellar year with a 17-\ngame winning streak, and became the 18th team to go undefeated in the \nCollege World Series. With a solid line-up from top to bottom, first-\nrate pitching, and some of the best all-around talent in all of college \nbaseball, the University of Miami capped its season by beating Stanford \n12-1.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate head coach Jim Morris for his \nsecond national title in three years, and I'd like to recognize the \nsenior starters on this team that has meant so much to the University \nof Miami.\n  Pitcher Tom Farmer finished the year 15-2, and won the final game, \nscattering a run and four hits over 5\\2/3\\ innings.\n  First baseman Kevin Brown also had a great Series, batting .467, \nhitting three home runs and leading the team with a home run, a double \nand 5 RBI in the final game.\n  Senior center fielder Charlton ``Chewy'' Jimerson, also had a great \nSeries, being voted the Most Outstanding Player, and showing the \ncountry what the University of Miami already knew.\n  Finally, Greg Lovelady, who caught both the 1999 and 2001 national \ntitle games for the Hurricanes, will be staying with the team as an \nassistant coach. I know his experience will be an asset that Miami \nteams will benefit from for years to come.\n  I am proud to welcome these scholar athletes on behalf of all \nFloridians, and to congratulate the University of Miami for its \nexcellence both on and off the field.\n  I ask consent to have printed in the Record the starting lineup of \nthis championship team.\n  The lineup follows:\n\n          University of Miami Hurricanes Baseball Team Lineup\n\n       Charlton Jimerson, Centerfield;\n       Mike Rodriguez, Leftfield;\n       Javy Rodriguez, Shortstop;\n       Danny Matienzo, Designated Hitter;\n       Kevin Howard, Third Base;\n       Kevin Mannix, Right Field;\n       Kevin Brown, First Base;\n       Kris Clute, Second Base;\n       Greg Lovelady, Catcher;\n       Tom Farmer, Pitcher; and\n       Jim Morris, Head Coach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1730-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING ROBERT HODGES\n\n Mr. HELMS. Madam President, this past Friday, March 8, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs paid special tribute to Robert Hodges of \nStonewall, NC, in a ceremony in Pamlico County where Mr. Hodges was \nofficially recognized and honored as the Nation's oldest veteran.\n  Family records disclose that Mr. Hodges was born June 18, 1891, \nconfirming that he is almost 111 years old. The grandson of slaves, \nRobert Hodges grew up on a large farm; he began working when he was 8 \nor 9 years old. Mr. Hodges was 27 when he volunteered to serve in the \nU.S. Army in 1918. As one of 237,000 African-American stevedores, he \nserved 1 year in France.\n  After his discharge, he returned to North Carolina and to his \nparents' farm. He married Malinda Boyd in 1924; eventually they saved \nenough money to buy their own farm. Along with their eight children, \nthey continued to work the farm until failing eyesight caused him to \nretire in the 1950s, but he continued being an active member of his \nchurch, Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church, and his community.\n  During his 111 years, he was aware of the first flight at Kitty Hawk \nand of Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon. There have been 20 U.S. \nPresidents during his lifetime.\n  I was represented at this ceremony by Kelly Spearman, a very fine \nmember of the Helms Senate Family. Mrs. Spearman presented Mr. Hodges \nan American flag which was flown over the Capitol in his honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1730-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOANNE GLASSER\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, today I rise to pay tribute to \nEastern Kentucky University's 10th president, Joanne Glasser. Ms. \nGlasser was officially inaugurated as the University's first female \npresident, and I would like to join Eastern Kentucky University in \nwelcoming her to the Kentucky academic community.\n  Ever since she graduated from high school in 1969, Joanne Glasser has \nbeen steadily on the rise. She received her bachelor of arts from \nGeorge Washington University in 1973 and a J.D. shortly after from the \nUniversity of Maryland School of Law in 1976. Most recently, she \nreceived a certificate from Harvard Graduate School in 1999. Besides \nher many educational achievements, Ms. Glasser has had a steller career \nas a public servant for the State of Maryland and now the commonwealth \nof Kentucky.\n  After completing law school, Ms. Glasser accepted a job as a law \nclerk for the State of Maryland, Baltimore County, and eventually \nbecame the Assistant County Attorney for Baltimore County. She next \nmoved on to become the Baltimore County Labor Commissioner for 6 years. \nBefore joining the administrative team at Eastern, Ms. Glasser worked \nat Towson University in Maryland, where her hard work and persistent \npersonality eventually earned her a promotion to executive vice \npresident. In October 2001, Eastern Kentucky University gladly invited \nMs. Glasser into their family.\n  Since her arrival, Ms. Glasser's personal style and energy has been a \nmotivating force on the campus and the streets of Richmond. She has \nmade it her mission to be personally involved not only with the \neveryday dealings of the students and faculty but also with local \nleaders. She rightly understands that a university exists to serve the \nneeds of its students and surrounding community. If a decision does not \nfit their needs, it simply will not be made. Joanne Glasser is fully \ncommitted to leading Eastern Kentucky University forward into the 21st \ncentury and her actions prove as much. By relating on a personal level \nwith the students and community, she will gain an understanding of \nwhere to focus her prodigious talents. She is devoted to doing her best \nfor the students and faculty at Eastern Kentucky University. I am very \npleased in the immediate impact Joanne Glasser has made and look \nforward to watching how high she can take the University.\n  I congratulate Ms. Glasser on her inauguration and applaud her \nefforts toward a brighter future for Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1730-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1730-S1731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on March 8, 2002, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3090.

A bill to authorize the negotiation of free trade agreement \nwith the Republic of the Philippines, and to provide for expedited \ncongressional consideration of such an agreement; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Philippine \nFree Trade Act of 2002.\n  My bill provides President Bush with the authority to engage the \nRepublic of the Philippines in negotiations on a free-trade agreement, \nand if an accord is forthcoming, to have it considered by Congress \nunder ``fast-track'' conditions.\n  The political and economic histories of the United States and the \nPhilippines have long been intertwined. Immediately following the end \nof World War II, with the help and protection of the United States, the \nPhilippine economy soared. In the mid-1980's when the circumstances \nsurrounding the Marcos regime threatened to destabilize the country and \nsubvert democracy in his election campaign against Corazon Aquino, the \nUnited States once again provided strong support. I was a member of a \ndelegation of American election observers who voiced strong concerns \nover the conduct of the election and provided support for the rightful \nwinner, Mrs. Aquino. Ultimately she was awarded the presidency and her \nadministration brought greater civil liberties and freedom to the \nPhilippine people and an even stronger relationship with the United \nStates.\n  A free trade agreement with the Republic of the Philippines would \nhold special economic significance for the United States. United States \nexports to the Philippines totaled more than $22.7 billion in the year \n2000. The Philippines ranks as the 19th largest export market for \nAmerican goods. The United States is the largest foreign investor in \nthe Philippines with some $3 billion in investments and 24 percent of \nthe foreign direct investment stock as of the end of the year 2000. \nBoth nations would benefit greatly from the elimination of tariffs and \nincreased economic transparency that would come with a free-trade \nagreement.\n  The Philippine economy has enjoyed a mixed history of growth and \ndevelopment since the end of World War II. Growth immediately after the \nwar was rapid, but slowed over time. The Philippines went from being \none of the wealthiest nations in Asia to one of the poorest. Broad \neconomic reforms designed to spur business growth and foreign \ninvestment met with success through most of the early and mid-1990s. \nUnder the leadership of President Ramos the Philippines secured \nratification of the Uruguay Round agreement and membership in the World \nTrade Organization.\n  The Philippines was not as severely affected by the Asian financial \ncrisis as most of its neighbors but it continue to face economic \nchallenges. Exports continue to grow but at slower rates. Despite \ncontinued slow growth, long-term prospects remain promising. The pace \nof economic reform is expected to accelerate under President Gloria \nMacapagal-Arroyo's leadership. Specifically, it is hoped that progress \nin electronic commerce, banking reform, and securities regulation will \nimprove the investment and business climate.\n  President Arroyo was the first foreign head of state to pledge her \ncountry's strong support for the United States in the aftermath of \nSeptember 11. The Philippines, she said, is prepared to ``go every step \nof the way'' with the United States. The U.S. was provided with the use \nof Filipino ports and airfields to support military operations in \nAfghanistan. President Arroyo defined Philippine national interests by \nlinking the struggle against international terrorism with the struggle \nagainst the Abu Sayyaf within the Philippines.\n  The Philippines has proven to be a strong and steadfast ally in the \nwar on terrorism. I am pleased that American and Filipino troops are \nworking side by side to eliminate the threat posed terrorists linked to \nal Quaeda.\n  I believe a free-trade agreement with the Philippines would make \nsignificant contributions to the economies of both countries and \nstrengthen our diplomatic and security relationships. It will ensure \nthe continuance of open dialogue, peace of mind, and security between \nour two nations.\n  It is my hope that the United States and the Philippines will soon \nbegin the process of constructing a free-trade agreement. There is much \nwork to do and success will not come easily or quickly. But I believe \nincreased free trade is the next step in this close and vitally \nimportant relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/11/senate-section/article/S1733-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 225--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MARCH 10 THROUGH MARCH \n               16, 2002, AS ``NATIONAL GIRL SCOUT WEEK''\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Clinton, \nMs. Cantwell, Mrs. Carnahan, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Landrieu, \nMs. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
