Madam President, I rise today to make a few comments on a \nbill introduced earlier this week and about which I have not had a \nchance to talk. I introduced it along with Senator Lincoln of Arkansas. \nIt is called the Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2001.\n  I am very happy to have had an opportunity to introduce this bill. It \nis important legislation, particularly for seniors living in rural \nareas. The bill is designed to provide more opportunities for seniors \nunder Medicare to have professional assistance in areas where often \nthere are shortages of providers, and this is designed to help that \nsituation.\n  It permits mental health counselors and marriage and family \ntherapists to bill Medicare for their services, and it pays them at the \nrate of clinical social workers.\n  It is particularly important in rural States, such as my State of \nWyoming, where often there is a shortage of mental health providers, \nand so it requires a good deal of travel. On the other hand, there are \ntrained social workers who are prepared to provide these services if \nthey have an opportunity to do it under the Medicare Program. That is \nwhat this bill does.\n  Currently, there are Medicare limitations on the types of mental \nhealth providers. Rural seniors are often forced to travel a good \ndistance to take advantage of those services. Mental health counselors \nand marriage and family therapists are often the only mental health \nproviders in a community. They have the same training and education as \nclinical social workers. Social workers have been recognized by \nMedicare for 10 years.\n  Seniors, of course, do have higher rates of suicide and depression \nthan other populations. Therefore, it is very evident that this change \nis needed. We need to recognize the qualifications of these providers \nand ensure that seniors do have access to them.\n  The majority of Wyoming communities are mental health professional \nshortage areas and probably will continue to be that way for some time. \nBecause Medicare recognizes a limited number of mental health \nproviders, Wyoming seniors have access to 537 providers, 247 social \nworkers, and 121 psychiatrists.\n  This bill will double the number of available Medicare mental health \nproviders. Seventy-five percent of 518 national designated mental \nhealth professional shortage areas are in rural areas. Again, not a \nsurprise.\n  One-fifth of rural counties have no mental health services of any \nkind.\n  Frontier counties, of course, as they are designated in terms of \nmental health providers, are in even more dire straits.\n  Ninety-five percent do not have psychiatrists, 68 percent do not have \npsychologists, and 78 percent do not have social workers.\n  I am proud to be an author of this bill, along with Senator Lincoln. \nI hope we will make some progress as soon as possible. It will perhaps \nnot be this year, I imagine, but it will be as we move on into Medicare \nreform, which I think we will certainly undertake next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12466-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to make a comment or two about the \nsubject we are going to debate this morning. It seems to me certainly \nthere is nothing more important for us to undertake than the matter of \nappropriations for defense. I think the Senate needs to be responsive \nto the President's request for defense funding in not adding non-\ndefense spending to this Defense appropriations bill.\n  Our men and women in the military are overseas defending this \ncountry, and we must support them. This appropriations bill, as other \nappropriations bills, obviously should have been passed back in August \nor September, the end of the fiscal year. We have gone 2 months now \nwithout increasing those dollars. So I hope we can move forward, and I \nhope we do not hold this bill hostage to some kind of fairly unrelated \nspending. We ought to get right to it and do what the President has \nasked us to do.\n  He has indicated what we did in the $40 billion in September is \navailable. He has indicated when they need more money, whether it be \nfor defense or domestic terrorism, he will request more money. So I \ncertainly hope we do not spend a great deal of time trying to add more \ndollars to Defense appropriations than what the President had asked. He \nhas made it quite clear he intends to veto it if it is that way. I \nthink that would be a real disadvantage to us all and to the people we \nare intending to assist.\n  I look forward to being able to deal with that, to come up with \nsomething we can pass through the Senate and the House, get to the \nPresident, and that we can support the President in this area of \ndefense. I think we find ourselves sometimes talking about spending \nmoney when there is not a plan yet to use it. Domestic security is one \nof those things. We have seen meetings where they are working together \nand Governor Ridge has said when we get the plan we will ask for the \nmoney that is necessary if it is not now in the $20 billion. So to go \nahead and sort of put the money out there before those who are managing \nthe program have had an opportunity to decide how that money can best \nbe used is a mistake. I hope we do not do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \ncomprehensive energy bill that is being introduced today.\n  As we all know, there has been a great deal of discussion this year \nabout the nation's energy situation. The increasing volatility in \ngasoline and diesel prices and the growing tension in the world from \nthe terrorist attacks have affected all of us. There is a clear need \nfor energy policies that ensure long term planning, homeland security, \nfuel diversity and a focus on new technologies.\n  To this end, I am very pleased that a comprehensive energy bill has \nbeen introduced in the Senate by my South Dakota colleague, Senator Tom\n\n[[Page S12467]]\n\nDaschle. The bill is the result of many months of hard work by the \nMajority Leader and the chairmen of the committees of jurisdiction, \nincluding Senator Jeff Bingaman, the chairman of the Energy Committee, \nof which I am a member. We have listened to the concerns of both those \nwho run our energy systems and our constituents in crafting the \nlegislation. The result is a balanced and thorough product that \naddresses most of the major segments of the energy system and looks \nahead to the needs of future.\n  The bill covers a number of important areas, including incentives to \nincrease oil and gas production and the nation's supplies of \ntraditional fuels, streamlining of electricity systems and regulations, \nimportant environmental and conservation measures, and provisions to \nincrease efficiency of vehicles and appliances.\n  One of the key provisions in the bill is the inclusion of a renewable \nfuels standard. Earlier this year, I introduced a bill with Senator \nChuck Hagel of Nebraska, the Renewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of \n2001, S. 1006, to ensure future growth for ethanol and biodiesel \nthrough the creation of a new renewable fuels content standard in all \nmotor fuel produced and used in the U.S. I am pleased the framework of \nthis bill is included in the comprehensive energy legislation.\n  Today, ethanol and biodiesel comprise less than one percent of all \ntransportation fuel in the United States. 1.8 billion gallons is \ncurrently produced in the U.S. The energy bill's language would require \nthat five billions gallons of transportation fuel be comprised of \nrenewable fuel by 2012--nearly a tripling of the current ethanol and \nrenewable fuel production.\n  There are great benefits of ethanol and renewable fuels for the \nenvironment and the economies of rural communities. We have many \nethanol plants in South Dakota and more are being planned. These \nfarmer-owned ethanol plants in South Dakota, and in neighboring states, \ndemonstrate the hard work and commitment to serve a growing market for \nclean domestic fuels.\n  Based on current projections, construction of new plants will \ngenerate $900 million in capital investment and tens of thousands of \nconstruction jobs all across rural America. For corn farmers, the price \nof corn is expected to rise between 20-30 cents per bushel. Farmers \nwill have the opportunity to invest in these ethanol plants to capture \na greater piece of the value-added profitability.\n  Combine this with the provisions of the energy bill and the potential \neconomic impact for South Dakota is enormous.\n  Today, an important but underemphasized future is biodiesel, which is \ncheaply produced from excess soybean oil. We all know that soybean \nprices are hovering near historic lows. Biodiesel production is small \nbut has been growing steadily. A renewable fuel standard would greatly \nincrease the prospects for bioproduction and benefit soybean farmers \nfrom South Dakota and other states around the Nation.\n  Moreover, the enactment of renewable fuel standards would greatly \nincrease the Nation's energy security. Greater usage of renewable fuels \nwould displace the level of foreign oil that we currently use. During \nthese difficult times it is imperative that we find ways to improve our \nNation's energy security and reduce our overwhelming dependence on \nforeign oil. A renewable fuel standard would go a long way toward \nachieving this critically important goal.\n  The House has passed an energy bill without any provisions for \nrenewable fuel standard. Moreover, I believe the other body looks \nbackward by focusing too heavily on simple tax breaks for traditional \nfuel supplies without enough encouragement for new technologies. Where \nthere are agriculturally based fuels, wind energy, and so on, we \nadequately provide for it in this Senate legislation. The House bill \nsets us on track for continued heavy reliance on imported petroleum \nfrom unstable nations all around the world.\n  I believe the Senate bill that is now introduced achieves the right \nbalance for the Nation's future. I commend Senator Daschle and Senator \nBingaman for their efforts and I look forward to debate this coming \nyear on this critical piece of legislation which directs our attention \nnot only to energy needs of every kind in our Nation but to the energy \nindependence and energy security that during these troubling times we \nall understand now more profoundly than ever is so badly needed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12467-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, in a short period of time we will take up \nthe Defense appropriations bill. This is a bill the Chair and the \nranking member, Senators Inouye and Stevens, have been working on as \npartners. A better term would be cochairs. They work so well together \nand have for so many years. They worked hard to get the bill to the \npoint where it now is. We also have the full committee chair, Senator \nByrd, who has worked very hard on this, with his counterpart, also, \nSenator Stevens, to get to the point where the bill is.\n  One of the--and I am sorry to say this--controversial aspects of this \nlegislation deals with something Senator Byrd has called homeland \nsecurity. There will be efforts to strike this provision because it \ncosts too much money, according to some, even though Governor Ridge, \nthe homeland security czar, has stated that we need hundreds of \nmillions of dollars for the things he has already recognized need to be \ndone.\n  If we, in our mind's eye, fix the headlines of newspapers in recent \nweeks--Smallpox threat; subsequent headline: Cost of smallpox \nvaccinations more than originally anticipated; yesterday's headlines \nacross the country: Osama bin Laden and the terrorists have recognized \nthat they have what is called a dirty nuclear weapon, maybe--I hope we \nwill be in a position to do something about this. That is what Senator \nByrd has tried to do. That is what this legislation is all about, \ndealing with some of the things I mentioned, headlines around the \ncountry indicating we need to do something about homeland security.\n  Two of our Senators have been attacked with anthrax: Senator Daschle \nand Senator Leahy. As we speak, we are trying to work with Senator \nLeahy's letter to find out what should be done with that.\n  I hope when this legislation comes before us, which will be very \nsoon, we will recognize we will have problems with anthrax and other \nbiological agents such as smallpox, that our ports are unsafe and our \nnuclear plants are unsafe. Local government is really being hurt as a \nresult of their spending all this money. So I hope we do something to \nkeep that in the bill.\n  I see the majority leader has come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senate majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader for his comments\n\n[[Page S12468]]\n\njust now and add my voice. He has said it so well. I know within the \nhour the distinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nByrd, along with the Senator from Hawaii, our dear colleague, Mr. \nInouye, will lay down the Defense Appropriations Committee bill. Of \ncourse, a key part of that Defense Appropriations Committee bill is the \nhomeland defense legislation incorporated within that bill.\n  The homeland defense bill is one-half of our economic stimulus plan, \nfirst and foremost. It responds to the economists across the country \nwho have said, if you are going to improve the economy, if you are \ngoing to strengthen our economic circumstances, the very best way to do \nit--in fact, the only way to ensure that it happens--is to make sure \nthe confidence level of all Americans improves.\n  Confidence has been shaken. The only way we can address it \neffectively is by ensuring that, regardless of where they travel, \nregardless of their circumstances at home, the mail they are now \nreceiving--that under any circumstances we begin to put the safety back \ninto our system, safety that we have lost since September 11. That is \nwhat homeland defense is all about.\n  Read the headlines in almost any daily newspaper. You don't need any \nmore evidence than that, that we have a set of circumstances unlike \nthis country has seen before. God forbid we have another event \ntomorrow, an attack within the week. I have no doubt, if we had any \nkind of additional terror activity, regardless of where it may be, even \nabroad, it would trigger the need, it would trigger the desire on the \npart of our colleagues, to ensure that we have the resources for \nhomeland defense.\n\n  That is what we are saying. We should not be response oriented, we \nshould be preventive in our desire to ensure the infrastructure is in \nplace.\n  We have proposed a very narrowly drawn bill, a bill that addresses \nthe need for bioterrorism response, the need for greater law \nenforcement, the need for protecting our infrastructure, the need for \nensuring that we have the health facilities in place. That is what this \nbill does.\n  I don't know that you could make a better case than the New York \nTimes editorial this morning about the need for homeland defense now. \nThey simply make a statement, about two-thirds of the way through the \neditorial, that says basically: The American people want this \nprotection now. They don't want to wait until next year. They know what \nwe know: The terrorists do not operate on a fiscal year basis. \nTerrorists operate now. Terrorists will operate whenever it is \nconvenient and appropriate for them.\n  There is no time to wait, when it comes to the homeland defense \ninvestments that are so important to us, as we look to restoring \nconfidence, restoring safety, restoring the opportunities that we need \nin this country to be ready should something happen.\n  That is what this fight is going to be all about. I hope our \ncolleagues will join with us in supporting it. I hope we are not going \nto be required to go through it piece by piece, which is what we will \nhave to do if we have no other option; we will offer amendments piece \nby piece.\n  I asked my Republican friends, rhetorically, over the last several \ndays: Tell us which part of it you do not support. Is it the effort at \nbioterrorism? We have 76 cosponsors on the Kennedy-Frist bill. I think \nthere would be strong support for that. Is it efforts to provide \ngreater resources to local law enforcement? If they are opposed to \nthat, let's have an amendment. We'll take it out. Are you opposed to \nproviding the new vaccine for smallpox and anthrax antibiotics? If that \npart is what you are opposed to, we will take that out. But we will be \nrequired, of course, to take each of these pieces step by step. I hope \nthat will not be necessary.\n  I hope people understand this is going to be a very important debate, \na debate that I think will give us our first chance to see how willing \nthe Senate is to respond to the very critical need in this country for \nhomeland defense. This is the first opportunity, and it is on the \nDefense bill. There could not be a more appropriate vehicle for it.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it, will work with us to get it. It \nhas such import that it is my intention to stay on this bill until we \nfinish it. If it takes Saturday to do it, I want to put my colleagues \non notice. Because Monday is a Jewish holiday, Hanukkah, we really have \nto complete our work this week. So we will be on the bill this \nafternoon. We will be on the bill tomorrow. We will be on the bill \nSaturday if necessary. But we will stay on the bill and complete our \nwork on it because it is that critical. We need to get in conference \nwith our House colleagues, and we need to get this job done before we \nleave.\n  Clearly, because of the importance we must place on completing our \nwork, we will have to accommodate whatever schedule is required to \nensure that we complete it this week.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the New York Times editorial \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 6, 2001.]\n\n                        The Home-Front Emergency\n\n       The need to do more to guard against terrorism at home is \n     obvious. Tom Ridge, the director of homeland defense, and \n     members of Congress have certainly endorsed the idea--in \n     principle. Yet today, when the Senate takes up a measure that \n     would add $7.5 billion to the budget for items like airport \n     security and defense against germ warfare, Republican leaders \n     will be trying to block it. The appropriation is tacked onto \n     a emergency military spending bill that no one opposes. But \n     an emergency also exists at home. Senators should put the \n     safety of their constituents first and vote for the entire \n     package.\n       President Bush has threatened to veto the $7.5 billion \n     measure if it reaches his desk, and Mr. Ridge has urged the \n     senators to wait until next year, when he acknowledges he \n     will be asking for more money for things like public health \n     and food safety. Senators have been appropriately skeptical \n     of his plea for delay. ``That, simply stated, is too late,'' \n     said Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican.\n       Why would the White House, which has issued another \n     generalized terrorism warning, want to temporize on mounting \n     an American response? The answer is old-fashioned budget \n     politics. Earlier this year the administration and Congress \n     settled on a ceiling of $686 billion in so-called \n     discretionary spending for the current fiscal year. After \n     Sept. 11, Mr. Bush and Congress agreed to add $40 billion to \n     deal with the terrorist attacks, half of which was supposed \n     to be set aside for New York. Not surprisingly, the money has \n     been used up quickly. About $20 billion is going to the \n     military to prosecute the war in Afghanistan. Only $10 \n     billion may go to New York. Only $8.5 billion is set aside \n     for homeland defenses.\n       It makes no sense to postpone help for the nation's health \n     facilities to recognize and treat victims of biological or \n     chemical attack when federal health officials have testified \n     that their departments could use the money now. If the \n     American people were asked whether they wanted to wait until \n     next year to appropriate money to keep nuclear facilities \n     secure and protect the nation's borders, they would \n     undoubtedly opt for immediate action. The other great unmet \n     need this year is New York City's recovery. The Bush \n     administration argues that the promise of at least $20 \n     billion to help the city will, eventually, be spent as costs \n     are incurred. But that is beside the point. The Senate bill \n     would give New York a further $7.5 billion for costs that \n     would not be covered under those emergency procedures, such \n     as grants to businesses to keep them from moving out of Lower \n     Manhattan. It would also commit money to the Port Authority, \n     the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other agencies \n     to start rebuilding now. Other parts of the package would \n     help reimburse utilities for rewiring the area and hospitals \n     for the emergency care they provided.\n       The only serious argument against the Senate package \n     appears to be the president's opposition. Senator Ted Stevens \n     of Alaska, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations \n     Committee, says he would vote for the bill except that the \n     White House asked him not to.\n       Mr. Bush has lately accused Congress of overspending, \n     though lawmakers have stayed within all the agreed-upon-\n     limits except those related to the emergency. Recently \n     Mitchell Daniels, Mr. Bush's budget director, has been citing \n     new deficit projections as evidence that Congress needs to \n     keep spending down. But the administration has found room to \n     expand the separate economic stimulus package to include huge \n     giveaways to corporations and the wealthy. About $25 billion \n     in the Republican stimulus bill would simply go to help the \n     biggest corporations in America avoid taxes altogether.\n       This is a time for Senator Stevens, and all his colleagues, \n     to vote on the merits. The merits dictate that the bill be \n     passed.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished majority leader, so everyone \nwithin the sound of his voice recognizes this is not\n\n[[Page S12469]]\n\nsomething we are trying to drum up for any reason other than the \nseriousness of it, I direct the Senator to today's newspaper--it is in \nall the newspapers--where the Ambassador from the Taliban to Pakistan \nsaid that any weapons the Taliban have they would use, including \nnuclear. He is not speaking for al-Qaida. If the Taliban, which we \nrecognize as bad people and bad leaders, are willing to do that, will \nthe Senator acknowledge that al-Qaida would be willing to do that, and \nmore?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think it has been documented now in most of the \nnewspapers and media that the terrorist cells which exist have produced \ninformation that would cause us to be concerned that some of these \ncells and some of these networks have weapons of mass destruction that \nthey certainly intend to target towards the United States. There is no \nquestion they have made every attempt to acquire these weapons over the \ncourse of the last several years, and if they have been successful, I \nthink it is a reasonable assumption the United States would be the \nfirst to experience those attacks.\n  That is why it is so critical for us to do all we can to prepare for \nwhatever possibility there is that these weapons could be used against \nus. We are not there yet. We have a lot of work to do to create the \nkind of infrastructure required to provide the maximum degree of safety \nfor all Americans. We don't have that today.\n  Director Ridge has indicated he is prepared to ask for additional \nresources next year. They have acknowledged that additional cost could \nentail upwards of a $200 billion commitment in homeland defense \nresources. But if we are going to require $200 billion, what is wrong \nwith taking the first installment, $7.5 billion, and putting in place \nat least the foundation of this new homeland defense infrastructure?\n  We have to do it. We know we have to do it. Why do it responsively in \nreaction to incidents that have occurred? The time to do it is now, \nbefore these new incidents occur. That is really the essence of the \ndebate in the Chamber this afternoon. But I thank the Senator for \nasking the question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it appears to me the Defense bill has been \nworked very much by Senators Inouye and Stevens, and they have come up \nwith a great bill to meet the demands of this new war. The bill is \nabout $340 billion. We are arguing over $7.5 billion for homeland \nsecurity--the items the distinguished majority leader outlined. It \ndoesn't seem to me we should be arguing about $7.5 billion compared to \n$340 billion. Some people in the administration say maybe we can deal \nwith it in a supplemental next year. But that is next year. It is the \nsame dollars. It would be a few months' difference. A few months, as \nfar as my family is concerned, and the people of every State, could \nmake a big difference.\n  Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Nevada.\n  Also, there really have been, as I understand, two basic concerns \nexpressed by our Republican friends about their additional commitment \nto homeland defense. One was that we agreed to $68.6 billion in \nappropriations for this calendar year. The fact is that is true. We \nhave agreed to $68.6 billion in overall money. But we also have always \nrecognized that in cases of emergency there is a need for an additional \ncommitment in resources. That agreement was reached before the anthrax \nattack. That agreement was reached before we had three specific \nincidents where we were put on high alert as a result of the potential \nfor additional attacks somewhere in this country. Clearly, the \ncircumstances have changed dramatically since that agreement. They \ncertainly have in my office, and I think we could say across the \ncountry.\n  No. 1, I think we all have to recognize the changed circumstances, \nand the emergency circumstances. We need to at least begin to put in \nplace the homeland defense structure that is so critical.\n\n  The second concern is that our Republican colleagues have said this \nreally doesn't have anything to do with stimulus, and for that reason \nthey are opposed to it. Yet that is contrary to what every single \neconomist has told us--that there is a tremendous stimulus out there. \nIn fact, there was an article on the front page of the Washington Post \na few days ago which said as a direct result of the efforts we are now \nmaking on homeland defense, the economy has actually started to blossom \nagain because of some of these new commitments we have made.\n  On both counts--No. 1, because the emergency circumstances have \nchanged, and, No. 2, clearly there is a stimulative value to what it is \nwe are doing beyond the security value to which we should all aspire--\nthere is ample reason for us to be overwhelmingly supportive of \nhomeland defense.\n  I only ask my colleagues: What would happen if we were attacked \ntomorrow? I have no doubt we would respond with not $7.5 billion, but \nwe might respond with $70 billion, if another attack were to occur. We \ndon't want to see another attack. God forbid that there would be \nanother attack. But we have to assume that if it is up to the \nterrorists, because they do not look at fiscal years--they are not \ngoing to wait until after we put all of this in place--they are going \nto attack whenever they think it is right. And I don't want to see that \nhappen to this country. I think it is critical that we be prepared for \nwhatever comes.\n  Our Republican friends say we can't afford $7.5 billion right now. I \nfind that the most illogical of all their arguments given their \nposition. They say we can't commit $7.5 billion. But then they go out \nand commit $175 billion to an economic stimulus package all in the name \nof tax cuts, $23 billion of which goes in the form of retroactive AMT \nrelief to the largest corporations in the country--General Motors, $1 \nbillion; IBM, close to $1 billion; Ford, almost $1 billion in \nretroactive payments. Where is the stimulative value in retroactive \npayments of that magnitude to corporations that have billions of \ndollars of cash on hand?\n  Their notion is, we can't afford it, while at the same time our \nRepublican friends will tell us, well, we still think we ought to be \nspending not $75 billion, which is what the President advocated for a \nstimulus package, but $175 billion--$100 billion more than what the \nPresident has acknowledged would be of stimulative value to us.\n  I have to say that argument doesn't hold much water either. Based on \nwhat opposition I have heard so far, I don't think the argument is even \nclose.\n  The bottom line is that we have to be prepared. The bottom line is \nthat for an economic stimulus package to work, people have to feel more \nsecure. The bottom line is that we need these resources to put in place \na homeland defense system that we recognize will be needed for all \nperpetuity--not just this year and not just next year.\n  I hope our colleagues will join with us in supporting this package in \nthe recognition that we need to be just as cognizant of our needs here \nat home as we are abroad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I saw their discussion occurring on the floor. I have \nbeen doing some calculations with my staff in the Budget Committee. I \nthought some of what we found might be useful in the discussion.\n  Over the next 3 years, the difference between the Republican stimulus \nplan and the Democratic stimulus plan is that the Republicans would add \n$140 billion more in deficits with their stimulus plan than with \nours. And now they are talking about----\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Did the Senator from North Dakota say $140 billion over \nhow long?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Just 3 years.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Just 3 years? Not a 10-year difference but just 3 years?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct. If one looks at the different fiscal \noutcomes based on the Republican stimulus plan and the Democratic \nstimulus plan just over the next 3 years, it is over $140 billion of \nadditional deficits and additional debt with the Republican stimulus \nplan versus the Democratic stimulus plan.\n  Interestingly enough, they are criticizing adding $7.5 billion for \nhomeland security to respond to the bioterrorism threat, to improve \nsecurity at airports, to improve security at our harbors, to improve \nsecurity for the rail system in this country--all things that are \nclearly necessary. I submit that terrorists are unlikely to wait for \nus.\n  But I also have learned that within the administration, they are \nworking\n\n[[Page S12470]]\n\non a supplemental that would come to us early next year for as much as \n$20 billion for these same items. So what we have in terms of \nresistance on the other side to addressing the vulnerability of this \ncountry now on the terrorist threat rings pretty hollow--rings pretty \nhollow--when they say, on the one hand, gee, you are going to be adding \n$7.5 billion to the deficit and the debt, and yet when we examine their \nstimulus package over the next 3 years, compared to ours, they are \ngoing to be adding $140 billion to the deficit and debt and perhaps \nmost revealing, all of their talk about how this represents big \nspending, and we have learned through sources in the administration \nthey are working on their own additional spending plan to be brought \nbefore us next year in the amount of approximately $20 billion.\n  I did not know if the leader had heard of these calculations or of \nthese reports, but I thought it might be useful to the discussion as to \nwhat the issue is going to be when we vote on these questions on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I really appreciate the Senator from North Dakota \nclarifying and reporting to the body about the intentions of the \nadministration. I was not aware they are contemplating a supplemental \nof that magnitude. I find it all the more ironic, I guess, that at the \nvery time they oppose $7.5 billion, they would be contemplating a \nsupplemental of the magnitude the Senator has just announced--a $20 \nbillion supplemental.\n  If $20 billion is good for February, why isn't $7.5 billion good for \nDecember? Where is the difference? Why is it that we must wait? And \nwhat happens between December and February if something, God forbid, \nwould happen?\n  So it seems to me that it makes the case all the more that this isn't \nnecessarily about money, it isn't about the need. It cannot be about \nthe administration's intentions. I do not understand the basis for \ntheir opposition, if, in just 60 days, as the Senator from North Dakota \nreports, they could be preparing a supplemental of the magnitude he has \njust discussed.\n  So I hope our colleagues can clarify that because I think the $20 \nbillion is a clear indication they, too, understand the importance of \nhomeland defense. What we are arguing over is whether we ought to do it \nnow or we ought to do it later.\n  What the Senator from North Dakota is saying is, we ought to do it \nnow. This is the time when we ought to be putting much of the \npreventative infrastructure in place. So I appreciate very much the \nSenator's comments and his contribution to this colloquy.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD: I just say to my colleague, I was startled to hear the \ncriticism coming from the other side on the question of $7.5 billion to \ndeal with specific threats that we all know exist. After all, our \nvulnerability in these matters is not something we just discovered. We \nhave had report after report made by very respected Members. In fact, \nthe former Republican majority leader in the Senate, Howard Baker, did \na report that alerted us to the need for tens of billions of dollars of \nexpenditure to deal with weapons of mass destruction being developed in \nother parts of the world, specifically the former Soviet Union; and \nthere are also the reports that were done on a bipartisan basis of the \nterrorist threats that existed to this country's infrastructure and the \nneed to respond. It takes money to respond.\n  In light of what I have been told by people within the administration \nthat they are, right now, working on a potential supplemental of $20 \nbillion for early next year, perhaps in the March timeframe, that they \nwould be bringing before us, they themselves know it is going to take \nmore money to respond to bioterrorism; it is going to take more money \nto strengthen our airports against terrorist attack; it is going to \ntake more money to provide defense for our harbors and to deal with the \nthreats to the rail infrastructure of this country.\n  I do not think there is a person here that does not know there are \nthese additional threats. When I couple that with what the Republicans \nare doing in terms of their stimulus package that would add, in \ncomparison to our package, over $140 billion of additional deficit and \ndebt over the next 3 years, and they are talking about defending the \ndeficit on $7.5 billion of funding necessary to protect this Nation at \nthe same time they are working on a plan for $20 billion of additional \nfunding to protect this Nation, that kind of rings hollow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I say to the Senator from North Dakota, it does ring \nhollow. I would hope our colleagues could enlighten us as to the \nintentions of the administration. If, indeed, they are going to be \nrequesting this $20 billion supplemental, we ought to know that. If \nthey are going to be requesting it, how much would be dedicated to \nhomeland defense? If they can tell us that, they ought to be explaining \nwhy it is important to do it in March but it is not important to do it \nin December.\n  Can they assure us that between December and March there will not be \nany need at all? I do not think anyone can do that. Nobody is that \nclairvoyant. So it is a risk. I do not think anybody ought to be \nwilling to take that risk today.\n  Clearly, we could commit a lot more than $7.5 billion to our own \npersonal security. But that is what we are doing in the name of \nreaching accommodation with our Republican friends. We started out with \n$15 billion, and we have cut it back in an effort to try to find a way \nto reach some compromise. What we have done is to cut it back to the \nbare essentials.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota pointed out, the essentials--which \nincludes the fight against bioterrorism; the fight to ensure that our \ninfrastructure, our nuclear facilities, our ports, our airports are \nsecure; the fight to ensure that we have the health facilities in \nplace--we were just apprised of a situation where somebody contracted \nWest Nile disease in September. The diagnosis was sent to the Centers \nfor Disease Control, and they were not informed as to what that \ndiagnosis was until just this week because they are so backlogged \nbecause they do not have the resources, they do not have the personnel.\n\n  My goodness, that is a wakeup call of a magnitude about which \neverybody should be concerned. But that is what we are talking about \nwith homeland security: ensuring that we have the resources to deal \nwith diagnosis, ensuring we can work with local law enforcement \nofficials.\n  To which part of what I have just described is our Republican caucus \nopposed? Which part of it do they want to take out? I think that is \nwhat we are going to have to try to figure out.\n  I think clearly within each one of those cases not only are we \nattempting to address it in as conservative a way as we can from a \nfiscal point of view but in as prudent a way as possible, taking what \nneeds to be done first and dealing with those issues that could be \ndealt with later at a later date.\n  So I appreciate very much the Senator's comments this morning.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for an additional observation?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thought I should report on testimony we had before the \nBudget Committee with respect to stimulus. We had a number of \neconomists who appeared who said spending to strengthen security is \nperhaps the very best thing we could do to stimulate the economy. Not \nonly would the spending itself be stimulative, but, more important, it \nwould improve the security of people in the country.\n  One of the big problems we have is a lack of confidence.\n  People are feeling threatened. People are feeling vulnerable. That \ninhibits economic activity. We see that in airline travel. People don't \nfeel safe flying. To the extent you can make expenditures that improve \nthe security of airports and improve the security of rail operations \nand improve the security in ports, that is going to improve the \npsychological security factor that people feel. That is going to help \nthe economy. They said you actually get a double hit: Not only the \nexpenditures will be stimulative, but the additional security will make \npeople feel safer and be safer.\n  I hope this does not become kind of a political debate, a partisan \npolitical debate, but that we deal with the underlying realities. The \nfact is, we know there are things that have to be done to strengthen \nour security. We can make that commitment now and get the work underway \nnow. That makes sense instead of delaying.\n  We are talking about $7.5 billion, when our Republican friends are \ntalking about a stimulus package that\n\n[[Page S12471]]\n\nmeans $140 billion of additional debt over the next 3 years over and \nabove what Democrats are advocating. This choice is going to be a \nrelatively simple one.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \ncontribution. I underscore what he said just now about the stimulative \nvalue of confidence. You can't calculate how much of an improvement in \nthe economy it will make when people feel safe again. You know it is \nthere; intuitively, you know that if people feel good about flying and \ntraveling and doing all the things we did months ago, this economy is \ngoing to start improving. People are going to start putting their lives \nback together again with a sense of normalcy that we have not \nexperienced in some time. They have to know it is safe to do so, that \nour airports and our ports and our nuclear facilities and all of our \ninfrastructure are safer today than they were before.\n  That is, in essence, what we are talking about, creating that \npsychology, that confidence, that sense of normalcy that we have not \nhad now for some time. I hope my colleagues will work with us in a way \nthat will allow us to address this need. If we are going to do it next \nMarch, let's do it now. Let's do it in a way that we can agree ought to \nbe done.\n  Homeland security is not a partisan issue, and it should not be in \nthis case either.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the majority leader has outlined for us \nwhat we will take up the balance of today and possibly tomorrow as we \ndebate the most important issue of Department of Defense \nappropriations.\n  There is something that has to be said in response to what the \nmajority leader has just outlined because while he has opined with \ngreat emotion a frustration about the basis of opposition that those of \nus on this side are expressing to this particular bill, what he has \nfailed to talk about are the very agreements he once made and once \nentered into with our President.\n  That agreement first started on October 2, well after September 11, \nas this country was beginning to assess its needs in light of a \nterrorist threat and how we might ultimately conclude our efforts in \nCongress for fiscal year 2002.\n  The President, the majority leader from South Dakota, the Republican \nleader, and the House met. They looked at all of these different issues \nand agreed on a couple of issues. First, they agreed that $686 billion \nin discretionary spending was an adequate level, plus $40 billion that \nwould be dedicated to homeland defense and the very emergencies we are \ntalking about and the effort to deal with the great tragedy in New York \nCity. Forty billion had already been agreed to: $20 billion of it was \nto be spent immediately at the discretion of the President; $20 billion \nwas to be worked out cooperatively with the Congress and the \nappropriating committees of the Congress. That work has been done.\n  What has gone on in the meantime is the breaking of a word. I come \nfrom Idaho. The majority leader comes from South Dakota. Out there is a \nground level expression called ``a deal is a deal.'' You walk up; you \nlook your fellow person in the eye; you shake hands; you arrive at an \nagreement, and that is the way you operate. We went even beyond that.\n  The President, in a letter, wrote:\n\n       This agreement is the result of extensive discussions to \n     produce an acceptable bipartisan solution to facilitate the \n     orderly enactment of appropriation measures. This agreement \n     and the aggregate spending level are the result of a strong \n     bipartisan effort at this critical time for our Nation, and I \n     expect that all parties will now proceed expeditiously and in \n     full compliance with the agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  Today the deal is not a deal; the deal has been broken. The DOD bill \nthat comes before us this afternoon is a deal breaker.\n  What the majority leader did not say, as he opined the criticality of \na homeland defense expenditure, was that it was not designed by the \nappropriate committees. It was not reviewed by all of the committees of \njurisdiction. It was largely written in the back room of the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, Senator Bob Byrd. I am not at all here \ntoday to impugn the integrity of Senator Byrd. That is not my intent. I \nwork with him on a daily basis. I have high regard for him.\n  But for the majority leader to come and say that $15 billion of \nspending is necessary in all of these categorized areas for homeland \ndefense is totally ignoring the fact that darn few have seen all of \nwhere it goes. Our new Homeland Defense Director is at this moment \ndeveloping an analysis of and an expression of need for a full \nimplementation of homeland defense. That is where he talks, and the \nmajority leader spoke, too--the issue of coming forth next year \nwith recommendations, thoroughly vetted, looked at by all, examined by \nthe committees of jurisdiction and not done in the back room of the \nAppropriations Committee of the Senate.\n\n  I am a bit surprised when the majority leader comes to the Chamber \nand suggests that Republicans are attempting to play politics with the \nissue of the stimulus package. It has been openly discussed. That is \nappropriate. It has been reviewed by the authorizing committees, and \nthat is appropriate. But what has not gone on and that which is being \nbrought to this committee this afternoon is a thorough and responsible \nexamination by all involved. That is why we look at it with great \nconcern, and the very reality that the money we are spending today \ncrosses that line of a balanced budget and into deficit.\n  There is no question that a stimulus package that will be dealt with \nbipartisanly or not is going to have the impact of deficit spending or \nit likely could happen. But the reason we are willing to look at an \ninvestment in the economy today is the hopes of lessening that deficit, \ngetting people back to work, causing things to happen out there.\n  Before the August recess, 1 million Americans had lost their jobs. We \nwere already in recession by August.\n  The appropriate committees that examine it and the appropriate \nFederal agencies that examine it to make the official proclamation had \nnot yet done so. That didn't occur until just a few weeks ago. Any of \nus going home, any of us spending time in our communities knew this \ncountry's economy had turned down dramatically. Now the figures show \nthat it started well before George W. Bush came to town. It started in \nSeptember of a year ago, and it was accelerating through the fall and \ninto the winter months and across the summer. We now know that as a \nreality. It is important that we do a stimulus package. We responded to \nthat when we did tax relief earlier this spring, and the then-chairman \nof the Budget Committee, who is now on the floor, spoke very eloquently \nas to why we did that. That is all part of the reason we are here.\n  I am extremely surprised we would now attempt to do what we are \nattempting to do in this. We will oppose this effort.\n  A deal is a deal. The President has said he will veto it. I am sorry \nthe message did not get to the majority leader. I am sorry the \nagreement he once struck is no longer the deal because he says \ncircumstances have changed.\n  No, frankly, circumstances have not changed. There is still a lot of \nmoney out there to spend. This afternoon we will thoroughly debate this \nissue, but it is important that the statements made this morning be \nresponded to.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12471-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12471-S12472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before we are finished with the \nappropriations bill that will be before the Senate shortly and the \neconomic stimulus package that someday will come up--I do not know \nwhen--I am very hopeful this will not end up being a partisan charade, \nbut I can cite a couple items that do bother me.\n  I was reading Roll Call a couple days ago. I understood the majority \nleader made a statement that whoever was on that committee to produce a \nstimulus, they had gotten the message from the leadership and the \nDemocrats that unless two-thirds of the Democrats were for the package, \nthey could not take it out of this conference committee. It would not \ncome out. That is an interesting statement. I assume it is pretty \npartisan, too.\n  Things operate in the Senate on a majority basis. We do not need two-\nthirds of Democrats and Republicans to\n\n[[Page S12472]]\n\nproduce a stimulus package. In any event, I hope that is not a sign \nthat it is going to be partisan because we do have a chance to produce \na stimulus package that will be worthwhile.\n  From my standpoint, I think I am going to put together a stimulus \npackage--what would go this with that, that with this. I might do that \nin the next couple days and at least come to the Chamber and talk about \na stimulus package and why it is a stimulus package.\n  It is important to not just work on what we choose to call a stimulus \npackage. The occupant of the chair would like to know that it produces \nnew jobs, that it puts people to work, along with the other issues, \nsuch as unemployment compensation, perhaps some health care activity.\n  Clearly, we have to put some provisions in the bill that will \nencourage this economy in a realistic way. I will be watching. Everyone \nelse will be watching. I hope we can get it done in due course.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12472-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12472-S12475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF HARRIS L. HARTZ TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE \n                             TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11:40 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider the nomination of Harris Hartz, to be U.S. Circuit Judge. The \nclerk will state the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Harris L. Hartz, of New \nMexico, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, is there some reason for 3 minutes or is \nit assumed I asked for 3 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was under the impression the Senator \nwanted 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can I do this, so I will not feel too pressed: I ask \nunanimous consent that I be able to speak for up to 5 minutes, which I \nprobably will not use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay credit to a very \ndistinguished lawyer and judge. His name is Harris Hartz. Today when we \nvote, if a majority votes for him--and I do not see why we would not; \nit might be a unanimous vote--he will become the U.S. Circuit Judge for \nthe Tenth Circuit.\n  To the extent a Senator, based upon observing and asking other \npeople, can fill himself or herself with knowledge about a person, I \nhave to say he is probably one of the most qualified persons I have \never asked the President to put on the bench.\n  His academic background is so superb that no one can challenge it. If \nHarvard Law School is a good law school, and he was among its best \nstudents--magna cum laude--all of the attributes of a great mind that \nwas being moved and melded into a great leader mind, that happened to \nhim. From that time on, he has been engaged in various activities that \nhave made him a broad-based lawyer to take this job.\n  He was a circuit judge in New Mexico, which caused him over time to \npublish 300 opinions, Mr. President. If people do not know him, they \nhave not bothered to read his opinions.\n  Whether it is being scholarly, whether he understands, whether he \nplays no favorites, whether he is truly a good judge, in what judges do \nbesides knowing the law--adding all that together, the Senator from New \nMexico recommended him to the President. He was thoroughly vetted at \nthe executive branch, and obviously the background checks have \noccurred, and he came forth with all the right pluses attendant his \nname.\n  Today, the 5- or 6-month ordeal which all candidates face--families \nworrying, wives and children wondering how much longer--will come to an \nend, and he will be sitting on the bench in the southwestern United \nStates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his vitae and the Department of Justice \nanalysis of his background be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Harris L. Hartz\n\n\n                               biography\n\n       Harris L. Hartz is a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard \n     Law School, where he was selected as Case and Developments \n     Editor of the Harvard Law Review. He received his AB degree \n     from Harvard College summa cum laude in physics. At Harvard \n     he was one of 9 members of his class elected to Phi Beta \n     Kappa in their junior year.\n       From 1989 to 1999, Hartz served as a judge on the New \n     Mexico Court of Appeals for eleven years. During that time he \n     authored approximately 300 published opinions. In 1997, Judge \n     Hartz was elevated to the position of Chief Judge. During his \n     last year on the Court, he was a member of the Executive \n     Committee of the American Bar Association Council of Chief \n     Judges.\n       In 1999 Judge Hartz resigned from the Court of Appeals to \n     join the law firm of Stier, Anderson & Malone as special \n     counsel to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He has \n     worked with the Union to develop a Code of Conduct and an \n     internal system for compliance and enforcement.\n       Before becoming a judge, most of Judge Hartz's legal career \n     was as a lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During his first \n     three years after law school he was an Assistant United \n     States Attorney for the District of New Mexico. After \n     teaching for a semester in 1976 at the University of Illinois \n     College of Law, he spent three years with the New Mexico \n     Governor's Organized Crime Prevention Commission, first as \n     its attorney and then as Executive Director. For the \n     following nine years he was in private practice, primarily in \n     civil litigation.\n       Judge Hartz has been active in the American Law Institute \n     since 1993 and now serves as an Adviser for the Restatement \n     of the Law (Third) Agency. He has also participated in \n     activities of the American Bar Association, including \n     membership on the Appellate Practice Committee of the \n     Appellate Judges Conference and the Advisory Committee to the \n     ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security.\n       His past civic activities have included being Chair of the \n     New Mexico Racing Commission, where his efforts against \n     drugging of racehorses led to his nomination for the Joan Pew \n     Award and his being appointed co-chair of the Quality \n     Assurance Committee of the National Association of State \n     Racing Commissioners. For the past two years Judge Hartz has \n     been chair of the New Mexico Rhodes Scholarship Selection \n     Committee and chair of the Selection Committee for the New \n     Mexico Ethics in Business Awards. He is active in Rotary, and \n     has served as President of the Rotary Club of Albuquerque.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Harris L.

Should he \n     be confirmed by the United States Senate, I believe Mr. Hartz \n     will, in his service, make each of us proud that we had a \n     part in placing him on the 10th circuit.''--Excerpt from \n     letter to Senator Hatch, August 9, 2001.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to share a quote from an \neditorial in one of our State's leading newspapers, the Santa Fe New \nMexican:\n\n       The cerebral and academic Hartz is everything America wants \n     in its judiciary.\n\n  Before becoming a judge, most of Judge Hartz's legal career was as a \nlawyer in Albuquerque, NM. During his first 3 years after law school he \nwas an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico. \nAfter teaching for a semester in 1976 at the University of Illinois \nCollege of Law, he spent 3 years with the New Mexico Governor's \nOrganized Crime Prevention Commission, first as its attorney and then \nas executive director.\n  I believe Judge Hartz will be an excellent U.S. circuit judge because \nabove all he is a person with great strength of character. He has the \ncourage to render decisions in accordance with the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States. More important, I believe Judge Hartz will \nrespect both the rights of the individual and the rights of society and \nwill be dedicated to providing equal justice under the law. He \nunderstands and appreciates the genius of our Federal system and the \ndelicate checks and balances among the branches of our National \nGovernment.\n  Judge Hartz also understands New Mexico because he was raised in \nFarmington. Judge Hartz's 29 years of experience both as a lawyer and a \njudge have prepared him well for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. I \nbelieve Judge Hartz will be a fine circuit judge. I count him among my \nfriends, and I recommend him highly to the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is taking final action on \nthree additional judicial nominations. There are a total of nine \njudicial nominees who have been voted out of committee and are awaiting \nfinal action by the Senate. Today's confirmation of 1 circuit court and \n2 district court judges will bring the total number of judges confirmed \nthis year to 21. When the Senate completes its action on the nomination \nof the remaining 6 district court judges, we will have confirmed 27 \njudges since July, including 6 to the Courts of Appeals.\n  I congratulate today's nominees and their families on their \nnominations, confirmations, and what is soon to be their appointments \nto the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and the \nUnited States District courts for Kentucky and the District of \nOklahoma. I also commend each of the Senators who worked with the \ncommittee and the majority leader to help bring these nominations \nforward and to have the Senate act to confirm them.\n  The nominee to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, Harris Hartz, \ncomes to us with the strong support of both Senator Domenici and \nSenator Bingaman. He was the first nominee to a Court of Appeals \nreceived by the Senate this June. His nomination is an example of the \nsort of progress we can make on consensus nominees with bipartisan \nsupport. The Tenth Circuit is one of many Courts of Appeals with \nmultiple vacancies, and which has had multiple vacancies long before \nthis summer. My recollection is that President Clinton had at least two \nnominees for vacancies on the Tenth Circuit pending in 1999 and for \nseveral months last year, but neither was ever accorded a hearing or a \nvote before the Judiciary Committee or before the Senate. Had they and \nother previous nominees been acted upon promptly and favorably in years \njust past, of course, the circumstances in the Tenth Circuit and many \nother courts around the country would be different today. During 6\\1/2\\ \nyears, the Republican majority in the Senate allowed only 46 nominees \nto be confirmed to the Courts of Appeals and left dozens of vacancies \nunfilled.\n  Just as we recently proceeded to confirm the first judge to the Fifth \nCircuit in 7 years, we are proceeding with Judge Hartz to provide some \nimmediate relief to the Tenth Circuit. When confirmed, Judge Hartz will \nbe the first new member of the Tenth Circuit in the last 6 years--since \njudges were confirmed to that Court in 1995 from Utah and Colorado.\n  Over the past 6\\1/2\\ years the average time it has taken for the \nSenate to consider and confirm Court of Appeals nominees had risen to \nalmost 350 days. The time it has taken for Judge Hartz's nomination is \nabout half of that, if measured from his initial nomination in June \n2001. Of course, that nomination was returned to the White House when \nthe Republican leader objected to keeping judicial nominations pending \nover the August recess. Accordingly, the nomination on which the Senate \nacts today was not received until this September. If measured from the \ntime the committee received his ABA peer review to the time of his \nconfirmation today, the process has taken only 112 days. He \nparticipated in one of the many October hearings and, having answered \nthe written questions following his hearing, was reported by the \ncommittee in November.\n  The strong bipartisan support he has received from his Senate \ndelegation paved the way for prompt action in one-third to one-half the \ntime it used to take on average to consider Court of Appeals nominees. \nBoth of the district court nominees, Danny Reeves from the Eastern \nDistrict of Kentucky and Joe Heaton for the Western District of \nOklahoma, whom I supported at the committee and am pleased to support \ntoday, have moved through the process with the support of Democrats and \nRepublicans relatively quickly.\n  Since July 2001, when the Senate was allowed to reorganize and the \ncommittee membership was set, we have maintained a strong effort to \nconsider judicial and executive nominees. There are a total of nine \njudicial nominees who have been voted out of committee and are awaiting \nfinal action by the Senate. Today's confirmation of one circuit court \nand two district court judges will bring the total number of judges \nconfirmed to 21. When the Senate completes its action on the nomination \nof the remaining six district court judges, we will have confirmed 27 \njudges since July, including six to the Courts of Appeals. That will be \nalmost twice the total number of judges that were confirmed in all of \n1989, the first year of the first Bush administration, and will include \ntwice as many judges to the Courts of Appeals as were confirmed in the \nfirst year of the Clinton administration. It is also more judges that \nwere confirmed in all of the 1996 session. Thus, despite all the \nobstacles, we exceeded the number of confirmations of judges during the \nfirst year of the first Bush administration by six, the last year of \nthe first Clinton term by four, and we are on pace to confirm as many \njudges as were confirmed in the first year of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Our total of six Court of Appeals confirmations doubles the number of \nappellate court judges confirmed in the entire first year of the \nClinton administration, one more than the number of appellate court \njudges confirmed in the first full year of the first Bush \nadministration, and six more than were confirmed in the entire 1996 \nsession, the last year of President Clinton's first term.\n  When I assumed the chairmanship, the number of vacancies on the \nFederal Bench was over 100 and quickly rose to 111. Since July, we have \nmade significant progress. In spite of the upheavals we have \nexperienced this year with the shifts in chairmanship, the vacancies \nthat have arisen since this summer, and the need to focus our attention \non responsible action in the fight against international terrorism, \nwith the confirmation of these 9 nominees we will have reduced the \nnumber of vacancies to below 100 for the first time since early this \nyear.\n  During the time a Republican majority controlled the process over the \npast 6\\1/2\\ years, the vacancies rose from 65 to at least 103, an \nincrease of almost 60 percent. We are making strides to improve on that \nrecord. The President has yet to send nominations to fill more than \nhalf of the current vacancies. This is a particular problem with\n\n[[Page S12474]]\n\nthe 71 district court vacancies, for which 49--that's 69 percent--do \nnot have nominations pending.\n  We have been able to reduce vacancies over the last 6 months through \nhard work and a rapid pace of scheduling hearings. Until I became \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, no judicial nominees had been \ngiven hearings this year. No judicial nominees had been considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee or been voted upon by the Senate. After almost \na month's delay in the reorganization of the Senate in June while \nRepublicans sought leverage to change the way the judicial nominations \nhad traditionally been considered and abruptly abandoned the practices \nthat they had employed for the last 6\\1/2\\ years, I noticed our first \nhearing on judicial nominees within 10 minutes of the reorganization \nresolution being adopted by the Senate.\n  I have previously noted that during the 6\\1/2\\ years the Republican \nmajority most recently controlled the confirmation process, in 34 of \nthose months they held no confirmations for any judicial nominees at \nall, and in 30 other months they conducted only a single confirmation \nhearing involving judicial nominees. Since the committee was assigned \nits members in early July 2001, I have held confirmation hearings every \nmonths, including two in July, two during the August recess and three \nhearings during October. Only once during the previous 6\\1/2\\ years has \nthe committee held as many as three hearings in a single month.\n  On the other hand, on at least three occasions during the past 6\\1/2\\ \nyears the committee had gone more then 5 months without holding a \nsingle hearing on a pending judicial nominee. We have held more \nhearings involving judicial nominees since July 11, 2001, than our \nRepublican predecessors held in all of 1996, 1997, 1999, or 2000. In \nthe last 6 months of this extraordinarily challenging year, the \ncommittee has held 10 hearings involving judicial nominees. Just this \nweek the committee held our tenth hearing on judicial nominations since \nI became chairman, when the Senate was allowed to reorganize and this \ncommittee was assigned its membership on July 10, 2001. Since September \n11, the Judiciary Committee has held six judicial confirmation \nhearings.\n  We have held hearings on 33 judicial nominees, including 7 to the \nCourts of Appeals. Since September 11 we have held hearings on 26 \njudicial nominees, including 4 to the Courts of Appeals. Within 2 days \nof the terrible events of September 11, I chaired a confirmation \nhearing for the 2 judicial nominees who drove to Washington while air \ntravel was still disrupted. Then on October 4, 2001, we held another \nconfirmation hearing for five judicial nominees, which included a \nnominee from Nebraska who was unable to attend the earlier hearing \nbecause of the disruption in air travel.\n  On October 18, 2001, in spite of the closure of Senate office \nbuildings in the wake of the receipt of a letter containing anthrax \nspores and in spite of the fact that Senate staff and employees were \ntesting positive for anthrax exposure, the committee proceeded under \nextraordinary circumstances in the U.S. Capitol to hold a hearing for \nfive more judicial nominees. The building housing the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing room was closed, as were the buildings housing the \noffices of all the Senators on the committee. Still we persevered.\n  On October 25, 2001, while the Senate Republicans were shutting down \nthe Senate with a filibuster preventing action on the bill that funds \nour Nation's foreign policy initiatives and provides funds to help \nbuild the international coalition against terrorism, the Judiciary \nCommittee nonetheless proceeded with yet another hearing for four more \njudicial nominees. On November 7, 2001, we convened another hearing for \njudicial nominees within 8 extraordinary weeks--weeks not only \ninterrupted by holidays, but by the aftermath of the terrorist attacks \nof September 11, the receipt of anthrax in the Senate, and the closure \nof Senate office buildings. The hearing on November 7 was delayed by \nanother unfortunate and unforeseen event when one of the family members \nof a nominee grew faint and required medical attention. With patience \nand perseverance, the hearing was completed after attending to those \nmedical needs.\n  On December 5, 2001, we convened another hearing for another group of \nfive judicial nominees. I thank Senator Durbin for volunteering to \nchair that hearing for nominees from Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, \nNevada, and Texas. We have previously considered and reported other \nnominees from Alabama, Georgia, and Nevada, as well. We have \naccomplished more, and at a faster pace, than in years past. Even with \nthe time needed by the FBI to follow up on the allegations that arose \nregarding Judge Wooten in connection with his confirmation hearing, we \nhave proceeded much more quickly than at any time during the last 6\\1/\n2\\ years. Thus, while the average time from nomination to confirmation \ngrew to well over 200 days for the last several years, we have \nconsidered nominees much more promptly. Measured from receipt of their \nABA peer reviews, we have confirmed the judges this year, including the \nCourt of Appeals nominees, on average in less than 60 days. So, we are \nworking harder than ever on judicial nominations despite the \ndifficulties being faced by the Nation, the Senate, and a number of \nmembers on the committee.\n  We have also completed work on a number of judicial nominations in a \nmore open manner than ever before. For the first time, this committee \nis making public the ``blue slips'' sent to home State Senators. Until \nmy chairmanship, these matters were treated as confidential materials \nand restricted from public view. We have moved nominees with little or \nno delay at all from hearing, on to the committee's business meeting \nagenda, and then out to the floor, where nominees have received timely \nrollcall votes and confirmations.\n  The past practices of extended unexplained anonymous holds on \nnominees after a hearing have not been evident in the last 6 months of \nthis year as they were in the past. Indeed over the past 6\\1/2\\ years \nat least eight judicial nominees who completed a confirmation hearing \nwere never considered by the committee but left without action. Just \nlast year two of the three Court of Appeals nominees reported to the \nSenate, Bonnie Campbell of Iowa and Allen Snyder of the District of \nColumbia, were both denied committee consideration from their May \nhearings until the end of the year. Likewise the extended, unexplained, \nanonymous holds on the Senate Executive Calendar that characterized so \nmuch of the last 6\\1/2\\ years have not slowed the confirmation process \nthis year.\n  Majority Leader Daschle has moved swiftly on judicial nominees \nreported to the calendar. And once those judicial nominees have been \nafforded a timely rollcall vote, the record shows that the only vote \nagainst any of President Bush's nominees to the Federal courts to date \nwas cast by the Republican leader.\n  In addition to our work on judicial nominations, during the recent \nperiod since September 11, the committee also devoted significant \nattention and effort to expedited consideration of antiterrorism \nlegislation. Far from taking a ``time out'' as some have suggested, the \nJudiciary Committee has been in overdrive since July and we have \nredoubled our efforts after September 11, 2001. With respect to law \nenforcement, I have noted that the administration was quite slow in \nmaking U.S. attorney nominations, although it had called for the \nresignations of U.S. attorneys early in the year.\n  Since we began receiving nominations just before the August recess, \nwe have been able to report, and the Senate has confirmed, 57 of these \nnominations. We have only a few more U.S. attorney nominations received \nin November, and await approximately 30 nominations from the \nadministration. These are the President's nominees based on the \nstandards that he and the Attorney General have devised.\n  I note, again, that it is most unfortunate that we still have not \nreceived even a single nomination for any of the U.S. marshal \npositions. U.S. marshals are often the top Federal law enforcement \nofficer in their district. They are an important front-line component \nin homeland security efforts across the country. We are near the end of \nthe legislative year without a single nomination for these 94 critical \nlaw enforcement positions. It will likely be impossible to confirm any \nU.S. marshals this year having not received any nominations in the \nfirst 11 months of the year.\n\n[[Page S12475]]\n\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, some of us have \nbeen seeking to join together in a bipartisan effort in the best \ninterests of the country. For those on the committee who have helped in \nthose efforts and assisted in the hard work to review and consider the \nscores of nominations we have reported this year, I thank them. As the \nfacts establish and as our actions today and all year demonstrate, we \nare moving ahead to fill judicial vacancies with nominees who have \nstrong bipartisan support. These include a number of very conservative \nnominees.\n  I am proud of the work the committee has done on nominations, and I \nam proud that by the end of the day we will have confirmed 21 judges. I \nhope that by the end of this session that total will rise to about 30 \nas the committee continues its work on the nominations heard this week \nand the Senate confirms the additional 6 nominees who were voted out of \ncommittee last week.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today we are considering the \nnominations of three extremely well-qualified individuals for the \nFederal bench.\n  Our circuit court nominee is the Honorable Harris Hartz of New \nMexico, whom the President has selected to serve on the Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. I have a personal interest in the confirmation of \nfair, qualified judges to serve on the Tenth Circuit since it \nencompasses the great state of Utah. In fact, there is an eminently \nwell-qualified nominee from Utah for the Tenth Circuit, University of \nUtah Law Professor Michael McConnell, who is awaiting a hearing from \nthe Judiciary Committee. His nomination has been pending for 211 days \nwithout a hearing. There are two other nominees for the Tenth Circuit \nwho are also awaiting hearings on their nominations: Timothy Tymkovich \nof Colorado, who has been waiting 195 days, and Terrence O'Brien of \nWyoming, who has been waiting 126 days.\n  Part of the holdup has unquestionably been due to lack of action by \nthe Judiciary Committee, but the ABA must shoulder some of the blame as \nwell. It took the ABA over 8 weeks to return its evaluation of Michael \nMcConnell, which, incidentally, was a rating of unanimously well \nqualified, over 15 weeks for Timothy Tymkovich, and over 12 weeks for \nTerrence O'Brien. The last of these three ratings was submitted in \nOctober, so there is no excuse for any of these nominations stalling \nany longer. I look forward to the opportunity to consider their \nnominations at hearings so that the pending vacancies on the Tenth \nCircuit can be expediently filled.\n  Our consideration of Judge Hartz's nomination today is a positive \nstep in that direction. His impressive legal career began--atypically--\nwith a degree from Harvard College summa cum laude in physics. Later, \nhe graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was \nselected as Case and Developments Editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n  Judge Hartz's legal experience began in Albuquerque, NM, as an \nAssistant United States Attorney. After that, he taught for a semester \nat the University of Illinois College of Law, and then returned to New \nMexico to work with the New Mexico Governor's Organized Crime \nPrevention Commission. For the following 9 years he was in private \npractice, primarily in civil litigation, and then he served for 11 \nyears as a judge on the New Mexico Court of Appeals. Currently, Judge \nHartz works as special counsel to the International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters, developing a Code of Conduct and an internal system for \ncompliance and enforcement. As you can see, he is a highly competent \nand hard-working person who is eminently well qualified to serve as a \njudge on the Tenth Circuit.\n  In addition to Judge Hartz, we have the privilege of considering the \nnomination of two district court nominees. One of these nominees is Joe \nHeaton for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nOklahoma. Mr. Heaton is a native Oklahoman with an outstanding record \nof legal experience and public service. After graduating from the \nUniversity of Oklahoma College of Law--where he was Order of the Coif--\nhe maintained a general civil practice with an emphasis in business and \ncommercial matters. For 8 years, Mr. Heaton served as a member of the \nOklahoma House of Representatives, including several years as Minority \nLeader. Then, in 1996, Mr. Heaton began serving in his current position \nas the First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of \nOklahoma, where he has earned a good reputation while handling a wide \nvariety of legal matters.\n\n  Our second district court nominee is Danny C. Reeves for the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. He began his legal \ncareer as a law clerk for then-district Judge Eugene Siler, who now \nsits on the Sixth Circuit. Mr. Reeves then joined the Lexington office \nof Greenebaum, Doll & McDonald, where he rose to the rank of partner in \n1988. Despite his busy legal career, he has served as a director of the \nVolunteer Center of the Bluegrass, the Kentucky Museum of Natural \nHistory, and the Bluegrass Youth Hockey Association.\n  Again, Mr. President, I am pleased to see such well-qualified \nnominees being brought before the Senate for consideration. Each of \nthese nominees received unanimous support from the Members of the \nJudiciary Committee, and I expect that they will receive similar \ntreatment from the full Senate. I commend President Bush for nominating \npersons who will bring honor and dignity to the Federal bench, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting their nominations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Harris L. Hartz, of New Mexico, to be \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit? The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered on the nomination. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The President will be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction.\n\n\n                     nomination of danny c. reeves\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support \nof the nomination of Danny Reeves to be a Federal District Judge for \nthe Eastern District of Kentucky.\n  Danny is a Kentucky native. He grew up in Corbin in the eastern part \nof our Commonwealth, and later went to college at Eastern Kentucky \nUniversity. He then graduated with honors from the Chase Law School in \nnorthern Kentucky, and clerked for one of Kentucky's leading jurists on \nthe Federal bench, Gene Siler.\n  Since then, Danny has practiced exclusively at a prominent Kentucky \nfirm, specializing in complex civil litigation. In that time, he has \nnot only represented a number of Kentucky's leading businesses, but he \nhas also done a great deal of community service work, focusing on title \nIX compliance for the Kentucky High School Athletic Association.\n  To be honest, I did not know Danny before I sat down earlier this \nyear to talk with him about his interest in sitting on the Federal \nbench. But in the conversations we have had, it became clear that he is \na bright, articulate lawyer who has the demeanor and integrity to be a \nfine judge. I enthusiastically support his nomination.\n  I thank my colleagues for voting for this nomination. Danny Reeves \nknows the people of eastern Kentucky, he knows the law and he knows how \nthe Federal bench in the Eastern District works. He is going to be able \nto hit the ground running, and he is going to do an exemplary job. The \nPresident made a fine choice in nominating him, and the sooner the \nSenate can confirm him, the better it will be for justice in Kentucky.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JOSEPH L. HEATON\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has just \nconfirmed Joe Heaton, an outstanding individual and a superb attorney, \nto be U.S. district court judge for Oklahoma's Western District.\n  President Bush could not have made a finer selection to serve our \ncountry as a district court judge. Joe Heaton is exceptionally well \nqualified and will prove to be a great asset to the judicial system in \nOklahoma and our country.\n  Joe graduated from Northwestern State College in his home town of \nAlva, OK, in 1973. Even before his graduation, Joe's commitment to \npublic service was already evident. While still in school, he was \nelected to the Alva City Council and later was elected to serve as \ncouncil president. Following graduation from college, Joe attended the \nUniversity of Oklahoma School of Law where he excelled, making Oklahoma \nLaw Review and Order of the Coif. He was also on the Dean's honor roll \nand won American Jurisprudence Awards in Constitutional Law and \nConflicts of Law. Upon his graduation from law school Joe continued to \ndedicate himself to public service, this time coming here to Washington \nto serve as Legislative Assistant to Senator Dewey Bartlett.\n  Returning to Oklahoma in 1977 he practiced law with the prestigious \nfirm of Fuller, Tubb & Pomeroy. He is respected by his colleagues as an \n``honorable and trustworthy leader and friend.'' While engaged in civil \npractice, Joe was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives \nwhere he served until 1992. In this capacity as a State legislator, Joe \nserved as the Republican leader for 3 years. His fellow legislators \nhave described him as possessing the qualities needed on the Federal \nbench.\n  In 1991, I was pleased to recommend Joe's appointment to serve as \nU.S. attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma. He joined the U.S. \nattorney's office as a special assistant U.S. attorney and served in \nthat capacity until 1992 when he became the U.S. attorney. In 1993, Joe \nreturned to private practice until 1996 when then U.S. attorney, \nPatrick Ryan, asked him to return to the U.S. attorney's office. For \nthe next 2 years, Joe was acting U.S. attorney while Mr. Ryan was in \nDenver in connection with the Oklahoma City bombing trials of Timothy \nMcVeigh and Terry Nichols. Once again, Joe exhibited his strong \ncommitment to serving Oklahoma and the Nation.\n  Joe and his wife Dee Anne are very active in their church where Joe \nserves as an Elder. They are proud of their two sons, Andrew and Adam. \nI congratulate Joe and his family on his having earned the position for \nwhich President Bush has selected him. I thank Chairman Leahy and \nRanking Member Hatch for their work on Joe Heaton's nomination. I \napplaud the Senate for confirming him as he will make an outstanding \njudge who will work diligently to administer justice while serving as a \nFederal district court judge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12476-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, on Tuesday of this week the \nAppropriations Committee met to approve the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2002, by a vote of 29 to zero. I am \npleased to present the recommendations to the Senate today, as division \nA of this bill, H.R. 3338.\n  I will focus my remarks on division A, the Defense portion of the \nbill. Later today, Chairman Byrd will describe the provisions of \ndivisions B through E. I want to point out that I support the \nallocation of $7.4 billion for Defense contained in division B. Prompt \naction on this measure will ensure that our efforts to fight terrorism \nare fully supported.\n  The House passed its version of this bill just last week, so you can \nsee we have acted as expeditiously as possible to bring it to the \nSenate. I want to note to all my colleagues that this would not have \nbeen possible without the tremendous cooperation that I have received \nfrom Senator Stevens and his able staff.\n  The Defense appropriations bill as recommended by the committee \nprovides a total of $317,623,483,000 in budget authority for mandatory \nand discretionary programs for the Department of Defense. This amount \nis $1,923,633,000 below the President's request.\n  The recommended funding is below the President's request by nearly $2 \nbillion because the Senate has already acted to reallocated $500 \nmillion for military construction and $1.2 billion for nuclear energy \nprograms under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Water Subcommittee.\n  The total discretionary funding recommended in division A of this \nbill is $317,208,000,000. This is the same amount as the subcommittee's \n302B allocation, and the House level.\n  As such, my colleagues should be advised that any amendment that \nwould seek to add funding to the recommendation would need to be \naccompanied by an acceptable offset in budget authority.\n  This measure is fully consistent with the objectives of this \nadministration and the Defense authorization bill which passed the \nSenate in September and is now in conference. Our staffs have worked in \nclose coordination with the Armed Services Committee to minimize \ndifferences between the bills.\n  In addition, we believe we have accommodated those issues identified \nby the Senate which would enhance our Nation's Defense while allowing \nus to stay within the limits of the budget resolution.\n  Our first priority in this bill is to provide for the quality of life \nof our men and women in uniform.\n  In that vein, we have fully funded a 5-percent pay raise for every \nmilitary member and, as authorized, we recommend additional funding for \ntargeted pay raises for those grades and particular skills which are \nhard to fill.\n  We believe these increases will significantly aid our ability to \nrecruit, and perhaps more importantly, retain much needed military \npersonnel.\n  We have also provided $18.4 billion for health care costs. This is \n$6.3 billion more than appropriated in FY 2001 and nearly $500 million \nmore than requested by the President.\n  This funding will ensure that TRICARE costs are fully covered, that \nour military hospitals receive increased funding to better provide for \ntheir patients and, by providing funding for ``TRICARE for life'', we \nfulfill a commitment made to our retirees over 65. This will ensure \nthat those Americans who were willing to dedicate their lives to the \nmilitary will have quality health care in their older years.\n  This is most importantly an issue of fairness; it fulfills the \nguarantee DOD made to the military when they were on active duty.\n  We also believe it will signal to those willing to serve today that \nwe will keep our promises. In no small part we see this as another \nrecruiting and retention program.\n  In title II, the bill provides $106.5 billion for readiness and \nrelated programs. This is $9.6 billion more than appropriated for \nfiscal year 2001. The bill reallocates funding from the Secretary of \nDefense to the military services for the costs of overseas deployments \nin the Balkans in the same manner as the Pentagon does for the Middle \nEast deployments.\n  Through this adjustment and because of other fact of life changes in \nthe Balkans, the committee has identified $600\n\n[[Page S12501]]\n\nmillion in savings to reapply to other critical readiness and \ninvestment priorities.\n  For our investment in weapons and other equipment, the recommendation \nincludes $60.9 billion for procurement, nearly $500 million more than \nrequested by the President. The funding here will continue our efforts \nto recapitalize our forces, supporting the Army's transformation goals \nand purchasing much needed aircraft, missiles, and space platforms for \nthe Air Force.\n  For the Navy, the bill provides full funding for those programs that \nare on tract and ready to move forward. In some cases, delays in \ncontracting have allowed the subcommittee to recommend reallocating \nfunds for other critical requirements.\n  Included in that, the committee has recommended $560 million for \nprocurement to support our National Guard and Reserve forces.\n  In funding for future investment for research and development, the \nmeasure recommends $46 billion, a 10-percent increase over the amounts \nappropriated for fiscal year 2001.\n  The recommendation mirrors the Senate-passed authorization bill for \nballistic missile defense. A total of $7 billion is provided under \nmissile defense programs and an additional $1.3 billion is provided in \na separate appropriation for the President to allocate either for \nmissile defense or for counterterrorism.\n  This is a balanced bill that supports the priorities of the \nadministration and the Senate. In order to cut spending by nearly $2 \nbillion, some difficult decisions were required. The bill reduces \nfunding for several programs that have been delayed or are being \nreconsidered because of the Secretary's Strategic Review, the Nuclear \nPosture Review, and the Quadrennial Defense Review.\n  The bill also makes adjustments that are in line with the reforms \nchampioned by the administration.\n  No. 1, a concerted effort was made at reducing reporting requirements \nin the bill.\n  No. 2, the bill also reduces funding for consultants and other \nrelated support personnel as authorized by the Senate.\n  No. 3, as requested, the bill provides $100 million for DOD to make \nadditional progress in modernizing its financial management systems.\n  Finally, the bill places a cap on legislative liaison personnel which \nthe Secretary of Defense has indicated are excessive.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to address a couple of items that \nsome press reports have mischaracterized about our recommendations.\n  First, the committee has reduced funding for the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program by $46,000,000. Let me assure all of my colleagues \nthat I strongly support the intent of this program.\n  The $356 million that we include for the program will assist the \nformer Soviet Union countries to dismantle and safeguard their nuclear \nweapons. However, the Defense Department has had a history of being \nunable to use all of the funding that has been provided to it in a \ntimely fashion.\n  As a result, at this time, the Pentagon has more than $700 million \nthat it hasn't used yet. That is nearly 2 years worth of funds. In \naddition, under current law, the authorizers have limited the use of \nfunding for certain activities. Even if this language is changed in the \npending Defense conference, the Pentagon has not yet presented a plan \nfor how they will use these funds.\n  The committee has taken its action without prejudice. We are required \nto reduce funding in this bill by nearly $2 billion. We simply must \nmake this type of reduction where we know they can't efficiently \nobligate the funding no matter how much we support the overall \nobjectives of the program.\n  Second, the bill provides discretionary authority to the Defense \nDepartment to lease tankers to replace the aging KC-135 fleet. This is \na program that is strongly endorsed by the Air Force as the most cost \neffective way to replace our tankers.\n  Despite what has been reported, the language in the bill requires \nthat the lease can only be entered into if the Air Force can show that \nit will be 10 percent less expensive to lease the aircraft than to \npurchase them. In addition, it stipulates that the aircraft must be \nreturned to the manufacturer at the end of the lease period.\n  No business sector has suffered more from the events of September 11 \nthan has our commercial aircraft manufacturers. The tragic events of \nthat day have drastically reduced orders for commercial aircraft. We \nhave been informed that Boeing, for example, will have to lay off \napproximately 30,000 people as a direct consequence of the terrorist \nattack.\n  We have provided funding to support the airlines as a result of that \ntragedy. We are including funds elsewhere in this bill to help in the \nrecovery in New York and the Pentagon. The leasing authority which we \nhave included in division A allows us to help assist commercial airline \nmanufacturers while also solving a long-term problem for the Air Force.\n  I strongly endorse this initiative which was crafted by my good \nfriend, Senator Stevens, with the support of several other members, \nincluding Senators Cantwell, Murray, and Durbin. I believe it deserves \nthe unanimous support of the Senate.\n  Today is December 6. Nearly one quarter of the fiscal year has \npassed.\n  The Defense Department is operating under a continuing resolution \nwhich significantly limits its ability to efficiently manage its \nfunding--most particularly, procurement programs.\n  I don't need to remind any of my colleagues that we have men and \nwomen serving half way around the world defending us.\n  Less than 1 percent of Americans serve in today's military. These few \nare willing to sacrifice themselves for us. They are willing to stand \nin harm's way in our behalf. They deserve our support.\n  Nearly 3 months ago, our Nation was hit by a surprise attack \ndelivered from out of blue. Forty years ago tomorrow we suffered a \nsimilar attack.\n  In 1941, our Nation rose up together and we worked diligently to \ndefeat this threat. I have been gratified to see our Nation come \ntogether in the past few months in a similar fashion.\n  This is the bill, that allows us to act. This is the measure that we \nneed to show our military forces that we support them.\n  I know there are disagreements among some of us with specific funding \nlevels in the other divisions of this bill. But, we should not let us \nget bogged down in a partisan squabble over how we pay for the war on \nterrorism.\n  We have the Defense bill that is urgently needed to fight and win \nthis war and to demonstrate to the world our resolve.\n  For the good of the Nation, I urge all my colleagues to look to our \nobjective and to support this measure. Let us take the bill to \nconference where we can work out an agreement that can be endorsed by \nthe President.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to join \nSenator Inouye in presenting the fiscal year 2002 Defense \nAppropriations Act.\n  The chairman has just effectively described the bill before the \nSenate, and I will add only a few comments that I want to make to \nendorse the presentation that he has made.\n  This bill before the Senate is a good bill. Section A of the bill \nSenator Inouye and I have worked on for some time. Later today it is my \nintention to offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute. It is \namendment No. 2743, substitute for divisions B and C that concern the \nallocation of funds from the previous emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill that relate to the September 11 attacks on our \nNation.\n  For the defense portion, there I am referring specifically to section \nA of the bill before the Senate. I am especially pleased we succeeded \nin funding the 5-percent pay raise and the $9.5 billion increase in \nreadiness funds in the O section of this bill.\n  Of special importance to me are three initiatives in the bill that \nwill dramatically enhance our national security. First, the bill \nincludes $143 million to continue the multiyear procurement contract \nfor the C-17 airlifter. Our current deployment relies heavily on the C-\n17 fleet, and this initiative will continue the procurement of that \naircraft--now the backbone of our strategy for deployment. As I said, \nwe continue to rely on the C-17 fleet for\n\n[[Page S12502]]\n\nour deployment policies of the Department of Defense, and we need as \nmany of those as we can get.\n\n  Second, this bill fully accommodates the President's request of $8.3 \nbillion for missile defense programs, and it carries out the conditions \nset forth in the Defense authorization bill for the allocation of that \nmoney.\n  The successful test earlier this week of the ground-based midcourse \ninterceptor reflects the great progress made in this missile defense \nprogram by LTG Ron Kadish and the people in his command. I congratulate \nthem. We are now talking about the ground-based midcourse interceptor \nprogram which is a portion of the missile defense program. That is what \nis in the bill before the Senate.\n  Third, the bill includes a new provision that authorizes the \nSecretary of the Air Force to lease 100 new air refueling tankers. If \nexecuted by the Department--that is, if these leases are followed \nthrough by the Department--these leased aircraft would replace the 136 \nKC-135E aircraft which are currently in use as air refueling tankers. \nThey average in excess of 41 years of age. I notice the chairman said \n42. I am sure he has more updated information than I.\n  This initiative, as the chairman said, endorsed by the Secretary of \nthe Air Force, has been cleared by CBO as having no budgetary impact in \nfiscal year 2002.\n  Earlier this week I answered a question of the press and other \nMembers of the Senate about this provision and told them this bill did \nnot, at that time, specify the aircraft to be procured. Because of the \nclearance procedure of the CBO, we have now put in the bill a \ndesignation that these aircraft to be leased will be the Boeing 767s \nbecause there is adequate information upon which we can base the \nconclusion and really advance the argument that there will be a \ncommercial market for these aircraft at the end of the lease involved.\n  What I really want to tell the Senate is that this bill reflects \ncountless hours of collaboration by myself and Chairman Inouye and the \nmembers of the committee and our staff. Both my chief of staff, Steve \nCortese, and the chief of staff for Senator Inouye, Charlie Houy, have \nreally put in weekends and hours that cannot even be counted to be sure \nthat this bill before the Senate is what we intend it to be.\n  Our allocation in this bill was $2 billion less than the President's \namended request. The committee allocated additional funds for military \nconstruction and defense nuclear weapons programs. Those really are \ndefense, in my judgment. I have supported and advocated the allocations \nto those programs. But I recognize the pressure everyone is working \nunder to make certain we have an adequate allowance for defense.\n  I believe the priorities of Members of the Senate, as requested by \nthem to both Senator Inouye and myself, are reflected in this bill in a \nbalanced and fair fashion. I state to the Senate that if I were still \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Defense, there really are very few \nchanges I would recommend to the Senate in the bill. I recommend none \nnow because the differences are so minor that they really should not \naffect the consideration of the bill.\n  There is, however, a long day ahead of us. It is my hope we can \nstrike a compromise. For that purpose, I will offer the substitute and \nexplain it further after Senator Byrd has presented his statement \nconcerning the Senate amendments as reflected by the bill that has been \nreported from the full Committee on Appropriations and is before the \nSenate now.\n  I do appreciate every consideration that has been extended to me and \nmy staff by Chairman Inouye and his staff director, Charlie Houy, and \nthe chairman of the full committee and his staff.\n  I wish I could say I look forward to this debate. At present, I think \nwe are heading toward being in the position of being between a rock and \na hard place. I will try to search out a way to move one or the other \nor both.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, before I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, I would like to have the Record show how pleased the \nsubcommittee is with the initiative offered by Senator Stevens, the \nPresiding Officer, and Senator Cantwell, on the KC-135 leasing program. \nIt took much time and, I would say, much creativity, but I am happy \nthat these great Senators were able to resolve this matter. We find now \nthat a measure that should have been contentious is no longer \ncontentious. I once again thank Senator Stevens, Senator Murray, and \nSenator Cantwell.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 3338, the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  H.R. 3338 provides $317.206 billion in nonemergency discretionary \nbudget authority for defense activities and $13 million in nonemergency \nbudget authority for general purpose activities. Those amounts will \nresult in new outlays in 2002 of $213.063 billion. When outlays from \nprior-year budget authority are taken into account, nonemergency \ndiscretionary outlays for the Senate bill total $309.412 billion in \n2002.\n  In addition, the bill includes $35 billion in emergency-designated \nbudget authority. Of that total, $20 billion represents amounts \npreviously authorized by and designated as emergency spending under \nPublic Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \nRecovery from and Response to Attacks on the United States, and $15 \nbillion is for homeland defense. That budget authority will result in \nnew outlays in 2002 of $12.123 billion. In accordance with standard \nbudget practice, the budget committee will adjust the appropriations \ncommittee's allocation for emergency spending at the end of conference. \nBecause the funds for homeland security include amounts for nondefense \nactivities, the emergency designation violates section 205 of the \nbudget resolution for fiscal year 2001 (H. Rept. 106-577).\n  The Senate bill also violates section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974 because it exceeds the subcommittee's Section 302(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays. Similarly, because \nthe committee's allocation is tied to the current law cap on \ndiscretionary spending, H.R. 3338 also violates section 312(b) of the \nCongressional Budget Act. The bill includes language that raises the \ncap on discretionary category spending to $681.441 billion in budget \nauthority and $670.447 billion in outlays. However, because that \nlanguage is not yet law, the budget committee cannot increase the \nappropriations committee's allocation at this time, putting it in \nviolation of the two points of order.\n  In addition, by including language that increases the cap on \ndiscretionary spending and adjusts the balances on the pay-as-you-go \nscorecard for 2001 and 2002 to zero, H.R. 3338 also violates section \n306 of the Congressional Budget Act. Finally, the bill violates section \n311(a)(2)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act by exceeding the spending \naggregates assumed in the 2002 budget resolution for fiscal year 2002.\n  H.R. 3338 violates several budget act points of order; however, it is \na good bill that addresses the nation's defense needs, including the \ndefense of our homeland. The President and Congressional leaders from \nboth parties agreed in the wake of the September 11th attack that more \nmoney was needed to respond to the terrorists and to protect our \nhomeland. This bill follows that bipartisan agreement and includes \nlanguage that raises the cap on discretionary spending to the necessary \nlevel. I commend Chairman Byrd and subcommittee Chairman Inouye on \ntheir excellent work in bringing this important bill to the Senate \nfloor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committee \nscoring of H.R. 3338 be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12503]]\n\n\n\n        H.R. 3338, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  General\n                                  purpose   Defense  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority.............        13   317,206        282   317,501\n  Outlays......................        13   309,399        282   309,694\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.............  ........   181,953        282   182,235\n  Outlays......................  ........   181,616        282   181,898\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget Authority.............  ........   317,207        282   317,489\n  Outlays......................  ........   308,873        282   309,155\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.............  ........   319,130        282   319,412\n  Outlays......................  ........   310,942        282   311,224\n \n SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n              TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.............        13   135,253  .........   135,266\n  Outlays......................        13   127,783  .........   127,796\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget Authority.............        13        -1  .........        12\n  Outlays......................        13       526  .........       539\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.............        13    -1,924  .........    -1,911\n  Outlays......................        13    -1,543  .........    -1,530\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the Senate-\n  reported bill to the Senate 302(b) allocation. The subcommittee's\n  allocation reflects the current law cap on discretionary category\n  spending. The Senate-reported bill includes language increasing that\n  cap to $681.441 billion (consistent with the agreement reached between\n  President Bush and Congressional leaders). Because the increase in the\n  cap is not yet law, the committee cannot revise the committee's 302(a)\n  allocation at this time.\n \nNotes: Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted\n  for consistency with scorekeeping conventions. In addition to the\n  amounts shown above, the Senate bill also includes $20 billion in\n  budget authority and $8.25 billion in outlays to respond to the\n  September 11th attack and $15 billion in budget authority and $3.873\n  billion for homeland security. Such amounts are designated as\n  emergency. The budget committee increases the committee's 302(a)\n  allocation for emergencies when a bill is reported out of conference.\nPrepared by SBC Majority Staff, 12-6-01.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, friends, Senators, Americans, lend me your \nears. It was just 56 days ago on a day like this day, as clear as the \nnoon day Sun and a cloudless sky, that tragedy struck.\n  Until September 10 we thought of national defense in terms of the \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and marines that make up our military. We \nsought to provide them with the best training and equipment that money \ncould buy, and when duty calls, we expect them to leave behind their \nfamilies and loved ones to go into harm's way to protect our country \nand our citizens from aggression.\n  Our concept of national defense has now been radically altered as a \nresult of the September 11 terrorist attacks. It is not just our \nmilitary personnel in Afghanistan who are on the front lines, but all \nAmericans here at home are on the front lines. This zone of conflict \nextends to where we live, where we work, and where we play. Judging by \nthe horrendous loss of life in New York, our own cities are the \nbattlefield of the 21st century.\n  The President has said that ``we are fighting a two-front war . . . \nour enemy is fighting an army, not only overseas, but at home.'' Our \ndomestic army against terrorism is made up of those who work to enforce \nour laws, those who work to secure our borders, those who manage the \nPublic Health Service, and those who provide for the security of our \nNation's airports and nuclear facilities. Just as we provide for the \nfinest and most capable military, we must provide for the defense of \nour homeland because, as I say, here, too, is the front line.\n  On September 14, the Congress passed a $40 billion emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill in response to the September 11 \nattacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. There was absolute \nbipartisanship. There was no aisle between the parties then.\n  At the time, we thought we could split those funds between our \nmilitary needs abroad and those needed to rebuild New York City and the \nPentagon. However, since September 14, we have seen a biological attack \nunleashed on the east coast in the form of anthrax. The specter of \nsmall pox has reemerged for the first time in almost 30 years.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Alaska and I can remember very \nwell those schooldays when we were vaccinated for smallpox at school. I \nremember the little two-room schoolhouse there in that ancient coal \nmining camp of Algonquin in Mercer County, southern West Virginia, in \nthe heart of the coal fields. There it was that I received the needle.\n  We have seen National Guard troops patrolling the Golden Gate Bridge. \nWe have had threats made against our nuclear facilities. We have gained \nnew information that Osama bin Laden loyalists have progressed further \nthan originally thought in producing chemical and nuclear weapons, and \nthose stories, those headlines appeared in the Washington press. The \nAdministration has issued three vague warnings to the American people \nurging them to be on a heightened state of alert.\n  We have learned so much more about our potential vulnerabilities here \nat home since September 14. We now know that these vulnerabilities must \nbe addressed, and that additional security precautions must be taken.\n  Of the $40 billion emergency appropriations bill passed on September \n14, the President has committed $21 billion to our military and \nintelligence primarily for needs abroad. That leaves $19 billion for \nthe President to fulfill his promise to provide $20 billion to rebuild \nNew York City and the Pentagon and other areas which were the subject \nof the terrorist attacks. And the other area is homeland defense, of \nwhich he, himself, has identified $6 billion in needs. Clearly, within \nthe confines of that $40 billion package, we cannot do it all.\n  The reality is that budget deficits are on the horizon as far as the \nhuman eye and as far as our computers can see, and certainly as far as \nthe end of the President's second term, if he should choose to run, if \nthe electorate should choose to elect him, and if the Good Lord chooses \nto let him live.\n  Under the guise of budgetary discipline, the administration has \nchosen an arbitrary number--independent of whether or not that amount \ncan provide for our homeland defense needs--and the administration has \ndecided to oppose or to postpone until next year any spending above \nthat line regardless of the need or purpose.\n  Osama bin Laden does not care one whit, not one snap of the finger, \nabout our budget agreements. His loyalists are not concerned about \nwhether we have a supplemental appropriations bill in the spring. They \nare plotting attacks right now, this very minute. Twenty-four hours a \nday they plot. They plot when you are sleeping. They plot when I am \nsleeping. They will not wait until next year, and if we do not make \nthese small investments now to address our potential vulnerabilities, \nthen we risk substantially larger losses in the future--not just \nfinancial and human casualties but also the loss of the American \npeople's confidence in their Government, the American people's \nconfidence in their President, the American people's confidence in \ntheir Congress.\n  We cannot shortchange our homeland defense. We cannot postpone these \ninvestments. Our citizens have a right to know that the police, the \nfire and the hospital personnel in their communities have the \nequipment, training, and medicine to respond to a terrorist attack.\n  I have, with the help of my staff and with the help of the witnesses \nwho have appeared before the appropriations subcommittees, crafted a \npackage that addresses our most immediate vulnerabilities at home. This \npackage provides the President's full request for our military \noperations abroad. We do not cut one penny from defense, defense as \nunderstood in the usual sense. We do not cut one penny from the \nPresident's promise and our commitment to New York City. Not one penny \ndo we cut. And we provide for homeland defense. That is as much defense \nas is the defense of our military people who are overseas.\n  Americans have spilled blood in Afghanistan. Americans have spilled \nblood in Lower Manhattan, and within our own sight out of the windows \nAmericans have spilled blood at the Pentagon. Is there any difference \nin the spilling of American blood whether it is overseas or at home, \nwhen the cause of that spilling of American blood and that blood itself \nis on the hands of terrorists?\n\n  The major elements of my homeland defense package include \nbioterrorism prevention and response, which includes food safety.\n  Our current public health system is ill-funded, fragmented, and \nunprepared to respond adequately to the threats posed by bioterrorism. \nThe anthrax-laced letters sent through the mail afforded us just a \nglimpse of the terror, the fear, the concern, the apprehension, that \ncould result from a more serious biological attack involving smallpox \nor Ebola.\n  We know that rogue nations like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are \ndeveloping biological and chemical weapons. We know that bin Laden \nloyalists have conducted research on chemical and biological weapons at \n40 sites in Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S12504]]\n\n  The Administration has proposed $1.6 billion for bioterrorism \nprevention, just barely enough to increase our supply of smallpox \nvaccine and other necessary pharmaceuticals alone. To fit into the \nPresident's budget request, the Health and Human Services Department \neven cut back on its repeatedly stated goal of purchasing 300 million \nsmall pox vaccine doses, choosing to rely instead on diluted versions \nof older vaccine doses left over from the 1970s.\n  The Administration's chief public health expert, the director of the \nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, \nindicated that the Administration's proposal is ``too little, too \nlate.''\n  Moreover, Dr. Koplan estimates that it will take at least $1 billion \nto bring state and local public health agencies up to speed to be able \nto recognize and respond to an incident of bioterrorism. Yet, the \nAdministration has proposed a paltry $115 million to increase State and \nlocal health capacity. Our proposal includes over $1.3 billion for \nexpanding State and local health capacity, twelve times the President's \nrequest.\n  State and local health departments are considered the weakest link in \nthe Nation's defense against bioterrorism, and experts say they must \ntake a range of steps to improve readiness, including increasing their \nlaboratory capacity and hiring more epidemiologists to track disease.\n  The Secretary of HHS, Tommy Thompson, when he appeared before our \nappropriations subcommittee to speak about protecting the American \npeople from an outbreak of smallpox, said every State should have at \nleast one epidemiologist. Experts say they must take a range of steps \nto improve readiness, increasing their laboratory capacity and hiring \nmore epidemiologists to track disease. Who will be the first to respond \nto a biological attack, the State and local health officials down in \nBeckley, WV, the local law enforcement officers at Sophia, population \n1,182?\n  These are the people who will be first. The Feds may come within 6 \nhours, 8 hours, or 10 hours, but those who will respond first are those \nlaw enforcement and health officials, fire department people who are \nthere on the spot. They will be the first to die, and they will be the \nfirst to act to prevent others from dying.\n  Fewer than half of these health departments have access to the modern \nfax machines capable of expeditiously alerting hospitals of a bioterror \nthreat. Our local health care providers are more likely to receive \ncritical health advisories from CNN than they are from other health \ncare officials.\n  My homeland security package would provide an additional $3.9 billion \nto not only expand the development of the Federal pharmaceutical \nstockpile and our supply of the smallpox vaccine, but also to expand \nstate and local health care capacity. In contrast to the \nadministration's funding proposal, this package prioritizes funding to \n``first responders'' at the state and local level. The bulk of the \nfunding is directed toward improving our public health departments, \nbeefing up local lab capacity, and expanding the Health Alert Network.\n  Also, included in my homeland security package is $575 million that \nwould be directed to the Food and Drug Administration, and the \nDepartment of Agriculture, to help prevent and respond to the malicious \nintroduction of a highly contagious disease into our food supply. Aside \nfrom the obvious health threat, agro-terrorism would severely disrupt \nthe economy and public confidence in the food supply.\n  We have to be conscious of the possibility that terrorists will act \nagainst our crops, against the Nation's livestock and threaten the \nlives of people through the food they eat.\n  We need only look to the recent outbreak of mad cow disease in Japan \nto see the chaos and economic devastation that would follow an agro-\nterrorist attack. I doubt many Americans would find comfort in the fact \nthat the FDA only has the resources to inspect 0.7 percent of all \nimported food. Not 1 percent, only 0.7 of 1 percent. The FDA only has \nthe resources to inspect 0.7 percent of all imported food.\n  When it comes to the health and safety of the American people, we \ncannot afford to cut corners. We cannot afford to gamble. We cannot \nafford to tempt fate. We must not deal with bioterrorism on the cheap.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I add the observation, we cannot afford to wait, \neither. Every one of the items--and I commend the Senator for his \nextraordinary leadership and initiative in this regard--every one of \nthe items covered by his homeland defense program are matters we should \naddress now, today, this week, this month.\n  They cry out for a commitment of resources to address airport \nsecurity, port security, border security, the postal system, the \nassistance to State and local antiterrorism law enforcement, the \nfirefighters, bioterrorism prevention, and protecting the nuclear \npowerplants. And in every one of these items, there is not a one of \nthem we can look at and say, let's leave that; we will do that later; \nthere is not a pressing need.\n  There is a pressing need now for every one of these items. I commend \nthe Senator for moving forward with this initiative. Governor Ridge \nhimself has said he will come in next year and ask for significant \nresources. But he needs them now. My perception is that Governor Ridge \nis being undercut in his effort to deal with homeland security by the \nfact that he is not picking up the additional resources he needs in \norder to go out into these communities--State and local governments, \nthe health community, the security community--and say, we are in a \nposition now to help move your program, and move it ahead. Much of this \nrequires a response from others. If we don't provide the resources here \nwith which to do it, when is it going to happen? We are going to delay \nit, 60, 90, 120 days? Who knows how long.\n  This is an opportunity, as the Senator has seen, to move now to \naddress these pressing concerns. If we want to move the economy back \nup, a way to do it is to provide to the American people a sense of \nsecurity and functioning within their own homeland, which the Senator \nhas done, and about which he has spoken quite eloquently.\n  I register my very strong support for this initiative and thank the \nSenator for, once again, moving forward to provide very important \nleadership in this critical matter facing our Nation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Scriptures say that a word fitly spoken \nis like apples of gold and pictures of silver. The words of the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland are fitly spoken.\n  The time is now. The danger is here. It is now.\n  Now, several subcommittees under the Appropriations Committee have \nhad hearings, and I have been able to attend some of those hearings. We \nhave heard eloquent witnesses appear before those subcommittees and \ntestify to the need of appropriations now, aside from the fact that it \nis at the State and local levels where the need exists now.\n  I saw in the paper, I believe in the last week, a headline that the \nState of Virginia was suffering a $1 billion shortfall in State \nrevenue. The State of Virginia is not alone in that respect. Most \nStates in this country are suffering shortfalls in their budgets. They \nneed help. They need money now. We cannot wait, as the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland has said.\n  In putting this package together, we have tried to consider those \nitems which are purely for homeland defense.\n  On the question of the need of States and cities for Federal aid, 39 \nStates--get this, 39 States--today, right now, nearly 4 out of 5 \nStates, are in a recession or near a recession. Since March, the number \nof States in recession has nearly doubled to 20 States from 11 States \nwith the terrorist attacks of September 11 helping to push some over \nthe brink.\n  I will refer to this statement of facts again later.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland. He is right on \npoint.\n  My homeland security package also contains $1 billion for Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement. The attacks of September 11 \ndramatically, and tragically demonstrated that our country's law \nenforcement agencies need greater support to counter the terrorist \nviolence that has reached our shores.\n  They need this support and, as we have already indicated, the States \ncannot provide it. The money is not there.\n\n[[Page S12505]]\n\n They are already running into deficit, so they are looking to the \nFederal Government to help.\n  Of the $1 billion included in this package, $225 million would be \nused to improve communication and coordination between the FBI and the \n43 Federal agencies involved in counterterrorism activities here at \nhome.\n  Former drug czar Barry McCaffrey testified before the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in October that the FBI's computers are \nwoefully inadequate--those were his words, the FBI's computers are \n``woefully inadequate''--and that the computers in the homes of most \nAmericans are more advanced than those used by FBI agents in the field. \nThink of that.\n  He also stated that a current FBI's computer upgrades effort is \nhampered by budgetary constraints. This $225 million that is included \nin this red section of the pie chart would jump-start those upgrades \nand move the Bureau's technology into the 21st century.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, on the \nfloor. He is listening raptly. He has indicated that he wishes to make \na point. I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator, our leader from West Virginia, for \nthe package he has put together. As somebody who chairs a subcommittee \nthat oversees the FBI, I would like to say to the Senator from West \nVirginia that when the FBI came and testified before us, and the \nSenator from West Virginia asked them what their No. 1 hinderance was \nin fighting the war on terrorism, they said it was lack of resources. \nTheir computers --I would just like to ask the Senator if he is \nfamiliar with this--in one part of the FBI cannot talk to the computers \nin the other part of the FBI, let alone talk to the computers of the \nCIA, the NSA, the INS, the ATF, and all of the other agencies.\n  I would like, before asking the question, to compliment the Senator. \nThis is desperately needed. We are at war on our homefront as much as \nwe are at war in Afghanistan. I think it was Vice President Cheney who \nsaid we will lose more people on the homefront than on the battlefront. \nSo I cannot see why we would not do this when our own people throughout \nAmerica are at risk.\n  But I would like to ask the Senator if he has heard of this almost \nprimitive computer structure at the FBI--that the computers are not \nable to talk to one another within the agency, let alone to others? And \nwould the package deal with that problem in every way that the FBI \nmight need?\n  Mr. BYRD. There is $225 million in this package to jump-start the \neffort to upgrade those computers. They are the instruments of \ncommunication between and among the FBI and the other agencies. It is a \ndire need, and it should be met now, not next spring.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If we waited until next spring, could it be that the \npotential of our FBI to catch the terrorists or prevent the next--God \nforbid--terrorist incident from occurring in America would be greatly \ndowngraded and it would increase the chances that--again, God forbid--\nsome other incident might occur?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct. Why wait? Why toy with ``wait''? \nWhy gamble? Why not act now?\n  The Senator knows we have wrapped a ribbon around this homeland \ndefense package which says, in essence: Mr. President, you may use this \nor you may not use it. So we have an emergency designation. It is an \nemergency, Mr. President, and you have the key. You have the key. So it \nis your call, but here are the tools. If you need them, you won't have \nto wait until next spring.\n  The thing about waiting until next spring is we are really waiting \nuntil next summer or next autumn because the supplemental request \ndoesn't come up on one day and end up being signed by the President on \nthe next day; there have to be hearings and so on.\n  We have had the hearings now that indicated a dire need for these \nemergency items. So we are putting this ribbon, this blue ribbon that \nsays emergency, E-M-E-R-G-E-N-C-Y, on it. Why? Of what are we afraid? \nWhy don't we want the President to have this so he can carry out his \ncommitment to protect the American people from the attacks of \nterrorism? He made that promise.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  I also included $150 million in this package for cyber security. It \nis alarming to know that the next terrorist attack could cripple our \nNation's economy simply by a few strokes of the keyboard. Cyber-attacks \nhave cost our economy $12 billion this year alone. Just imagine the \nfrightening consequences if a cyber-terrorist were to take control of \none of our financial institutions, or to take control of one of our \npower grids, or to take control of our air traffic control system. That \ncan happen.\n  Of the $1 billion included for antiterrorism law enforcement, one-\nhalf, or $500 million, would be directed to State and local law \nenforcement agencies. This is where the rubber meets the road in law \nenforcement.\n  State and local police departments are stretched thin enough, due to \nthe need for an increased security presence throughout our cities and \nStates. Twelve-hour days and overtime pay for State and local law \nenforcement personnel have become the norm since September 11. Right \nhere in this city, in the capital city here around this Capitol \nBuilding, this building which is the most splendid edifice in the \nworld, this has happened. It is taking place here: 12-hour days, \novertime pay for State and local law enforcement personnel. The Office \nof Homeland Security has asked State police to increase their patrols \nof State nuclear facilities, without any Federal compensation or \ntimetable for how long state assistance will be needed. Meanwhile, the \nactivation of 57,000 National Guard and Reservists to support the Armed \nServices during our operations in Afghanistan and our counter-terrorism \nactivities here at home has drained the manpower of many State and \nlocal police departments.\n\n  According to the National Governors' Association, State police \npatrols of our nuclear facilities will cost States an extra $58 million \nthis year. It will cost another $46 million to secure our dams and \nbridges, $28 million to protect gas pipelines and power stations, and \n$75 million to assist Federal authorities with patrolling our borders.\n  Who makes up the National Guard? If I am wrong, I would like someone \nto point it out to me. Do doctors serve in the National Guard? Do \npolicemen? Do law enforcement personnel? Do paramedics at the homefront \nand at the local level serve in the National Guard? Then why should we \ntake those men and women away from the local level where they are most \nneeded and where they will be the first to answer the call and send \nthem up there to the northern border to patrol the border? What sense \ndoes that make? We need to keep them at home.\n  According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Los Angeles has spent \nmore than $11 million so far due to increased security costs and lost \nrevenue related to the September 11 terrorist attacks. The city's \npolice and fire department deficits have doubled.\n  In Boston, Mayor Thomas Menino must now pay $20,000 in additional \nsecurity costs every time a tanker enters his port carrying liquefied \nnatural gas, and 42 tankers are on the way. Police overtime expenses \nalone in Boston so far total about $700,000.\n  Denver Mayor Wellington Webb is facing a long list of emergency \nneeds, including biohazard-decontamination units, protective suits, \nbigger stores of antibiotics and drugs, special cameras, an anthrax \ndetector, and a preparedness guide for every household that will cost \nin total $610,000.\n  In Baltimore, Mayor Martin O'Malley spent $2 million in overtime for \npolice and fire departments in the first three days following Sept. 11. \nBy year's end the added security costs are expected to hit $14 million.\n  Security costs in Dallas have passed $2 million and could reach $6 \nmillion by the end of the year.\n  At a time when our State and local governments are cutting budgets \ndue to the recession, our State and local law enforcement need our \nsupport, and they need it now.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for \na moment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the distinguished \nSenator.\n\n[[Page S12506]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, very much.\n  As a Senator from Michigan, I wanted to rise to agree totally with \nwhat Senator Byrd is saying today about the pressure on our northern \nborders and our law enforcement officials who are now donating overtime \non the borders. In Michigan, we have four different border crossings. \nWe have the busiest bridge in the country through Detroit. We are \nstretching our local law enforcement to the limit, and we are using our \nNational Guard as well. But we certainly have tremendous pressures on \nus.\n  I wanted to congratulate the Senator from West Virginia for what he \nis proposing.\n  I also wanted to quote for the Record part of an article that was in \nthe Detroit Free Press, entitled ``State's Health Care System Unready \nfor Major Bio-Terror.''\n  It says:\n\n       The call came late the evening of Oct. 25 to the top health \n     officer for two Upper Peninsula counties.\n       Dr. John Petrawsky was told that a woman who had exhibited \n     only mild cold symptoms the previous day had died. Her \n     relatives said she had received a stranger letter with powder \n     in it the week before.\n       Was this anthrax?\n       A pathologist at Marquette General Hospital refused to do \n     an autopsy, fearing his facility couldn't contain lethal \n     bacteria. No one at the state Department of Community Health \n     in Lansing knew where the nearest properly ventilated autopsy \n     room might be, Petrasky said.\n       Finally, a pathologist tracked down by the U.S. Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention advised doing a limited \n     autopsy. The Marquette doctor agreed, and 19 hours later, \n     Petrasky had his answer: It wasn't anthrax. The woman had \n     died of something completely unrelated, and the crisis was \n     averted.\n       Or was it?\n       In the weeks since Sept. 11, many Michigan hospitals and \n     public health agencies are realizing how ill-prepared they \n     are for biological or chemical warfare. Many hospitals lack \n     proper decontamination and laboratory facilities. Public \n     health departments are strapped by low staffing levels and \n     inadequate communication between the departments and the \n     state. Doctors are learning they may not know how to spot \n     rarely diagnosed diseases like anthrax.\n       After years of hospitals and public health departments \n     being pushed to run lean, some say what's left is a system \n     that can be overburdened by a bad flu season.\n       ``We don't have enough beds. We don't have enough nurses.''\n\n  This is a very serious situation.\n  I cannot imagine a greater urgency.\n  I wanted to thank the Senator for his leadership on this issue.\n  I cannot imagine why we would not be coming together 100 Members \nstrong in this Senate. We understand more than anyone else, given what \nhas happened in our own complex with anthrax and the difficulties and \nchallenges of finding out how to respond to it. We can only imagine how \nsmall communities in northern Michigan are struggling when they believe \nthey may have, in fact, encountered something related to bioterrorism.\n  I congratulate the Senator from West Virginia. There is a tremendous \nsense of urgency in my State of Michigan and around the country. People \nassume we are acting. We are acting together in the defense of our \ncountry overseas. It is now time to act in defense of our homeland.\n  That is what the Senator from West Virginia is proposing, and I am \nhopeful that our Senate colleagues will join in supporting the plan \nthat he has put forward, and which is so needed for all of our \nfamilies.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished and able \nSenator from Michigan for her cogent, very persuasive and forceful \nremarks, and for the observations she has made with respect to the \nneeds of those at the local level who bear a responsibility to detect \nand to respond in the first instance to acts of terrorism on the part \nof those who have said to us: We will kill Americans.\n  As to the FEMA firefighters program, many people are just now \nbeginning to appreciate the critical role played by our Nation's \nfirefighters. We have taken these heroes for granted and, tragically, \nthey have been denied the funding resources necessary to enable them to \ndo their job as safely and effectively as possible. Their job is to \nprotect people--men, women, old people, children. That is the job of \nthese firefighters.\n  Last year, Congress took action to begin to address this provision by \ncreating a new Federal program to provide direct assistance to fire \ndepartments.\n  Administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the \nAssistance to Firefighters Grant Program received an initial \nappropriation of $100 million, which was quickly depleted by tremendous \ndemand. The agency received more than 31,000 applications totaling \nnearly $3 billion in requested funds--almost 30 times the amount \nappropriated.\n  This package includes $300 million in grants to State and local \ncommunities to expand and improve firefighting programs through FEMA \nfirefighting grants. Over 50 percent of that funding goes to volunteer \nfire departments in rural communities.\n  Some rural communities in this country are using fire wagons, \nfirefighting machines, and fire trucks that are 20, 30, or 40 years \nold. In the countryside, the volunteer fire department is the first and \nonly entity available to deal with a crisis.\n  Now, we have heard much about the letters that have come to the \nSenate leader, Senator Daschle, and to the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy, and to some other Americans. So today the American people are \nvictims of terrorism by mail, delivered to your home, brought to your \nstreet address. We will deliver it, packaged, ready to kill.\n  This is not something that might happen sometime in the future; it is \nhappening now. I do not like for my wife to go to the mailbox. Who \nknows. There could be an envelope in that mailbox that could have some \ndeadly pathogen enclosed. It could be your wife. It could be your \ndaughter, your father, your husband. This is real.\n  How do we know? I know. My staff has not been in their offices since \nOctober 15. That is how I know. We are located in the southeast corner \nof the Hart Building. How many letters have I received since October 15 \nfrom my constituents, who send me here to vote to protect them and to \nprotect their interests? How many letters have I received? Twelve. We \nreceived 12 yesterday, 12 letters. It is real.\n  And we seek to protect ourselves. We have fumigated the offices. We \nhave taken action to decontaminate the offices so that our people can \nmove back into those offices. Action has been taken to clear the \nstreets nearby while these things have been going on to decontaminate \nour offices.\n  How about the people on Main Street in Sophia, are they being \nprotected? Oh, it is easy to say to our people: Go about your business. \nEverything is OK. Get out there and go to the stores, go to the movies, \ngo to the restaurants, buy, buy, buy. It is easy to say that. It is \neasy for me to say: Come to West Virginia. We want to build up our \ntourism in West Virginia. Come to see West Virginia. Come to see \nWashington. I can say that, can't I?\n\n  Why? I have much in the way of protection here, and so does every \nother Senator. The President pro tempore has security--takes him home \nwith him at night, brings him to the office in the morning, stays in \nthe office daily, stands outside the office, ready to protect the \nPresident pro tempore against all comers.\n  The President goes in Air Force One, the Vice President goes in Air \nForce Two, other people high in the Government have protection.\n  Out here we have concrete barriers. You cannot get into this Capitol \nwithout being carefully scrutinized and having your pocketbooks opened \nand your packages carefully inspected. We are protected. We live in \nthis little, tiny bit of the world.\n  The worm crawled upon the clod, and the worm said: Aha, I see the \nworld.\n  The squirrel climbed the tallest pine in the southern hills, and he \nlooked about him and he said: Aho, I see the world.\n  The eagle--the national emblem of our country, the eagle--flew high \nabove the Earth into the blue heavens and said: Ho-ho, I see the world.\n  So we see the world in our own little corner here. I feel safe--\nfairly safe--because of all these protections here. But we do not see \nthe world as that miner or that farmer, that office worker, that \nprofessional, that lawyer, that minister, the housewives, the \nschoolteachers out in the rural areas of the country or who are out in \nthe greater urban cities.\n  We do not see things as they see them. They do not have Secret \nService\n\n[[Page S12507]]\n\nto protect them where they go. They do not have security personnel to \nprotect them, as I have. They do not have the concrete barriers out \nthere. They do not have the physician just 2 minutes away from my \noffice. They live in a different world.\n  Why can't we see it through their eyes? Why can't we take off the \ngreen eyeshades and see the world as our people see it--the people out \nthere who are subject to these terrorists, who run these risks every \nday, those who come into Penn Station in New York. Seven hundred fifty \ntrains every day come into that station--500,000 persons: Commuters, \ntourists, people on their way to work--500,000 every day. Can they see \nthe world through our eyes?\n  They come in the tunnels, tunnels that were built before World War I, \ntunnels that are inadequately lighted, inadequately protected, and \nwithout adequate means of access--ingress and egress--without adequate \nescape routes, without adequate ventilation. Those are the tunnels.\n  Those people face these potential terrorist acts every day, going to \nwork, coming from work, wanting to do no more than just earn an honest \nliving, earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow. They need \nprotection. Who are we to deny it to them? Fie on us. We know the need \nis there. And we know it is our responsibility to provide it. And we \nare doing it. We are doing it in the package here that has a little \nblue ribbon around it that says: Mr. President, you can spend this. It \nis here. You do not have to spend it, but here it is--right now, \ntonight --if you need it to protect the people.\n  That first phrase in the preamble to the Constitution of the United \nStates says: ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a \nmore perfect Union. . . .'' That is not talking about an aisle that \nseparates one party from the other. That is not talking about in order \nto form more perfect political parties --``a more perfect Union.'' And \nnow is the time when we should do our part to form that ``more perfect \nUnion'' right here in this Senate and join together and vote together \nto support this eminently sensible package.\n  The U.S. Postal Service is a $70 billion organization, and it is part \nof a $900 billion industry. It has seen mail volume drop by 7 percent \nsince September 11 and lost between $200 million and $300 million in \nrevenue. The Postal Service reported a $1.7 billion loss in fiscal year \n2001--on top of $200 million in losses last year.\n  The Postal Service has asked for $3 billion to cover the cost of \nequipment to safeguard the mail. In response, the administration has \nprovided $175 million so that the Postal Service can buy gloves and \nmasks for now and has promised more money later. It is almost \nlaughable, if it were not so serious.\n  That is not enough money for the Postal Service to deal with this \ncrisis that is happening right now. Here it is. The words read ``postal \nsecurity, $875 million.''\n  This package provides an additional $875 million to begin to make the \nsecurity changes necessary to keep the mail moving and to allow the \nPostal Service to respond immediately to this and future terrorist \nattacks.\n  How little did I imagine, when I came to this great institution, the \nlegislative branch, 50 years ago next year, how little did I realize \nthat there would come a day when our mail would have to be screened, \nwhen I, as an elected representative of the people of West Virginia, \nwould see my staff forced to evacuate the U.S. Senate office building \nin which they were located? How little did I foresee that the time \nwould come when, over this long period of time since September 11, only \n12 letters would reach my office from my constituents, and only \nyesterday did the 12 letters come. I never dreamed of such a thing, \nnever dreamed of it.\n  Yes, I was there in the House of Representatives when the Puerto \nRicans, who were in the galleries, shot Members of the House who ran \nfor the doors, who fell behind the desks, and who fell in the center of \nthe floor of the House of Representatives, wounded. Not until then did \nthey require that Members have cards that they could present to the \ngalleries. I sat there tongue-tied as I watched. I thought it was a \ngroup of demonstrators using firecrackers or some such until I saw \nMembers fall.\n  Little did I know at that time that the day would come when this \ndeadly anthrax would be delivered right to our building, right to our \ndoors, the office doors, right to the desks of the workers. I never \nthought about that. But we know it now.\n  Our border security is dangerously underfunded. It leaks like a \nsieve. Right now, today, the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nconducts some 500 million inspections at our ports of entry every year. \nYet there are only 4,775 INS inspectors to process these hundreds of \nmillions of visitors. That is one inspector--just one--for roughly \nevery 100,000 foreign nationals who cross the Nation's borders.\n  There are only 2,000 INS investigators and intelligence agents to \ntrack aliens who have entered this country illegally, overstayed their \nvisas, or otherwise violated the terms of their status as visitors in \nthe United States. That is one--just one --investigator for every 4,000 \nillegal aliens.\n  The U.S. Customs Service currently has the resources to inspect only \nabout one-third of the truck cargo crossing the southern border. And of \nthe 400 ships that dock in the 361 ports of this country, only about 2 \npercent of the cargo is inspected.\n  On our northern border with Canada, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service currently has 498 inspectors at ports of entry \nand 334 Border Patrol agents assigned to the northern border. That is a \n4,000-mile-long border. So that equates to about one INS inspector for \nevery 8 miles and one patrol agent for every 12 miles of the 4,000-\nmile-long northern border.\n\n  Of the 113 northern border ports of entry, there are 62--more than \nhalf--62 small ports that do not operate on a 24-hour basis. Just \nimagine pulling up to one of those 62 ports of entry along the northern \nborder where we don't have agents 24 hours at a time. There you will \nsee a sign that says ``stay out.'' There you will see a yellow cone--\nnot a person, not an INS agent, not a Customs agent but a yellow cone. \nIt is open some hours of the day when there is nobody there during \ncertain times of the day.\n  This week the Attorney General announced an emergency program to \nplace National Guard troops on the northern border. A Justice \nDepartment official stated that ``it is a great vulnerability that \nneeds to be dealt with immediately.''\n  This package reads, ``border security, $591 million,'' for additional \nBorder Patrol agents and screening facilities primarily on the northern \nborder. We must provide the funds and we must do so now.\n  I spoke a moment ago about our seaports, our lack of adequate port \nsecurity. Our seaports are perhaps the weakest link in our national \nsecurity. Yet they are just as important to our border security as are \nour land borders with Canada and Mexico. And yet they remain \ndangerously exposed. Ports are international boundaries through which \n95 percent of U.S. international trade arrives.\n  Last year, we imported 5.5 million trailer truck loads of cargo. Yet \nthe U.S. Customs Service has the resources to inspect only 2 percent of \nthe cargo that enters this country by sea.\n  As we were preparing this package in my office, Senator Hollings \nraised the warning sign: The need for money to be used for security of \nour ports.\n  With only 2 percent of the cargo that enters the country by sea being \ninspected, that means a terrorist would have a 98-percent chance of \nsneaking illegal and dangerous materials into this country. So our \nchances are 2 out of 100. The terrorists' chances are 98. So it is 98 \nto 2 percent.\n  The average shipping container measures 8 feet by 48 feet and can \nhold 60,000 pounds. That is just the average. A bulk ship or tanker \ntransporting cargo can hold hundreds of times the amount of explosives \nor other dangerous materials that could ever be smuggled on an airplane \nor a truck crossing a land border. While agents at the U.S.-Mexican \nborder are tearing the seats out of a car to search for drugs, a crane \njust up the coast a little ways in Los Angeles can lift thousands of \ntruck-size cargo containers on to the dock with no inspection at all.\n\n[[Page S12508]]\n\n  I remind my distinguished colleagues that Osama bin Laden has vast \nshipping interests which he used to transport and sneak into Kenya and \nTanzania the explosives used in the U.S. Embassy bombings.\n  Last month, a suspected member of the al-Qaida terrorist network was \narrested in Italy after he tried to stow away in a shipping container \nheading to Toronto. The container was furnished with a bed, a toilet, \nand its own power source--how about that, its own power source--to \noperate the heater and to recharge the batteries. That terrorist was \nready, he was prepared. According to the Toronto Sun, the man also had \na global satellite telephone, a regular cell phone, a laptop computer, \ncameras, identity documents, an airline mechanics certificate, and \nairport security passes for airports in Canada, Thailand, and Egypt. He \nhad thought of everything. This incident only expands what type of \ncargo we must be looking for at our Nation's ports.\n\n  The danger is here, and it is now, and it is not waiting until next \nyear's supplemental to cross the desk of the President along about the \nmiddle of July or August.\n  Nuclear powerplants: In just the past few days, I can recall seeing \nheadlines in the Washington press about the dangers to our nuclear \nplants in this country.\n  I have on the chart a map of the United States showing where the \nnuclear power reactors are, in the red cone, and where the nonpower \nreactors are. They are the reactors that are used for educational and \nresearch purposes. They do not produce power. The weapons complexes are \nshown by the green dots. The nuclear reactors are shown by the red \ncones. The nonpower reactors are shown by the blue squares.\n  There are 19 States in this country that have no nuclear plants, that \nhave no power-producing reactors. There it is.\n  Mr. President, nearly every facet of daily life that was America \nprior to September 11 must now be regarded in a new light. We have to \nclimb upward from the worm's clod, upward from the squirrel's tree. We \nhave to go above the eagle's flights to see the world as it is and as \nthe people out there who sent us here see the world, not through green \neyeshades. But they see it every day.\n  Nearly every facet of daily life must now be regarded in a new and \ndifferent light. The face of our enemy has become increasingly clear in \nrecent weeks. He is an enemy who will live among us. He is an enemy who \nwill enjoy our generosity and the blessings of our freedoms. Then he \nwill callously turn all of these against us.\n  This is an enemy with no fear of death. None. He will count it an \nhonor to die, to kill Americans and to die in the act. He will be \nimmediately entered into paradise. They have no fear and apparently \nlittle regard for life. This is the enemy of our nuclear nightmares.\n  According to the Washington Post of December 4, U.S. intelligence has \ncompiled credible information that Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida \nterrorist network have taken several disconcerting steps toward \ndeveloping radiological weapons. The Post reported that bin Laden and \nhis loyalists ``may have made greater strides than previously thought \ntoward obtaining plans or materials to make a crude radiological weapon \nthat would use conventional explosives to spread radioactivity over a \nwide area, according to U.S. and foreign sources.''\n  There you have it. Now we are being warned. In fact, the Post relayed \na discomforting description of a meeting within the last year in which \n``bin Laden was present when one of his associates produced a canister \nthat allegedly contained radioactive material. The associate waved the \ncanister in the air''--as one would wave an aerosol air spray. Ha, here \nit is; I have it; eureka--``The associate waved the canister in the air \nas proof of al-Qaida's progress and seriousness in trying to build a \nnuclear device.''\n  Most young Americans have never known the fears of nuclear war that \nonce haunted their parents and grandparents. They have never had to \nhunch under their school desks in nuclear drills or stock the family \nfallout shelter with jugs of water or cans of food in preparation for \nattack. We of our generation have seen these things. And while, to \ndate, we have seen no evidence that bin Laden has the capability to \ndeliver a nuclear warhead, he has made clear his intention to acquire \nsuch technology, and it is increasingly evident that he may well \npossess and be prepared to use a crude version known as a ``dirty'' \nbomb.\n\n  Clearly, he is well positioned to possess such a weapon and the \nmakings of such a device are pitifully easy to acquire.\n  The key ingredient is radiological material, which exists in \nabundance in Russia, just next door to Afghanistan, and right here in \nour own country at nuclear power plants and research facilities. While \nwe would like to believe that such material is closely guarded, the \nUnited Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed 376 \ncases of illicit sales of stolen radioactive materials since 1993. That \nwas in USA Today, November 3, 2001.\n  Although a dirty bomb does not have the kind of massive explosion \nthat destroys broad areas, the detonation of such a weapon would have \ndevastating consequences. Some experts have estimated that a single \nsuch bomb could cause 100,000 casualties within a 3-mile radius in an \nurban area, and render it uninhabitable for years, if not decades.\n  If we Senators think we have been terribly put out by the evacuation \nof our staffs from the southeast corner of the Hart Building--and my \nstaff falls into that category--if we think that is bad, let the \nterrorists find some way--remember, bin Laden does not count his life \nas anything. He will gladly consider it an honor to lay down his life, \nnot for his friend, as the Scriptures say, but to kill Americans. He \nwould count it an honor.\n  Remember, they have shown they can deliver catastrophe, disaster. \nThey can guide a plane into each of two world towers. They can demolish \nthem. They can kill thousands of people. We need not ponder as to \nwhether or not they could find a way to deliver this dirty bomb which, \nif exploded on The Mall in Washington, would render the buildings \naround The Mall uninhabitable. And if the wind were coming our way, it \nwould do the same with the Capitol, and the people at the White House \nwould not be at the White House any longer. They would have to go to \n``undisclosed locations.'' For a month? For a year? For a decade? \nPicture that. What about the fear that would spread throughout the \ncountry?\n  It was in 1991--10 years ago recognizing the potential for the vast \nnumber of Russian nuclear weapons to fall into the wrong hands, that \nthe Congress created the Nunn-Lugar Program to eliminate Russian \nnuclear weapons in a safe and secure manner. The budget for this \nprogram has been cut back for each of the last 3 years, but not because \nRussian nuclear weapons are now secure. In fact, in January 2001, a \npanel headed by former Senator Howard Baker and former White House \nCounsel Lloyd Cutler found that the threat of terrorists getting their \nhands on Russian nuclear weapons is the most urgent unmet national \nsecurity threat to the United States today. Clearly that threat \nremains. My homeland defense package provides $286 million for nuclear \nnonproliferation programs that would help to get at these unabated \nsources of nuclear material abroad.\n  Moreover, my package contains $215 million to help secure nuclear \nfacilities on our own shores, and to peacefully engage these 60,000 \nnuclear specialists in Russia not employed now that the Soviet Union \nhas broken up.\n  It has taken decades of public relations and education to begin to \nease the discomfort once prevalent among communities asked to house \nnuclear energy facilities. Even now, though the Nation boasts 104 \nnuclear power reactors, many Americans are unsettled at the thought of \nhaving such a nuclear neighbor.\n  Today, through long years of safe operations, nuclear power is a \nsignificant player in the international power generation game, and it \nis an important part of America's overall energy mix.\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question now or sometime \nlater in his presentation, whatever would be agreeable? There are some \nquestions in particular on Nunn-Lugar I am interested in addressing to \nthe Senator as it applies to the whole issue of bioterrorism. But I am \nglad to wait, if he desires, to inquire of him after he has some \nadditional time for his presentation.\n\n[[Page S12509]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. If I may continue for another minute or two, I will be \nhappy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  To keep it that way, nuclear power companies and the NRC recognize \nthe need to reassure the public that their plants are secure--not only \nsecure in the sense of the pre-September 11 world, but also impervious \nin the post-September 11 world. That may be one tough job.\n  Nuclear plants, though built to tough standards, were not designed to \nwithstand the impact of a commercial jetliner. But what is really \ndisturbing may be that, even though the plants have been designed with \na goal of stopping an assault on land--something along the lines of \nwell-armed intruders in heavy trucks or SUVs storming the plant--their \ntested security performance is surprisingly poor.\n  In fact, according to another recent article in The Washington Post \nthough the plants are always warned in advance about the NRC's tests, \nwhich involve mock assaults by actor-intruders, 47 percent have \nrevealed ``significant weaknesses'' in their security forces--\nsignificant being something in the realm of an American Chernobyl.\n  There are, however, other less well-publicized security problems at \nour nuclear facilities that need attention now.\n  Questions about just who is employed in our nuclear program in this \ncountry are begging to be addressed. The Los Alamos Laboratory scandal \nprovided a mere glimpse of the security challenges confronting a field \nwhose payrolls are thick with foreign-born employees, and a nation that \nhas long provided educations to foreign students seeking to build \ncareers in such fields as nuclear physics.\n  Moreover, in response to concerns about ``dirty'' bombs, many \nindustry critics are currently looking with renewed concern at the \n40,000 tons of spent fuel stored at operating and shut down plants in \nour own country. These radioactive pools, housed in standard concrete \nor corrugated buildings, have never been the focus of NRC security \ntests. The Union of Concerned Scientists reportedly refers to these \nbuildings as ``Kmarts without neon.'' To a determined terrorist, they \nare thrift stores of bomb-making material.\n  NRC Chairman Richard A. Meserve, conservatively referring to the \nevents of September 11 as ``a wake-up call,'' conceded that the \nterrorist acts have changed the agency's attitude about ``reasonably \nforeseeable'' threats, and ordered a ``top to bottom'' review of \nsecurity rules. But whatever the outcome of the review, action is \nneeded sooner rather than later.\n  The plants have already been placed on high-alert. Defenses have been \nbolstered on land, in the air, and on nearby waterways. Patrols of \nlocal police, as well as private security businesses and even some \nNational Guardsmen, have been stepped up. All of these measures are \ncostly. And a new review of our nuclear plants under the lens of \nterrorism potential is sure to identify additional security risks and \nrecommend additional security measures.\n  Make no mistake about it, our over-dependence on foreign fuels, \nparticularly from lands where political tensions run high, is a \nvulnerability waiting to be exploited. If our energy grid is \ndismantled, if our power plants are attacked, if our nuclear advances \nare pirated and turned against us, America will feel the shockwaves. \nMoreover, if our nuclear plants are assaulted, if they can be made into \nweapons in our own backyard, the confidence of the public so carefully \nnurtured by the nuclear industry in recent years would be destroyed. It \nwould be a heavy blow to our Nation's energy security.\n  I am happy to yield to the distinguished senior Senator from the \nState of Massachusetts, if he so desires.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Senator.\n  In reviewing the content of your proposal, I would like to ask a \nquestion. We believe as a Congress and as the Senate of the American \npeople in giving the full support we can possibly give to the men and \nwomen fighting in Afghanistan--supporting their efforts with the best \nequipment, the best technology, the best leadership, and the best \ntraining. We have had good discussions and debates over a period of \ntime as to how that can and should be done. I don't know if the Senator \nwas there when we had the Secretary of Defense briefing Members of the \nSenate. He was asked specifically: Was there more to do?\n  His response was: We will have a chance after the first of the year.\n  As someone who listened to that briefing, I certainly felt, as a \nSenator from Massachusetts having supported the past Defense \nappropriations bills, we had done what was necessary to secure the \ndefense and to carry forward America's interest in the battle against \nterrorists.\n  Now I ask this question: It appears to me we have followed our \nexperts in assuring that those who are going to be on the front lines \nof the military will have the best resources. Shouldn't we follow the \nexperts who are similarly engaged in trying to advise us as Americans \nwhat we can do and must do in order to battle against bioterrorism? It \nseems to me in reading through the thoughtful, compelling rationale for \nthe Senator's amendment, that is just what this amendment does. I ask \nfurther if the Senator would not agree.\n  We have just heard in the past few weeks the head of homeland \nsecurity, former Governor Ridge, say: Next year, we are going to have \nto spend billions and billions of dollars to build up our public health \nsystems so we will be able to have an early warning system in this \ncountry. That is what has been recommended by the public health system \nthat has studied the program. He is talking about billions and billions \nof dollars next year.\n  We have had the work group on bioterrorism preparedness, a conference \nof leading experts in bioterrorism and public health. It is probably \nthe most distinguished group of individuals that have studied this \nproblem--long before September 11. Many have been involved in the \nelimination of smallpox, as has Dr. Henderson. And having worked in the \nformer Soviet Union, he recommended we needed at least $835 million \njust to begin to meet the public health needs to fight bioterrorists. \nThat recommendation was made prior to the anthrax incident.\n  We have had the National Governors Association discussing their \nestimate in terms of the needs they face in public health. We have had \nthe American Hospital Association discussing $11 billion so hospitals \ncan be prepared. We have had Johns Hopkins University, which houses \nprobably the most thoughtful bioterrorist center in the country, which \nDr. Henderson headed. They said just to make the hospitals ready in the \nmajor cities is another $750 million.\n  This is billions and billions of dollars. I am impressed by the fact \nthat the Senator's amendment is a modest amendment. It is targeted to \ncurrent needs and can be expended immediately in order to make sure \nthere would be safety and security for our fellow Americans.\n  I have difficulty understanding why the administration wants to wait \nuntil next year to start this process when we know if we wait, we are \nputting at risk the lives and the well-being of our fellow citizens. I \nam interested in asking the Senator, if we are listening to the best in \nterms of our military advice, shouldn't we listen to those experts in \nthe area of bioterrorism who are advising and giving us notice. \nShouldn't we listen to those experts who have an awareness of the \ncountries needs, and try the best we can to follow their \nrecommendations?\n  Is not the Senator's amendment a reflection of the best in terms of \nthose who have studied this problem?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator is preeminently correct. As we \nin my office, our staff, considered this package, we were mindful of \nthe testimony that had been given in the appropriations subcommittees. \nWe were mindful of the subcommittee that had been chaired by Mr. \nDorgan, the subcommittee that had been chaired by Mr. Harkin, the \nsubcommittee before which Senator Kennedy and Senator Frist, the \neminent ``one'' physician in our midst, before which subcommittee they \nappeared and recommended moneys be spent for bioterrorism. I was \nvisibly impressed by their testimony and commented on it. They had \nstudied this matter quite at length. They had listened to the \nspecialists in the field. They had listened to the Governors. They had \nlistened to mayors. They had listened to legislators at the State \nlevel. They came up with this very tightly drawn package, bioterrorism \npackage.\n  We have used that information, used that material and used the advice \nof\n\n[[Page S12510]]\n\nthe Senator from Massachusetts and the advice of the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Frist, as we put this package together.\n\n  So in that bioterrorism area, we have sought to improve the food \ninspection lines, we have sought to provide for additional studies of \nadvanced and second generation anthrax and other viral agents, and we \nhave sought to provide for the laboratory specialists, the CDS and the \nlabs at the State and local levels, the moneys they need to deal with \nthe next attack.\n  You see, we are not dealing with just the last attack. We are dealing \npreventively, we hope, against the next attack.\n  Let me take this opportunity to compliment the distinguished Senator. \nHe has been busy day and night, and so has Dr. Frist, in talking about, \nin working in connection with, this area of safety and welfare for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his remarks.\n  I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Frist. Senator Frist and I had \nhearings going back to 1998, 1999, and then passed legislation dealing \nwith bioterrorism and also drug-resistant bacteria. The kinds of \nproblems we were facing, healthwise, were similar to problems with many \nof these pathogens.\n  But I want to raise another question to the Senator. I have before me \nthe review of the States by the Public Health Service. This is after \nthe anthrax attacks that have infected 17 and killed 5 of our fellow \ncitizens. What we have seen in the wake of these attacks is that our \ncapacity to deal with this was right at the edge of being overwhelmed. \nAnd not just in the particular regions where these incidents took place \nbut all across the country, all across the Nation.\n  I will just read about a few of the States. I will include in the \nRecord a few examples from the States that illustrate this. Let me \nmention these incidents and ask the Senator whether this is something \nto which he believes his particular measures will respond.\n  Here is the State of Iowa after the anthrax attack. This report is \nvery recent--just a few weeks old. They are talking about the public \nhealth situation of Iowa.\n\n       The State and local public health systems have been \n     overwhelmed trying to meet the needs of State and local law \n     enforcement agencies in evaluating testing threats. We have \n     been working 10-hour days and all weekends, just to try to \n     keep our heads above water. We need help.\n\n  That is Iowa.\n  Ohio:\n\n       We have processed 722 samples related to the anthrax \n     threats in the laboratory. The signs of stress are showing in \n     a number of staff as a result.\n\n  This is Ohio.\n\n       There is not enough staff to respond to all the tentacles \n     that are out there with the public in terms of these false \n     attacks that were taking place.\n\n  Tennessee:\n\n       Our communicable disease control in our 13 regions has been \n     working night and day to respond to white powder exposures. \n     The State laboratory has been overwhelmed with volume \n     testing, 450 testings in 3 weeks. We have had to pull \n     resources from other areas, leaving us vulnerable to food-\n     borne outbreaks.\n\n  In Wisconsin:\n\n       We have processed more than 400 anthrax related specimens \n     since October 10. The staffs are overwhelmed and \n     overstretched.\n\n  This is true in just about every State of the country. These examples \nare just a result of these past weeks. The Senator is asking why should \nwe take a chance with the health and the lives of the American people \nin not putting in place the kind of mechanisms we have had recommended \nto us in order to protect the lives of American people.\n  Senator, earlier today in the Judiciary Committee we heard from \nAttorney General Ashcroft. He spoke of all the emergency steps that are \nbeing taken in order to deal with the problem of terrorism here at \nhome. We are supportive of so many of those. We heard of the extent to \nwhich we are going in order to protect the lives of American people, \nand all the times we might have to bend the civil liberties of the \nAmerican people in order to protect them. We are here to make sure we \nare going to try to get it right--that those steps are going to be \neffective and they are going to be able to do their job and while also \nprotecting our rights.\n  Now we come over here this afternoon, and the Senator from West \nVirginia has an eminently reasonable, responsible amendment. His \namendment responds to the findings, the recommendations, and \nsuggestions of people who know this business, and we are told, well, we \ndon't have to deal with this.\n  I commend the Senator for his thoughtfulness in bringing this \ntogether.\n  I will just make a final, quick point and ask the Senator whether he \nmight agree with me. We have a strategic oil reserve. We have this \nstrategic oil reserve in order to protect the American industry and \nAmerican families if we run short of oil or if oil is going to run \nexcessively high in cost. I wonder why we should not have a strategic \npharmaceutical supply, so we are able to guarantee to every child, \nevery elderly citizen, in this country that if we face the challenge of \nsmallpox--that they will be adequately protected. If we can do it in \nterms of oil, it seems to me we ought to be able to do it in terms of \nsmallpox. The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia moves us down \nthat path. Any Senator who supports that amendment will be able to go \nback home, and in any town meeting they have with parents around this \ncountry, they will be able to say: We voted to make sure we are going \nto be able to provide smallpox vaccine if it becomes necessary to \nprotect your child.\n  How does anyone believe that is somehow a failure of investing in the \nsecurity of this country?\n  The bioterrorism amendment of the Senator is a few billion dollars. \nWe are spending billions of dollars overseas--and I support that. Why \nis it we are willing to spend billions of dollars overseas to try to \ndislodge al-Qaida that may kill some Americans in the future, and fail \nto support the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia, which is a \nfew billion dollars in order to protect American citizens? I just don't \nunderstand it.\n  I don't know whether the Senator can help me to try to understand the \nrationale and reason for that because it seems to me he has made \neminently good sense. The amendment is based upon the solid record of \nthose who have studied this particular issue and is in response to the \nneeds we are facing.\n  I know the Senator has other matters to which he wishes to speak. But \nI remember when we had the Office of Technology Assessment. They did a \nstudy about the potential impact of an anthrax attack on the United \nStates. It was going to cost, for 100,000 Americans who were exposed--\nit was going to cost $26 billion, for each 100,000 Americans who were \nexposed.\n  We are talking about all different kinds of possibilities. The \nSenator has in his homeland security proposal a very important \ndownpayment to make sure we are going to meet those threats. He has \nother very important measures to which I know other Members want to \nspeak. But the evidence is there.\n  I mention finally on the bill the Senator referenced--the bill \nSenator Frist and I introduced--there are now 74 cosponsors of that \nbill. Yours is a slight degree above the Frist-Kennedy bill, but there \nare 74 cosponsors for our bill.\n  I, again, thank my friend and chairman of that committee for his \nforesight in this area, and for all the good work he is doing to \nprotect families on the issues of bioterrorism. I know that later on we \nare going to have an amendment by the Senator from Indiana with regard \nto the Nunn-Lugar proposal which will help deal with the problem and \ndangers of nuclear proliferation.\n  Also, we are concerned about the dangers of proliferation of \nbioterrorist material that exists in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union \nat one time was able to produce 24 tons of anthrax a day. They have \nstored that in various areas. Even Mr. Chernov, who was a member of \ntheir national security council, was warning that he was not satisfied \nthat they had adequate protections.\n  We are interested in trying to work cooperatively with the Soviet \nUnion to contain it.\n  We are interested--as this amendment will do--in building the early \nwarning systems through the public health systems. We want to build and \nsupport the treatment which is necessary in terms of helping and \nassisting\n\n[[Page S12511]]\n\nthe hospitals, and we want containment so that it will not expand.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has an amendment that deals with all \nof those measures as a downpayment for every family to make sure they \nare going to be protected from a bioterrorist attack.\n  I commend him and look forward to supporting his amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his cogent, lucid, \nand very pertinent remarks. It boggles my mind, it boggles my mind and \nmy imagination that there is opposition to this package.\n  Does the Senator know that we have this package wrapped up and tied \nwith a little blue ribbon, and on that ribbon is the word \n``emergency?'' We have an emergency designation on this whole package.\n  If the President wants to use the money, it is there. We say: Here it \nis, Mr. President. We want to help you keep your promise to the \nmilitary.\n  There is $21 billion for the military. That is what the President \nsaid he wanted for defense. Every penny is there. We have not cut a \npenny.\n  He said on September 20 to the joint session of the Congress--I was \nthere, the Senator from Massachusetts was there in the House of \nRepresentatives when the President spoke.\n\n       Our Nation has been put on notice. We are not immune from \n     attack. We will take defensive measures against terrorism to \n     protect Americans.\n\n  Here it is. Right here is the defensive measure to protect Americans \nagainst terrorism. I am trying to help the President keep his promise.\n  He also promised $20 billion for New York City and the other \ncommunities that were involved in that attack. He promised them. We are \ncommitted to it. We are trying to help the President. I am not trying \nto get in his way. I am not trying to embarrass the President. I am \nsaying, Mr. President, let me on your boat.\n  I am trying to help him. Here it is. You don't have to spend it \nbecause we have an emergency designation.\n  What is wrong with that? Who can complain about that? The American \npeople want this. They need it. They are entitled to it, and we have a \nresponsibility to give it to them. This is defense. Whether it is in \nthe foreign fields or here in this country, it is defense.\n\n  When we talk about helping our military, we have military people in \nthis country. They are training in this country. They are in Georgia. \nThey are in South Carolina. They are in California. They are all around \nthe country. They, too, might suffer from a pathogen that comes in the \nmail. They, too, might suffer from a terrorist act.\n  We are acting to protect our people, whether they are in the \nmilitary, or whether they are not in the military, in this country and \nabroad.\n  We are trying to help our President to keep his promise. We are not \ntrying to be a problem for him. We are trying to help him.\n  I am sorry that I think he is being ill advised by some people around \nhim. I will not name of whom I have suspicions. But I think the \nPresident is well meaning. I was impressed with the President when he \nspoke at the House of Representatives. But I think he is being ill \nadvised.\n  This is not a party matter. It is not a Democratic matter. It is not \na Republican matter. It is a not a Republican threat.\n  So help us. Let us join together and fulfill that first phrase of the \npreamble of the Constitution:\n\n       We the People . . . in Order to form a more perfect Union . \n     . .\n\n  Let us form that more perfect union. Let us form it here. Let us form \nnow that more perfect union. Let us have no aisles separating Democrats \nfrom Republicans on this issue. This is not a political matter.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his observations, for his good \nwork in this area, for his support of this effort, and for the \nleadership he is providing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator from West \nVirginia a question about the issue of border security for which he \nprovides in his amendment.\n  I am especially interested in the issue of the security of our \nnorthern border. We have twice as many Customs agents on the southern \nborder between the United States and Mexico as we do on the northern \nborder between the United States and Canada.\n  With respect to the Border Patrol, we have roughly 500 Border Patrol \nagents on the northern border between the United States and Canada to \ncontrol those 4,000 miles. We have 9,000 agents on the southern border \nbetween the United States and Mexico.\n  I note that the Senator has included in his amendment some resources \nto deal with this border issue. The reason I ask the question is you \ncannot provide security for this country unless you provide security \nfor our country's borders--not just some of the borders but all of the \nborders because the terrorists will seek the weakest link.\n  There was recently a story of a fellow from the Middle East who was \nshipping himself in a container to Toronto, Canada--a suspected \nterrorist. He put himself in a container. He had a food supply; he had \na heater; he had a global positioning satellite mechanism; he had a \ncell phone; he had a toilet. He had all the comforts. He had food.\n  When they found him in this container on a container ship having \ntried to ship himself to Toronto, Canada, he got out of the container, \nand they said he was very well dressed. He looked quite well.\n\n  The question is, If he is shipping himself in a container to Toronto, \nCanada, to come into this country to commit a terrorist act, do we have \nthe resources on the northern border to be sure that we are going to \ncatch suspected terrorists or those associated with terrorists who are \ntrying to come into our country?\n  At the moment, on the northern border, Customs agents are working 12 \nto 14 hours a day, 6 days a week, and have ever since September 11.\n  The President did not request additional resources for new Customs \nagents. He requested some additional resources to pay for overtime, \nwhich they will have to do given these outlooks. But the fact is, we \nneed more agents. We need new resources.\n  It is very interesting that a request was made by the administration \nfor Border Patrol agents and for immigration agents but not for \nadditional Customs Service agents.\n  The Senator, with his amendment, has provided for additional \nresources for our border protection and border security, especially on \nthe northern border. Is that not the case?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is true. We have presently 498 inspectors on the \n4,000-mile long northern border--334 individuals who travel from one \narea to another, the Border Patrol--and at 62 of the 113 ports of entry \nalong the northern border nobody is watching at certain hours of the \n24-hour day.\n  We are trying to provide additional moneys in the amount of an extra \n$551 million to meet these needs and to meet them now. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might inquire further of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, I have traveled to those border ports of entry. My \nState has a long common border with Canada. I have been there at 10 \no'clock in the evening when the port of entry closes. I have seen what \nthey do. On that paved road between the United States and Canada, at \nclosing time, they put out an orange rubber cone in the middle of the \nroad, and that is our security past 10 o'clock at night.\n\n  As I have indicated, an orange rubber cone cannot walk, it cannot \ntalk, it cannot shoot or tell a terrorist from a tow truck. And the \npolite people who violate our ports of entry, they apparently stop the \ncar, after the port of entry is closed, and they actually move the \nrubber cone, drive through, and put the cone back. Those who are not so \npolite come running through at 60 and 80 miles an hour and just shred \nthe rubber cone.\n  The point is, terrorists will always find the weakest link. For this \ncountry to have good security, adequate security, that gives people \nconfidence, you have to have security of all of your borders. And it \nhas not been the case with the northern border.\n  It is the case that the Port Angeles point of entry is where the so-\ncalled millennium bomber tried to come through, and a very alert \nCustoms agent caught the millennium bomber who was intending to bomb \nthe Los Angeles Airport.\n\n[[Page S12512]]\n\n  It is also the case that Middle Eastern folks were inquiring in a \nsmall Canadian town just 100 miles north of the border of North Dakota \nabout the capability of crop-spraying airplanes. This was at the time \nMohamed Atta was doing the same thing in Florida. And others were doing \nthe same thing in other parts of the country--150 miles from Minot Air \nForce Base where we have our B-52s housed.\n  The point is, we must be concerned about all of our borders. I deeply \nappreciate the Senator's amendment dealing with the northern border \nsecurity, which was left out--with respect to the Customs Service, \nespecially--of the President's request.\n  If I might say, as I continue to inquire, it seems to me the \nproposals offered by the Senator from West Virginia are proposals that \neveryone supports. The head of homeland security, Governor Ridge, says, \nyes, we need to do these things. The administration says, yes, we need \nto do these things. The disagreement is about timing.\n  The issue is, should we do them sooner or later? The administration \nsays, let's do them later. The question is, Is there risk for this \ncountry in waiting until later? Will terrorists wait until later? I do \nnot think so. I think the American people will be better served by our \ndeciding to make these investments now and protect this country now. \nThe issue of sooner or later ought to be, in my judgment, resolved by \nthis Senate in favor of sooner, taking protections sooner for the \nAmerican people, taking the steps necessary to minimize the risk of \nterrorism.\n  Now, let me make one final point as I ask a question. The \nadministration, just in the last couple of weeks, has once again \nindicated to the American people there is a high threat of a terrorist \nact, according to some reasonably credible evidence that exists. This \nis the third time we have heard this. I am not critical of that at all. \nI believe it is their obligation to inform the American people under \nthose circumstances.\n  But if, in fact, it is the case that there are credible pieces of \ninformation about terrorist threats against this country that could \ncause great harm to the American people, isn't it also reasonable and \nlogical, then, for us to understand the urgency of making the very \nchanges that the Senator from West Virginia is now counseling we make \nwith respect to homeland defense and homeland security?\n\n  I ask the Senator from West Virginia, Do you not believe that the \nissue here is not policy, not whether we should do these things, but \nthe disagreement is about when they should be done, and that the \nadministration is simply saying, we do not necessarily disagree with \nwhat you want to do, we just believe it ought to be done later? Is that \nthe case?\n  (Mr. CORZINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. That appears to be the case. And it boggles my mind to \nthink that while we have a perfectly logical, commonsense approach here \nof providing to the President the means whereby he can deal earlier, \nquicker, more effectively with possible terrorist attacks--we have it \nin a package here; it is designated ``emergency;'' he can use it, he \ncan not use it--we are being asked to vote against this package. I \ncannot believe the President is receiving good advice. I have to \nbelieve he must be receiving some partisanly political advice from \nsomewhere down the line. It does not make sense.\n  Why would the President be opposed to our providing this now? We do \nnot lose anything by it. We have everything to gain by providing this \nnow. It is our responsibility, it is our duty, to provide for the \ncommon defense. And if this isn't common defense, I do not know what it \nis, if it does not fall within the category set forth in the preamble \nthat we should provide for the general welfare. This, it seems to me, \nwe have to do.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might make one additional inquiry of \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  I want people to understand, as I know the Senator from West Virginia \ndoes, that when we have a disagreement here--which is only about the \ntiming of when we ought to do what we should do for this country's \nhomeland defense and homeland security--it is not a circumstance where \nwe are confronting this President in a way that says, we are not \nsupportive of what you are doing for America.\n  In fact, there is, in my judgment, general support and admiration for \nthis President's leadership with respect to the prosecution of the war \nagainst terrorism. I think they have had a spectacular success. I \nindicated to Secretary Rumsfeld just a few moments ago how much I \nadmire his service and respect what he has done. I think the President \nalso has shown outstanding leadership in a number of these areas.\n  So this is not a confrontation with this President during a period of \nconflict. There is no disagreement about support, widespread, \npassionate support, for this administration and the administration's \nprosecution of the war on terrorism.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This issue is simply an issue of what kinds of \ninvestments do we believe need to be made to protect this country, what \nkinds of homeland security and homeland defense investments do we \nbelieve need to be made. In fact, if you read, day after day, the press \naccounts from Governor Ridge, and others, they will say that they agree \nwith all of the recommendations we are now talking about.\n  It is unfathomable to me that we should continue, month after month, \nnow saying we will not put any additional Customs agents on the \nnorthern border. I do not think anybody in this country can take \ncomfort from that. Everybody understands you must provide security on \nour borders, you must provide additional security on the northern \nborder. If not, we do not have border security. If you do not have \nborder security, you have an added risk of a terrorist being \nsuccessful. That is why the timing issue here is critical.\n\n  This is just about the question of whether we ought to do what \nSenator Byrd is suggesting now or later. If we do not do it now, 6 \nmonths or a year from now it will be done by the administration. And \nGod forbid some terrorist act would occur in the interim that we could \nhave well prevented with this additional vigilance, with the resources \nprovided in this amendment.\n  So I would ask the Senator from West Virginia to continue his efforts \non the floor of the Senate and see that we are able to enact this \namendment. I know some believe that this is confronting the President. \nIt is not at all. It is helping this country and helping this \nadministration do now what they say, in any event, they want to do \nlater. It makes much more sense, it seems to me, for us to make this \ninvestment for America today.\n  I thank very much the Senator from West Virginia for yielding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend.\n  We are not being confrontational. I have no hesitance whatsoever to \nbe confrontational with the President of the United States or anybody \nelse. Let the President advocate fast track; I am ready for that \nconfrontation, and so is the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  We are not being confrontational. We are trying to live up to our \nresponsibility. We want to work with the President. We want to help the \nPresident. I want to help him to keep his commitment when he said on \nSeptember 20, in that joint session of Congress, ``Our Nation has been \nput on notice we are not immune from attack. We will''--not maybe--``We \nwill take defensive measures against terrorism to protect America.''\n  Now, Mr. President, this is what we are trying to do. We are trying \nto help our national leader keep his commitment, and yet there is a \nveto threatened--a veto--a veto. I cannot believe the President has \nreached this decision in his own mind--a man who, when he took the oath \nof office, referred to the Scriptures, referred to the good Samaritan \non the road to Jericho. It gave me a new sense of confidence and trust \nin our President.\n  President Eisenhower, when he was inaugurated, prayed. He didn't call \non somebody else to pray; he prayed. Eisenhower himself prayed a \nprayer. I was impressed and thankful. So this President has the support \nof the American people in the war effort. There is no question about \nthat. The people have rallied. There is no party spirit in the rallying \nof the American people behind their President when it comes to the \nprosecution of a war overseas.\n  Why should they be denied the support of the administration in this \neffort to deal with future terrorist acts?\n\n[[Page S12513]]\n\n We are not being confrontational. We want to help the President. We \nare not interested in this from a political party standpoint. There is \nno dividing aisle here. We are dealing with the protection of the \nAmerican people. When we protect the American people, we protect the \nmilitary men and women who are here in this country. We protect them \nfrom terrorist acts. We protect all citizens. We protect the old, the \nyoung, the weak, the sick.\n  Why do we have to draw political lines in a matter of this solemn \nnature? This is not a Democratic proposal. This is not a Republican \nproposal. Safety, to the American people, has no political designation \non it. We have this duty. I think we would be recreant in our duty and \nit would be criminal if we did not act when we know what has been said \nto our committees and when we know from what we read in the press that \nall these things are available. Yet we say, wait, wait.\n  I think we may be in the position of the five foolish virgins. When \nthe bridegroom came, they had no oil in their lamps. He knocked at the \ndoor. ``We have no oil in our lamps.'' That is what we are trying to \nprovide here so that we will not suffer the fate of the five foolish \nvirgins.\n  I thank the Senator for his observations and his contributions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nyield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is aware \nof the recent rather sobering comment that our Vice President made with \nrespect to this war, that we are fighting on two fronts, that we are \nlikely to suffer more casualties on our homeland front than we will \nacross the seas?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am aware that he said this. He said that, for the first \ntime we are more likely to suffer casualties on the homefront than \namong our forces here or abroad.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for the careful \nattention he has given to the threats we are confronted with today. I \nthank the two distinguished ranking members who are in the Chamber, the \nSenator from Hawaii and the Senator from Alaska, for coming to New York \nCity to go to ground zero to see what happens when our country is \nattacked the way we have been.\n  I inquire of the Senator regarding the work he has done with respect \nto preparing this extremely important amendment that understands our \ndefense needs are both with our men and women in uniform, and we are \nall supportive of the President and our military leadership and very \nproud of the extraordinary work being done to root out the terrorist \nnetwork, but we also have credible threats here at home.\n  In fact, just as a reminder, this is what war looks like when it is \nbrought home to our own shores. These are pictures, as the Senator from \nWest Virginia knows so well, of the attack New York City suffered on \nSeptember 11, pictures of the devastation that occurred, pictures of \nthe men and women who are on the frontline of defense--the \nfirefighters, the police officers, the emergency responders--who, just \nas our men and women in uniform, our special forces, as well as our \nMarines, our Navy, our Air Force, our Army forces across our country \nand the world, are on the front lines of defending us at home. Here is \nwhat our defenders look like in the streets of New York. They could be \nin the streets of any of our cities.\n\n  May I inquire if the Senator, in constructing this very thoughtful \namendment that takes into account our defense needs at home, took into \naccount, as I know he did, the extraordinary devastation and damage the \ncity of New York has suffered because the attack on New York was an \nattack on America?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. May I say that the two distinguished Senators \nfrom New York have not once, have not twice, have not thrice, but many \ntimes talked with me about the needs, the immediate needs, of the \npeople of New York. They have talked to me about the suffering that the \npeople of New York have had visited upon them by this beastly attack. \nThey have continued to implore me, as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, to help them, to help the State of New York.\n  The Governor of New York came down to see me also. He sat at the \ntable in my office on the floor below and pleaded with me to provide \nhelp and succor and comfort in the form of dollars for New York City.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator has heard those cries for help and has, \nalong with the committee, responded in our time of need, for which all \nof New York is grateful. It goes beyond that.\n  As we look at these pictures, as we are reminded of the devastation \nand destruction, we know it is going to take a long time to recover. We \nknow that what the Senator has very thoughtfully provided in this \nappropriations bill will put us on the path toward recovery, will put \nmoney into the pipeline.\n  As the Senator knows better than anyone, it will be quite sometime \ninto next year before another appropriation can possibly be obtained.\n  Mr. BYRD. It will be.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Isn't it correct that it is likely to be late spring at \nthe earliest before any additional money would flow to New York?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. As a result, because of the estimates of $100 billion \nof damage, so clearly shown here in the difference of what this part of \nour country looked like on the morning of September 11 before the \nterrorists wreaked their evil on our country and what it looked like \nafterwards, we know very well it is going to be a long struggle for us \nto recover. The fires are still burning. We need to get contracts let.\n  We need to repair the destruction that has been done to our streets, \nour highways, our infrastructure. We need to help our hospitals that \nwere so prepared; they literally did all they could in spite of the \ndamage they suffered. They lost their generators. They lost their \nbilling systems. Their computers went out. But they stayed on duty. \nThey didn't ask anyone who was brought in injured, a rescue worker who \nwas injured on the job: Where is your insurance? You can't come in this \ndoor today because we don't know if you can pay. Everyone was brought \nin and given care.\n  What I have learned from that and what I commend the Senator for \nunderstanding is that New York City was probably better prepared than \nany other city in the country because of the work that had been done. \nOf course, the heroic efforts of our police and especially our \nfirefighters and our emergency workers showed that preparation.\n  What the Senator is trying to do, as I understand it, is not only to \nhelp us with the extraordinary needs we face to get us on the path of \nbeing able to use these dollars in the way they should be used--\naccountably--but to get the money in the pipeline as opposed to waiting \nuntil next year.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is also telling us we \nhave to be prepared in case this happens anywhere else in the country; \nis he not?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I am also saying those tunnels that go into Penn \nStation in New York are traps. They were built before World War I. I am \npassed 84 years of age, and they were built before I discovered \nAmerica. They are inadequately ventilated, they are inadequately \nlighted, and the escape routes are inadequate. There are 500,000 \nindividuals who go through that station every workday. There are 750 \ntrains. Yet how much has been appropriated to prevent another \ncatastrophe there to rebuild the tunnels?\n  Yes, I know. I have heard from the Senator, and I have heard from her \nsenior colleague. They have not been recreant in their duty. They have \nbeen very effective. As I say, the Governor of New York has been in my \noffice. I hope he will support this package because it will help him; \nit will help the State of New York; it will help the people in the fire \ndepartments; in the police departments, the paramedics in New York City \nand other cities in New York.\n  We have that responsibility. I did not go to New York. I am one of \nthe few national politicians who did not go to New York City. I did not \nneed to go.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. This Senator knows very well that the Senator from West \nVirginia has a grasp, an understanding of what happened, not only with \nrespect to the attacks but also the anthrax which came to New York to \nour\n\n[[Page S12514]]\n\nPostal Service and to our media offices as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I saw it on television. I saw it on the agonized faces \nof wives, mothers, and fathers. The terrorists made many widows that \nday. The terrorists made many orphans that day. I saw it in the sweaty, \ngrimy faces and hands of the workers, sifting through the rubble. I did \nnot need to go. I would like to have gone, but I made the same \ncommitment that those individuals in high places made who did go.\n  Now is the time to keep our commitment. I believe that a promise made \nis a debt unpaid, and I promised the New York Senators that I would try \nto help them, and I have done everything I can. I promised the New \nJersey Senators, one of whom presides over this Senate at this moment \nwith great dignity, skill, poise. I am keeping that promise. The \nPresident promised, and I am trying to help the President keep that \npromise.\n  I am not being confrontational about it. I want to help. Can we not \njust join hands once, one time and not be political about this and help \nto form a more perfect union and fulfill that phrase that is in the \npreamble of the Constitution?\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator for his extraordinary efforts and \nhis very fine work on this amendment, which will strengthen our \nnational defense at home as well as abroad.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, continuing along the line that the distinguished \njunior Senator from New York was pursuing, on May 10, Chief Jack \nFanning of the New York City Fire Department testified before the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the \nJudiciary on the role of the fire service in responding to terrorism.\n  Fanning, the officer responsible for the New York City Fire \nDepartment's hazardous materials operation, said that in preparing for \nterrorism, ``The emphasis must be placed on the most important aspect \nof the equation, the first responder, and first responder team.''\n  Mr. Fanning was talking about the people at the ground level, the \npeople at ground zero, the people who are the first to arrive when the \nalarm bells ring.\n  Fanning said:\n\n       If lives are to be saved and suffering reduced, it will be \n     up to them to do it.\n\n  Meaning the first responders, the first responder team.\n\n       At an incident, whatever the scale, firefighters and other \n     responders will be there within minutes, some quite possibly \n     becoming victims themselves.\n\n  Those were the words of Mr. Fanning. His testimony concluded with the \nfollowing:\n\n       They [the first responders] will do what they have always \n     done, act to protect the public they serve. Knowing this, let \n     us provide them with the tools they need to perform their \n     duties safely and effectively.\n\n  Prophetically, Fanning was among the 343 firefighters, including the \ncity's fire chief and most of the senior staff, who died in the World \nTrade Center collapse. There, as it were, is the voice from the grave \ntelling us again, do something, do it now.\n  The people at the local level need help. They are the people who are \nthe first on the scene, the first to save lives, and perhaps the first \nto give their own lives.\n  Before I turn again to the chart, this is another chart which visibly \ndisplays the situation as explained by the very distinguished senior \nSenator from North Dakota a little earlier when he talked about the \nports on the northern border being closed, and this is what the chart \nsays: ``Stop,'' with a big red sign.\n\n       This port is closed. Open daily at 9 a.m. Warning, $5,000 \n     fine for entering the United States through a closed port. \n     Nearest open port is 70 miles east at Portal, North Dakota, \n     on Canadian Highway 39.\n\n  There we have it. We can see the orange cones sitting around the \nside. My colleagues will recall the distinguished senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota said some trucks and automobiles will pull up to the sign \nand the driver or someone in the car or truck will get out, move the \ncone, and drive right on through. Or, he said, some will just press \ntheir foot on the accelerator and at the speed of 75, 80 miles an hour \ngo right through those cones and leave them in shreds. That is the \nvisual of the warning Senator Dorgan was speaking about.\n  Now let us go back. Some Senators may wish to take a look at the \nchart so we will set the chart in the chair in front of me.\n  That is what we are trying to help with. We are trying to provide \nlive men and women at those ports of entry that presently are not \ncovered 24 hours a day. That is what we are trying to do in this \npackage. We are saying do it now, do not wait, do not gamble with fate.\n  We have already fallen behind in complying with the aviation security \nbill recently passed by the Congress and signed into law by the \nPresident. The Transportation Secretary said last month on November 27 \nthat the Federal Government cannot meet the January 18 deadline that \nall checked baggage be screened for explosives. The new law requires \nthat by the end of 2002 all checked luggage be screened using explosive \ndetection systems. That would require 2,000 machines at a cost of $2 \nbillion, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  We cannot wait until next year to provide these funds if our Nation's \nairports are to comply with the tougher airline security required under \nthat law.\n  Last month, on November 3, a man carrying seven lock-blade knives, a \nstun gun, and a canister labeled ``tear gas/pepper spray,'' slipped \npast security screeners at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. It was a stunning \nbreach of security. At a time of heightened scrutiny, everybody should \nhave been looking. The would-be passenger, who had already been \nstripped of two knives at a prior security checkpoint, made it to the \nboarding gate before airline personnel in a second check discovered the \nother weapons. Here was a mini arsenal on two legs walking right \nstraight for the door of the airline, and he was almost there.\n\n  These incidents follow a recent surprise inspection by the \ninvestigators from the inspector general's office of the Transportation \nDepartment and of the Federal Aviation Administration at 14 airports \nacross the country.\n  In October, FAA inspector general agents found a man who passed \nthrough a metal detector at Dulles International Airport with a knife \nin his shoe. Now why is he carrying a knife around in his shoe?\n  In September, a man went through security in Atlanta and realized \nbefore boarding the plane he had a pistol in his carry-on bag.\n  The American people want tougher security at airports. One can see it \nin the half-full airplanes taking off from our airports every day. Even \nafter grounding nearly 20 percent of their planes, airlines filled only \n63 percent of their seats in October according to the Air Transport \nAssociation. So that is still 8 percent less airline traffic than in \nOctober of last year, well before the September 11 attacks.\n  Airports need funds to increase the visibility of law enforcement \npersonnel for deterring, identifying, and responding to potential \nsecurity threats. Additional staff persons are needed to conduct \nsecurity and employee identification checks through airports. Airports \nwith tighter budgets, particularly smaller airports in rural areas, are \nunable to absorb these new costs.\n  This package provides $238 million to hire law enforcement personnel \nand improve protection for you, you who are watching through those \ntelevision cameras.\n  I simply cannot understand the logic of opposing this package. Who \nwould choose to allow their family to live in constant fear? What \nparent would repeatedly warn a child of predators on the playground and \nthen send the child out to the park unattended and unprepared to \nprotect himself? What is the sense in telling the people to be brave \nand then denying the people even the most modest, necessary \nprotections?\n  Budget agreements are certainly no reason. This package bears an \nemergency designation. With that emergency label, this President could \nchoose, as I have said repeatedly today, not to spend these funds if \nthey prove to be unnecessary to spend at a given time and for a given \npurpose. But at least the funds would be available should the need \narise. This package also contains provisions to ensure that\n\n[[Page S12515]]\n\nthese funds are not counted in the baseline calculations in future \nyears.\n\n  Get that. I am not trying to build up future budgets. I am not trying \nto use the funds accounted for in the baseline calculations to increase \nthe budgets in the future years. There is no outyear growth, no \nmultiplier effect. It is a simple, straightforward investment in \nprotection at a time of national crisis.\n  To say we are willing to gamble the safety of the American public on \nthe bet that no additional attacks will occur, that no additional \nvulnerabilities will surface, that no additional security precautions \nwill have to be taken, defies common sense. It defies logic.\n  The President has declared we are in a state of national emergency. \nHe did that some time ago. His administration has issued three alerts, \nthree broad warnings of possible terrorist attacks, three alerts to the \nAmerican people. We must respond to our national emergency. We must \ntake matters in hand and guide this Nation through this time of \nuncertainty, this time of danger, this time of darkness.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to provide the American people with \nbasic protections at a time when the American people are most \nvulnerable. Forget your politics. Politics has nothing to do with \nthis--nothing. This package fulfills our commitment to provide $20 \nbillion to New York in response to the September 11 attacks. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this package.\n  On a statue in Atlanta, GA, are these words inscribed in memory of \nSenator Benjamin Hill, a great Senator, great orator: He who saves his \ncountry saves himself, saves all things, and all things saved do bless \nhim. He who lets his country die, lets all things die, dies himself \nignobly, and all things dying curse him.\n  Let's vote to save our country. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2243\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the allocation of supplemental emergency \n                                funds.)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the chairman has presented a program \nwhich is a program for the future, without any question one that \nreflects a substantial number of meetings that I have had with the \nchairman, and others, over a period of time since September 11. We \nhave, however, a position taken by the President of the United States \nthat he believed we had an agreement not to exceed the $40 billion that \nwe previously approved for supplemental money for 2002 to cover the \nexpenditures required to initiate the recovery from the disastrous \nattacks in our country on September 11 of this year.\n  We have before the Senate section A of the committee bill, the \nDefense appropriations bill for 2002, that was prepared by my good \nfriend, the chairman, Dan Inouye of Hawaii, and me and our staffs. It \nhas been included in the amended version reported by the full committee \nthat Senator Byrd has described and has been reported as we presented \nit, as a matter of fact.\n  Senator Inouye's version of the Defense bill for next year is in \nsection A. I do not intend to address that at all. I do, however, \naddress the problem presented with the President's position of not \nwanting additional money at this time beyond the $40 billion that he \npreviously agreed to when he signed the supplemental we previously \npassed this year. To achieve that goal, I now call up amendment 2243.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2243.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me describe, if I may, the problem we \nface. We are in the month of December, which is the last month of the \nfirst quarter of fiscal year 2002. When we finish this bill, however it \nmay look after it goes to conference with the House, and then goes to \nthe President and the President signs it, it will be approximately the \nend of the year. In other words, the new money in this bill will be \nspent in three of the quarters of the calendar year 2002.\n  Realizing that, I visited with my good friend, Chairman Byrd, and \nsuggested we deal with the issues he wanted to deal with by putting \nadditional money in the bill as money to be made available in 2003, the \nfirst quarter of 2003, which would be the last quarter of calendar year \n2002. Had we done that, we would have stretched the payments over the \nnormal four quarters of a year. I think we may have been able to solve \nthe issue that way.\n  Senator Byrd said he would rather proceed with the 2002 bill. It \ndoes, I might add, have some extra points of order that could have been \nraised against the other approach. So he deferred on that, and we went \nback to the drawing board to see what we could do to deal with the \nproblem of the President's position and the position just presented by \nSenator Byrd.\n  Let me say, basically, I believe as the future unfolds in this \ncountry, substantially all of the additional $15 billion that Senator \nByrd wants to make available will be requested by the administration. I \nwill be surprised if they don't request more than that. The problem is, \nhow much money should be pushed into the system now?\n  We had a bill before the Congress when we first reacted to the events \nof September 11. We were requested to present a $10 billion \nsupplemental. Senator Byrd and I had some meetings and we decided that \nought to go up to $20 billion. While we were working on that, we got \nword that the President had gone into the Rose Garden with some people \nfrom New York and Virginia and Pennsylvania and agreed it ought to be \n$40 billion. With the leadership of Senator Byrd, we charted through \nthe quarters of the legislative process a supplemental providing $40 \nbillion: The first $10 billion to be available to the President without \nany interference by Congress, the second $10 billion to be available \nafter 15 days' notice to the Congress on how the President intended to \nspend it, and the last $20 billion to be available in an appropriations \nbill to be passed by the Congress.\n  This bill covers the $20 billion, the last $20 billion of the $40 \nbillion.\n  We have had a great many meetings, hearings, and consultations from a \nvast number of people in the country who believe there should be more \nmoney available now. Were I President, I think I would agree. But I am \nnot President.\n\n  Mr. President, we are at war. We really are at war. We are in a \nperiod of time where, if we take action to challenge the President now, \nwe could well leave an impression, I think, that we do not have \nbipartisan support of the President as Commander in Chief.\n  I have changed my position on this matter. I told my friend, the \nchairman of the committee, that I had. I believe we can legitimately \nsay that the money we make available now through this bill and through \nthe bills that are still pending here: the Labor, Health and Human \nServices bill, the Foreign Assistance bill--before we are through here, \nwe will have presented to the administration $375 billion more than is \navailable to the Presidency right now.\n  The current level of expenditures by the Department of Defense, for \ninstance, is based on the year 2000. We have increased that \nconsiderably. The amount of money available to the President for the \nconduct of the war, really, under the Food and Forage Act--I have to \nexplain that. There is an old act that allows the President of the \nUnited States to spend money to pursue conduct of a war or when there \nare troops deployed, our troops deployed. We saw it in Kosovo; we saw \nit in Bosnia; we have seen it in connection with the activities of the \nalert in South Korea; we have seen it in many instances. This President \nhas not used the Food and Forage Act yet, but he could use any of the \nmoney in this bill to achieve the goals Senator Byrd would achieve with \n$15 billion and come to us later and say, we want the money.\n  In any event, beyond that, we have been told there will be--by \nGovernor Ridge and by the President himself--there will be a request \npresented to Congress early next year for supplemental moneys for the \nyear 2002, to pursue the further activities that are necessary to meet \nthe problems of homeland defense and the problems of\n\n[[Page S12516]]\n\nrecovery from the disaster of September 11.\n  I believe what we have to do is to look again at the $20 billion and \nallocate the $20 billion in a way to make sure there is available now \nenough money to handle at least the first quarter of the next year--\nthat will be the second quarter of the fiscal year--and then some.\n  So what I have done, in an amendment that is now pending, is to \nallocate the $20 billion in that fashion, pursuing, to a vast extent, \nthe recommendations of Senator Byrd and his $15 billion additional. The \namendment before the Senate right now, addressing division B of the \npending bill, would amend that division B to allocate the $20 billion \nin this fashion: $7.3 billion for the Department of Defense, of which \nwe have earmarked $2.3 billion for bioterrorism defense. I emphasize \nthat. The Department of Defense should have a great role in the total \ndefense of the country. I think bioterrorism is one of the key issues. \nI believe that is one of the key issues of Senator Byrd.\n  We allocate $7.05 billion for New York. Of that, $5.05 billion is for \nthe FEMA disaster relief; $290 million is for the FEMA Firefighters \nGrant Program; $2 billion is for the Housing and Urban Development \nemergency community development block grant.\n  We also allocate $5.65 billion for homeland defense. It is allocated, \n$1 billion for the Department of Justice--that is for FBI, INS, and the \nU.S. Marshals; $400 million more for the Department of Energy for \nnuclear facilities; $256 million for the legislative branch security; \n$800 million for Coast Guard and FAA security which includes $100 \nmillion for more airport security; $50 million for the White House \nsecurity.\n\n  There is $334 million for the Treasury. Again, the Secret Service, \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Customs are included in \nthat $334 million.\n  We have $300 million for food security, $100 million for the Justice \nDepartment general administration, Patriot Act, which is covered by \nSenator Byrd's proposal; $362 million for the Bureau of Justice \nAssistance, $237 million for State and local law enforcement, $775 \nmillion for Federal antiterrorism enforcement--that is executive, \nnondefense, of which $575 million is for the Postal Service, $100 \nmillion for cyber-security, and $100 million for increased security at \npublic events.\n  We also add $94 million for NASA and for the National Science \nFoundation security upgrades, and $156 million for the EPA \nCounterterrorism and Anthrax Cleanup Program.\n  If one examines this supplemental, one finds that almost every single \nitem mentioned by Senator Byrd is covered by our allocations. But they \nare lower. Admittedly, Senator Byrd had $15 billion in two emergency \nsectors. We have eliminated that and moved back into the $20 billion \nand allocated the $20 billion in a way primarily reflecting, to a great \nextent, what the House did. It also reflects to a substantial degree \nwhat the President originally requested. And it covers basically, as I \nsaid, all of the items Senator Byrd would cover.\n  In the $2.3 billion bioterrorism defense allocation, for instance, we \nhave provided money for upgrading State and local capacities, improving \nhospital response capabilities, improving the CDC, starting a national \npharmaceutical stockpile which includes the purchase and deployment of \nthe smallpox vaccine that has already been purchased. That contract has \nalready been signed.\n  It includes the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease \nat NIH, one of the signal areas that we must fund. And it has other \npreparedness activities.\n  The money for New York is committed to rebuild the infrastructure of \nLower Manhattan. The FEMA disaster relief includes the $290 million for \nthe FEMA Firefighters Grant Program, and it will involve grants to \nlocal communities to expand and improve firefighting programs through \nthe FEMA Firefighters Grant Program. Over 50 percent of the funding \nwill go to volunteer fire departments in rural communities.\n  We have tracked to a great extent what my friend has done: If you \nlook at the money for homeland defense, $1 billion for the Justice \nDepartment more than they have now in their normal bill which has \nalready passed, the State, Justice, Commerce bill. This adds to what \nthey already have available, $1 billion for coordination of information \nin the field of FBI--particularly the Trilogy Computer Modernization \nProgram. And it does address the INS construction backlog to make sure \nwe can take care of the outposts that were mentioned by Senator Byrd.\n  There is $40 million for the Department of Energy nuclear facilities, \nwhich covers, again, really a downpayment on the program Senator Byrd \nannounced in that area.\n  There is $256 million for legislative branch security. Again, I know \nof no argument about that. There is $800 million for the Coast Guard \nand FAA security. The port security hearing was held today, and this \nincludes the port security task force creation to ensure coordination \nof the efforts to protect our ports. It also includes the $100 million \nto add to the moneys we already made available to carry out the new \nrequirements imposed on FAA in the airline and airport bills we have \nalready enacted into law.\n\n  I could keep on going. It has $300 million for food security to \nincrease the number of food inspectors, as Senator Byrd indicated. It \nmust be done.\n  But I emphasize we can put up the money Senator Byrd asked for. We \ncan't find those people in just one quarter. The President's people are \ngoing to make some further requests. I think what we need to do is make \nsure there is money to meet any of the areas outlined by Senator Byrd \navailable now, and see what Governor Ridge and what the President want \nus to do to direct our attention to the future.\n  There is no question that the great part of the money must be \ndirected towards antiterrorism, and antiterrorism law enforcement in \nparticular. The Postal Service very much needs a great deal of money.\n  Again, I want to sidetrack. There are major issues involved in where \nwe are going now that have to be addressed by legislative committees. \nFor instance, the Postal Service told us they had lost over $6 billion \nand they wanted assistance. When we examined it, we agreed we should \nprovide some additional money. But we have to have some basic \nconsideration of the question of how much of that loss should be paid \nby the taxpayers of the United States and how much should be borne by \nthe ratepayers of the Postal Service, an independent entity that is not \nreally financed by the Federal Government anymore, except in connection \nwith disaster concepts. It may be that we will have to change that \nparadigm. It may be that we should help pay for some of the newer \nequipment that the Postal Service needs in order to prevent future \ndisasters such as we had in the handling of the anthrax letters by \nPostal Service employees.\n  We also have to urge them to take steps to modernize so the system \nitself does not expose employees to contamination by substances such as \nthat sent through the mail. We need to have an inspection system. And \nwe need to have a system of treating the mail so it cannot carry these \ninfectious diseases.\n  What I am saying is, if you examine the amendment I presented as an \namendment for the Senate to speak out, and say to the administration \nthat we have different priorities than have been presented to us \nbefore, we funded them through at least the first quarter of the \ncalendar year 2002. We, of course, have to go to conference with the \nHouse and meet them in any event, but I think any fair reading of this \namendment would say this is enough additional money through the use of \nthe $20 billion to meet these priorities of the Congress, and we can \nawait the request of the President for additional money and at that \ntime be part of the process to meet the needs of the future as the \ncountry changes.\n\n  That would be my last comment to the Senate. We have a great many \nproblems that come from the realization we are now exposed to different \ntypes of disasters. The disaster act that is in place was primarily \npassed at the time when we addressed natural disasters. It is the \nStafford Act.\n  The Stafford Act provides that the Federal taxpayer will replace \nfacilities owned by public entities that were destroyed because of the \ndisasters such as we saw in New York. It assists local communities in \nreplacing streets and\n\n[[Page S12517]]\n\ndocks, or whatever, in community-owned utilities, but it doesn't \nreplace privately owned utilities. It doesn't replace privately owned \nfacilities that went down with the public facilities. Clearly, it \ndoesn't even cover the publicly owned building that went up 104 \nstories. We don't know.\n  We know we have to address that. That is not something we ought to \naddress as appropriators. This should be addressed by the legislative \ncommittees in the Congress responding to legislative solutions that set \nthe new guidelines for how we handle disasters caused by terrorism.\n  I say to the Senate that I think Senator Byrd has stepped forward and \noffered us a solution to some of those problems by funding them now. \nBut I think the Congress should be involved in making those decisions \nas to what we replace.\n  Should we replace all of the firetrucks in the country? Should we \nreplace only those that come in and qualify for the grants? I do not \nknow. I pointed out in committee that we have some of the oldest \nfiretrucks in the Nation operating in Alaska villages. They were given \nto those villages at the end of World War II, and they have never been \nable to replace them.\n  But the intent is to replace those facilities that were destroyed by \nthe disaster or, because of the disaster, have become inoperable. There \nare a couple, by the way, that were destroyed by the fire itself.\n  I believe we need to have decisions on a bipartisan basis as to how \nto solve those problems, and to put the money up now would not solve \nthe problem. It would create a greater problem of having stepped down \nthe road to say we will pay it if anyone comes forward and wants a new \nfire engine. There is not enough money in Senator Byrd's bill to \nreplace all the firetrucks in the country. I am sure he would agree.\n  On the other hand, we all agree there should be some help for \ncommunities to modernize their facilities to respond to terrorist \nattacks, and to respond to acts of terrorism of any kind.\n  I have to confess that this Senator believes the bioterrorism, \ncyberterrorism, and food security problems are of the highest priority. \nI think the great problem is we need to be able to detect substances \nthat are currently undetectable. One physician told me we were lucky \nthat the anthrax attack was the first attack because anthrax is \ndetectable and it is treatable.\n  There are substances that we know exist out there that are not \ndetectable, that are not treatable, and they are not curable. We need \nto have research to find out how we can detect them and how we can \nmanage them once they are detected.\n  We started down that road in the Defense bill itself. There is $100 \nmillion in there for the Department of Defense to continue its studies, \nand expand them in those two areas of detection of these substances \ncurrently undetectable, and how to treat them once detected.\n  Freon disease, for instance, is one of the leading examples of that. \nThat is the manifestation of mad cow disease in human beings. We know \nfrom the experience in Britain that it is not only undetectable, but \neven the people who carry it may not know it for several years before \nit manifests itself in the brain of a human being. Once it does, if it \ncomes in contact with any utensils in any facility, those utensils and \nfacilities must be destroyed. There is no way to know what portion of \nthem are uncontaminated. You must destroy everything that comes in \ncontact with it.\n  That is why much of the great disaster took place in England in the \npast. We should join the international effort in that regard. Our bill \nstarts us down that line.\n  I have spoken longer than I intended to speak. But let me now address \nthe problem we face.\n  There are people on our side of the aisle who prepared a chart of the \nproblems that this bill faces in terms of points of order. Senator \nByrd's two provisions that would add the emergency money in division C \nof this bill are subject to points of order. They could be waived by 60 \nvotes. The basic bill itself that came over from the House to the \nSenate is subject to a point of order. The House waived that point of \norder. We, similarly, could waive it, or we could ignore it here.\n  There is also the point of order that comes out of the 1996 Budget \nControl Act which imposed a limit upon us of the amount of money we \ncould spend in the year 2002. Since the year 1999, that has been waived \nto a certain extent, but we, through that process, came to a balanced \nbudget. I thought we did a very good job. The balanced budget now is \ndisappearing because of the semicollapse of our economy through the \nrecession and our ability to recover from the terrorist acts and \nprevent further ones.\n  What I am saying right now is we have to waive the Budget Control \nAct; in effect, lift the caps. We have done that in section C of this \nbill. Senator Byrd's version puts it right in the bill. If we vote \nthat, that lifts those caps.\n  But there is at least three, maybe four other points of order \ninvolved here that once we get into, if we are divided on a partisan \nbasis--it looks as if we might be--there is no way out.\n  I have offered this compromise for the Senate itself to speak out and \nsay, let us settle this now and give the administration enough money to \ndo what we think they should do through the first part of next year. \nAnd let us come back and respond to the President's request for a \nsupplemental when we get back here next year.\n  Mr. President, I am not the Parliamentarian my friend is, but I can \nsay, from my study of this bill, there is no way out if we have a point \nof order and a motion to waive and that motion is not carried. It does \nnot appear that any of those points of order would be waived by the \nSenate, according to my understanding of the situation now.\n  My amendment takes us around those. My amendment says, let's set \naside the $15 billion. We deal with about half of it in the $20 \nbillion, and we move on to next year and the request from the \nPresident, and we do not have this collision. And we also--I am back \nwhere I started--do not leave the impression that a Senate that wants \nto provide bipartisan support to the Commander in Chief at a time of \nwar is insisting upon doing what he says he does not want us to do.\n  I do not argue with my friend from West Virginia at all about the \nitems he says must be covered sometime in connection with the recovery \nfrom this disaster. On how far we go on some of them we might have \ndisagreement, such as firetrucks or what is covered in public \nfacilities and what not. But the necessity for more money than the $40 \nbillion is now apparent to everybody, even from the comments Governor \nRidge has made as head of our home defense organization.\n  So I say to my friend once again, I am sad to be in this position. I \nreally am because the Senator knows--and we worked on some of these \nfigures--I believe the needs are there. And I believe the needs will \nhave to be met sometime in the future. But I would rather give the \nmoney now to initiate meeting those needs and determine the extent to \nwhich we will meet the needs, and which we will actually want to meet, \nand which we will set aside and say are the responsibility of \nratepayers or local governments or States.\n  My friend from Hawaii and I are from the generation of which \nPresident Kennedy was a part. As I sat here this afternoon, I was \nthinking about his comment at his first inauguration: Ask not what your \ncountry can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.\n  If the things we worry about today would be worried about by every \nAmerican, if every American would really take on the job of watching \nfor those erratic people who are part of a conspiracy plot, if every \nAmerican would come forth and assist the Government, volunteer to \nprovide help to people who need help now, our job, using the taxpayers' \nmoney, would be substantially reduced. I think that will come as we, \nmore and more, live up to our current slogan that we stand united.\n  I would prefer to see the Senate stand united and adopt my amendment, \nmove on this bill, and take it to conference. We will be in conference \nMonday if this amendment passes. We will still be arguing about points \nof order next Friday if it does not.\n  I hope I have offered an honorable solution to the conundrum I see \nthe Senate facing. I plead with the Senate to act in a bipartisan way \nand to tell the President: There are some priorities we want you to \nfollow. Follow them within the first $20 billion, if you disagree with \nthe $15 billion that Senator Byrd\n\n[[Page S12518]]\n\nseeks--which he does; we know he does--but, meanwhile, be assured when \nwe come back next year, we are going to make certain that the \nsupplemental that is requested will cover the needs of the country with \nregard to protection against terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I commend the Senator from \nAlaska for the compromise amendment which he has proposed, I commend \nthe Senator from West Virginia for all he has done to focus attention \non the important problems of the nation on homeland security, and I \nadmire his stamina on the presentation of a very extensive floor \nstatement.\n  I support and cosponsor the Stevens amendment. I divide my reasons \ninto three categories: First, I believe there is sufficient funding to \ntake care of the homeland security needs of America. Second, I think it \nis very important there be unity between the Congress and the President \nnow as we fight the war against terrorism and have a major aspect of \nthat war on homeland security. Third, I think it is very important the \nSenate act without having a stalemate and a gridlock, which is where we \nwill be heading if we do not find a compromise, such as the compromise \nproposed by Senator Stevens.\n  The reason there would be a deadlock is that for Senator Byrd's \nproposal to be adopted by the Senate, there will have to be 60 votes. I \nbelieve there is agreement there are not 60 votes present to have \nSenator Byrd's proposal passed by the Senate. Then the sequence which \nwould follow would be virtually interminable.\n  We are facing a situation where it is now December 6. Who would have \nthought we would be here this late with all the expectations of \nfinishing at least by the end of October or before Thanksgiving? \nHowever, here we are. We now face a continuing resolution which is \ngoing to run until a week from tomorrow, the 14th. Beyond that, there \nwill be a continuing resolution until January 3, if we do not resolve \nthis issue and the matter of the stimulus package.\n  These important items on homeland security should be advanced with \nthe necessary funding on an appropriations bill, which could go through \nthe conference and get to the President's desk next week so these \nimportant problems can be addressed.\n\n  Most fundamentally, the substitute bill proposed by Senator Stevens \nprovides the necessary funding. The subcommittee, which I had chaired \nfor 6\\1/2\\ years and of which I am now the ranking member, has the \nappropriations responsibility for the Department of Health and Human \nServices. Senator Harkin, who is now the chairman, and I moved ahead \nvery promptly to address these bioterrorism threats.\n  Senator Harkin and I have worked on a bipartisan basis on that \nsubcommittee, I think, to the benefit of the country. I found a long \ntime ago in my Senate service, if you want to get something done in \nWashington, you have to be willing to cross party lines. Senator Harkin \nand I have done that. We have held a series of hearings on these issues \nto find out what is necessary for funding on bioterrorism. We had our \nfirst hearing on October 3, our second hearing on October 23, and our \nthird hearing on November 29.\n  In the hearing on October 3, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices testified that he believed we were able to handle all of the \nproblems of bioterrorism in America. He had made a statement on ``60 \nMinutes'' to that effect. A number of us raised questions--that we \nreally were not at that point yet, and that it was not helpful to make \nsuch a statement.\n  Senator Byrd, who attended the hearing, in a very direct and emphatic \nway, threw up his arms and said, ``I do not believe you.'' From that \nsession we have moved ahead to push the Department of Health and Human \nServices to find ways to provide for antibiotics on anthrax. The \nSecretary signed the contract to provide Cipro. Then we had the hearing \non October 23 and the issue was raised about where we stood on \nsmallpox. The experts from the Centers for Disease Control and the \nNational Institutes of Health said we should not be prepared to \ninoculate Americans, that we had 15 million smallpox vaccinations, and \nthat those vaccinations could be diluted 5 times to 75 million.\n  In an exchange I had with Dr. Fauci of NIH, the discussion focused on \nwhether it was the Government's responsibility to have sufficient \nvaccines so that people could make the choice themselves. I asked Dr. \nFauci what the risk factor was. He said it was one to six out of a \nmillion.\n  I said considering that smallpox had failed, my preference would be \nto see my grandchildren vaccinated. Before we finished the discussion, \nDr. Fauci agreed that he would like to see his grandchildren \nvaccinated.\n  The point is that as a result--I think fairly stated, as a result of \nthis press--the Secretary of Health and Human Services has entered into \ncontracts which will provide enough vaccines to take care of almost all \nof America, and not years down the line but by next September, so that \nwe have moved ahead.\n  Then, in our hearing on October 3, Senator Harkin and I pressed the \nCenters for Disease Control to give us a list of all the bioterrorist \nthreats and to tell us what it would cost to meet the bioterrorist \nthreats. And as usual, there was problems with the CDC getting \nclearance from HHS and getting clearance from OMB. By the time you work \nthrough the alphabet soup in Washington, it is very difficult to get \nanything done. However, we finally found out. When they testified on \nNovember 29, they testified in a very careful way to say that it was \nnot an administration request, but it was their professional judgment \nas to what was necessary to take care of our bioterrorist threats.\n\n  As a result of what Senator Byrd did in his questioning of Secretary \nThompson and what Senator Stevens did--even though they are the \nchairman and ranking member of the full committee, they attended these \nhearings--we have been able to push up the funding far from what the \nadministration requested, which was $1,445,000,000, so that we now \nhave, under Senator Stevens' amendment, $2,300,000,000.\n  When you take the $338 million which is now in the bill for Health \nand Human Services, the total funding comes to $2,638,000,000, which I \nbelieve to be adequate.\n  When a group of Senators met with the President in his living \nquarters about 10 days ago, we had a conversation about bioterrorism. \nThere was a discussion as to a downpayment. I made the point that we \ncould not deal with a downpayment, that when there was talk about \nputting this in next year's budget, it wasn't right. Simply stated, \nthat was too late.\n  I do not speak for the President. I am a Senator and work under the \nseparation of powers. However, I had the sense that the President was \nsympathetic to the view, although I explicitly say he did not say so.\n  We are giving the President more money than he had asked for, but I \nbelieve he will sign the bill with the amendment offered by Senator \nStevens.\n  We face a very difficult time internationally, as everyone knows. The \nterrorist attack on the United States on September 11 was the most \nbrutal, inhumane, barbaric act in human history, sending airplanes \nloaded with fuel as deadly missiles into the World Trade Center in New \nYork killing thousands of people. Also, a plane crashed into the \nPentagon killing more Americans, hundreds more. I believe the plane was \nheaded to the White House. That plane's wings were perpendicular. This \nplane did not sink to crash into the Pentagon. That plane crashed into \nthe Pentagon because it could not go any further. It was on a direct \nline for the White House.\n  The plane which crashed in Somerset County, PA, I believe, was headed \nfor the United States Capitol. Senator Santorum and I visited the crash \nsite, and no one will ever know for sure, but we do know from cellular \nphone conversations that passengers on that plane fought with the \nterrorists and brought down the plane.\n  There have been three alerts, and there is no doubt of the tremendous \nconcern in America that there be adequate funding for homeland \nsecurity. I believe the bill, the substitute which Senator Stevens has \noffered, gets that job done.\n  There is the bioterrorism funding of $2,300,000,000, which, when \nadded to the existing $338 million, brings the figure\n\n[[Page S12519]]\n\nto $2,638,000,000. There is funding for New York, since the commitment \nwas made by the Congress.\n  There is funding for the FBI, Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nand the U.S. Marshals Service; for security for nuclear facilities; for \nadditional security for the legislative branch, the Coast Guard, the \nFederal Aviation Administration, the Secret Service, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the U.S. Customs Service; and food \nsecurity; and on and on and on--postal security, cyber- security \nprograms, etc.\n\n  Right now, the President of the United States has provided much \nneeded leadership for the free world. The President has said he will \nveto the bill if it has the extra $15 billion in it. I think it would \nbe calamitous if the Congress of the United States submitted a bill to \nthe President in the face of that expressed veto threat, and then the \nPresident vetoed it. There is no doubt about his determination. I saw \nblood in his eyes when he said that to a group of visiting Senators.\n  It would be a sign of disunity between the President and the \nCongress, which would have a devastating effect on our war effort \nagainst terrorism. It simply ought not to happen. In my 21 years here, \nI have been party to a lot of conferences. When we have had a threat \nfrom the President for a veto, we acknowledge that there is time for \ncompromise.\n  My distinguished colleague, Senator Stevens, has given me the audible \nto abbreviate, so I shall do that, although there is quite a bit more I \nwould like to say. I will conclude with a comment about the \ndesirability of not having gridlock in the Senate.\n  When the stimulus package came up, it was a party-line vote. I think \nAmerica is sick and tired of bickering on party lines and on \npartisanship. I believe that if we divide on party lines again, it will \nbe bad for this institution and bad for the war on terrorism and bad \nfor the funding which we need now to fight the war against \nbioterrorism.\n  It is my hope that we will find a bipartisan resolution here. I \nconcede it is not quite as much money, but the President is the leader. \nHe has asked for an opportunity to present to Congress the funding \nwhich he and his Director of Homeland Security believe to be adequate. \nThe Congress has rejected the notion of waiting until next year. I \nbelieve the President will respect the accommodation, the compromise \nwhich we have made. It is my hope that we can come together.\n  There is legislative anarchy and legislative chaos if the Stevens \ncompromise amendment is not enacted and if, instead, we are left to the \npoints of order where nothing will be accomplished, and we will be \nreturning here in January without having completed our work and without \nhaving appropriated funds necessary now. These funds can be made \navailable next week with a bill signed by the President if we come \ntogether on a bipartisan basis and adopt the Stevens compromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my desire to start the process of \nhaving some of the votes that I have indicated must be encountered.\n  It would be my intention to now raise a point of order against the \ntwo emergency designations set out in division C of the committee-\nreported amendment as prepared by Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question? Does the Senator \nnot intend to press for a vote on the Stevens amendment first?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It has been requested we now proceed with the point of \norder and then proceed with the vote on my amendment following that, if \nit is possible to do so. There is still other debate to be heard, I \nthink, on my amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will yield for a parliamentary inquiry, provided I do \nnot lose my right to the floor to make my point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Iowa seeks recognition, and the Senator from New York \nseeks recognition. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: The Senator would like to know \nexactly what the situation is at this time. This Senator has been \nwaiting to speak on the amendment offered by Senator Stevens. What is \nthe present situation on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the present time, there is a first-degree \namendment offered by the Senator from Alaska to the committee \nsubstitute reported with the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as I understand it, if I set that aside \nand make the point of order and have the vote on that, then we will \ncome back to my amendment after that vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Alaska yield to the \nSenator from New York?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the good Senator from Alaska answer two questions? \nAre they two separate points of order or one point of order against \nboth provisions?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The way my motion is worded, I am raising a point of \norder against the two emergency designations in division C, and I am \ntrying to get those two issues settled at one time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I presume that point of order is debatable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The motion to waive is debatable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not debatable. The \nmotion to waive is debatable.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished chairman \nfor a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Might we have a quorum call?\n  Mr. STEVENS. May we have a quorum call and I will regain the floor \nwhen we come back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Under that circumstance, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nyield to Senator Byrd so he might make a response to my statement on my \namendment and that I regain the floor after Senator Byrd has finished \nhis statement on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not envy myself for being in the \nposition in which I find myself. Senator Stevens is a Senator who can \nsay no and make you like it--almost. He is always so gracious. I have \nheard a lot about his renowned temper. I have seen it at work, but he \ndoes not lose his temper. He uses his temper and is always, as I have \nwitnessed over several decades, one of the most reasonable individuals. \nSo I do not like to be in a position of being opposite to Senator \nStevens.\n  While discussions are going on, let me attempt to point out some \nflaws of the amendment by Mr. Stevens. The substitute amendment reduces \nthe amount of money available to the Office of Domestic Preparedness, \nODP, to $362 million, a $138 million reduction. That is a 39-percent \nreduction from the bill, as reported, for State and local law \nenforcement antiterrorism equipment and training.\n  The Office of Domestic Preparedness estimates there is currently no \nState that is adequately equipped to respond to an incident involving a \nweapon of mass destruction at the State or local level.\n  Texas, identified as one of the best prepared States, has conducted a \nstudy that shows that $159 million in equipment would be needed to \nbring the State to the minimum level needed to adequately respond to a \nterrorist incident. In fact, ODP, the Office of Domestic Preparedness, \nestimates funds needed to bring the Nation's State and local \ngovernments up to minimum standards\n\n[[Page S12520]]\n\ncould well exceed $2 billion in fiscal year 2002 alone. Thus, the \nreduction proposed by the substitute amendment is equivalent to the \nlevel of funding needed to bring Texas up to minimum standards.\n  There are currently over 9 million first responders in the United \nStates who would be called upon to respond to a terrorist incident. To \ndate, the ODP has been provided with training funds that have allowed \nthem to train only 80,000 of the 9 million first responders nationwide.\n  The bill as reported attempted to more than double the population \ntrained to date. The substitute amendment's reduction in funding \njeopardizes our efforts to provide the individuals on the front lines \nwith the training necessary to protect their own lives, as well as the \nlives of victims.\n  Furthermore, the amendment by Mr. Stevens reduces the $300 million in \nthe committee bill for FEMA for gathering grants by $10 million; $300 \nmillion in the committee bill is reduced by $10 million.\n  As to Federal antiterrorism law enforcement, the substitute amendment \ncuts $100 million in the homeland security bill to cover the costs of \nthe FBI's investigation of the terrorist attacks on September 11. These \nfunds are critical to the investigation of the attacks from September \n11 and the anthrax attacks.\n  The substitute amendment cuts $25 million from the homeland security \nbill for the FBI's Trilogy, the computer modernization program. This \n$25 million will significantly accelerate the completion of Trilogy.\n  The September 11 attacks have exposed the vulnerability in the \nintegration of the FBI's computer system. While FBI agents in the field \nare working around the clock collecting evidence and clues, their \nreliance on paper files leaves their work fragmented and uncoordinated. \nIt will only be when FBI agents are linked by the Internet to one \nanother and the universe of law enforcement agencies, that the FBI will \nactually know what it and others know about terrorism, espionage, or \norganized crime.\n  Without these additional funds, deployment of Trilogy may be delayed \nand these unacceptable problems will continue to exist.\n  The substitute amendment cuts $25 million included in the Homeland \nSecurity bill for counterterrorism equipment and supplies. These funds \nare essential for the FBI to have the resources they need to properly \ninvestigate the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and the \nfollowing anthrax attacks.\n  With reference to Border Security the substitute amendment cuts over \n$270 million in funding for the Customs Service. This will prevent \nCustoms from hiring the necessary inspectors and agents to protect our \nborders.\n  On Monday, the Attorney General essentially called out the National \nGuard to assist the Border Patrol and INS in their duties on the \nnorthern border. Treasury has not taken the same steps, yet has pulled \npersonnel from the over-worked posts on the Southwest border to staff \none-person posts on the northern border. They even eliminated funding \nfor added inspectors on the Southwest border.\n  This delay places $7.5 billion in international commerce at risk \ndaily; $1.3 billion of which crosses the northern border. Instead of \nproviding additional people to protect our borders, it will continue \nour short-sighted reliance on orange rubber cones to stop terrorists.\n  The substitute amendment cuts $300 million for INS construction that \nis funded in the homeland security bill even though there is an ever-\ngrowing overcrowding crisis at the INS.\n  For example:\n  Of 85 outposts across 9 sectors on the southwest border, 63 are \novercrowded, some grossly so. The worst, a station in Mercedes, TX, was \ndesigned for 13 agents but currently houses 142, more than 1,000 \npercent its rated capacity.\n  In total, there are 10,150 agents working in office space designed \nfor a capacity of 5,831 on the southern border. There are 525 agents \nworking in office space designed for a capacity of 469 on the northern \nborder.\n  The substitute amendment makes the same mistake made with the \nsouthern border over the past several years. We are building up \nagents--300 inspectors and 100 Border Patrol agents--but we are not \nproviding the necessary funding to address necessary space requirements \nfor them to do their job efficiently and professionally.\n  The risks to the safety of agents cannot be overemphasized and \nappalling work conditions will do nothing but contribute to the Border \nPatrol's soaring attrition rate.\n  This $300,000,000 is only the beginning to truly address the enormous \nbacklog with INS construction projects.\n  Now, we have heard a lot about airport security.\n  The bill reported by the committee included $200 million to assist \nthe neediest airports in meeting the costs of the dozens of new safety \ndirectives issued by the FAA since September 11. The Stevens amendment \ncuts that figure in half.\n  Senators should ask their small- and medium-sized airports whether \nall this money is needed. Airport revenues are dropping drastically at \nthe same time as the airports are being required to triple their law \nenforcement expenditures and security personnel.\n  The Stevens amendment actually cuts the President's request to better \nsecure cockpit doors by more than 20 percent.\n  Senators should not be confused by recent announcements that the \nairlines have reinforced all their aircraft. All the airlines have done \nto date is install a temporary metal bar and a cheap deadbolt.\n  The money in the President's request for FAA operations is to install \nthe next generation of truly impenetrable cockpit doors. The Stevens \namendment cuts it by more than 20 percent.\n  As for the nuclear power plants, the amendment by Mr. Stevens \nproposal cuts $86 million from the $285 million provided for enhanced \nprotection of our Nation's nuclear weapons plants and laboratories.\n  The amendment by Mr. Stevens also cuts $131 million from the $286 \nmillion provided for the acquisition and safeguarding of fissile \nnuclear material from Russia and states of the former Soviet Union.\n  The non-proliferation programs at the Department of Energy are the \ncornerstone of our Nation's effort to keep nuclear material out of the \nhands of terrorists.\n  The Stevens proposal cuts all funding--$139 million--for enhanced \nsecurity at Army Corps of Engineers owned-and-operated facilities: \nports, dams, and flood control projects nationwide.\n  Additionally, the proposal cuts all funding--$30.259 million--for \nincreased security at Bureau of Reclamation facilities.\n  It funds only the GSA request for security of Federal buildings in \nNew York City. It fails to provide similar security for other Federal \nbuildings elsewhere in the country.\n  How about U.S. port security.\n  The Stevens amendment then goes further by eliminating two-thirds of \nthe funding for marine safety teams to permanently protect our ports.\n  Under the Stevens amendment, there will only be one such team to \nprotect all the ports on the East Coast and one team to protect all the \nports on the West Coast.\n  The substitute amendment reduces funding for the port security \ninitiative through the Maritime Administration by $12 million.\n  These reductions would eliminate funding to assist local ports in \ntheir efforts to purchase security equipment such as fences, \nsurveillance cameras, and barriers.\n  Effective physical security and access control in seaports is \nfundamental to deterring and preventing potential threats to seaport \noperations, and cargo shipments.\n  Securing entry points, open storage areas, and warehouses throughout \nthe seaports, and controlling the movements of trucks transporting \ncargo through the seaport are all important requirements that should be \nimplemented. They will not be implemented under the substitute \namendment.\n  United States seaports conduct over 95 percent of United States \noverseas trade. Seaport terrorism could pose a significant threat to \nthe ability of the United States to pursue its national security \nobjectives.\n  The amendment by my friend would cut the President's request for \ndefense programs by $2.3 billion.\n  Let me say that again. The substitute amendment by Mr. Stevens\n\n[[Page S12521]]\n\nwould cut the President's request for defense programs by $2.3 billion. \nWhile the amendment has no detail, the cut would need to come from \neither classified programs or force protection programs designed to \nimprove security for our forces around the world.\n  As to the Postal Service, my friend's amendment would cut $300 \nmillion from the $875 million in my proposal to sanitize the mail, \nprotect postal employees, rebuild the facilities lost in New York City. \nThe U.S. Postal Service identified $1.1 billion in unfunded needs. This \nproposal cuts that amount in half.\n  My friend's amendment to my amendment cuts $29 million from the EPA \nfor bioterrorism response and investigation teams. This would undercut \nEPA's ability to respond to, investigate, and clean up after acts of \nbioterrorism.\n  My friend's amendment does this. The President promised New Yorkers \nthey would get $20 billion to help them recover from the September 11 \nattacks. My amendment fulfills the President's promise. My amendment \nfulfills our commitment. I did not go to New York, but I saw enough on \ntelevision. I did not go up there and make any promises. I stayed here \nand made my promise, and I am living up to that promise.\n  So the substitute, I am sorry to say, cuts funds for New York and \nother communities directly impacted by the attacks by over $9.5 \nbillion. Here are some examples:\n  FEMA disaster relief, which funds debris removal at the World Trade \nCenter site, repair of public infrastructure such as the damaged \nsubway, the damaged PATH commuter train, all government offices and \nprovides assistance to individuals for housing, burial expenses, and \nrelocation assistance, is cut--cut--by $8.6 billion.\n  And $100 million for security in Amtrak tunnels is eliminated. \nEliminated.\n  Funding of $100 million for improving security in the New York and \nNew Jersey subways is eliminated by my friend's amendment.\n  As to New York/New Jersey ferry improvements, $100 million for \ncritical expansion of interstate ferry service between New York and New \nJersey is eliminated by my friend's amendment. Prior to the September \n11 attacks, 67,000 daily commuters used the PATH transit service that \nwas destroyed.\n  Those commuters are trying to get to our Nation's financial center in \nlower Manhattan. The communities in the New York region have been \npiecing together temporary ferry and train service using facilities \nthat are not even safe to transport these commuters. The train riders \nat alternative train stops are so crowded, the police authorities are \nconcerned with passengers being pushed off the platform onto the \ntracks. Yet the amendment proposed by Mr. Stevens eliminates all this \nfunding for transit and ferry assistance in that region.\n  And $140 million is eliminated to reimburse the hospitals in New York \nthat provided critical care on September 11 and the weeks and months \nthat followed.\n  Mr. President, $175 million is eliminated that would help New York \nprocess workers compensation claims for the victims of the September 11 \nattacks.\n  As to Federal facilities, $16 million is eliminated for the costs of \nkeeping Federal agencies operating that were in the World Trade Center, \nsuch as the Social Security Administration, the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration \nand the National Labor Relations Board.\n  Ten million dollars is eliminated that would help New York schools \nprovide mental health services to the children of the victims of the \nWorld Trade Center bombing.\n  Hear me. Hear me, Governor of New York Pataki. He came to my office. \nHe sat down at the table across from me, and he made his plea for help. \nI am trying to help him. Yet $10 million is eliminated that would help \nNew York schools provide mental health services to the children of the \nvictims of the World Trade Center bombing.\n  The Stevens compromise is $174.4 million less than the Senate \ncommittee bill for the District of Columbia.\n  I will soon close my remarks. Before doing so, let me call attention \nto a cut in bioterrorism activities by over $1 billion. The amendment \nby my friend, Mr. Stevens, would cut bioterrorism activities by $1.025 \nbillion. It would cut in half funds from $1.15 billion to $500 million \nfor upgrading our State and local public health infrastructure funds, \ndesperately needed to help upgrade State and local lab capacity, to \nenhance surveillance activities, support local planning for \nemergencies, and improve local communications systems.\n  Recent events have made it clear that the State and local public \nhealth departments have been allowed to deteriorate. The head of the \nCDC, Mr. Jeffrey Koplan, testified only last week that at least--at \nleast--$1 billion is needed not next spring, not next summer, not in \nthe next supplemental, but now, immediately, to begin to upgrade our \nState and local health departments. That is the head of the CDC \ntalking.\n  It cuts all funds provided in our proposal for the deployment of the \nsmallpox vaccine across the country. This vaccine does no good if it is \nall at the CDC, with no plans for distribution if an emergency occurs.\n  He cuts funding for CDC capacity improvements by $57 million. \nRecently the Los Angeles Times reported that four men in Georgia were \ndiscovered to have contracted the West Nile virus 3 months earlier. The \ndelay in the diagnosis was due to the large backups at the CDC labs. \nThis cannot continue.\n  The people of the Nation cry out for help. They are concerned about \nthe safety of their children, the safety of their wives, their mothers, \ntheir husbands, their fathers. They are concerned about the possible \nloss of life that might be visited upon them tonight, this very night.\n  So I had three goals in the committee bill. Let me repeat them.\n  One goal is to fully fund the President's request for defense--he \nwould get every penny--$21 billion for defense. Nobody can say that \nthis impedes or impinges upon the needs for defense.\n  Second, my proposal fulfills the promise of $20 billion for New York.\n  Also, my package responds to the vulnerabilities in our homeland \ndefense.\n  Lastly--I would much prefer to be on the side of my friend than to be \nopposite him--my friend's substitute does not meet any of these \nobjectives.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my friend for his courtesies.\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 2243, WITHDRAWN\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I shall read and reconsider the \nsubstitute based upon the Senator's detailed objections.\n  I withdraw my amendment.\n  Pursuant to section 205 of H. Con. Res. 290, the fiscal year 2001 \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, I raise a point of order against \nthe two emergency designations set out in provision C of the committee-\nreported amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I move to waive section 205 of H. Con. \nRes. 290 of the 106th Congress for the consideration of the emergency \ndesignation on page 397, and I move to waive section 205 of H. Con. \nRes. 290, 106th Congress, for the consideration of the emergency \ndesignation on page 398, and I ask that the motion be divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to divide the \nmotion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  This will be on the first division.\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. There is a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there has been a vote ordered on both \nmotions to waive; is that right?\n\n[[Page S12522]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only the first division is pending at this \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is the order to so request.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 60 \nminutes for debate with respect to the motions to waive, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens \nor their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, without \nintervening action, the Senate proceed to vote with respect to the \nmotions to waive. I further ask unanimous consent that--I have checked \nwith Senator Byrd on this--Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton each be \nrecognized for 5 minutes out of the time of Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \nleadership. I know he will address the homeland security part of the \ndebate so well, I will talk about the New York part of the debate, as I \nknow my colleague, Senator Clinton, will.\n  We are about to experience one of the most incomprehensible and \ninexplicably absurd moments in the entire history of this body. We are \ngoing to debate and vote upon whether what happened in New York on \nSeptember 11 was an emergency. Think about it. We are debating whether \nwhat happened in New York on September 11 is an emergency. Some are \nsaying it is not an emergency. Ask the thousands of families who lost \nloved ones as the Twin Towers collapsed. Ask the firefighters and \npolice officers, emergency rescue workers who worked so valiantly, many \ngiving their lives to rescue those in the Twin Towers. Ask the \nhospitals that extended themselves in ways they never had to before. \nAsk our mayor, a hero in America. Ask our Governor. If there was ever \nan emergency that affected the United States and certainly affected New \nYork, it was this. Yet now we are debating whether this was an \nemergency.\n  New York desperately needs the money that Senator Byrd has allocated \nin his bill. When Senator Clinton and I visited the White House and the \nPresident committed to help us with $20 billion, it was an act of \ngenerosity. It was an act of understanding that you don't divide \nAmerica in a time of need. It was an act that said we are all one, and \nwhen one part of America is wounded and hurt and crying, all of America \ncomes to its aid.\n  The proposal by the Senator from Alaska puts less money in for New \nYork than either the President did when he committed to us or even that \nthe President argued for in the House bill. That is not a way to heal \nour country. That is not a way to restore our Nation's greatest city. \nThat is not a fair thing to do.\n  Every day we learn of new needs and new hurt in New York. The amount \nof money proposed in this bill helps us begin to recover. It helps the \nfamilies who have lost loved ones. It helps the office workers who have \nlost their jobs. It helps the small businesses that are about to go \nunder because they don't have anybody there to buy their wares. It \nhelps the large businesses that lost so much space, 20 million square \nfeet of space. It helps us restore our transportation system so \ndamaged.\n  To now say that we don't have an emergency is almost as if to say \nwhat happened on December 7, 1941, was not an emergency. What kind of \nworld are we living in? How can we contort ourselves in a political \nknot and deny what is obvious to everyone on this planet, American and \notherwise? In an effort to deny New York badly needed funds, we are now \nattempting to vote away an emergency designation.\n  In my years here in the Senate, I have voted for emergencies such as \nearthquakes and floods. I have voted for all kinds of money for such. \nNow an emergency has struck my city, a horrible, fiendish emergency \ncaused by diabolical people from halfway around the globe.\n  America, my friends in the Senate, we need your help. We desperately \nneed your help. Please, do not turn your back on us. Do not turn your \nback on us in our hour of need. Bring America together. Unite and help \nus heal by supporting Senator Byrd's proposal, by voting against \nSenator Stevens', on its face--with all due respect--absurd proposal \nthat New York is not in an emergency situation.\n  If New York and if all of America--because the attack on New York was \nan attack on America--ever needed you, it is now. Do not let other \ntypes of considerations get in the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise to once again remind us what an \nemergency looks like. I have, over the past 25 years, visited the sites \nof tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, the Oklahoma City \nbombing. I have never seen anything in my life like what I saw in New \nYork City on September 11. The television and the pictures didn't do it \njustice. I had to see it with my own eyes on September 12.\n  I rise to join my colleague who has, with me and so many others, been \nworking to recover from this, this picture of devastation and \ndestruction. I remind my colleagues of those early pictures of the \nfirefighters, the police officers, and the emergency response teams \ncoming out of the dust, the black soot that covered them from head to \ntoe. There were a lot of very kind words spoken, a lot of applause and \ncheers for our soldiers on the front line at home who ran toward danger \nand saved countless lives.\n\n  It is hard to imagine that we are having this debate. It is \nespecially hard when we look back, as I did, at how this body responded \nto the emergencies that were not man-made but naturally occurring, and \nwhat happened in Oklahoma City.\n  We know we are going to have a long struggle ahead to recover and \nrebuild. New York is taking on that obligation and challenge. But we \nalso know we cannot do it without America's help.\n  This is America represented in this Chamber tonight. When New York \nCity was attacked, America was attacked. I cannot imagine us ever \nturning our faces away from this. In fact, we did not. We immediately \nmoved to appropriate money to be spent for New York. Right now, we are \nfighting for the emergency designation that will put that money in the \npipeline, that will make it available.\n  Why is that important? It is important because in every disaster--\nthere are some former Governors in this body, and I have spoken to a \nfew of them tonight--when States were flooded, when the hurricanes \ncame, when the tornadoes came, they wanted that money as soon as \npossible to begin to put it to work, to start letting the contracts, to \nstart paying back the overtime so they did not have to run in the red, \nas we are having to do throughout New York.\n  I went back and looked at how fast money got out in other emergencies \ncompared to the amount of money that was eventually delivered.\n  In the Midwest floods, within 3 to 4 months more than 40 percent of \nthe dollars from the Federal Government had been appropriated. With the \nNorthridge earthquake, more than 30 percent of the dollars had been \nappropriated within 26 days. Ninety-nine days after the Oklahoma City \nbombing, more than 40 percent of the money that went to help the people \nof Oklahoma had been appropriated. Eighty-five days after the attacks, \nwe are fighting over whether or not what happened in New York on \nSeptember 11 was an emergency.\n  I remember what people said in the immediate aftermath. We were given \nenormous support.\n  ``We will rebuild New York City,'' said President Bush on September \n21.\n  ``We will come back to New York again to see this town rise from the \nashes that we saw today,'' Speaker Hastert.\n  ``We are here to commit to the people of New York City and New York, \nregardless of the region of the country that we come from--and the \nentire\n\n[[Page S12523]]\n\ncountry is represented by this delegation--that we will stand with \nyou.'' Senator Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, on behalf of not just New York--let's \nnot look at it abstractly as just the big State and the big city that \nwe are. I want everyone to picture the faces of those firefighters, \npolice officers, and emergency workers, and then I want everyone to \nthink about the widows and the orphans. Our country was invaded, and \nunder the Constitution, we owe, as a nation, the protection and \ncertainly the support of this body for which we are fighting tonight. I \nhope that what is an emergency will be voted as such this evening.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise as chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to point out that while our Republican colleagues are \nopposing $15 billion to strengthen our defenses and to rebuild what has \nbeen destroyed in the sneak attack on this country--they argue that \nthis will add deficits--at the very same time, they are proposing an \neconomic stimulus package that adds $146 billion of deficits over the \nDemocratic stimulus plan over the next 3 years, 10 times as much in \ndeficits in their economic stimulus plan than the $15 billion that \nwould be used to strengthen homeland security and to rebuild the \ndevastation in New York. Something does not make sense.\n  In their stimulus package, they have $25 billion, as the New York \nTimes pointed out this morning, that would simply go to help the \nbiggest corporations in America avoid taxes altogether.\n  They argue: No, no, go slow, the President might veto. Nobody argued \ngo slow when we counterattacked those who attacked America. Nobody \nargued that we ought to go slow when the President went to New York and \npromised to rebuild. This is not the time to go slow in protecting \nAmerica and rebuilding that which has been destroyed. This is the time \nto act.\n  The greatest irony is I was informed last week by sources within the \nadministration that they themselves are working on a $20 billion \nsupplemental appropriations bill for early next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we should not wait. We should act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator from New Jersey wish?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Three minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for yielding the time.\n  There are moments when we are reminded why our fathers and mothers \ncreated this Union. This is one of those moments to provide for the \ncommon defense, to promote the general welfare.\n  All of America was attacked, but that attack fell most directly on \nthe peoples of several States. The President of the United States has \nreminded us that in this new war, we are all soldiers. If that be the \ncase, the obligation of this Senate is to provide resources for all the \npolice officers, all the citizens, all the workers who are on the front \nlines.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has answered that call for my State, \nand I believe for the national interest. Since September 11, thousands \nand thousands of people are unable to get to their place of employment \nbecause the trains under the Hudson River were, in some instances, \ndestroyed; businesses had to relocate and have had enormous economic \ndisruptions. The Appropriations Committee has provided money to repair \nthose trains, and $100 million for ferry service so businesses can \ncontinue to operate.\n  We are told that one of the greatest threats to our security in \nanother terrorist attack is the tunnels under the Hudson River, \nidentified as the primary threat in the country. The Appropriations \nCommittee has provided $100 million to repair the tunnels for safety, \nfor fire, for escape.\n  We are told that one of the greatest threats, from a previous threat \nfrom the al-Qaida organization, was to attack the tunnels for \nautomobiles and bridges. Indeed, that attempt was foiled once before, \nbut we remain vulnerable.\n  The Appropriations Committee has provided $81 million for security \nupgrades of the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel.\n  Finally, on this very day, we have this Senator's testimony about the \nvulnerability of millions of uninspected containers coming into this \ncountry on container ships from every corner of the Earth. The \nAppropriations Committee has provided $29 million for new security \npersonnel and new boats for New York Harbor to ensure these ships are \nintercepted, and that these containers are inspected to assure the \nsafety of our people.\n\n  President Bush is right. This country is at war. It is not a distant \nwar. It may be fought in Afghanistan, but it began in New York and in \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. These are the resources in a very real way, just as \nreal as in Afghanistan to win that fight to secure these people, and I \nam grateful to the Appropriations Committee for its commitment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, does the Senator from West Virginia \nneed additional time now?\n  Mr. BYRD. I need some additional time. I was hoping the other side \ncould use some of its time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to yield 10 minutes of our time to the \nSenator from West Virginia and shift it over to his control.\n  Let me briefly state the position of this Senator on the motion to \nwaive. As I have stated, the President, as Commander in Chief in a time \nof war, has said he believes he has requested ample money to take him \nthrough to the time when he will submit, based on Governor Ridge's \nreport to him, the moneys that are necessary to conduct the homeland \ndefense for the United States. He has also said he believes we have now \nsufficient funds to pursue the war that is being conducted against \nglobal terrorism based on the moneys that have been presented in \nsection A of this bill, and the additional moneys for defense in \nsection B of this bill.\n  Those moneys are presented pursuant to the act of September 14, which \nspecified that not less than $20 billion of the moneys involved would \ngo to New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania to help react to the events \nof September 11.\n  My amendment--I have withdrawn it now, but I will offer it again \nprobably in the morning--does not change that law. Nothing in the \nproposal of the Senator from West Virginia changes the September 14 \nlaw, as I understand it. He seeks to add to it, but he does not change \nthat, and that law guarantees $20 billion.\n  Now, I do not have my tie on to take on the Senator from New York as \nI might normally. That will be tomorrow probably, but right now let me \nsay to the Senator from New York, no one knows disasters in the United \nStates like Alaskans. We have an earthquake about every week. We have \ntidal waves. We have tornados, floods. We understand emergencies.\n  We have not said New York did not suffer an emergency. We have \nmerely, by this point of order, said emergency money is not needed now \nto meet the needs of the people affected by September 11 because with \nthis bill, we have put up a total of $40 billion, plus the moneys that \nare in the bill itself. They cannot even come near to be spent before \nwe can get the next supplemental out.\n  I am informed that New York has only requested so far less than $5 \nbillion of the money to which it is entitled.\n  I do not mind being a whipping boy. You play with the cards you are \ndealt. My role is to try to get this bill to conference. I want the \nbill enacted before Christmas. I think New York is better\n\n[[Page S12524]]\n\noff to have it enacted before Christmas. I do not think it can be \nenacted before Christmas if we have a situation where we have a veto of \nthis bill. I do not think we should be challenging the President of the \nUnited States.\n  I remember standing in this Chamber as the chairman of the committee \nasking for money for the former President of the United States to \nconduct two wars against which I voted. I have always honored the \nrequest of the President of the United States with regard to defense \nand emergencies, too. I remember standing in the Chamber and asking for \nmoney to replace the money that the former President of the United \nStates used under the Food and Forage Act to conduct activities in \nKosovo and Bosnia, that I opposed.\n\n  This is no precedent. This is a procedure established to assure the \nCongress agrees with the designation of emergency in terms of spending. \nWe are not saying there was not an emergency on September 11. Anyone \nwho watched the television--and I did visit ground zero. God knows \nthere was an emergency up there and one that will be ongoing, but New \nYork is not going to be rebuilt before March of next year. The money in \nthis bill, the $40 billion, cannot be spent before March of next year. \nThere is no necessity for additional money now. There will be a \nnecessity to respond to the President's request next spring. Therefore, \nI believe the motion to waive is not necessary, and I oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the other side wish to yield some time to themselves?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We yielded 10 minutes of our time to the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I understand.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Oklahoma seek time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes remains for the minority; 24 \nfor the majority.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, first I wish to compliment our \ncolleagues for this debate, and particularly Senator Stevens. It is not \neasy when one takes on the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I \nhave great respect for my friend and colleague from West Virginia. I do \nnot happen to agree with him on this particular issue. I agree with him \non a lot of issues. This is not one I agree with him on, and I will \nstate why.\n  I have heard some colleagues imply if we do not support this, we are \nnot in favor of New York, or we are not in favor of rebuilding, and I \njust totally disagree with that. I think every one of us wants to help \nNew York, wants to help Virginia, wants to help our country, wants to \nprovide for national security, wants to provide for a defense bill.\n  I am trying to look at where we are in regard to helping New York and \nhelping our national defense. We have to have a bill that is going to \nbe signed by the President of the United States.\n  I read the President's statement of policy, and it does not \nequivocate. It says if the final bill presented to the President \nexceeds either of the agreed-upon spending levels, the President will \nveto the bill--the spending levels of $686 billion that he agreed to. \nAnd I might mention he increased that spending level to get an \nagreement. He had an agreement with Members of Congress, Democrats, and \nRepublicans. I might mention the Democrats in the House insisted he put \nit in writing. It was put in writing on October 2.\n  That agreement was for $686 billion in discretionary spending. That \nwas for a growth level of over 7 percent. The President agreed with \nthat. Subsequent to that, the President agreed to an emergency spending \nbill of $40 billion.\n  I might mention we were marking up the bill--I am sure my colleague \nfrom West Virginia remembers this--and the bill was $20 billion. At one \ntime, some people were saying maybe it should be less than that, but it \nwas at $20 billion. Then our colleagues from New York and the Governor \nand the mayor of New York prevailed upon the President to make the $20 \nbillion $40 billion. So in one afternoon, in a period of hours, right \nbefore the very day we were passing the emergency assistance bill, it \nwas $40 billion.\n  That bill was passed unanimously. It was done in a bipartisan \nfashion. We all agreed, let us make it $40 billion. We were basically \nsaying let us work together on this. I questioned whether or not at \nthat time it needed to be $40 billion. I was saying, why do we not do \n$20 billion now, and if we need another $20 billion, we will do it? But \nwe all agreed, let us do $40 billion.\n  We had a significant discussion about how that first $20 billion \nwould be controlled, and we agreed basically $10 billion at the \nPresident's discretion, the other $10 billion the President would \nsubmit his request to the appropriators and they would sign off on it. \nThey had 15 days to do that.\n  Then we said the additional $20 billion would be subject to a \nseparate appropriations bill, and that is what we have in the \nDepartment of Defense bill. Some people might be wondering why this is \nbeing done in the Defense bill in the first place. It did not have to \nbe in Defense. We just said it will be in a subsequent bill. It could \nhave been an independent bill or it could have been in an \nappropriations bill. So that is the $20 billion. The President agreed \nwith that. Both parties agreed with that, and it was passed.\n  That is all we have agreed on. The President says that is enough for \nnow. The President said he is willing to make whatever considerations \nare needed in the future. The President's letter also said the \nadministration spent less than 16 percent of the $40 billion designated \nby Congress to respond to the September 11 attacks. Yet some people are \nsaying let us make the $40 billion $55 billion, even though we have \nonly spent 16 percent of the original $40 billion. I think that is \nmoving a little aggressively, maybe a little too fast, and maybe not \ngiving us a chance to figure out the cleanup costs.\n  Both Senator Stevens' bill and Senator Byrd's bill have a lot of \nmoney for FEMA. I do not know, and I do not know that anybody knows, \nhow much FEMA is going to need for cleanup costs for Virginia and New \nYork, but we are paying every bill that FEMA has been requested to pay.\n  I contacted the mayor's office in New York City and they said every \nsingle bill they have submitted to this administration has been paid \nwithin 5 days. That was from the mayor's office as recently as a few \ndays ago. So if every bill has been paid, they are making good on their \ncommitment.\n\n  Why not give the administration a chance to look at the total costs. \nGovernor Ridge was appointed to be head of this task force. We give him \nenormous responsibility. Let him make recommendations. Then we will \nconsider those recommendations. I am sure we will pass almost all of \nthem. We may modify them. We have that right. To say we will preempt \nand move ahead, we are wasting our time. The President says he will \nveto it. I tell my friends, we have the vote to sustain the veto; why \ngo through this exercise?\n  Finally, some have implied we are not doing anything for the victims \nin New York. This disaster happened September 11 and it is December 6 \nand we have not enacted legislation. Let me correct that. At least \ncompare it to what we did in Oklahoma City. We had a disaster in \nOklahoma City. It killed 169 people. That is not as bad as 3,000 or \n4,000 but it is still pretty bad.\n  What did we do? For New York City, by the end of the week or \nhopefully by the end of next week, we will pass legislation that will \nsay victims who were killed, their families will not have to pay any \ntax on income earned this year or the previous year. That is a benefit \npreserved primarily for the military. We will make that apply for the \npeople who were killed as a result of the September 11 disaster. We \nnever did that for the people in Oklahoma City 6 years ago, but we will \ndo it in this case, and I strongly support it. Very good. That is \npositive.\n  Some of the families, the survivors of families were lobbying for \nthat. I compliment them for that. We are going to deliver. That will be \nvalued assistance. They will get back all the taxes they paid last year \nand all the taxes they paid this year. That will happen soon. They will \nnot go through bureaucracy. That will happen. I am happy we can provide \nthat assistance.\n  We have also already passed a victim's compensation fund and we have \nappointed a special master. The Attorney General appointed a special \nmaster who is trying to come up with an adequate compensation system \nfor people\n\n[[Page S12525]]\n\nwho lost a family member as a result of the disaster. That moved \nquickly. We never did that in Oklahoma City. Some people estimate they \nwill receive large payments. I don't know. I think it has something to \ndo with how much compensation they receive or how much they will \nreceive from the insurance companies. That is very significant. \nCongress has already acted on that. Hopefully, checks will go out to \nthe families and those in need of assistance will get that quickly.\n  It would be shortsighted to say we are not taking care of families. I \nthink they have significant assistance through the Tax Code by this \nCongress, this year, and I think they will get something through the \nvictim's compensation fund which Congress has already enacted. That \nshould happen pretty quickly.\n  Congress has been moving. Maybe we don't move as fast as some think \nwe should, but that is pretty quick. What about rebuilding New York \nCity? Oklahoma City just had a dedication to rebuild the Murrah \nBuilding destroyed 6 years ago. They just had the groundbreaking today. \nAgain, everybody is wanting to move full speed ahead, but use a little \ncommon sense. Work with Governor Ridge. Let him have some input on what \nis needed. Let the President of the United States have some input on \nwhat is needed. Let's work together in a bipartisan fashion to figure \nout what is needed, not one party saying this is what we will insist \nupon. Let's work together. We did it for the initial $40 billion. I \nthink we can do it for the future. We can do it working with the \nadministration. It will not happen in this bill, trying to jam $15 \nbillion on the President, saying he will not sign it and we will \nsustain the veto. That will not happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on waiving the budget point of order. \nThe budget point of order is well made. Let us work today. When we \nwaive the budget, we should do it when we are working together. If we \nwaive the budget and say budget rules don't apply, do it when we are \nall on the same bandwagon, when we are working together, not for \npartisan advantage trying to make some look as if we don't care about \nNew York or care about fighting terrorism. That is false. Every Member \nserving, House and Senate, cares about New York and cares about \nfighting terrorism. I urge my colleagues to work together in a \nbipartisan fashion, work with the administration, work with Governor \nRidge to come up with something mutually acceptable that will provide \nthe Nation security and make sense economically and not break the bank \nat the same time.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Iowa and I yield 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we are talking about just another part \nof the defense of our country. If we think of what is happening in \nAfghanistan, if we found out our troops were ill-trained, that our \nradar was out of date, and they were short of ammunition, we would have \nhearings. We would call in the experts, we would listen to them, we \nwould find out how much they needed to make sure our troops were \ntrained, to make sure our radar worked, and to make sure they had \nenough ammunition, and we would supply it.\n  That is exactly what we did for this bill. We brought in the \nwitnesses. We heard from the experts. We asked: What do we need to \nprotect the people of this country in terms of a bioterrorist attack? \nThat fell under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee which I chair. \nSenator Specter and I had four hearings. Senator Stevens and Senator \nByrd attended those hearings. We had good testimony. What they came up \nwith was the expert judgment of what we needed to protect our people \nagainst a bioterrorist attack.\n  If I put it in military terms in terms of bioterrorism, our troops \nare ill-trained, our radar is out of date, and we don't have enough \nammunition. For example, we had testimony that we needed to get our \nsmall pox vaccine manufactured and deployed. This bill includes $829 \nmillion to do that. The substitute amendment would take that down by \n$267 million. We would cut local and State public health preparedness \nby over $650 million. This is our radar system. These are the people, \nif an attack happens, who will pick it up immediately and keep it from \nspreading. We had $1.15 billion. The amendment, the substitute, only \nhas $500 million. There are cuts for CDC for the lab capacity. These \nare things we need to protect our people.\n  We heard from the experts. We got their testimony. We made a judgment \ncall as to what was needed to protect us from a bioterrorist attack. We \nhad $3.9 billion--it was $3.3 billion for public health and $600 \nmillion in agriculture, for a total of $3.9. The substitute amendment \nonly leaves $2.3 billion.\n  Just as we would not want to shortchange our troops in the field \noverseas, we don't want to shortchange the troops we have at home. Our \npublic health officials, our local hospital administrators, the \nlaboratories, the manufacturers of the small pox vaccine, make sure \nthey have the equipment they need to protect our people.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the time remaining be divided 25 \nminutes to the Senator from West Virginia and 5 minutes to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to support the efforts of our \nchairman, Chairman Byrd, on an extraordinary package that recognizes \nthe reality we have to do more, not less, and we have to do it now to \nrespond to the issue of homeland defense.\n  A few weeks ago I met with my Governor and all the emergency \npreparedness officials in the State of Rhode Island. They have an \nexcellent plan. They have an idea of what they can do, what they must \ndo. They don't have the resources to do it. Time waits for no person. \nAnd if we waste this time when the crisis comes and a response is \nnecessary, the plans won't mean anything.\n  This funding is critical now. It is critical to protect our \npreparedness infrastructure to allow first responders with appropriate \nequipment, with radios that communicate with all the different \nagencies, to be in place--not on order. We have to move now, and we \nhave to move aggressively, and that is what the chairman has done. He \nhas carefully weighed conflicting demands for scarce resources, and he \nhas come up with a plan that covers the gamut of major responsibilities \nat the State level. We have to protect our infrastructure. We have to \nprotect our nuclear facilities. We have to ensure that all of our State \nagencies and Federal agencies and not-for-profit groups, such as the \nRed Cross, are coordinated.\n  Rhode Island is one of three or four States that have a plan that has \nbeen approved and accepted by the Federal Government. They know what to \ndo. But they would be the first to tell you, as they told me, they \ndon't have the resources to do the job. When the crisis comes, when an \nattack comes, we cannot satisfy our constituents simply by saying we \nhad a good plan. We have to be able to act. This money is necessary \nnow. I commend and thank the chairman for his great efforts, his \nleadership on those resources.\n  If I may, I request 1 more minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 1 more minute.\n  Mr. REED. I am particularly concerned, in terms of assisting local \ncommunities, that they have these resources now because it will signal, \nfirst, that the Federal Government is committed to supporting them now; \nsecond, it will leverage State dollars. We are approaching a situation \nwhere the States are under extreme fiscal distress. Without the \nfoundation of this Federal funding, I am very pessimistic that States \nwill come forward.\n  If it is not important for us, the Federal Government charged with \nprotection of our country, then how is it important to a State \nlegislature to appropriate funds this coming year, in the next few \nmonths? That is another reason I believe we have to act now. We have to \nact promptly.\n  In addition, we have to be able to support the efforts of the State \ngovernments to begin to take these plans and\n\n[[Page S12526]]\n\noperationalize them--to go and actually test these plans. Frankly, we \nwill not know the gaps until they go out and test it. This money could \nenable that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I strongly support the leadership and \ninitiatives of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia with regard \nto these issues on homeland defense.\n  There are so many powerful arguments that support this investment \nthat I think our society needs to make in the protection of our \ncommunities through the bioterrorism initiative, which puts money in \nState and local hands, money that will make a difference to make sure \nwe have the plans in place to really protect our people.\n  I live in New Jersey. We had a number of anthrax-related events in \nour Postal Service. We were not prepared, and the State ended up coming \nin and spending enormous amounts of money. It needs to be addressed \nnow. That is why the kind of program that Senator Byrd has put together \nis so important.\n  It is a good economic policy. We need to have confidence in our \nsociety right now. This is a statement to all of the people in this \ncountry that we take these issues seriously with regard to homeland \ndefense, whether it is from bioterrorist attacks or whether it is \nprotecting our nuclear plants, of which we have four in New Jersey. It \nis absolutely essential we send out these sure and certain statements \nthat we care.\n  It is good economic policy because it will stimulate our economy. We \ndo not want to get too far away from that. This is real expenditures \nthat will be out the door quickly.\n  Our States are desperately strapped, as the Senator from Rhode Island \nwas just saying. New Jersey has a $1.9 billion deficit in this fiscal \nyear, the one that ends June 30. They need resources to be able to be \neconomically sound in a tough economic environment.\n  It is inconceivable to me that we do not stand strong with New York \nCity and New York State at this period of time. I have seen the two \nSenators make their presentations today with regard to the devastation. \nThis is money not going to be available in the near term when the need \nis the greatest. We need to act. I have lived and worked in the \ncommunity around New York for 30 years. The desperation, the depression \nthat we have--in an economic and emotional context--is real. We need to \nsend these signals. That is what this is about. It will do much along \nthose lines.\n  I will be very parochial. This bill has meaningful elements in it for \nthe State of New Jersey--those parts of New Jersey, by the way, that \nare linked inextricably with New York City. There is $100 million for \nferry service, $81 million for law enforcement. Part of that, $34 \nmillion, is going to the State police in New Jersey. We have one boat \npatrolling the ports--one boat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CORZINE. For all these various reasons, I strongly support \nSenator Byrd's amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I shall use the remainder of our time \nand then the Senator from West Virginia, the chairman, shall close on \nthis motion.\n  I call to the attention of the Senate that the act of September 18 \nwas specific in the sense of dealing with $40 billion for the costs of:\n\n       . . . providing Federal, State and local preparedness for \n     mitigating and responding to the attacks . . . providing \n     support to counter, investigate, or prosecute domestic or \n     international terrorism . . . providing increased \n     transportation security . . . repairing public facilities and \n     transportation systems damaged by the attacks; and . . . \n     supporting national security.\n\n  Then it says:\n\n       Provided, That these funds may be transferred to any \n     authorized Federal Government activity to meet the purposes \n     of this Act.\n\n  It later specifically says:\n\n       . . . not less than one-half of the $40 billion shall be \n     for disaster recovery activities and assistance related to \n     the terrorist acts in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, \n     on September 11, as authorized by law. . . .\n\n  ``As authorized by law,'' the funds must go to Federal agencies for \nauthorized Federal activities.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment--and I think we are going to have to go \nthere sometime in the future--goes beyond this law. It goes beyond the \n$40 billion and makes $15 billion more available, and not all of it is \nchanneled through Federal activities.\n  Again, I do not argue with the intent. I think he is right. \nEventually we will have to do that. But for now, if we look at what my \namendment has done--and we are going to modify it to a certain extent, \nbased upon the comments of the Senator from West Virginia and the \nSenators from New York. No one is perfect about this. We are trying to \nallocate this money where it is needed within the $40 billion and \nfollow the existing law and authorization. The authorization for the \n$20 billion we are dealing with now is in the act of September 18. But \nfor that authorization, the whole amount would be subject to a point of \norder on the basis of emergency. But that emergency was declared on \nSeptember 18.\n  We are dealing with a concept of fulfilling that. Nothing we do \ntonight will alter the commitment to New York and Pennsylvania and \nVirginia that not less than $20 billion of the $40 billion is dedicated \nto Federal activities in support of recovery in those States. \nRespectfully, New Jersey was not included, I am sorry to say. They \nprobably are the beneficiary of some of the moneys that will be spent \nin recovering from the New York moneys that were guaranteed. I think we \nprobably should have included New Jersey in there on September 18, as a \nmatter of fact.\n  But I urge the Senate not to declare this emergency and not to \nsupport the waiver of the budget resolution that provides for such a \nprocedure of a point of order when the moneys exceed the amount of the \nbudget process. We had an agreement with the President. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia and I have done our absolute best to keep the \nagreement with the President. I think the Senator from West Virginia \nwill be the first to admit his $15 billion goes beyond the concept of \nthe rest, to which the rest of us were committed.\n  I hope to be here in the Chamber in March or April supporting the \nchairman, the Senator from West Virginia, and supporting the request of \nthe President of the United States for additional moneys to cover many \nof the targets of his amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, let me thank my friend, Senator Stevens, \nfor being the man that he is. He is a Senator. He is a first-class \nSenator. He lives up to his responsibilities under the Constitution. He \nreveres this institution. He lives up to his promises to his fellowman. \nI watched him the other day in the committee and how he said no. He is \na Senator who says no and does not lose respect in any way. He does not \nmake you angry. He almost makes you like him when he says no. He is a \nremarkable man. In this debate, he has given me much of his time. He \ndid the right thing. He offered to let me close the debate on my \nmotion. I could close the debate, but he offered it. I didn't have to \nfight for it.\n  Madam President, I thank my friend. Let me say this: No matter what \nthe outcome, Senator Stevens will always be my friend. I will not think \nless of him for his opposition. I will think more of him for the way he \nhas conducted himself. We have two Medal of Honor winners in this body, \nas far as I am concerned: Danny Inouye; and, although Ted Stevens \nhasn't formally been presented with such a medal, from me he gets one \nalso. I love him. There is a friend who walketh closer to a brother. \nAnd Ted Stevens is one who does that.\n  On November 8, President Bush addressed the Nation. In his remarks, \nthe President asked the American people for courage. He asked them for \nvigilance, for volunteerism, and for adherence to time-honored values. \nHe called upon them to carry on with their lives. He told them that \nthey had new responsibilities. He asked for their help in fighting this \nnew war on terrorism here at home.\n  I have no quarrel with many of the things which the President said. \nBut the first responsibility of any government is to protect the safety \nof its citizens. How can we ask our people to\n\n[[Page S12527]]\n\nshoulder new responsibilities to fight the war against terror, unless \nthis Government first lives up to its most basic duty--ensuring the \nsafety of our citizens on our own soil.\n  Ask those men in Afghanistan: How would you vote on this amendment? \nWould you vote to give the people back home the security that this \namendment provides to them? How would they vote? I have no doubt that a \ngreat majority of them would vote for this amendment. They are thinking \nof their loved ones back here, too, who might any day be subjected to a \nterrorism attack. Would they take the position, well, let them wait \nuntil the spring? Let them wait for the supplemental? How laughable \nthat is.\n  This Government must take positive, proactive steps right now to \nshore up our homeland. If we are all to become citizen soldiers here at \nhome, let us make sure that we provide those homeland soldiers with at \nleast a front line of defense. I am talking about protecting our \nairports; screening baggage and passengers thoroughly; protecting mass \ntransit; protecting rail service; guarding our ports; patrolling our \nnuclear power plants, dams, bridges; guarding chemical plants, food \nsuppliers, water supplies; protecting malls, and stadiums. If 911 \ntaught us anything, it taught us that we are vulnerable in hundreds of \nways. It taught us that the unthinkable is not only thinkable--it has \nhappened. We are totally derelict in our duties as public servants if \nwe learn nothing--take no real action--as a result of the horrific \nexperiences of September 11.\n  On November 8, the President's remarks were the classic call to \npublic service. ``Ask what you can do for your country'' was its \nrhetorical theme. And I applauded him. And while I have no problem with \nthose sentiments, and hope that they do inspire more of our people to \nservice and unselfish action, I think that we should all be aware that \nthe ground has shifted under us. The battleground is no longer just on \nsome distant shore in Afghanistan, it is in New York, Florida, \nPennsylvania, California, Washington--indeed anywhere in this great \nland. I think that the American people now have a right to ask their \ncountry what it can do for their safety.\n  Anthrax has turned up in our mail. Where is the massive effort to be \nsure that we can sanitize our mail for that threat?\n  I have received 12 letters from my constituents since those Twin \nTowers went down--12 letters I have received. My staff has been \nevacuated from the southeast corner of the Hart Building. What about \nthe people out there? What about their safety? What about my wife's \nsafety when she goes to the mailbox? My daughter, your daughter, his \ndaughter, think of them.\n  The Postmaster General has been told by this administration that he \nwill only get $175 million for equipment to sanitize mail. He needs at \nleast $1 billion even to begin. Whether the anthrax scare was homegrown \nor the work of madmen in other lands makes no difference. Poisoned mail \nposes a new threat to our people and we need to find ways to deal with \nmaking mail safe to handle and safe to receive.\n  Smallpox could be a devastating blow to this nation, and indeed to \nthe world, should some madman find a way to unleash its horror on an \nunsuspecting population. Yet, where is the massive effort to develop a \nsafe vaccine?\n  We need billions to combat this and other bioterrorism threats.\n  We need a commitment to improve our health care facilities--to train \npersonnel to deal with widespread diseases and panic. Especially in \nrural areas, there is next to no frontline of defense against such \nbioterrorism attacks. We are like children in the dark being asked to \nbe brave in the face of an enemy we cannot see, and whose actions we \ncannot predict, and with no ammunition forthcoming from a federal \ngovernment to which we all pay taxes. What better use of the tax dollar \nthan to protect our citizens as well as we can from the scourge of \nterrorists who have already killed thousands of Americans. We fail our \npeople and we fail them grossly if we do not do all we can to keep them \nsafe in their own beds. No volunteer effort can do that. No tax break \ncan do that. Only a strong Federal commitment from the government can \nhave any hope of success for such a massive and important task.\n  States will be in the frontline of any homeland defense effort, yet \nthe states are in severe financial difficulty. Four out of five states \nare sliding into or are in a recession, and state revenues are \nsuffering accordingly. Moreover many of the tax cuts in the House-\npassed stimulus bill would serve to rob states of the very revenues \nthey need at this time.\n  An October survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures \nrevealed that almost every state is experiencing revenue shortfalls. \nForty-three states and the District of Columbia now report that \nrevenues were below forecasted levels in the opening months of FY 2002. \nAt least 36 states have implemented or are considering budget cuts or \nholdbacks to address fiscal problems. Twenty-two states have \nimplemented belt-tightening measures that include hiring freezes, \ncapital project cancellations and travel restrictions. Six states have \nconvened in special sessions to address budget problems, and several \nothers are considering special sessions later this year or early next \nyear. Yet, we put more on them. We ask them for more.\n  How can we expect States in such shape to mount a frontline defense \nfor our people if the Federal Government does not help with additional \nmoneys dedicated to that cause? That is not just a rhetorical question. \nThe failure to respond may have real and disastrous consequences.\n  We all may cheer the victory in Afghanistan when it finally comes, \nand we may all breathe a little easier if bin Laden is caught, but we \ndare not forget that the bin Laden organization has branches in 60 \ncountries. They are here in the United States. They are cunning. They \nare organized, as we have so painfully learned.\n  Yet there is opposition to the moneys to beef up the computer \ncapabilities of the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nand the Bureau of Customs--all agencies charged with monitoring the \npeople and goods which come over our borders or for tracking down \nterrorists once they get here.\n  In short, there has been plenty of lip service paid to homeland \nsecurity, but talk is much cheaper than a Federal funding commitment. \nAnd while it is fine to lift spirits, it is not enough. It is essential \nto dedicate funding to protect entities most vulnerable to terrorist \nattacks.\n  Madam President, we have been sent a horrific message. We have \nawakened with a start. We have suffered bad dreams. Yes, we have \nsuffered nightmares. We have awakened, as I say, with a start. But we \ndare not return to our slumber. We dare not let our concentration wane \nand our attention wander. We will not be safer as a nation than we were \non September 10, if we do not use the lessons that we have learned to \nmake us stronger now. We will be just as unprepared the next time, God \nforbid, and it will be the fault of this Government and its \ncomplacency. Issuing terrorism alerts is no substitute for taking real \naction that we know can help minimize the threats.\n  So I plead with my colleagues to support this package which is \nintended to make our people safer and more confident. It is not a \npackage which divides Americans. It is not a proposal that pits the \nrich against the poor or corporations against working people. It is a \nprogram for the safety of all Americans. It is something Democrats and \nRepublicans can do together for our people. There should be no aisle \nseparation here. It can change the tone in Washington by promoting \nunity among elected leaders. We can come together for the benefit of \nevery man, woman and child in this Nation. We can improve the climate \nof fear which is troubling our people and hurting our economy. There is \nno partisanship--no partianship--in homeland security. It is our solemn \nduty. And anyone who was living in this country on September 11 knows \ndeep in their heart that we had better start to do something now.\n  Madam President, I am already at the beginning of my 85th year. I \nhave seen wars and depressions and natural disasters of huge \nproportions. Always, Madam President, always we have had leadership \nthat acted quickly to protect America and her people. Now we are faced \nwith perhaps the most dangerous threat that we have ever faced--\n\n[[Page S12528]]\n\nterrorists on our own soil. Terrorist cells in more than 60 countries \nin this world; terrorists plotting right now--right tonight; while we \nsleep, they will be plotting; plotting right now--the next attempt to \nkill massive numbers of innocent people.\n  I do not want to stand on this floor after the next terrible attack \nand say to my colleagues, ``We should have acted sooner. We might have \nsaved lives.'' None of us want that on our conscience. We can act now. \nWe can do all that we can right now to ``promote the common defense.'' \nLet us not wait. Let us not give bin Laden more time. Let us not hew to \nthe party line so closely that we sacrifice the safety of our people.\n  The White House pulled out all stops today in the effort on behalf of \nthe legislation that has been given the name of: promote trade \nsecurity. It is fast track--fast track. And I cannot reconcile what I \nseem to see: an administration that says, give me fast track, an \nadministration that says, no, but slow down when it comes to providing \nmoney for homeland defense; slow down there but give me fast track on \ntrade legislation.\n  We must not go home, Madam President, without doing something to ward \noff what could be another tragedy of major proportions. I do not \nunderstand how any Member of this body could sleep if we fail to take \nthis critical step for the protection of the people who sent us to the \nSenate.\n  I have been around here so many years, and I have seen so many \nthings. I have seen disasters. And never have I voted against any State \nthat came here needing help from the Federal Government in the face of \ndisaster. I have never turned my back on any State.\n  And I could go down the list: Texas, $1.090 billion for Tropical \nStorm Allison--$452 million in 2001, including emergency funding in the \nfiscal year 2002 VA-HUD bill--and Hurricane Bret in 1999, and damages \nfrom severe storms, flooding, hail, and tornadoes.\n  I have a list that I will not take the time--and I do not have the \ntime--to read. I have a list of disasters that have occurred, and a \nlist of responses by the Appropriations Committees of the Congress in \nhelping the people who were suffering from those disasters. I ask \nunanimous consent to have that printed at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I do not understand how any Member of this \nbody could sleep if we fail to take this critical step for the \nprotection of the people who sent us here.\n  Have we become so cynical that we cannot even do that? Are we so \ninsensitive that we would rather embrace the cold illogic of budget \ndeals than face our duty to ease the palpable fear in this Nation? I \nhope not. For if that is so, we have failed this Nation at its most \ncritical hour. That is not the Senate I know. That is not the Senate to \nwhich I have given most of my life.

Madam President, with great pleasure, I belatedly wish the \nhappiest of birthdays to the senior Senator from South Carolina. It was \n99 years ago yesterday that Strom Thrumond was born in Edgefield, SC.\n  Ninety-nine years old, what a feat. that makes him old enough to be \nmy big brother!\n  When he was born, December 5, 1902, the Wright brothers had not yet \nmade their historic flight at Kitty Hawk. He has lived to see men \nwalking on the Moon and American space vessels exploring the far \nreaches of our galaxy.\n  When he was born. Theodore Roosevelt was President of the United \nStates. Since then we have had 16 more Presidents.\n  When he was born, the Kaiser still ruled in Germany. Since then, that \ncountry has seen the rise and fall of the Weimar Republic, the rise and \nfall of Nazi Germany, a divided Germany, and now a united Germany.\n  When he was born, the Czar still ruled in Russia. Since then, that \ncountry has experienced the Russian Revolution, the Bolshevist \ngovernment, the Communist government, the Soviet empire, and now Russia \nagain.\n  Almost as intriguing has been the extraordinary career of our \nremarkable colleague. During the same time period, he has been a \nteacher, an athletic coach, an educational administrator, a lawyer, a \nstate legislator, and a circuit court judge.\n  He won his first elective office, County Superintendent, the same \nyear that Herbert Hoover won his first elective office, 1928. He was a \nsoldier in World War II, where he took part in the D-Day invasion of \nNormandy. He was a presidential nominee in 1948 and the governor of his \nbeloved State of South Carolina from 1947 to 1951. He has been a \nDemocrat, a Dixiecrat, and a Republican. Most of all he is a great \nAmerican.\n  All of this would have been more than enough experiences and \nachievements in one lifetime for most mortals. But, incredibly, Strom \nThrumond's greatest days were still ahead of him.\n  In 1954, he won his first election to the U.S. Senate as a write-in \ncandidate--making him the only person in history to be elected to the \nSenate as a write-in candidate. He has now become the longest-serving \nSenator in history, and the oldest person ever to have served in the \nSenate.\n  But it is more than longevity that has made Strom Thurmond an \nextraordinary Senator. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has fought \nfor a stronger military to keep our country free, and he has fought for \ntougher anti-crime laws to make our streets safer. As President pro \ntempore of the Senate, he brought dignity, style, and a southern \nrefinement to this important position.\n  For these and other achievements, he has had high schools, state and \nfederal buildings, as well as streets, dams, and town squares named in \nhis honor. A few years ago (1991), the Senate designated room S-238 \nhere in the U.S. Capitol as the ``Strom Thurmond Room'' ``in \nrecognition of the selfless and dedicated service'' that he has \n``provided . . . to our Nation and its people.''\n  On this, his 99th birthday, I wish to say what a privilege and an \nhonor it has been to have served with this remarkable man for all these \nyears.\n  He has always been an outstanding legislator, a Southern gentleman, \nand foremost, a good and dear friend.\n  Happy birthday, Senator. God Bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12529-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12529-S12530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF LARRY HICKS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, every Member of the United States Senate \nshould be grateful for the hard work that Chairman Leahy and the entire \nJudiciary Committee have exhibited in an effort to move judicial \nnominations forward as quickly as possible.\n  Even under the most extraordinary of circumstances, Chairman Leahy \nhas moved forward in a reasonable and timely fashion.\n  In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, Chairman \nLeahy spearheaded legislation through the Judiciary Committee that will \nprovide our law enforcement agencies with the necessary tools to \nprovide homeland security while at the same time protecting our most \ncherished civil liberties.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee and its Members were also forced to \nendure a lengthy closure of its committee room and office space as a \nresult of the anthrax-laced letter that was sent to Majority Leader Tom \nDaschle's Hart Senate Office.\n  Yet Chairman Leahy and the Senate Judiciary Committee persevered.\n  They even approached the distinguished Chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee and asked his permission to hold a hearing on \njudicial nominations in the Committee's historic conference room in the \nCapitol.\n  I attended that hearing in support of the nomination of Larry Hicks, \nof Reno, to be the next Judge on the United States District Court for \nthe District of Nevada.\n  Larry Hicks is currently a partner in the Reno law firm of McDonald, \nCarano, Wilson, McCune, Bergin, Frankovich & Hicks.\n  The Chairman of the litigation section, Larry has been with the firm \nsince 1979.\n  He has extensive trial court, appellate court and settlement \nexperience, having served as a settlement judge since 1998 for the \nNevada Supreme Court.\n  Larry is also admitted to practice in all State and Federal courts of \nthe State of Nevada, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \nand the United States Supreme Court.\n  Prior to his private practice, Larry served the people of Northern \nNevada for 11 years in the Office of the Washoe County District \nAttorney.\n  In 1975, he was elected District Attorney of Washoe County.\n  Larry received his undergraduate degree from the University of Nevada \nin\n\n[[Page S12530]]\n\nReno and received his law degree from the University of Colorado School \nof Law in Boulder.\n  He has also received numerous awards and recognition from a variety \nof organizations, including the Nevada State Bar, where he has served \non the Board of Governors, and as President, the American Bar \nAssociation, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America and the \nInternational Association of Gaming Attorneys.\n  Larry and his wife Marianne have been blessed with a beautiful \nfamily. They are the proud parents of three children, Carrie, Amy and \nChristopher, all of whom are graduates of the University of Nevada in \nReno.\n  He is a fine man, a fine Nevadan, and I am sure that he will be a \nfine judge.\n  I would also like to take a moment to commend my friend and colleague \nfrom Nevada, Senator John Ensign.\n  Senator Ensign and I have discussed every candidate that he has \nrecommended to President Bush, and I fully support his selections.\n  It has truly been a bipartisan approach with respect to the federal \nbench in Nevada, and I am so pleased that the Senate will soon vote to \nconfirm Larry Hicks to be the next Judge on the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12530-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMEMORATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the \nselfless men and women who sacrificed so much to protect freedom during \nthe December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. On that fateful day, 2,403 \nmembers of the Armed Forces lost their lives defending freedom. I \nsalute the New Mexicans who were caught in that attack, and those who \nsubsequently answered the call of their grateful nation to bear arms in \nits defense.\n  Sixty years ago, the unwarranted attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy \nand Air Force on Pearl Harbor challenged the peace and well-being of \nthis great Nation. However, the attack served as a catalyst, unifying \nthis Nation and galvanizing the bravery of our people. With enormous \nself sacrifice and unbound patriotism, the ``greatest generation,'' \nthose who lived and served during the Second World War, rose up to meet \nthe challenge and overcame adversity.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, this country is once again dealing \nwith an unwarranted attack on our homeland and our freedom. As America \ncommemorates the 60th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, we \nappreciate more than ever before the heroes of the past. The American \npeople look to that generation's courage and heroism to find solace and \ninspiration for meeting the threats we face today. As Americans then \nused every avenue available--defense programs, universities and \nresearch institutions, the national laboratories, and an energized \npublic--to win World War II, so too, must we be just as resourceful in \nfighting the war on terror.\n  Today, just as then, our national laboratories play a vital role in \nthe fight against terrorism. In my home State of New Mexico, the \nlaboratories are contributing to help ensure domestic preparedness and \nsecurity.\n  The anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor reminds us of those who \npaid the ultimate price to protect our Nation, even as brave Americans \nare paying that price today in the war on terror. I am honored to pay \ntribute to those who served, and are serving, in the defense of this \ngreat Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12530-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONFERENCE REPORT TO H.R. 2944, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS \n                        ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to offer for the Record the \nBudget Committee's official scoring on the conference report to H.R. \n2944, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The conference report provides $408 million in discretionary budget \nauthority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $370 million. \nWhen outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the conference report total $418 million in \n2002. By comparison, the Senate passed bill included $408 million for \nthe District, which would have increased total outlays by $416 million \nin 2002. The conference report is at the subcommittee's Section 302(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays. It does not include \nany emergency-designated funding. In addition to the Federal funds, the \nconference report to H.R. 2944 also approves the District government's \nbudget for 2002, including granting it the authority to spend $7.154 \nbillion of local funds.\n  It is important that the Congress complete its work on the remaining \nappropriations bills for 2002. In the case of this report, H.R. 2944 \nnot only provides a limited amount of Federal funding to the District, \nbut also, through the enactment of its budget, allows the city to \nobligate and spend its own local revenues.

Madam President, I rise today to address an unfortunate \nsituation that has come to my attention concerning the United States \nCivil Rights Commission. One might even say that it is unbelievable.\n  There is no one in this body that has greater appreciation for the \nwork and history of the United States Civil Rights Commission than I \ndo, and for the need of having a body such as this that can review \nissues that may arise in the area of civil rights without the taint of \npartisanship or ideologies. It is comforting to know that there is such \na body that gathers disinterested public servants of unimpeachable \nintegrity with a passion for the great work of securing the freedoms \nwhich belong to all citizens, without discrimination.\n  As you know, the Congress has taken a great interest in the \nappointment of the Commission's eight members. In fact, four of the \neight are appointed by the Congress, two by the Senate and two by the \nHouse. The President appoints the other four. In each case, whether \nappointed by the President or by the Congress, the Commission must have \nan equal number of Commissioners from each party.\n  It appears that there is a controversy brewing as to when the term of \na Commissioner expires. I believe that this controversy could do severe \nharm to the reputation of the Civil Rights Commission and the trust \nthat is placed in it by the American people. I hope that this is a \nmatter that will have an immediate resolution.\n  Apparently, one of the presidential appointees of the previous \nadministration, Victoria Wilson, is refusing to accept the expiration \nof her term. Ms.\n\n[[Page S12531]]\n\nWilson claims that she was appointed for a six-year term, although it \nappears that President Clinton expressly appointed her for only one \nyear to complete the unexpired term of Judge Leon Higgenbotham, who \ndied before his term expired. It appears also that the Chairwoman of \nthe Committee, Mary Frances Berry, has told the White House that she \nrefuses to recognize the President's new appointee, a person, by the \nway, of impeccable credentials who is an attorney with a distinguished \ncareer. Chairwoman Berry has indicated that it would take federal \nmarshals to seat the President's appointee when the Commission next \nmeets.\n  As if the American people did not have enough drama in their lives, \nwe hardly need something like this to further erode the public's \nconfidence in the Civil Rights Commission. I think many of us are \nalready concerned with the work of the Commission in recent years. They \nhave taken on rather partisan issues, or at very least they have \nprosecuted issues in what often appears to be partisan ways, and \narguably injudicious ways. I will not get into these concerns, but I am \nafraid that the Commission is doing great harm to the trust of the \nAmerican people.\n\n  Rather, I would like to comment on the current situation, which is a \nmatter of existing law. What is especially troubling is that it appears \nthat Chairwoman Berry and Ms. Wilson are refusing to comply with the \nlegal opinion of the White House Counsel, Judge Gonzales, as well as \nthe independent opinion of the Justice Department.\n  In 1994 Congress amended the provisions governing the appointment of \nthe Civil Rights Commissioners. Congress' intent was to ensure that the \nterms of the Commissioners would not expire all at once. We made \nprovision for staggered terms for the Commissioners, adopting what is \nuniversally deemed good practice in the private corporate and nonprofit \narenas. Staggered terms preserve institutional memory and experience. \nTo have staggered terms requires that an appointee named to fill an \nunexpired term serve for only the remainder of that term. To do \notherwise would completely eviscerate the staggering that Congress \nintended. The argument that Ms. Wilson, and Chairman Berry, is making--\nthat all appointments, and Ms. Wilson's appointment in particular, are \nalways for terms of six years--would create the untenable opportunity \nfor mischief if Commissioners were to resign at the end of a particular \nadministration. Commissioners could resign as a group, allowing a \ndeparting Administration to fill several seats for six year terms, and \ndenying the incoming administration the right to name any \nCommissioners.\n  This argument, not only makes no sense, but I am also afraid that \nthis sort of confrontational approach does very real harm to the \nreputation of the Commission and its individual members who the \nAmerican people expect to be disinterested, apolitical public servants. \nI invite my colleagues to urge the immediate resolution of this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Judge Gonzales' letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, December 5, 2001.\n     The Hon. Mary Frances Berry,\n     Commission on Civil Rights, 624 Ninth Street, NW., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: I am writing to confirm our \n     conversation yesterday about the recent expiration of \n     Commissioner Victoria Wilson's term of service on the U.S. \n     Commission on Civil Rights and the President's forthcoming \n     appointment of her replacement.\n       As we discussed, Ms. Wilson was appointed to the Commission \n     on January 13, 2000. Official White House records and Ms. \n     Wilson's commission issued by President Clinton, which \n     explicitly states that she was appointed by President Clinton \n     to fill the unexpired term of the late Judge Leon \n     Higginbotham, document that Ms. Wilson's term ended November \n     29, 2001. To be sure, in our conversation you stated that, \n     when Ms. Wilson received her commission, she attempted to \n     contact the White House Clerk to ask that her commission be \n     reissued to provide for the six year term she is now \n     claiming. However, the Clerk has no record of any such \n     request. In any event, the commission was never reissued, a \n     fact that can only be viewed as confirming the conclusion \n     that Ms. Wilson's term expired on November 29, 2001 in \n     accordance with her commission.\n       The Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice \n     has issued a legal opinion confirming that Ms. Wilson's term \n     expired on November 29, 2001. The opinion rests on an \n     analysis of the Commission's organic statute, in particular \n     the intent of Congress expressed therein to provide for \n     staggered terms of commissioners. The legislative history of \n     the 1994 amendments to the statute also makes plain that \n     Congress intended to preserve the system of staggered terms. \n     As you yourself noted in 1983 in testimony before Congress, \n     the staggered terms system was proposed by commission members \n     to limit the degree of political influence over the \n     commission. H.R. 98-197, 1983 U.S.C.A.A.N. 1989, 1992. Of \n     course, the orderly staggering of terms intended by Congress \n     would be frustrated if vacancies created through death or \n     resignation could be filled with commissioners appointed for \n     new six year terms. Ultimately, the balance between \n     continuity and change sought by Congress in allowing a fixed \n     number of new members to be appointed at regular intervals \n     would give way to a process in which Presidents and \n     commissioners alike could ``game the system'' by timing \n     resignations and appointments.\n       In our conversation yesterday, I explained the legal \n     position of the White House and the Department of Justice. I \n     also explained, that President Bush has selected an \n     individual--Peter Kirsanow--whom he intends to appoint to \n     succeed Ms. Wilson. Mr. Kirsanow is an extraordinarily well-\n     qualified individual. He is a partner with a major Cleveland \n     law firm and has served as chair of the Center for New Black \n     Leadership and as labor counsel for the City of Cleveland. \n     Because there is a vacancy on the Commission, the President \n     intends to appoint Mr. Kirsanow as a commissioner as soon as \n     possible.\n       You maintained, however, that you support Ms. Wilson in her \n     decision to purport not to vacate her position and to \n     continue service and to attend the Commission's upcoming \n     meeting on December 7. Moreover, you informed me that you do \n     not consider yourself to be bound by opinions of the \n     Department of Justice nor do you intend to abide by them or \n     to follow the directives of the President in this matter. You \n     further informed me that you will refuse to administer the \n     oath of office to the President's appointee. I advised you \n     that any federal official authorized to administer oaths \n     generally could swear in Mr. Kirsanow.\n       Finally, you stated that, even if Ms. Wilson's successor \n     has been lawfully appointed and has taken the oath of office, \n     you will refuse to allow him to be seated at the Commission's \n     next meeting. You went so far as to state that it would \n     require the presence of federal Marshals to seat him.\n       I respectfully urge you to abandon this confrontational and \n     legally untenable position. As to questions regarding Ms. \n     Wilson's status, we view these as a matter between Ms. Wilson \n     and the White House. With respect to Mr. Kirsanow, any \n     actions blocking him from entering service following a valid \n     appointment would, in my opinion, violate the law. The \n     President expects his appointee to take office upon taking \n     the oath and to attend upcoming meetings as a duly appointed \n     commissioner. The President also expects all sworn officers \n     of the United States government to follow the law.\n       In sum, the law and official documents make clear that Ms. \n     Wilson's term expired last week, November 29, 2001, and that \n     she is no longer a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil \n     Rights. As soon as Mr. Kirsanow takes the statutory oath, the \n     incumbent commissioners and staff should treat the \n     President's new appointee as a full member of the Commission.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Counsel to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12531-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12531-S12532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONFIRMATION OF JOHN WALTERS AS DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG \n                             CONTROL POLICY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to congratulate John Walters, the \nnew Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, on his \nconfirmation by the Senate last night. I have no doubt that the hard \nwork and experience he brings to the Office will greatly benefit our \nefforts to reduce drug abuse in our nation.\n  I do wish he could have been confirmed much earlier, considering the \nchallenges we face at home and overseas. In the last eight years alone, \nteenage drug use has almost doubled and, as I speak, terrorists, \nincluding those we are fighting in Afghanistan and across the globe, \nare using the drug trade to help finance their operations.\n  President Bush nominated John Walters in early June, but he was not \ngranted a hearing until October 10. Finally, on November 8 and five \nmonths after his nomination, John Walters was favorably voted out of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, 14 to 5, with five Democrats joining \nall the Republicans in support of his confirmation. Seven months to be \nconfirmed is not a credit to the workings of the Senate.\n  It was disappointing that, of the small number of activists opposed \nto\n\n[[Page S12532]]\n\nthe nomination of John Walters, a few carried on a campaign to distort \nhis public policy positions. Americans would not have known if they \njust listened to these activists that John Walters believes that many \nfirst-time, non-violent offenders ought to be diverted into treatment. \nIn fact, when he was deputy drug czar in the first Bush Administration \nunder William Bennett, he helped secure increases in the drug treatment \nbudget in four years that were double what the previous administration \nmanaged in eight. And it's also noteworthy that the previous \nadministration enforced the very same anti-drug laws that some of John \nWalters' opponents today criticize, and the same administration made no \neffort to change them.\n  I look forward to working with John Walters and hope his needlessly \nprotracted nomination process will not discourage other outstanding \nAmericans from considering public service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12532-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OUR CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, let me begin by saying plainly and \nunabashedly that I love our flag. I wear an American flag lapel pin to \nwork every single day. We fly ``Old Glory'' at our home throughout the \nyear and display it proudly in each of my Senate offices. The American \nflag is even displayed on the minivan that I drive all over our State. \nIt is the symbol of our freedom and a reflection of our pride in our \ngreat Nation.\n  But while our flag is the symbol of our freedom, our Nation's \nConstitution is its guarantee. It is the foundation on which was built \nthe longest living experiment in democracy in the history of the world. \nThough written by man, I believe it to be divinely inspired. Before \nbeginning 23 years of service as a naval flight officer, I took the \nsame oath as each of the men and women now fighting overseas. We swore \nto protect our Nation's safety and honor and defend our Constitution \nagainst all enemies both foreign and domestic. The men and women of our \narmed forces past and present each pledged to lay down their lives in \ndefense of the freedoms our Constitution provides. I can think of no \ngreater honor, no more solemn a commitment, than this pledge.\n  On a cold December 7, 214 years ago, Delawareans stood proudly and \ndeclared their belief in the right of self-government by becoming the \nfirst to ratify the United States Constitution. Each year we celebrate \nthis act of leadership, courage, and wisdom. While our constitution has \nproved the most durable model for democracy, at the time, it was a \nrevolutionary and some thought risky step forward. For the power of its \nwords and the brilliance of its logic is matched only by the astounding \nscope of what it sought to achieve, to ``establish Justice, insure \ndomestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \ngeneral Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and \nour Posterity.''\n  It was truly a miraculous undertaking, and we celebrate that Delaware \nhad the courage to lead the world in embracing this new standard \nexcellence in self-government.\n  But as we reflect on this bold step towards freedom, there is a stain \non our celebration.\n  After the Constitution's ratification, the Bill of Rights sought to \nprovide greater and more lasting liberties than any single document \nbefore or since. In 1789, the Federal Government sent the articles that \nwould make up the Bill of Rights to States for ratification. While \nother States sent their approval of ratification back to the Federal \nGovernment on separate parchment, in their enthusiasm, Delaware's \nleaders signed their approval directly on their copy of the document \nand returned it to the Federal Government. While other states are now \nable to display their copies of the original Bill of Rights, Delaware's \nis locked in a drawer in the National Archives near College Park, \nMaryland. Our State and this document deserve better. I call today on \nthe National Archives to return this copy of the Bill of Rights to its \nplace of ratification. I ask that in the spirit of celebration \nsurrounding Delaware Day, the National Archives return to us this \nimportant part of our State's history.\n  We are witnessing a time of renewed respect for our Nation at home \nand abroad. In fact, in all of my life, I've never witnessed a warmer \nembrace of our flag or a greater sense of pride for our country than \nwe've seen since September 11. Almost everywhere we turn, we see signs \nof this renewed national pride on our homes, office buildings, \nfactories, schools, construction sites, on the vehicles we drive, and \nas well at thousands of sporting events, parades and gatherings across \nour country. A spirit of patriotism has swept across our Nation in a \nway that I've never seen. It is both comforting and inspiring to me \nand, I know, to Americans everywhere.\n  This December, let us pause in thanks to those wise Delawareans who \nstarted our Nation along the road to becoming the most successful and \nlong-lasting democracy in world history. They gave us a great gift for \nwhich we, and much of the world, will be forever thankful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12532-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BRADY ACT SUCCESSES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, November 30 was the eighth anniversary of \nthe signing of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The passage \nof that legislation was a watershed event in the fight against gun \nviolence. According to the Centers for Disease Control statistics cited \nby the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, since the Brady Law went \ninto effect, the number of gun deaths in the United States has dropped \n27 percent, from 39,595 in 1993 to 28,874 in 1999. Even more \ndramatically, the number of gun homicides dropped by more than 40 \npercent from 18,253 in 1993 to 10,828 in 1999.\n  While the Brady Law is not the only reason for the decrease, its \nimpact on gun violence cannot be overlooked. Keeping guns out of \ncriminal hands saves lives. The law's requirement that gun purchasers \nundergo a criminal background check before they can buy a firearm has \nstopped literally hundreds of thousands of criminals and others \nprohibited by law from purchasing a gun.\n  The obvious success of the Brady Law should spur us to do more to \nstop gun violence. A logical step would be to extend the Brady Law's \nmandatory criminal background check provisions. As it stands, the law \nonly applies to guns sold by Federal firearms licensees. It does not \ncover gun sales by unlicensed private sellers at gun shows. Despite the \nevidence that background checks save lives, lobbyists from the National \nRifle Association and their allies have fought against legislation to \nclose the ``gun show loophole.'' The Senate should not allow itself to \nbe held hostage by the gun lobby. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting efforts to bring legislation to the floor to close the gun \nshow loophole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12532-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12532-S12533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHANGES TO H.

The Terrorist Victim Citizenship Relief Act is designed \nto provide relief to families that face potential deportation and other \ndifficulties because of the death of their primary visa holder on \nSeptember 11. It would enable them to address many of the daunting \nissues by conferring United States citizenship upon them.\n  I want to thank Senator Corzine for introducing this legislation and \nam pleased to be a cosponsor of it. I urge my fellow Senators to join \nin support of this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12533-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12533-S12534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE CONTINUING NEED FOR FISCAL DISCIPLINE\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, 2001 has been a year of tragedy for \nthe United States as well as a year of resolve. I am proud of the way \nmy fellow Americans have united behind efforts to heal and comfort \ntheir fellow citizens who have been devastated by the attacks of \nSeptember 11.\n  Just as the American people have opened their wallets to provide \nhundreds of millions of dollars to those in need, the Federal \nGovernment so too has provided billions of dollars to make our homeland \nsafe, rebuild, comfort and provide, and wage war against the terrorist \nenemies of freedom.\n  Protecting our homeland and fighting terrorism are our Nation's top \npriorities right now, and the work of this body and the use of our \nNation's resources must reflect that.\n  One critical way we do that is to vigilantly guard against the misuse \nof the taxpayer's hard-earned dollars and ensure that we get the most \nout of every dollar spent on homeland defense and the war on terrorism. \nThose who seek to use the current crisis as an excuse to spend more on \npet projects should be ashamed of themselves and their efforts must be \ndefeated. We simply cannot afford pork barrel politics right now, \nperiod.\n  Just look how quickly things have changed in our country--with \namazing speed we went from an environment where some of us were worried \nthe government would run out of national debt to repay, to an \nenvironment where not only is the Federal Government no longer paying \noff debt, but regrettably, it is adding to it.\n  The year started out with the President proposing a budget with a \nroughly 4 percent increase in discretionary spending. Given last year's \nenormous 14.5 percent increase in non-defense discretionary spending, I \nthought a 4 percent increase was reasonable and realistic, and I was \npleasantly surprised that the Senate budget resolution didn't \ndramatically exceed this figure, as I feared, but instead was largely \nin-line with the President's budget plan. Because of this, I supported \nthe $661 billion in discretionary spending it contained.\n  Besides supporting the budget resolution, I also supported the \nPresident's tax cut, because I saw it fit within a plan whereby \nspending increases would be limited and the Social Security surplus \nwould be reserved for reducing the national debt. Clearly the situation \nhas changed.\n  Even before the events of September 11, Congress was on-track to \nincrease overall discretionary spending by approximately 8 percent. To \nfacilitate the completion of the annual appropriations process, a deal \nwas struck by the Administration and the members of the appropriations \ncommittee to set a discretionary spending cap of $686 billion in fiscal \nyear 2002--$25 billion more than agreed to in the budget resolution.\n  This number was agreed to by the appropriators and leaders in both \nparties in both Houses, and the President. In the President's letter to \nthe leaders agreeing to this new, revised number he wrote, ``And I \nexpect that all parties will now proceed expeditiously and in full \ncompliance with the agreement.''\n  While I was disappointed that this deal circumvented the budget \nresolution, I believe it quite likely would have been worse if no deal \nhad been struck, and Congress had been able to steam roll the budget \nresolution in the urge to spend. Now Congress is poised to leave this \nnumber and this agreement in the dust as appropriators seek billions \nmore.\n  Some justify this by saying that the current crisis requires the \ndeath of fiscal discipline. Nothing is further from the truth. The \ncurrent crisis requires us to be more fiscally disciplined than ever \nbefore, to carefully direct funds to the most pressing needs of \ndefending against and fighting terrorism.\n  Compounding the problem is the softening economy and the need to walk \nthe tightrope of crafting a stimulus package to provide short-term \nrelief without causing long-term harm.\n  We are certainly in a grave fiscal situation. Spending is required \nbut not too much, stimulus is required but it cannot be overly zealous. \nIf we fall from this tightrope, there is no safety net to catch us. \nInstead our Nation falls into the grasping arms of structural deficits, \nfrom which we only recently freed ourselves after decades of \nimprisonment.\n  After working so hard to free ourselves from deficit spending, \nstarting to pay off our debt, and beginning to prepare for Social \nSecurity's looming insolvency, isn't it worth it for us to do all we \ncan to keep from slipping back into the clutches of deficits?\n  The only way to avoid this is through self-discipline. Every member \nmust sacrifice individual political wants for the greater good of the \nnation. We need to avoid pet projects. We need to set aside our \nparochial interests.\n  We should proceed very carefully and very deliberately with every \npiece of legislation that authorizes any additional spending or equally \nimportantly, reduces revenues. Unless we get a handle on our spending \nhabits, we are going to add to the national debt that\n\n[[Page S12534]]\n\nwe stand to pass on to our children and grandchildren.\n  Sometimes I wonder if my colleagues actually realize how dire the \ncondition of the Federal Government has become. As it now stands, for \nfiscal year 2002, we are poised to spend every last tax dollar we \ncollect and the entire $174 billion projected Social Security surplus. \nOn top of that, we are going to issue new debt to the tune of $52 \nbillion to pay for the fiscal stimulus bill and another $15 billion on \ntop of that if the senior Senator from West Virginia gets his way.\n  OMB Director Mitch Daniels, in a speech last week before the National \nPress Club, relayed the same sobering message. According to Director \nDaniels, the Federal Government is on track to run a deficit through \nthe remainder of this presidential term.\n  So, as we discuss every piece of legislation that will cost money or \nreduce revenues, whether on efforts to fight terrorism or anything else \nwe do, we must ask ourselves: Do these new spending initiatives warrant \nissuing new debt to pay for them?\n  With this in mind, I am utterly amazed that some of my colleagues are \nproposing new spending.\n  For example, the Agriculture Committee is proposing a new farm bill \nthat would increase agricultural spending by roughly $70 billion over \nthe next 10 years. I ask my colleagues, should we issue new federal \ndebt to increase payments to farmers?\n  Wasn't the Freedom to Farm bill designed to free farmers from \ndependency upon federal handouts so they could farm as they wished in \nresponse to international market conditions? Would the farming \ncommunity support these proposals if they knew that we were going to \nhave to issue debt to provide such payments? We're poised to debate a \nfarm bill yet the old farm programs don't even expire until next year. \nIs this money and this bill the most critical thing we should be doing \nat this time?\n  Other colleagues of mine today are proposing additional spending \nincreases over and above the $686 billion agreed to with the President \nearlier this Fall, and the $40 billion emergency supplemental passed in \nthe aftermath of September 11; $20 billion of which is included in this \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill. They think the Federal \nGovernment needs to spend an additional $15 billion on homeland \nsecurity.\n  The fact of the matter is the Director of Homeland Security, Governor \nTom Ridge, says we don't need any more funds for homeland defense at \nthis time than the amount requested by the President because of what \nwe've already passed here on Capitol Hill. Why are we unwilling to take \nhis word on this issue? It seems to me that he and the President, our \nCommander in Chief, are more qualified to advise us on what the nation \nneeds and we should heed their advice.\n  Other colleagues are considering increasing education spending by \nbillions of dollars over and above the already large increases agreed \nto by the President and the Appropriations Committee. Again, I ask, \nshould we issue new federal debt to increase education spending--which \nas we all know has been, is, and should be primarily a state and local \nresponsibility?\n  I am flabbergasted to watch this parade of spending proposals at a \ntime when we have to dig ourselves deeper in debt to pay for them.\n  I am encouraged that the President has taken a stand by pledging to \nveto an emergency supplemental spending measure that would exceed the \n$686 billion spending agreement. I stand squarely behind the President.\n  And if the President indeed uses his veto to control spending, I will \nvote against any attempt to override it. Hopefully my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle who care about fiscal responsibility and who \ncare about honoring an agreement we made with the President will join \nme in supporting his veto. It is fortunate we have a President with the \ncourage to hold fast against rampant spending, even if that spending is \ncloaked in the guise of homeland safety and national defense. The \nAdministration recognizes that we have to draw a line and is willing to \nlay it on the line.\n  The Senate is supposed to be a deliberative body, a cooling saucer if \nyou will. At this crucial time, it is important that the Senate carry \nout its appointed role. If we do increase spending, it should be \nlimited to measures that truly enhance domestic and international \nsecurity and efforts that truly stimulate the economy. We should not \naccept the fact that the Treasury Department must once again issue new \ndebt to finance the operation of the Federal Government for any longer \nthan is absolutely necessary, and every dollar we spend is going to be \nborrowed money.\n  The current crisis is not an excuse to spend but is a call to \nvigilance. As we fight for the future security of our country and our \nideals, let us also fight for the future fiscal health of our nation \nwhich will in turn help provide for the continued and future stability \nand prosperity of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12534-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12534-S12535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING, 107TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

His 90 plus years of life--and still going \nstrong!--are the perfect showcase of Wyoming's pioneer spirit and the \npatience and persistence with which the people of the West have always \npursued their dreams.

He has amassed quite a record of \nachievements and I am sure he is as proud of it as we are proud of him. \nHe earned his fame and reputation and it's good to know he's enjoying \nlife in the Shenandoah. It isn't Wyoming, but it's still a nice spot to \nrelax and take a\n\n[[Page S12536]]\n\nbreak to do some fishing and enjoy the beauty of some of God's finest \nhandiwork.\n  Floyd Dominy's story begins with his graduation from the University \nof Wyoming in 1932 and his arrival in Gillette to find a home and start \nwork. He found a simple home and began his employment as a County \nAgent. As a matter of fact, his home was so simple, the owner didn't \ncharge Mr. Dominy and his wife any rent because he couldn't believe \nanyone would want to live there. The ``fixer upper'' Mr. Dominy and his \nwife called home was without every convenience you could imagine, both \nmodern and old fashioned--even for its time.\n  As an Agriculture Extension Agent, one of his responsibilities was to \nbuy cattle for the Government from ranchers who were devastated by the \nGreat Depression. They used to trail cattle on foot back then and Floyd \nrealized there were no places to water the cattle on the way. That is \nwhen he began working on his idea of constructing dams to hold the \nwater to make it available where it was needed. He visited with then \nWyoming U.S. Senator John O'Mahoney about his ideas and Senator \nO'Mahoney was able to obtain Federal emergency aid to help out the \nfarmers of Wyoming. As a result, Wyoming's farmers got some much needed \nwork and three hundred dams were built.\n  Then came his service in World War II after which he joined the \nBureau of Reclamation. His talents, abilities and ingenuity were soon \nnoticed and it wasn't long before he had landed the top job at the \nBureau. He served for quite a while as the Bureau of Reclamation's \nCommissioner, a job he held longer than anyone else. Remarkably, he \nserved under four Presidents.\n\n  Mr. Dominy's friends would probably call him ``90 something'' years \nyoung--because he is still living a full life and enjoying every day as \nhe always has--with an independent streak a mile long and a yard wide. \nHe lives the code of the West--he says what he means, and he means what \nhe says.\n  In an interview for an article, he was asked about his career and his \nphilosophy about his line of work. He made it clear that he was never \nafraid to stand up for what he believed in and to stand up to whomever \nhe had to so that things got done. Thanks to his determination, drive \nand dedication to making a difference, a lot of things got done.\n  Floyd Dominy had much to look back on with a great deal of pride and \nthe satisfaction that comes from a job well done. As the Commissioner \nof the Bureau or Reclamation during the Administrations of Presidents \nEisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, he left a legacy of service in \nthat office that will probably never again be matched. We owe him a \ndebt of gratitude for his vision and his ability to make his dreams a \nreality. Thanks to him, we in the West had our access to water--one of \nGod's greatest gifts and our most prized and precious resource--greatly \nenhanced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12536-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO HAROLD SCHAFER OF NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today a giant presence in North \nDakota history is being laid to rest.\n  Harold Schafer was truly larger than life. He was perhaps North \nDakota's most prominent citizen--accomplished in his public life, and \ngenerous in his private life.\n  He grew up in western North Dakota in hard times, and went on to be \nthe most successful entrepreneur in our State's history. Harold Schafer \nwas a salesman's salesman. He had a magnetic personality, boundless \nenergy, a genuine interest in people and tremendous enthusiasm for \nlife. His curiosity and passion for living were contagious. Harold \nSchafer was just plain fun to be around.\n  He started a small business in his basement, and grew it into a \nmulti-million dollar national enterprise. His Gold Seal company was the \nkind of great American success story that gave meaning to the phrase \n``household name.'' Harold Schafer gave us Glass Wax, Snowy Bleach, and \nMr. Bubble. He enjoyed great financial success, and his rags-to-riches \nstory earned him the Horatio Alger award.\n  But Harold Schafer was much more than a successful businessman. He \nwas interested and involved in every part of the life of North Dakota \nand the Nation. His acquaintances ranged from the powerful and well-\nknown to the shoeshine man on the corner, and he enjoyed the company of \nall of them. He entertained General Douglas MacArthur in his home in \nBismarck. He was a friend to Ronald Reagan and Perry Como. He appeared \nin the movie ``How the West Was Won.''\n  And he will always be remembered as our State's most prominent \nphilanthropist, even though he never sought recognition for his \ngenerosity. He helped hundreds of young North Dakotans through college, \nalmost always anonymously. I know, because he offered to put me through \ncollege when I was a young man. He helped hundreds and hundreds of \nothers, in ways big and small. Almost always, he reached out to assist \nthe less fortunate in ways that others never knew about.\n  He preferred it that way, but how he loved to help. Harold Schafer \nwas a big man with a big heart, and a real love for life. He could talk \nto anyone, and learn from everyone.\n  His enthusiasm and energy took him into the worlds of politics, \nbusiness education and philanthropy. He was the man who restored the \ntown of Medora in the North Dakota Badlands, an important place in the \nlife of President Theodore Roosevelt.\n  Harold spent millions of dollars of his own money to bring the story \nof that town to a national audience. Today, Medora is the premier \nvacation spot in our State. It is the gateway to the rugged beauty of \nTheodore Roosevelt National Park, and hosts a professional show every \nevening in the summer in a spectacular outdoor amphitheater.\n  Harold Schafer did not invest in Medora to make money, but to \npreserve the area's rich history. Medora tells a story that has \ninspired thousands of young people with the vision that Theodore \nRoosevelt and Harold Schafer shared, the ``can-do'' attitude that says, \n``every person can make a difference, and every person should try.''\n  Harold Schafer adopted as the symbol of his company a statue of a \npioneer entitled ``Work.'' He loved to work, to build and to make \nthings better. That was at the heart of Harold Schafer's philosophy.\n  I know these things because I first met Harold Schafer when I was a \nsmall boy, and had the privilege of being part of his extended family. \nHe was a close friend of my father. When my parents were killed in an \nautomobile accident, Harold Schafer adopted my family as he did so many \nothers. Every Christmas Eve, Harold would come to my home with a \ntrunkload of gifts for the family, a wide smile, and genuine glee \ncelebrating all that life had to offer.\n  He brought happiness to hundreds of families that had suffered a loss \nor a hardship. That's the kind of man Harold Schafer was. He made the \nworld a better place while he was here, and he leaves the world a \nsadder place for his passing. Our sympathy goes out to his wife, \nSheila, and his children, Haroldeen, Ed, Joanne, Dianne, Pamela, Mark, \nMichele, and Maureen, their families, and his many grandchildren and \ngreat-grandchildren. We will miss him greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12536-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12536-S12537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2115.

In addition, and most \n     relevant to this NPR, VEOA affords to ``covered employees'' \n     of the legislative branch (as defined by section 101 of the \n     Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') (2 USC Sec. 1301)) \n     the rights and protections of selected provisions of \n     veterans' preference law. VEOA Sec. 4(c)(2). The selected \n     statutory sections made applicable to such legislative branch \n     employees by VEOA may be summarized as follows.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Pub. L. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3186 (Oct. 31, 1998).\n     \\2\\ Sen. Rept. 105-340, 105 Cong., 2d Sess. at 19 (Sept. 21, \n     1998).\n     \\3\\ Act of June 27, 1944, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 387, amended and \n     codified in various provisions of Title 5, USC.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A definitional section prescribes the categories of \n     military veterans who are entitled to preference \n     (``preference eligible''). 5 USC Sec. 2108. Generally, a \n     veteran must be disabled or have served on active duty in the \n     Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in \n     specified military campaigns to be entitled to preference. In \n     addition, certain family members (mainly spouses, widow[er]s, \n     and mothers) of preference eligible veterans are entitled to \n     the same rights and protections.\n       In the appointment process, a preference eligible \n     individual who is tested or otherwise numerically evaluated \n     for a position in the competitive service is entitled to have \n     either 5 or 10 points added to his/her score, depending on \n     his or her military service, or disabling condition. 5 USC \n     Sec. 3309. Where experience is a qualifying element for a job \n     in the competitive service, a preference eligible individual \n     is entitled to credit for having relevant experience in the \n     military or in various civic activities. 5 USC Sec. 3311. \n     Where physical requirements (age, height, weight) are a \n     qualifying element for a position in the competitive service, \n     preference eligible individuals (including those who are \n     disabled) may obtain a waiver of such requirements in certain \n     circumstances. 5 USC Sec. 3312. For certain positions in the \n     competitive service (guards, elevator operators, messengers, \n     custodians), only preference eligible individuals can be \n     considered for hiring so long as such individuals are \n     available. 5 USC Sec. 3310.\n       Finally, in prescribing retention rights during RIFs for \n     positions in both the competitive and in the excepted \n     service, the sections in subchapter I of chapter 35 of Title \n     5, USC, with a slightly modified definition of ``preference \n     eligible,'' require that employing agencies give ``due \n     effect'' to the following factors: (a) employment tenure \n     (i.e., type of appointment); (b) veterans' preference; (c) \n     length of service; and, (d) performance ratings. 5 USC \n     Sec. Sec. 3501, 3502. Such considerations also apply where \n     RIFs occur in connection with a transfer of agency functions \n     from one agency to another. 5 USC Sec. 3503. In addition, \n     where physical requirements (age, height, weight) are a \n     qualifying element for retention, preference eligible \n     individuals (including those who are disabled) may obtain a \n     waiver of such requirements in certain circumstances. 5 \n     USC Sec. 3504.\n       On February 28, 2000, and March 9, 2000, an Advanced Notice \n     of Proposed Rulemaking (``ANPR'') was published in the \n     Congressional Record (144 Cong. Rec. S862 (daily ed., Feb. \n     28, 2000), H916 (daily ed., Mar. 9, 2000)). The ANPR \n     identified a number of interpretative issues on which the \n     Board sought public comment in order to assist it in \n     proposing the substantive regulations mandated under section \n     4(c)(4) of VEOA. The Board had sought to obtain an array of \n     information regarding the employment policies and practices \n     in the various employing offices affected by VEOA. In \n     addition, the Board sought to gain any relevant information \n     that might aid the Board in interpreting VEOA. In response to \n     the ANPR, the Board received two written comments, one of \n     which was from a local unit of a labor organization and the \n     other of which was from the national office of the same labor \n     organization. Both comments focused on the issue of whether \n     the term guard in section 3310 of 5 USC, applied by VEOA, \n     should be interpreted to included officers and other \n     employees of the U.S. Capitol Police. The Board received no \n     further public input to assist it in resolving the other \n     issues outlined in the ANPR. Therefore, the Board upon its \n     own further research and study has decided to propose \n     substantive regulations implementing the relevant portions of \n     VEOA. What follows is a discussion of how the Board, \n     tentatively at least, proposes to address the thirteen \n     interpretative issues identified in the ANPR.\n     Discussion of interpretative issues\n       Interpretation of term ``competitive service'' and \n     ``excepted service'' as applied to the legislative branch \n     [Issues (1)-(7)].\n       The ANPR observed that VEOA confers upon covered employees \n     the statutory rights and protections of veterans' preference \n     in appointments to the ``competitive service.'' The ANPR also \n     explained that veterans'' preference rights in the context of \n     a reduction in force, as provided in the application of \n     subchapter I of chapter 35 of title 5, USC and under VEO, \n     are, with one exception, applicable to both the competitive \n     service and to the excepted service. Moreover, OPM's \n     implementing regulations regarding reductions in force, set \n     forth in 5 CFR part 351, are couched in terms that assume \n     application to the ``competitive service'' and the ``excepted \n     service.'' Thus the definitions of these two terms, as \n     applied to the legislative branch by virtue of VEOA, are \n     central to a determination of the substantive veterans' \n     preference rights which now apply to covered employees.\n       The Board received no written comments in response to a \n     series of questions exploring how to interpret these \n     statutory categories of Federal service. In the absence of \n     illuminating comment or contrary definitions in VEOA, the \n     Board believes that it must define these terms in accordance \n     with their meaning under derivative sections of title 5, USC, \n     made applicable by VEOA. This conclusion is\n\n[[Page S12540]]\n\n     supported by a directive in VEOA to issue regulations that \n     are consistent with section 225 of the CAA (2 USC Sec. 1361), \n     one of whose subsections embraces a rule of construction that \n     ``definitions and exemptions in the laws made applicable by \n     this [Congressional Accountability] Act shall apply under \n     this [Congressional Accountability] Act.'' This section \n     enables the Board to flesh out the meaning and scope of the \n     various federal employment laws made applicable under the CAA \n     by referring to their respective definitions and exemptions \n     even though they are not expressly cited in the CAA.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\4\\ Compare Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [Fair Labor \n     Standards Act regulations under Congressional Accountability \n     Act], 141 CONG. REC. S17603, S17604 (Daily Ed. Nov. 28, \n     1995)(in proposing the substantive regulations of the FLSA, \n     29 USC Sec. 201 et seq., the Board cited section 225(f)(1) of \n     the CAA as requiring the application of the FLSA definition \n     of ``wages'' in 29 USC Sec. 203(m).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Section 2102 of Title 5 USC, as applied under VEOA, \n     presents a three-fold definition of the term ``competitive \n     service'': First, the competitive service consists of ``all \n     civil service positions in the executive branch,'' with \n     exceptions for (a) positions specifically excepted from the \n     competitive service by statute , (b) positions requiring \n     Senate confirmation, and (c) positions in the Senior \n     Executive Service.\\5\\ 5 USC Sec. 2102(a)(1)(A)-(C) (emphasis \n     added). Second, the competitive service includes ``civil \n     positions not in the executive branch which are specifically \n     included in the competitive service by statute.'' 5 USC \n     Sec. 2102(a)(2). Third, the competitive service encompasses \n     those ``positions in the government of the District of \n     Columbia which are specifically included in the competitive \n     service by statute.'' 5 USC Sec. 2102(a)(3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\5\\ These generally are high-level, managerial positions in \n     the executive department whose appointment does not require \n     Senate confirmation. See 5 USC Sec. 3123 (a)(2), which \n     defines the term ``Senior Executive Service position.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Section 2103 of Title 5 further defines the ``excepted \n     service'' to include all ``civil service positions which are \n     not in the competitive or the Senior Executive Service.'' 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2103. And section 2101 of that Title defines the \n     ``civil service'' to include ``all appointive positions in \n     the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the \n     Government of the United States, except positions in the \n     uniformed services.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2101(1).\n       As applied under VEOA, it would seem that section 225 \n     requires the Board to issue regulations that take into \n     account the definitions (and exemptions) accompanying the \n     civil service laws from which the rights and protections of \n     veterans' preference are derived. Accordingly, the Notice \n     proposes a section, in the form of a proviso, requiring that \n     the terms ``competitive service'' and ``excepted service'' in \n     the proposed regulations be defined in reference to their \n     statutory meaning in Title 5, USC. Where an applied \n     regulation refers to the ``competitive service,'' such term \n     shall have the meaning as provided in 5 USC Sec. 2102(a)(2). \n     Where an applied regulation refers to the ``exempted \n     service,'' such term shall have the meaning as provided in 5 \n     USC Sec. 2103. Consistent with the definition under section \n     2103, it is the position of the Board that all ``covered \n     employees'' \\6\\ holding civil service positions in the \n     legislative branch are within the definition of excepted \n     service, unless otherwise designated by statute as being \n     competitive service or Senior Executive Service positions.\\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\6\\ The definition of ``covered employee'' under section VEO \n     Sec. 4(c)(1) has the same meaning as the term under section \n     101 of the CAA, 2 USC Sec. 1302, which includes any employee \n     of the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Capitol \n     Guide Service, the Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the \n     Office of the Attending Physician, the Office of Compliance, \n     or the Office of Technology Assessment. Under VEO \n     Sec. 4(c)(5), the following employees are excluded from the \n     term ``covered employee'': (A) presidential appointees \n     confirmed by the Senate, (B) employees appointed by a Member \n     of Congress or by a committee or subcommittee of either House \n     of Congress, and (C) employees holding positions the duties \n     of which are equivalent to those in Senior Executive Service.\n     \\7\\ In the ANPR the Board had initially suggested that no \n     ``covered employees'', as defined by VEOA, fall within the \n     meaning of ``excepted service.'' Upon further review of the \n     governing statutes, the Board herein submits that many \n     ``covered employees'' within the legislative branch are \n     encompassed by the term ``excepted service'' as discussed \n     above. The definition of ``covered employee'' under section \n     VEO Sec. 4(c)(1) has the same meaning as the term under \n     section 101 of the CAA, 2 USC Sec. 1302, which includes any \n     employee of the House of Representatives, the Senate, the \n     Capitol Guide Service, the Capitol Police, the Congressional \n     Budget Office, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, \n     the Office of the Attending Physician, the Office of \n     Compliance, or the Office of Technology Assessment. Under VEO \n     Sec. 4(c)(5), the following employees are excluded from the \n     term ``covered employee'': (A) presidential appointees \n     confirmed by the Senate, (B) employees appointed by a Member \n     of Congress or by a committee or subcommittee of either House \n     of Congress, and (C) employees holding positions the duties \n     of which are equivalent to those in Senior Executive Service. \n     Consistent with the definition at section 2103 of title 5, \n     USC, any covered employee within the legislative branch who \n     holds a civil service position which is not in the Senior \n     Executive Service and which is not in the competitive service \n     is encompassed within the definition of ``excepted service.'' \n     The regulations which the Board here proposes reflect this \n     interpretation of the governing statutes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Board recognizes that the adoption of these \n     definitions, consistent with the mandate of section 225, \n     yields an unusual result in that no ``covered employee'' in \n     the legislative branch currently satisfies the definition of \n     ``competitive service.'' Moreover, as the substantive \n     protections of veterans' preference in legislative branch \n     appointment apply only to ``competitive service'' positions, \n     the regulations which the Board proposes regarding preference \n     in appointment would with one noted exception, currently \n     apply to no one.\\8\\ However, should Congress, by statute, \n     hereinafter designate any civil service positions in the \n     legislative branch as ``competitive service'' positions, then \n     consistent with the second definition of section 2102(a)(2) \n     and the parallel regulation proposed herein, the substantive \n     regulations regarding veterans' preference in appointment \n     would apply.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\8\\ The Board proposes the potential application of the \n     substantive regulations regarding veterans' preference in the \n     appointment process insofar as the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capital, pursuant to the Architect of the Capital Human \n     Resources Act, has established a personnel management system \n     with features analogous to the ``competitive service'' as \n     defined in Sec. 2102(a)(2) of Title 5, USC. See Section 1.106 \n     infra.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Authority of Board to exercise powers and responsibilities \n     similar to that of OPM in executing, administering, and \n     enforcing the federal service system [Issues (8)-(10)].\n       The ANPR contrasted the regulatory authority vested in OPM \n     and in the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     with respect to personnel management matters. Congress has \n     established OPM as an independent agency in the executive \n     branch and authorized it to exercise broad powers \n     administering the civil service laws.

In addition, OPM exercises broad administrative \n     powers over the competitive service, including the authority \n     to develop and conduct examinations for the appointment of \n     applicants into the competitive service and the authority to \n     administer rules exempting positions from the competitive \n     service.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\9\\ See also 5 CFR Sec. 5.1, issued by the President, which \n     states that the ``Director, Office of Personnel Management, \n     shall promulgate and enforce regulations necessary to carry \n     out the provisions of the Civil Service Act and the Veterans' \n     Preference Act, as reenacted in Title 5, United States Code, \n     the Civil Services Rules, and all other statutes and \n     Executive orders imposing responsibilities on the Office.''\n     \\10\\ The following summary explains in part the role of the \n     OPM in the appointment of employees to competitive service \n     positions in executive branch agencies:\n     ``An employee typically becomes a member of the ``competitive \n     service'' by taking an examination administered by the Office \n     of Personnel Management (``OPM'').

This is most clearly \n     evident from the fact that VEOA did not make applicable to \n     the Board the powers and responsibilities exercised by OPM \n     under 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1103-04, 1301-04, among other \n     sections.\n       Insofar as the Board's authority under VEOA is not \n     coextensive with that of OPM, the ANPR identified two legal \n     implications. First, the Board's power to promulgate \n     veterans' preference regulations that are the ``same as'' \n     those of OPM may be circumscribed to some degree. To \n     illustrate, if OPM has promulgated a regulation under the \n     combined authority of two statutory sections, A and B, but \n     the Board is given authority only under section A, any \n     corresponding regulation proposed by the Board must be \n     tailored to reflect only the standard, directive, or power of \n     section A. Thus, some regulations of OPM may have to be \n     adopted with modifications to reflect their narrower \n     statutory basis. Other OPM regulations may not be adopted at \n     all simply because the Board does not have the underlying \n     statutory authority.\n       The second implication identified by the ANPR was that \n     where the veterans' preference regulations contemplate a role \n     by OPM,\\11\\ the Board of Directors might not be empowered to \n     exercise a comparable administrative role with respect to \n     personnel matters in the legislative branch.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\11\\ See, e.g., 5 CFR Sec. Sec. 330.401 (OPM's role in \n     competitive examination in restricted positions), 330.403 \n     (OPM's role in filling restricted positions by noncompetitive \n     action of a nonpreference eligible), 332.401 (OPM's \n     responsibility to maintain registers of eligibles), 337.101 \n     (OPM's role in rating applicants).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Board received no written comments addressing these \n     issues. Upon further study and reflection, the Board has \n     concluded that the if the provisions of VEOA are to be given\n\n[[Page S12541]]\n\n     their plain meaning, the Board must propose only those OPM \n     regulations, modified as necessary, that can be linked to \n     those statutory sections whose rights and protections have \n     been made applicable to covered employees in the legislative \n     branch. The Board further concludes that VEOA does not vest \n     the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance with the \n     broad-ranging authority to execute, administer, and enforce a \n     civil service system in the legislative branch.\\12\\ \n     Accordingly, in certain of the proposed regulations the \n     references to OPM have been deleted. To the extent that the \n     executive branch regulations directed OPM to exercise certain \n     responsibilities, including setting of standards, exercising \n     review of agency determinations, and engaging in oversight, \n     those duties have been eliminated in the proposed \n     regulations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\12\\ Compare Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [Fair Labor \n     Standards Act regulations under Congressional Accountability \n     Act], 141 Cong. Rec. S17603, S17604 (Daily Ed. Nov. 28, \n     1995)(explaining that because the CAA did not incorporate the \n     notice posting and recordkeeping requirements of section 11 \n     of the FLSA, 29 USC Sec. 211, the Board determined that it \n     may not impose by substantive regulations such requirements \n     on employing offices).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Interpretation of provision restricting certain positions, \n     including guards, to preference eligibles [Issue (11)].\n       With respect to ``competitive service'' positions \n     restricted to preference eligible individuals under 5 USC \n     Sec. 3310, as applied by VEOA, namely guards, elevator \n     operators, messengers, and custodians, the Board sought \n     information and comment on a series of issues, including the \n     identity, in the legislative branch, of guard, elevator \n     operator, messenger, and custodian positions within the \n     meaning of these statutory terms. A specific question was \n     posed whether police officers and other employees of the \n     United State Capitol Police should be considered ``guards.'' \n     As noted previously, the only two written comments received \n     in response to the ANPR addressed this latter issue.\n       Both comments argued that the term ``guard'' should not be \n     interpreted to include officers of the U.S. Capitol Police. \n     One comment contrasted the use of key terms within chapter 33 \n     of Title 5, USC, which governs the examination, selection, \n     and placement of personnel in the competitive service and \n     from which selected provisions made applicable under VEOA to \n     the legislative branch are drawn. Section 3310, which is made \n     applicable by VEOA, uses the term ``guard.'' In contrast, \n     section 3307, which addresses maximum-age requirements in the \n     competitive service and which is not made applicable under \n     VEOA, refers to ``law enforcement officer.'' Because of this \n     differentiation within the same chapter of the U.S. Code, the \n     commenter suggests that Congress could not have intended to \n     treat a ``guard'' under section 3310 as analogous to a ``law \n     enforcement officer.'' Since U.S. Capitol police officers \n     have the authority of law enforcement officers (see 40 USC \n     Sec. Sec. 212-212a), they are not ``guards'' for purposes of \n     section 3310 as applied.\n       The other comment makes a similar distinction between \n     guards and law enforcement officers, relying upon the \n     interpretations of OPM, which is responsible for \n     administering the Federal government's occupation \n     classification system. The commenter cites to two OPM \n     publications, Grade Evaluation Guide for Police and Security \n     Guard Positions, GS-0083/GS-0085 and Digest of Significant \n     Classification Decisions and Opinions, No. 8, April 1986. \n     Together, these publications establish a distinction between \n     police officers and guards in the executive branch.\n       The Board finds that the comments make a persuasive case \n     for not equating officers of the U.S. Capitol Police with \n     ``guards'' under section 3310 as applied by VEOA. The \n     proposed rule includes a provision that explicitly excludes \n     law enforcement officer positions of the U.S. Capitol Police \n     from the substantive regulations implementing section 3310 \n     as applied by VEOA.\n       Executive branch regulations that either should not be \n     adopted or should be adopted with modification [Issues (12)-\n     (13)].\n       The Board received no written comments addressing the \n     questions posed in the ANPR as to which substantive \n     regulations should not be adopted because they are based on \n     statutory provisions that have not been made applicable under \n     VEOA. Similarly, no comments were received on what \n     modifications should be adopted to make the regulations more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections made applicable under VEOA.\n       Nevertheless, as explained above in the discussion \n     concerning its authority to exercise powers comparable to \n     OPM's, the Board has concluded that it may not propose \n     regulations that are not based on statutory rights and \n     protections made applicable under VEOA. Conversely, the Board \n     believes that the regulations proposed in this Notice most \n     appropriately fulfill the statutory mandate to adopt \n     regulations that are the ``same as the most relevant \n     substantive regulations (applicable with respect to the \n     executive branch) promulgated to implement the statutory \n     provisions'' of VEOA. To the extent that modifications are \n     being proposed, the Board believes that they are warranted to \n     reflect the more limited statutory authority which VEOA vests \n     in the Board.\n     Special provision for coverage of Architect of the Capitol\n       While drafting the proposed regulations following the \n     receipt of written comments to the ANPR, it came to the \n     attention of the Board that the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol has been under a special statutory mandate with \n     respect to managing and supervising its human resources. \n     Because AOC is part of the legislative branch, it has not \n     generally been subject to many of the statutes that regulate \n     personnel policy for Federal agencies. As a consequence, the \n     General Accounting Office reported in 1994 that AOC's \n     personnel system was deficient in many respects. GAO, \n     ``Federal Personnel: Architect of the Capitol's System Needs \n     Improvement,'' B-256160 (April 29, 1994). Congress responded \n     by enacting the Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act \n     (AOCHRA). P.L. 103-283, 108 Stat. 1444 (July 22, 1994), \n     codified at 40 U.S.C. Sec. 166b-7. This law did not directly \n     bring the AOC within the purview of the various Federal \n     personnel laws. Rather, the AOC was directed to establish its \n     own personnel management system. As stated in AOCHRA, \n     Congress found that the Architect should ``develop human \n     resources management programs that are consistent with the \n     practices common among other Federal and private sector \n     organizations,'' and to that end, the Architect was directed \n     ``to establish and maintain a personnel management system \n     that incorporates fundamental principles that exist in other \n     modern personnel systems.'' 40 U.S.C. Sec. 166b-7(b)(1),(2). \n     The law then sets out in broad terms eight subject areas that \n     a model personnel management system must address, leaving it \n     to the Architect to develop a detailed plan for implementing \n     these model policy goals no later than fifteen months after \n     enactment. 40 U.S.C. Sec. 166b-7(c)(2)(A)-(H), (d)(1)(B),(C). \n     Among these objectives is the requirement that the personnel \n     management system ``ensure[] that applicants for employment \n     and employees of the Architect of the Capitol are appointed, \n     promoted, and assigned on the basis of merit and fitness \n     after fair and equitable consideration of all applicants and \n     employees through open competition.'' 40 U.S.C. Sec. 166b-\n     7(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\n       The notion of merit selection based on open competition, of \n     course, is a bedrock principle of the federal civil service \n     system, particularly its competitive service component, as \n     described in the ANPR, 146 Cong. Rec. S864 (Daily ed. \n     February 29, 2000)(ANPR). Thus, instead of formally placing \n     the job positions of the Architect's Office within the \n     federal competitive service, which is contemplated under 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2101(a)(2),\\13\\ Congress authorized the \n     Architect's Office to devise its own personnel system \n     independent of the competitive service (and of the oversight \n     responsibilities of the Office of Personnel Management) but \n     consistent with its animating principles.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\13\\ ``The `competitive service' consists of--. . .``(2) \n     civil service positions not in the executive branch which are \n     specifically included in the competitive service by \n     statute;''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       AOCHRA did not specifically mandate that the Architect's \n     Office incorporate veterans' preference principles into its \n     merit selection system. And there is nothing in the public \n     record to indicate that the AOC in practice affords qualified \n     veterans some form of preference in the selection process. \n     However, it seems equally true that there is nothing in \n     AOCHRA to preclude the Architect from taking veterans' \n     preference into account in making appointments, promotions, \n     and assignments, the same way that an executive branch agency \n     must afford veterans' preference to appointments to positions \n     in the competitive service. Thus, the issue arises whether \n     VEOA may be read in pari materia with AOCHRA, so as to make \n     the substantive VEOA regulations concerning appointments \n     applicable to AOC's merit selection system notwithstanding \n     the fact that job positions subject to that system are not \n     technically part of the ``competitive service.''\n       As noted above, the Board has tentatively concluded that it \n     must limit the application of the substantive, veterans' \n     preference appointment regulations to those legislative \n     branch positions that are within the ``competitive service,'' \n     as the latter term is defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2102. As a \n     practical matter, this may significantly limit the group of \n     ``covered employees'' who will benefit from VEOA, since it \n     appears that the vast majority of ``covered employees'' hold \n     civil service positions in the legislative branch, including \n     those in the Office of AOC, that are within the definition of \n     excepted service.\n       However, the congressional policy declared in the enactment \n     of AOCHRA may warrant the promulgation of a special \n     regulation tailoring the application of the VEOA appointment \n     regulations to positions in Office of the AOC, for it is a \n     general rule of statutory construction that statutes on the \n     same subject matter are to be construed together.\\14\\ In this \n     case, the specific obligations under VEOA to afford veterans' \n     preference in connection with merit appointments would be \n     interpreted in conjunction with the preexisting, general \n     obligations under AOCHRA to establish a merit selection \n     personnel system. If read together, the two statutes would \n     seem to authorize the application of substantive VEOA \n     regulations, at least those governing appointments, insofar \n     as AOCHRA imposes obligations on the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol to establish a personnel management system \n     which at a minimum provides\n\n[[Page S12542]]\n\n     for appointment, promotion and assignment on the basis of \n     merit and fitness after fair and equitable consideration of \n     all applicants and employees through open competition.\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\14\\ N.

In addition, \n     the Board invites comments on the related question of how \n     substantive regulations promulgated under VEOA may be applied \n     to AOC's personnel management system, even assuming that it \n     currently does not include a veterans' preference component, \n     being mindful that the Board is authorized under VEOA to \n     propose modifications for the more effective implementation \n     of the rights and protections under VEOA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1316a(c)(4)(B).\n       In order to frame the issues for comment, the Board has \n     decided to include in this NPR a proposed new section \n     Sec. 1.106, which would apply the appointment regulations \n     governing veterans' preference to appointments made pursuant \n     to the merit selection system under AOCHRA. This section \n     would apply the proposed regulations notwithstanding the fact \n     that the job positions within the AOCHRA merit selection \n     system are not technically within the ``competitive \n     service.'' Insofar as AOCHRA imposes obligations on the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol to establish a \n     personnel management system which at a minimum provides for \n     appointment, promotion and assignment on the basis of merit \n     and fitness after fair and equitable consideration of all \n     applicants and employees through open competition, the \n     Architect of the Capitol would be required to afford to a \n     covered employee, including an applicant veterans' \n     preference, in a manner and to the extent consistent with \n     these proposed regulations.\n     Recommended Method of Approval\n       The Board recommends that (1) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to the Senate and employees of \n     the Senate be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives be approved by the House of Representatives \n     by resolution; and (3) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to other covered employees and \n     employing offices be approved by the Congress by concurrent \n     resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 13th day of November, \n     2001.\n\n                                            Susan S.

Purpose and scope\n\n       (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (VEOA) applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of title 5 USC, to covered employees within the \n     legislative branch.\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein are the substantive regulations that the Board \n     of Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated \n     pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of VEOA, in accordance with the \n     rulemaking procedure set forth in section 304 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. 1.102. Definitions\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, as used \n     in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) VEOA means the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of \n     1998 (Pub. L. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3182).\n       (c) Except as provided by Sec. 1.103, the term covered \n     employee means any employee of (1) the House of \n     Representatives; (2) the Senate; (3) the Capitol Guide \n     Service; (4) the Capitol Police; (5) the Congressional Budget \n     Office; (6) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (7) \n     the Office of the Attending Physician; and (8) the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (d) The term employee includes an applicant for employment \n     and a former employee.\n       (e) The term employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol includes any employee of the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol, the Botanic Gardens, or the Senate \n     Restaurants.\n       (f) The term employee of the Capitol Police includes any \n     member or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (g) The term employee of the House of Representatives \n     includes an individual occupying a position the pay for which \n     is disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph \n     (c) above.\n       (h) The term employee of the Senate includes any employee \n     whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but \n     not any such individual employed by any entity listed in \n     subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph (c) above.\n       (i) The term employing office means: (1) the personal \n     office of a Member of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate or a joint committee; (2) a committee of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate or a joint committee; (3) any \n     other office headed by a person with the final authority to \n     appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, conditions, or \n     privileges of the employment of an employee of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate; or (4) the Capitol Guide \n     Board, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol, the Office of the Attending \n     Physician, and the Office of Compliance.\n       (j) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (k) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (l) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Office \n     of Compliance.\n       (m) The term agency means employing office as defined by \n     subsection (i).\n\n     Sec. 1.103. Exclusions from definition of covered employee\n\n       The term covered employee does not include an employee\n       (a) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate;\n       (b) whose appointment is made by a Member of Congress or by \n     a committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress; or,\n       (c) who is appointed to a position, the duties of which are \n     equivalent to those of a Senior Executive Service position \n     (within the meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United \n     States Code).\n\n     Sec. 1.104. Authority of the Board\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, 4(c)(4)(B) of VEOA \n     directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are ``the \n     same as the most relevant substantive regulations (applicable \n     with respect to the executive branch) promulgated to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in paragraph \n     (2)'' of section 4(c) of VEOA. Those statutory provisions are \n     section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35, of title 5, United States Code. The regulations \n     issued by the Board herein are on all matters for which \n     section 4(c)(4)(B) of VEOA requires a regulation to be \n     issued. Specifically, it is the Board's considered judgment \n     based on the information available to it at the time of \n     promulgation of these regulations, that, with the exception \n     of the regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no \n     other ``substantive regulations (applicable with respect to \n     the executive branch) promulgated to implement the statutory \n     provisions referred to in paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of \n     VEOA that need be adopted.\n       (b) Technical and nomenclature changes. In promulgating \n     these regulations, the Board has made certain technical and \n     nomenclature changes to the regulations as promulgated by the \n     executive branch. Such changes are intended to make the \n     provisions adopted accord more naturally to situations in the \n     Legislative Branch. However, by making these changes, the \n     Board does not intend a substantive difference between these \n     regulations and those of the executive branch from which they \n     are derived except to the extent that a modification is \n     necessary to more effectively implement the rights and \n     protections made applicable under VEOA.\n       (c) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification of the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as the most substantive \n     regulations (applicable with respect to the executive \n     branch),'' section 4(c)(4)(B) of VEOA authorizes the Board to \n     ``determine, for good cause shown and stated together with \n     the regulation, that a modification of such regulations would \n     be more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under'' section 4(c) of VEOA. In examining the \n     relevant regulations of the executive branch, which were\n\n[[Page S12543]]\n\n     promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management, the Board \n     has concluded that a number of sections were issued under a \n     combination of statutory authorities, some of which were made \n     applicable under section 4(c)(2) of VEOA and some of which \n     were not made applicable under that section. The Board has \n     accordingly determined that given the selective application \n     of statutory provisions, some regulations of the executive \n     branch are not applicable to the legislative branch and some \n     regulations must be modified in order to be made applicable.\n       (d) Retention of section numbering. Except for the sections \n     in Part 1, the regulations adopted herein are numbered to \n     correspond with the section numbering of the substantive \n     regulations of the executive branch as they appear in title 5 \n     of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) on which they are \n     based.\n\n     Sec. 1.105. Coordination with Section 225 of Congressional \n       Accountability Act\n\n       (a) Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(D) of the VEOA \n     requires that regulations promulgated must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of \n     section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule \n     of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws \n     made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and \n     subsection (f)(3), which states that the CAA shall not be \n     construed to authorize enforcement of the CAA by the \n     executive branch.\n       (b) Provisos necessary to satisfy statutory directive. The \n     Board determines that in order for certain regulations \n     applied under VEOA to be consistent with subsections (f)(1) \n     and (f)(3) of section 225 of the CAA, the such regulations \n     shall be subject to the following provisos:\n       (1) Where an applied regulation refers to the ``competitive \n     service,'' such term shall have the meaning as provided in 5 \n     USC Sec. 2102(a)(2). Where an applied regulation refers to \n     the ``exempted service,'' such term shall have the meaning as \n     provided in 5 USC Sec. 2103.\n       (2) Where an applied regulation refers to the ``excepted \n     service,'' such term shall have the meaning as provided in 5 \n     USC Sec. 2103. Consistent with the definition provided by \n     section 2103, the Board determines that ``excepted service'' \n     encompasses all civil service positions within the \n     legislative branch which are neither in the ``competitive \n     service'' nor have duties that are equivalent to the Senior \n     Executive Service as those terms are defined in Title 5, USC.\n\n     Sec. 1.106. Application of regulations to certain positions \n       of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol\n\n       (a) The Office of the Architect of the Capitol, pursuant to \n     the provisions of the Architect of the Capitol Human \n     Resources Act (AOCHRA), P.L. 103-283, 108 Stat. 1444 (July \n     22, 1994), as codified and amended in 40 USC Sec. 166b-7, \n     is required to establish a personnel management system \n     that in part ``ensures that applicants for employment and \n     employees of the Architect of the Capitol are appointed, \n     promoted, and assigned on the basis of merit and fitness \n     after fair and equitable consideration of all applicants \n     and employees through open competition.'' 40 USC \n     Sec. 166b-7(c)(2)(A).\n       (b) Insofar as AOCHRA imposes obligations on the Office of \n     the Architect of the Capitol to establish a personnel \n     management system which at a minimum provides for \n     appointment, promotion and assignment on the basis of merit \n     and fitness after fair and equitable consideration of all \n     applicants and employees through open competition, the \n     Architect of the Capitol shall provide veterans' preference \n     to a covered employee, including an applicant, in a manner \n     and to the extent consistent with these regulations.\n\n                      PART 211--VETERAN PREFERENCE\n\nSec.\n211.101 Purpose\n211.102 Definitions\n211.103 Administration of preference\n\n     Sec. 211.101.

(5 U.S.C. 2108, as applied by VEOA)\n\n     Sec. 211.102. Definitions\n\n       For purposes of preference in Federal employment the \n     following definitions apply:\n       (a) Veteran means a person who was separated with an \n     honorable discharge or under honorable conditions from active \n     duty in the armed forces performed--\n       (1) In a war; or,\n       (2) In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge \n     has been authorized; or\n       (3) During the period beginning April 28, 1952, and ending \n     July 1, 1955; or,\n       (4) For more than 180 consecutive days, other than for \n     training, any part of which occurred during the period \n     beginning February 1, 1955, and ending October 14, 1976.\n       (b) Disabled veteran means a person who was separated under \n     honorable conditions from active duty in the armed forces \n     performed at any time and who has established the present \n     existence of a service-connected disability or is receiving \n     compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pensions \n     because of a public statute administered by the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs or a military department.\n       (c) Preference eligible means veterans, spouses, widows, or \n     mothers who meet the definition of ``preference eligible'' in \n     5 U.S.C. 2108. Preference eligibles in the competitive \n     service are entitled to have 5 or 10 points added to their \n     earned score on a civil service examination (see 5 U.S.C. \n     3309). They are also accorded a higher retention standing in \n     the event of a reduction in force in positions in either the \n     competitive service or in the excepted service (see 5 U.S.C. \n     3502). Preference does not apply, however, to inservice \n     placement actions such as promotions.\n       (d) Armed forces means the United States Army, Navy, Air \n     Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.\n       (e) Uniformed services means the armed forces, the \n     commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and the \n     commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration.\n       (f) Active duty or active military duty means full-time \n     duty with military pay and allowances in the armed forces, \n     except for training or for determining physical fitness and \n     except for service in the Reserves or National Guard.\n       (g) Separated under honorable conditions means either an \n     honorable or a general discharge from the armed forces. The \n     Department of Defense is responsible for administering and \n     defining military discharges.\n\n     Sec. 211.103. Administration of preference\n\n       Agencies are responsible for making all preference \n     determinations.\n\n   PART 330--RECRUITMENT, SELECTION, AND PLACEMENT (GENERAL) IN THE \n                          COMPETITIVE SERVICE\n\nSec.\n330.401 Competitive examination\n330.402 Direct recruitment\n\n        Subpart D--Positions Restricted to Preference Eligibles\n\n     Sec. 330.401.

For purposes of this part, the term guard does not \n     include law enforcement officer positions of the U.S. Capitol \n     Police Board.\n\n     Sec. 330.402. Direct recruitment\n\n       In direct recruitment by an agency under delegated \n     authority, the agency shall fill each restricted position by \n     the appointment of a preference eligible as long as \n     preference eligibles are available.\n\nPART 332--RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION IN THE COMPETITIVE SERVICE THROUGH \n                        COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION\n\nSec.\n332.401 Order on registers\n\n                Subpart D--Consideration for Appointment\n\n     Sec. 332.401.

Use of regulations\n\n       (a)(1) Each agency is responsible for determining the \n     categories within which positions are required, where they \n     are to be located, and when they are to be filled, abolished, \n     or vacated. This includes determining when there is a surplus \n     of employees at a particular location in a particular line of \n     work.\n       (2) Each agency shall follow this part when it releases a \n     competing employee from his or her competitive level by \n     furlough for more than 30 days, separation, demotion, or \n     reassignment requiring displacement, when the release is \n     required because of lack of work; shortage of funds; \n     insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the exercise \n     of reemployment rights or restoration rights; or \n     reclassification of an employee's position due to erosion of \n     duties when such action will take effect after an agency has \n     formally announced a reduction in force in the employee's \n     competitive area and when the reduction in force will take \n     effect within 180 days.\n       (b) This part does not require an agency to fill a vacant \n     position. However, when an agency, at its discretion, chooses \n     to fill a vacancy by an employee who has been reached for \n     release from a competitive level for one of the reasons in \n     paragraph (a)(2) of this section, this part shall be \n     followed.\n       (c) Each agency is responsible for assuring that the \n     provisions in this part are uniformly and consistently \n     applied in any one reduction in force.\n\n     Sec. 351.202. Coverage\n\n       (a) Employees covered. Except as provided in paragraph (b) \n     of this section, this part applies to covered employees as \n     defined by section 1.102(c) of these Regulations.\n       (b) Employees excluded. This part does not apply to an \n     employee who is within the exclusion set forth in section \n     1.103 of these Regulations.\n       (c) Actions excluded. This part does not apply to:\n       (1) The termination of a temporary or term promotion or the \n     return of an employee to the position held before the \n     temporary or term promotion or to one of equivalent grade and \n     pay.\n       (2) A change to lower grade based on the reclassification \n     of an employee's position due to the application of new \n     classification standards or the correction of a \n     classification error.\n       (3) A change to lower grade based on reclassification of an \n     employee's position due to erosion of duties, except that \n     this exclusion does not apply to such reclassification \n     actions that will take effect after an agency has formally \n     announced a reduction in force in the employee's competitive \n     area and when the reduction in force will take effect within \n     180 days. This exception ends at the completion of the \n     reduction in force.\n       (4) Placement of an employee serving on an intermittent, \n     part-time, on-call, or seasonal basis in a nonpay and nonduty \n     status in accordance with conditions established at time of \n     appointment.\n       (5) A change in an employee's work schedule from other-\n     than-full-time to full-time. (A change from full-time to \n     other than full-time for a reason covered in Sec. \n     351.201(a)(2) is covered by this part.)\n\n     Sec. 351.203. Definitions\n\n       In this part:\n       Competing employee means an employee in tenure group I, II, \n     or III.\n       Current rating of record is the rating of record for the \n     most recently completed appraisal period as provided in Sec. \n     351.504(b)(3).\n       Days means calendar days.\n       Function means all or a clearly identifiable segment of an \n     agency's mission (including all integral parts of that \n     mission), regardless of how it is performed.\n       Furlough under this part means the placement of an employee \n     in a temporary nonduty and nonpay status for more than 30 \n     consecutive calendar days, or more than 22 workdays if done \n     on a discontinuous basis, but not more than 1 year.\n       Local commuting area means the geographic area that usually \n     constitutes one area for employment purposes. It includes any \n     population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the \n     surrounding localities in which people live and can \n     reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to \n     their usual employment.\n       Modal rating is the summary rating level assigned most \n     frequently among the actual ratings of record that are:\n       (1) Assigned under the summary level pattern that applies \n     to the employee's position of record on the date of the \n     reduction in force;\n       (2) Given within the same competitive area, or at the \n     agency's option within a larger subdivision of the agency or \n     agencywide; and\n       (3) On record for the most recently completed appraisal \n     period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force \n     notices or the cutoff date the agency specifies prior to the \n     issuance of reduction in force notices after which no new \n     ratings will be put on record.\n       Rating of record means the officially designated \n     performance rating, as provided for in the agency's appraisal \n     system.\n       Reorganization means the planned elimination, addition, or \n     redistribution of functions or duties in an organization.\n       Representative rate means the fourth step of the grade for \n     a position subject to the General Schedule, the prevailing \n     rate for a position under a wage-board or similar wage-\n     determining procedure, and for other positions, the rate \n     designated by the agency as representative of the position.\n       Transfer of function means the transfer of the performance \n     of a continuing function from one competitive area and its \n     addition to one or more other competitive areas, except when \n     the function involved is virtually identical to functions \n     already being performed in the other competitive area(s) \n     affected; or the movement of the competitive area in which \n     the function is performed to another commuting area.\n       Undue interruption means a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by the employee \n     90 days after the employee has been placed in a different \n     position under this part. The 90-day standard should be \n     considered within the allowable limits of time and quality, \n     taking into account the pressures of priorities, deadlines, \n     and other demands. However, a work program would generally \n     not be unduly interrupted even if an employee needed more \n     than 90 days after the reduction in force to perform the \n     optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-day standard may \n     be extended if placement is made under this part to a low \n     priority program or to a vacant position.\n\n     Sec. 351.204. Responsibility of agency\n\n       Each agency covered by this part is responsible for \n     following and applying the regulations in this part when the \n     agency determines that a reduction force is necessary.\n\n                    Subpart C--Transfer of Function\n\n     Sec. 351.301. Applicability\n\n       (a) This subpart is applicable when the work of one or more \n     employees is moved from one competitive area to another as a \n     transfer of function regardless of whether or not the \n     movement is made under authority of a statute, reorganization \n     plan, or other authority.\n       (b) In a transfer of function, the function must cease in \n     the losing competitive area and continue in an identical form \n     in the gaining competitive area (i.e., in the gaining \n     competitive area, the function continues to be carried out by \n     competing employees rather than by noncompeting employees).\n\n     Sec. 351.302. Transfer of employees\n\n       (a) Before a reduction in force is made in connection with \n     the transfer of any or all of the functions of a competitive \n     area to another continuing competitive area, each competing \n     employee in a position identified with the transferring \n     function or functions shall be transferred to the continuing \n     competitive area without any change in the tenure of his or \n     her employment.\n       (b) An employee whose position is transferred under this \n     subpart solely for liquidation, and who is not identified \n     with an operating function specifically authorized at the \n     time of transfer to continue in operation more than 60 days, \n     is not a competing employee for other positions in the \n     competitive area gaining the function.\n       (c) Regardless of an employee's personal preference, an \n     employee has no right to\n\n[[Page S12545]]\n\n     transfer with his or her function, unless the alternative in \n     the competitive area losing the function is separation or \n     demotion.\n       (d) Except as permitted in paragraph (e) of this section, \n     the losing competitive area must use the adverse action \n     procedures found in 5 CFR part 752 if it chooses to separate \n     an employee who declines to transfer from his or her \n     function.\n       (e) The losing competitive area may, at its discretion, \n     include employees who decline to transfer with their function \n     as part of a concurrent reduction in force.\n       (f) An agency may not separate an employee who declines to \n     transfer with the function any sooner than it transfers \n     employees who chose to transfer with the function to the \n     gaining competitive area.\n       (g) Agencies may ask employees in a canvass letter whether \n     the employee wishes to transfer with the function when the \n     function transfers to a different local commuting area. The \n     canvass letter must give the employee information concerning \n     entitlements available to the employee if the employee \n     accepts the offer to transfer, and if the employee declines \n     the offer to transfer. An employee may later change and \n     initial acceptance offer without penalty. However, an \n     employee may not later change an initial declination of the \n     offer to transfer.\n\n     Sec. 351.303. Identification of positions with a transferring \n       function\n\n       (a) The competitive area losing the function is responsible \n     for identifying the positions of competing employees with the \n     transferring function. A competing employee is identified \n     with the transferring function on the basis of the employee's \n     official position. Two methods are provided to identify \n     employees with the transferring function:\n       (1) Identification Method One; and\n       (2) Identification Method Two.\n       (b) Identification Method One must be used to identify each \n     position to which it is applicable. Identification Method Two \n     is used only to identify positions to which Identification \n     Method One is not applicable.\n       (c) Under Identification Method One, a competing employee \n     is identified with a transferring function if--\n       (1) The employee performs the function during at least half \n     of his or her work time; or\n       (2) Regardless of the amount of time the employee performs \n     the function during his or her work time, the function \n     performed by the employee includes the duties controlling his \n     or her grade or rate of pay.\n       (3) In determining what percentage of time an employee \n     performs a function in the employee's official position, the \n     agency may supplement the employee's official position \n     description by the use of appropriate records (e.g., work \n     reports, organizational time logs, work schedules, etc.).\n       (d) Identification Method Two is applicable to employees \n     who perform the function during less than half of their work \n     time and are not otherwise covered by Identification Method \n     One. Under Identification Method Two, the losing competitive \n     area must identify the number of positions it needed to \n     perform the transferring function. To determine which \n     employees are identified for transfer, the losing competitive \n     area must establish a retention register in accordance with \n     this part that includes the name of each competing employee \n     who performed the function. Competing employees listed on the \n     retention register are identified for transfer in the inverse \n     order of their retention standing. If for any retention \n     register this procedure would result in the separation or \n     demotion by reduction in force at the losing competitive area \n     of any employee with higher retention standing, the losing \n     competitive area must identify competing employees on that \n     register for transfer in the order of their retention \n     standing.\n       (e)(1) The competitive area losing the function may permit \n     other employees to volunteer for transfer with the function \n     in place of employees identified under Identification Method \n     One or Identification Method Two. However, the competitive \n     area may permit these other employees to volunteer for \n     transfer only if no competing employee who is identified for \n     transfer under Identification Method One or Identification \n     Method Two is separated or demoted solely because a volunteer \n     transferred in place of him or her to the competitive area \n     that is gaining the function.\n       (2) If the total number of employees who volunteer for \n     transfer exceeds the total number of employees required to \n     perform the function in the competitive area that is gaining \n     the function, the losing competitive area may give preference \n     to the volunteers with the highest retention standing, or \n     make selections based on other appropriate criteria.\n\n                    Subpart D--Scope of Competition\n\n     Sec. 351.401. Determining retention standing\n\n       Each agency shall determine the retention standing of each \n     competing employee on the basis of the factors in this \n     subpart and in subpart E of this part.\n\n     Sec. 351.402. Competitive area\n\n       (a) Each agency shall establish competitive areas in which \n     employees compete for retention under this part.\n       (b) A competitive area must be defined solely in terms of \n     the agency's organizational unit(s) and geographical \n     location, and it must include all employees within the \n     competitive area so defined. A competitive area may consist \n     of all or part of an agency. The minimum competitive area is \n     a subdivision of the agency under separate administration \n     within the local commuting area.\n\n     Sec. 351.403. Competitive level\n\n       (a)(1) Each agency shall establish competitive levels \n     consisting of all positions in a competitive area which are \n     in the same grade (or occupational level) and classification \n     series, and which are similar enough in duties, qualification \n     requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that \n     an agency may reassign the incumbent of one position to any \n     of the other positions in the level without undue \n     interruption.\n       (2) Competitive level determinations are based on each \n     employee's official position, not the employee's personal \n     qualifications.\n       (b) Each agency shall establish separate competitive levels \n     according to the following categories:\n       (1) By service. Separate levels shall be established for \n     positions in the competitive service and in the excepted \n     service.\n       (2) By appointment authority. Separate levels shall be \n     established for excepted service positions filled under \n     different appointment authorities.\n       (3) By pay schedule. Separate levels shall be established \n     for positions under different pay schedules.\n       (4) By work schedule. Separate levels shall be established \n     for positions filled on a full-time, part-time, intermittent, \n     seasonal, or on-call basis. No distinction may be made among \n     employees in the competitive level on the basis of the number \n     of hours or weeks scheduled to be worked.\n       (5) By trainee status. Separate levels shall be established \n     for positions filled by an employee in a formally designated \n     trainee or developmental program having all of the \n     characteristics covered in Sec. 351.702(e)(1) through (e)(4) \n     of this part.\n       (c) An agency may not establish a competitive level based \n     solely upon:\n       (1) A difference in the number of hours or weeks scheduled \n     to be worked by other-than-full-time employees who would \n     otherwise be in the same competitive level;\n       (2) A requirement to work changing shifts;\n       (3) The grade promotion potential of the position; or\n       (4) A difference in the local wage areas in which wage \n     grade positions are located.\n\n     Sec. 351.404. Retention register\n\n       (a) When a competing employee is to be released from a \n     competitive level under this part, the agency shall establish \n     a separate retention register for that competitive level. The \n     retention register is prepared from the current retention \n     records of employees. Upon displacing another employee under \n     this part, an employee retains the same status and tenure in \n     the new position. Except for an employee on military duty \n     with a restoration right, the agency shall enter on the \n     retention register, in the order of retention standing, the \n     name of each competing employee who is:\n       (1) In the competitive level;\n       (2) Temporarily promoted from the competitive level by \n     temporary or term promotion.\n       (b)(1) The name of each employee serving under a time \n     limited appointment or promotion to a position in a \n     competitive level shall be entered on a list apart from the \n     retention register for that competitive level, along with the \n     expiration date of the action.\n       (2) The agency shall list, at the bottom of the list \n     prepared under paragraph b(1) of this section, the name of \n     each employee in the competitive level with a written \n     decision of removal under part 432 or 752 in this chapter.\n\n     Sec. 351.405. Demoted employees\n\n       An employee who has received a written decision under part \n     432 or 752 of this chapter to demote him or her competes \n     under this part from the position to which he or she will be \n     or has been demoted.\n\n                     Subpart E--Retention Standing\n\n     Sec. 351.501. Order of retention--competitive service\n\n       (a) Competing employees shall be classified on a retention \n     register on the basis of their tenure of employment, veteran \n     preference, length of service, and performance in descending \n     order as follows:\n       (1) By tenure group I, group II, group III; and\n       (2) Within each group by veteran preference subgroup AD, \n     subgroup A, subgroup B; and\n       (3) Within each subgroup by years of service as augmented \n     by credit for performance under Sec. 351.504, beginning with \n     the earliest service date.\n       (b) Groups are defined as follows:\n       (1) Group I includes each career employee who is not \n     serving a probationary period. An employee who acquires \n     competitive status and satisfies the service requirement for \n     career tenure when the employee's position is brought into \n     the competitive service is in group I as soon as the employee \n     completes any required probationary period for initial \n     appointment.\n       (2) Group II includes each career-conditional employee, and \n     each employee serving a probationary period.\n       (3) Group III includes all employees serving under \n     indefinite appointments, temporary appointments pending \n     establishment of a register, status quo appointments, term \n     appointments, and any other nonstatus nontemporary \n     appointments which meet the definition of provisional \n     appointments.\n       (c) Subgroups are defined as follows:\n       (1) Subgroup AD includes each preference eligible employee \n     who has a compensable service-connected disability of 30 \n     percent or more.\n\n[[Page S12546]]\n\n       (2) Subgroup A includes each preference eligible employee \n     not included in subgroup AD.\n       (3) Subgroup B includes each nonpreference eligible \n     employee.\n       (d) A retired member of a uniformed service is considered a \n     preference eligible under this part only if the member meets \n     at least one of the conditions of the following paragraphs \n     (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, except as limited by \n     paragraph (d)(4) or (d)(5):\n       (1) The employee's military retirement is based on \n     disability that either:\n       (i) Resulted from injury or disease received in the line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n       (ii) Was caused by an instrumentality of war incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 301 of title 38, United States Code.\n       (2) The employee's retired pay from a uniformed service is \n     not based upon 20 or more years of full-time active service, \n     regardless of when performed but not including periods of \n     active duty for training.\n       (3) The employee has been continuously employed in a \n     position covered by this part since November 30, 1964, \n     without a break in service of more than 30 days.\n       (4) An employee retired at the rank of major or above (or \n     equivalent) is considered a preference eligible under this \n     part if such employee is a disabled veteran as defined in \n     section 2108(2) of title 5, United States Code, as applied by \n     VEOA, and meets one of the conditions covered in paragraph \n     (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.\n       (5) An employee who is eligible for retired pay under \n     chapter 67 of title 10, United States Code, and who retired \n     at the rank of major or above (or equivalent) is considered a \n     preference eligible under this part at age 60, only if such \n     employee is a disabled veteran as defined in section 2108(2) \n     of title 5, United States Code, as applied by VEOA.\n\n     Sec. 351.502. Order of retention--excepted service\n\n       (a) Competing employees shall be classified on a retention \n     register in tenure groups on the basis of their tenure of \n     employment, veteran preference, length of service, and \n     performance in descending order as set forth under Sec. \n     351.501(a) for competing employees in the competitive \n     service.\n       (b) Groups are defined as follows:\n       (1) Group I includes each permanent employee whose \n     appointment carries no restriction or condition such as \n     conditional, indefinite, specific time limit, or trial \n     period.\n       (2) Group II includes each employee:\n       (i) Serving a trial period; or\n       (ii) Whose tenure is equivalent to a career-conditional \n     appointment in the competitive service in agencies having \n     such excepted appointments.\n       (3) Group III includes each employee:\n       (i) Whose tenure is indefinite (i.e., without specific time \n     limit), but not actually or potentially permanent;\n       (ii) Whose appointment has a specific time limitation of \n     more than 1 year; or\n       (iii) Who is currently employed under a temporary \n     appointment limited to 1 year or less, but who has completed \n     1 year of current continuous service under a temporary \n     appointment with no break in service of 1 workday or more.\n\n     Sec. 351.503. Length of service\n\n       (a) Each agency shall establish a service date for each \n     competing employee.\n       (b) An employee's service date is whichever of the \n     following dates reflects the employee's creditable service:\n       (1) The date the employee entered on duty, when he or she \n     has no previous creditable service;\n       (2) The date obtained by subtracting the employee's total \n     creditable previous service from the date he or she last \n     entered on duty; or\n       (3) The date obtained by subtracting from the date in \n     paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the service \n     equivalent allowed for performance ratings under Sec. \n     351.504.\n       (c) An employee who is a retired member of a uniformed \n     service is entitled to credit under this part for:\n       (1) The length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which \n     a campaign badge has been authorized; or\n       (2) The total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces if the employee is considered a preference eligible \n     under Sec. 351.501(d) of this part.\n       (d) Each agency shall adjust the service date for each \n     employee to withhold credit for noncreditable time.\n\n     Sec. 351.504. Credit for performance\n\n       (a) Ratings used. Only ratings of record as defined in Sec. \n     351.203 shall be used as the basis for granting additional \n     retention service credit in a reduction in force.\n       (b)(1) An employee's entitlement to additional retention \n     service credit for performance under this subpart shall be \n     based on the employee's three most recent ratings of record \n     received during the 4-year period prior to the date of \n     issuance of reduction in force notices, except as otherwise \n     provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section.\n       (2) To provide adequate time to determine employee \n     retention standing, an agency may provide for a cutoff date, \n     a specified number of days prior to the issuance of reduction \n     in force notices after which no new ratings of record will be \n     put on record and used for purposes of this subpart. When a \n     cutoff date is used, an employee will receive performance \n     credit for the three most recent ratings of record received \n     during the 4-year period prior to the cutoff date.\n       (3) To be creditable for purposes of this subpart, a rating \n     of record must have been issued to the employee, with all \n     appropriate reviews and signatures, and must also be on \n     record (i.e., the rating of record is available for use by \n     the office responsible for establishing retention registers).\n       (4) The awarding of additional retention service credit \n     based on performance for purposes of this subpart must be \n     uniformly and consistently applied within a competitive area, \n     and must be consistent with the agency's appropriate \n     issuance(s) that implement these policies. Each agency must \n     specify in its appropriate issuance(s):\n       (i) The conditions under which a rating of record is \n     considered to have been received for purposes of determining \n     whether it is within the 4-year period prior to either the \n     date the agency issues reduction in force notices or the \n     agency-established cutoff date for ratings of record, as \n     appropriate; and\n       (ii) If the agency elects to use a cutoff date, the number \n     of days prior to the issuance of reduction in force notices \n     after which no new ratings of record will be put on record \n     and used for purposes of this subpart.\n       (c) Missing ratings. Additional retention service credit \n     for employees who do not have three actual ratings of record \n     during the 4-year period prior to the date of issuance of \n     reduction in force notices or the 4-year period prior to the \n     agency-established cutoff date for ratings of record \n     permitted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be \n     determined as appropriate, and as follows:\n       (1) An employee who has not received any rating of record \n     during the 4-year period shall receive credit for performance \n     based on the modal rating for the summary level pattern that \n     applies to the employee's official position of record at the \n     time of the reduction in force.\n       (2) An employee who has received at least one but fewer \n     than three previous ratings of record during the 4-year \n     period shall receive credit for performance on the basis of \n     the value of the actual rating(s) of record divided by the \n     number of actual ratings received. If an employee has \n     received only two actual ratings of record during the period, \n     the value of the ratings is added together and divided by two \n     (and rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher \n     whole number) to determine the amount of additional retention \n     service credit. If an employee has received only one actual \n     rating of record during the period, its value is the amount \n     of additional retention service credit provided.\n\n     Sec. 351.505. Records\n\n       Each agency shall maintain the current correct records \n     needed to determine the retention standing of its competing \n     employees. The agency shall allow the inspection of its \n     retention registers and related records by an employee of the \n     agency to the extent that the registers and records have a \n     bearing on a specific action taken, or to be taken, against \n     the employee. The agency shall preserve intact all registers \n     and records relating to an employee for at least 1 year from \n     the date the employee is issued a specific notice.\n\n     Sec. 351.506. Effective date of retention standing\n\n       Except for applying the performance factor as provided in \n     Sec. 351.504:\n       (a) The retention standing of each employee released from a \n     competitive level in the order prescribed in Sec. 351.601 is \n     determined as of the date the employee is so released.\n       (b) The retention standing of each employee retained in a \n     competitive level as an exception under Sec. 351.606(b), Sec. \n     351.607, or Sec. 351.608, is determined as of the date the \n     employee would have been released had the exception not been \n     used. The retention standing of each employee retained under \n     any of these provisions remains fixed until completion of the \n     reduction in force action which resulted in the temporary \n     retention.\n       (c) When an agency discovers an error in the determination \n     of an employee's retention standing, it shall correct the \n     error and adjust any erroneous reduction-in-force action to \n     accord with the employee's proper retention standing as of \n     the effective date established by this section.\n\n               Subpart F--Release From Competitive Level\n\n     Sec. 351.601. Order of release from competitive level\n\n       (a) Each agency shall select competing employees for \n     release from a competitive level under this part in the \n     inverse order of retention standing, beginning with the \n     employee with the lowest retention standing on the retention \n     register. An agency may not release a competing employee from \n     a competitive level while retaining in that level an employee \n     with lower retention standing except:\n       (1) As required under Sec. 351.606 when an employee is \n     retained under a mandatory exception or under Sec. 351.806 \n     when an employee is entitled to a new written notice of \n     reduction in force; or\n       (2) As permitted under Sec. 351.607 when an employee is \n     retained under a permissive continuing exception or under \n     Sec. 351.608 when an employee is retained under a permissive \n     temporary exception.\n       (b) When employees in the same retention subgroup have \n     identical service dates and are tied for release from a \n     competitive level, the agency may select any tied employee \n     for release.\n\n     Sec. 351.602. Prohibitions\n\n       An agency may not release a competing employee from a \n     competitive level while retaining in that level an employee \n     with:\n\n[[Page S12547]]\n\n       (a) A specifically limited temporary appointment;\n       (b) A specifically limited temporary or term promotion.\n\n     Sec. 351.603. Actions subsequent to release from competitive \n       level\n\n       An employee reached for release from a competitive level \n     shall be offered assignment to another position in accordance \n     with subpart G of this part. If the employee accepts, the \n     employee shall be assigned to the position offered. If the \n     employee has no assignment right or does not accept an offer \n     under subpart G, the employee shall be furloughed or \n     separated.\n\n     Sec. 351.604. Use of furlough\n\n       (a) An agency may furlough a competing employee only when \n     it intends within 1 year to recall the employee to duty in \n     the position from which furloughed.\n       (b) An agency may not separate a competing employee under \n     this part while an employee with lower retention standing in \n     the same competitive level is on furlough.\n       (c) An agency may not furlough a competing employee for \n     more than 1 year.\n       (d) When an agency recalls employees to duty in the \n     competitive level from which furloughed, it shall recall them \n     in the order of their retention standing, beginning with \n     highest standing employee.\n\n     Sec. 351.605. Liquidation provisions\n\n       When an agency will abolish all positions in a competitive \n     area within 180 days, it must release employees in group and \n     subgroup order consistent with Sec. 351.601(a). At its \n     discretion, the agency may release the employees in group \n     order without regard to retention standing within a subgroup, \n     except as provided in Sec. 351.606. When an agency releases \n     an employee under this section, the notice to the employee \n     must cite this authority and give the date the liquidation \n     will be completed. An agency may also apply Secs. 351.607 and \n     351.608 in a liquidation.\n\n     Sec. 351.606. Mandatory exceptions\n\n       (a) Armed Forces restoration rights. When an agency applies \n     Sec. 351.601 or Sec. 351.605, it shall give retention \n     priorities over other employees in the same subgroup to each \n     group I or II employee entitled under 38 U.S.C. 2021 or 2024 \n     to retention for, as applicable, 6 months or 1 year after \n     restoration, as provided in part 353 of this chapter.\n       (b) Use of annual leave to reach initial eligibility for \n     retirement or continuance of health benefits. (1) An agency \n     shall make a temporary exception under this section to retain \n     an employee who is being involuntarily separated under this \n     part, and who elects to use annual leave to remain on the \n     agency's rolls after the effective date the employee would \n     otherwise have been separated by reduction in force, in order \n     to establish initial eligibility for immediate retirement \n     under 5 U.S.C. 8336, 8412, or 8414, and/or to establish \n     initial eligibility under 5 U.S.C. 8905 to continue health \n     benefits coverage into retirement.\n       (2) An agency shall make a temporary exception under this \n     section to retain an employee who is being involuntarily \n     separated under authority of part 752 of this chapter because \n     of the employee's decision to decline relocation (including \n     transfer of function), and who elects to use annual leave to \n     remain on the agency's rolls after the effective date the \n     employee would otherwise have been separated by adverse \n     action, in order to establish initial eligibility for \n     immediate retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336, 8412, or 8414, and/\n     or to establish initial eligibility under 5 U.S.C. 8905 to \n     continue health benefits coverage into retirement.\n       (3) An employee retained under paragraph (b) this section \n     must be covered by chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (4) An agency may not retain an employee under this section \n     past the date that the employee first becomes eligible for \n     immediate retirement, or for continuation of health benefits \n     into retirement, except that an employee may be retained long \n     enough to satisfy both retirement and health benefits \n     requirements.\n       (5) Except as permitted by 5 CFR 351.608(d), an agency may \n     not approve an employee's use of any other type of leave \n     after the employee has been retained under a temporary \n     exception authorized by paragraph (b) of this section.\n       (6) Annual leave for purposes of paragraph (b) of this \n     section is described in Sec. 630.212 of Title 5, CFR.\n       (c) Documentation. Each agency shall record on the \n     retention register, for inspection by each employee, the \n     reasons for any deviation from the order of release required \n     by Sec. 351.601 or Sec. 351.605.\n\n     Sec. 351.607. Permissive continuing exceptions\n\n       An agency may make exception to the order of release in \n     Sec. 351.601 and to the action provisions of Sec. 351.603 \n     when needed to retain an employee on duties that cannot be \n     taken over within 90 days and without undue interruption to \n     the activity by an employee with higher retention standing. \n     The agency shall notify in writing each higher-standing \n     employee reached for release from the same competitive level \n     of the reasons for the exception.\n\n     Sec. 351.608. Permissive temporary exceptions\n\n       (a) General. (1) In accordance with this section, an agency \n     may make a temporary exception to the order of release in \n     Sec. 351.601, and to the action provisions of Sec. 351.603, \n     when needed to retain an employee after the effective date of \n     a reduction in force. Except as otherwise provided in \n     paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, an agency may not \n     make a temporary exception for more than 90 days.\n       (2) After the effective date of a reduction in force \n     action, an agency may not amend or cancel the reduction in \n     force notice of an employee retained under a temporary \n     exception so as to avoid completion of the reduction in force \n     action.\n       (b) Undue interruption. An agency may make a temporary \n     exception for not more than 90 days when needed to continue \n     an activity without undue interruption.\n       (c) Government obligation. An agency may make a temporary \n     exception to satisfy a Government obligation to the retained \n     employee without regard to the 90-day limit set forth under \n     paragraph (a)(1) of this section.\n       (d) Sick leave. An agency may make a temporary exception to \n     retain on sick leave a lower standing employee covered by an \n     applicable leave system for Federal employees, who is on \n     approved sick leave on the effective date of the reduction in \n     force, for a period not to exceed the date the employee's \n     sick leave is exhausted. Use of sick leave for this purpose \n     must be in accordance with the requirements in part 630, \n     subpart D of this chapter (or other applicable leave system \n     for Federal employees). An agency may not approve an \n     employee's use of any other type of leave after the employee \n     has been retained under this paragraph (d).\n       (e)(1) An agency may make a temporary exception to retain \n     on accrued annual leave a lower standing employee who:\n       (i) Is being involuntarily separated under this part;\n       (ii) Is covered by a Federal leave system under authority \n     other than chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code; and,\n       (iii) Will attain first eligibility for an immediate \n     retirement benefit under 5 U.S.C. 8336, 8412, or 8414 (or \n     other authority), and/or establish eligibility under 5 U.S.C. \n     8905 (or other authority) to carry health benefits coverage \n     into retirement during the period represented by the amount \n     of the employee's accrued annual leave.\n       (2) An agency may not approve an employee's use of any \n     other type of leave after the employee has been retained \n     under this paragraph (e).\n       (3) This exception may not exceed the date the employee \n     first becomes eligible for immediate retirement or for \n     continuation of health benefits into retirement, except that \n     an employee may be retained long enough to satisfy both \n     retirement and health benefits requirements.\n       (4) Accrued annual leave includes all accumulated, accrued, \n     and restored annual leave, as applicable, in addition to \n     annual leave earned and available to the employee after the \n     effective date of the reduction in force. When approving a \n     temporary exception under this provision, an agency may not \n     advance annual leave or consider any annual leave that might \n     be credited to an employee's account after the effective date \n     of the reduction in force other than annual leave earned \n     while in an annual leave status.\n       (f) Other exceptions. An agency may make a temporary \n     exception under this section to extend an employee's \n     separation date beyond the effective date of the reduction in \n     force when the temporary retention of a lower standing \n     employee does not adversely affect the right of any higher \n     standing employee who is released ahead of the lower standing \n     employee. The agency may establish a maximum number of days, \n     up to 90 days, for which an exception may be approved.\n       (g) Notice to employees. When an agency approves an \n     exception for more than 30 days, it must:\n       (1) Notify in writing each higher standing employee in the \n     same competitive level reached for release of the reasons for \n     the exception and the date the lower standing employee's \n     retention will end; and\n       (2) List opposite the employee's name on the retention \n     register the reasons for the exception and the date the \n     employee's retention will end.\n\n            Subpart G--Assignment Rights (Bump and Retreat)\n\n      351.701 Assignment involving displacement\n\n       (a) General. When a group I or II competitive service \n     employee with a current annual performance rating of record \n     of minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent, or higher, \n     is released from a competitive level, an agency shall offer \n     assignment, rather than furlough or separate, in accordance \n     with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section to another \n     competitive position which requires no reduction, or the \n     least possible reduction, in representative rate. The \n     employee must be qualified for the offered position. The \n     offered position shall be in the same competitive area, last \n     at least 3 months, and have the same type of work schedule \n     (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or seasonal) as \n     the position from which the employee is released. Upon \n     accepting an offer of assignment, or displacing another \n     employee under this part, an employee retains the same status \n     and tenure in the new position. The promotion potential of \n     the offered position is not a consideration in determining \n     an employee's right of assignment.\n       (b) Lower subgroup--bumping. A released employee shall be \n     assigned in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and \n     bump to a position that:\n       (1) Is held by another employee in a lower tenure group or \n     in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group; and\n       (2) Is no more than three grades (or appropriate grade \n     intervals or equivalent) below the position from which the \n     employee was released.\n\n[[Page S12548]]\n\n       (c) Same subgroup--retreating. A released employee shall be \n     assigned in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this \n     section and retreat to a position that:\n       (1) Is held by another employee with lower retention \n     standing in the same tenure group and subgroup;\n       (2) Is not more than three grades (or appropriate grade \n     intervals or equivalent) below the position from which the \n     employee was released, except that for a preference eligible \n     employee with a compensable service-connected disability of \n     30 percent or more the limit is five grades (or appropriate \n     grade intervals or equivalent); and\n       (3) Is the same position, or an essentially identical \n     position, formerly held by the released employee as a \n     competing employee in a Federal agency (i.e., when held by \n     the released employee in an executive, legislative, or \n     judicial branch agency, the position would have been placed \n     in tenure groups I, II, or III, or equivalent). In \n     determining whether a position is essentially identical, the \n     determination is based on the competitive level criteria \n     found in Sec. 351.403, but not necessarily in regard to the \n     respective grade, classification series, type of work \n     schedule, or type of service, of the two positions.\n       (d) Limitation. An employee with a current annual \n     performance rating of record of minimally successful (Level \n     2) or equivalent may be assigned under paragraph (c) of this \n     section only to a position held by another employee with a \n     current annual performance rating of record no higher than \n     minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent.\n       (e) Pay rates. (1) The determination of equivalent grade \n     intervals shall be based on a comparison of representative \n     rates.\n       (2) Each employee's assignment rights shall be determined \n     on the basis of the pay rates in effect on the date of \n     issuance of specific reduction-in-force notices, except that \n     when it is officially known on the date of issuance of \n     notices that new pay rates have been approved and will become \n     effective by the effective date of the reduction in force, \n     assignment rights shall be determined on the basis of the new \n     pay rates.\n       (f)(1) In determining applicable grades (or grade \n     intervals) under Secs. 351. 701(b)(2) and 351.701(c)(2), the \n     agency uses the grade progression of the released employee's \n     position of record to determine the grade (or interval) \n     limits of the employee's assignment rights.\n       (2) For positions covered by the General Schedule, the \n     agency must determine whether a one-grade, two-grade, or \n     mixed grade interval progression is applicable to the \n     position of the released employee.\n       (3) For positions not covered by the General Schedule, the \n     agency must determine the normal line of progression for each \n     occupational series and grade level to determine the grade \n     (or interval) limits of the released employee's assignment \n     rights. If the agency determines that there is no normal line \n     of progression for an occupational series and grade level, \n     the agency provides the released employee with assignment \n     rights to positions within three actual grades lower on a \n     one-grade basis. The normal line of progression may include \n     positions in different pay systems.\n       (4) For positions where no grade structure exists, the \n     agency determines a line of progression for each occupation \n     and pay rate, and provides assignment rights to positions \n     within three grades (or intervals) lower on that basis.\n       (5) If the released employee holds a position that is less \n     than three grades above the lowest grade in the applicable \n     classification system (e.g., the employee holds a GS-2 \n     position), the agency provides the released employee with \n     assignment rights up to three actual grades lower on a one-\n     grade basis in other pay systems.\n\n     Sec. 351.702. Qualifications for assignment\n\n       (a) Except as provided in Sec. 351.703, an employee is \n     qualified for assignment under Sec. 351.701 if the employee:\n       (1) Meets the standards and requirements for the position, \n     including any minimum educational requirement, and any \n     selective placement factors established by the agency;\n       (2) Is physically qualified, with reasonable accommodation \n     where appropriate, to perform the duties of the position;\n       (3) Has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills \n     needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position \n     without undue interruption. This determination includes \n     recency of experience, when appropriate.\n       (b) An employee who is released from a competitive level \n     during a leave of absence because of a corpensable injury may \n     not be denied an assignment right solely because the employee \n     is not physically qualified for the duties of the position if \n     the physical disqualification resulted from the compensable \n     injury.\n       (c) If an agency determines, on the basis of evidence \n     before it, that a preference eligible employee who has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of a \n     position to which the employee would otherwise have been \n     assigned under this part, the agency must notify the employee \n     of the reasons for the determination.\n       (e) An agency may formally designate as a trainee or \n     developmental position a position in a program with all of \n     the following characteristics:\n       (1) The program must have been designed to meet the \n     agency's needs and requirements for the development of \n     skilled personnel;\n       (2) The program must have been formally designated, with \n     its provisions made known to employees and supervisors;\n       (3) The program must be developmental by design, offering \n     planned growth in duties and responsibilities, and providing \n     advancement in recognized lines of career progression; and\n       (4) The program must be fully implemented, with the \n     participants chosen through standard selection procedures. To \n     be considered qualified for assignment under Sec. 351.701 to \n     a formally designated trainee or developmental position in a \n     program having all of the characteristics covered in \n     paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, an \n     employee must meet all of the conditions required for \n     selection and entry into the program.\n\n     Sec. 351.703. Exception to qualifications\n\n       An agency may assign an employee to a vacant position under \n     Sec. 351.201(b) or Sec. 351.701 of this part if:\n       (a) The employee meets any minimum education requirement \n     for the position; and\n       (b) The agency determines that the employee has the \n     capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to \n     satisfactorily perform the duties and responsibilities of the \n     position.\n\n     Sec. 351.704. Rights and prohibitions\n\n       (a)(1) An agency may satisfy an employee's right to \n     assignment under Sec. 351.701 by assignment to a vacant \n     position under Sec. 351.201(b), or by assignment under any \n     applicable administrative assignment provisions of Sec. \n     351.705, to a position having a representative rate equal to \n     that the employee would be entitled under Sec. 351.701. An \n     agency may also offer an employee assignment under Sec. \n     351.201(b) to a vacant position in lieu of separation by \n     reduction in force under 5 CFR part 351. Any offer of \n     assignment under Sec. 351.201(b) to a vacant position must \n     meet the requirements set forth under Sec. 351.701.\n       (2) An agency may, at its discretion, choose to offer a \n     vacant other-than-full-time position to a full-time employee \n     or to offer a vacant full-time position to an other-than-\n     full-time employee in lieu of separation by reduction in \n     force.\n       (b) Section 351.701 does not:\n       (1) Authorize or permit an agency to assign an employee to \n     a position having a higher representative rate;\n       (2) Authorize or permit an agency to displace a full-time \n     employee by an other-than-full-time employee, or to satisfy \n     an other-than-full-time employee's right to assignment by \n     assigning the employee to a vacant full-time position.\n       (3) Authorize or permit an agency to displace an other-\n     than-full-time employee by a full-time employee, or to \n     satisfy a full-time employee's right to assignment by \n     assigning the employee to a vacant other-than-full-time \n     position.\n       (4) Authorize or permit an agency to assign a competing \n     employee to a temporary position (i.e., a position under an \n     appointment not to exceed 1 year), except as an offer of \n     assignment in lieu of separation by reduction in force under \n     this part when the employee has no right to a position under \n     Sec. 351.701 or Sec. 351.704(a)(1) of this part. This option \n     does not preclude an agency from, as an alternative, also \n     using a temporary position to reemploy a competing employee \n     following separation by reduction in force under this part.\n       (5) Authorize or permit an agency to displace an employee \n     or to satisfy a competing employee's right to assignment by \n     assigning the employee to a position with a different type of \n     work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or \n     seasonal) than the position from which the employee is \n     released.\n\n     Sec. 351.705. Administrative assignment\n\n       (a) An agency may, at its discretion, adopt provisions \n     which:\n       (1) Permit a competing employee to displace an employee \n     with lower retention standing in the same subgroup consistent \n     with Sec. 351.701 when the agency cannot make an equally \n     reasonable assignment by displacing an employee in a lower \n     subgroup;\n       (2) Permit an employee in subgroup III-AD to displace an \n     employee in subgroup III-A or III-B, or permit an employee in \n     subgroup III-A to displace an employee is subgroup III-B \n     consistent with Sec. 351.701; or\n       (3) Provide competing employees in the excepted service \n     with assignment rights to other positions under the same \n     appointing authority on the same basis as assignment rights \n     provided to competitive service employees under Sec. 351.701 \n     and in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section.\n       (b) Provisions adopted by an agency under paragraph (a) of \n     this section:\n       (1) Shall be consistent with this part;\n       (2) Shall be uniformly and consistently applied in any one \n     reduction in force;\n       (3) May not provide for the assignment of an other-than-\n     full-time employee to a full-time position;\n       (4) May not provide for the assignment of a full-time \n     employee to an other-than-full-time position;\n       (5) May not provide for the assignment of an employee in a \n     competitive service position to a position in the excepted \n     service; and\n       (6) May not provide for the assignment of an employee in an \n     excepted position to a position in the competitive service.\n\n                     Subpart H--Notice to Employee\n\n     Sec. 351.801. Notice period\n\n       (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, \n     each competing employee selected for release from a \n     competitive level under this part is entitled to a specific \n     written notice at least 60 full days before the effective \n     date of release.\n\n[[Page S12549]]\n\n       (2) At the same time an agency issues a notice to an \n     employee, it must give a written notice to the exclusive \n     representative(s), as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(16), as \n     applied by the CAA, of each affected employee at the time of \n     the notice. When a significant number of employees will be \n     separated, an agency must also satisfy the notice \n     requirements of Secs. 351.803 (b) and (c).\n       (b) When a reduction in force is caused by circumstances \n     not reasonably foreseeable, an agency may provide a notice \n     period of less than 60 days, but the shortened notice period \n     must cover at least 30 full days before the effective date of \n     release.\n       (c) The notice period begins the day after the employee \n     receives the notice.\n       (d) When an agency retains an employee under Sec. 351.607 \n     or Sec. 351.608, the notice to the employee shall cite the \n     date on which the retention period ends as the effective date \n     of the employee's release from the competitive level.\n\n     Sec. 351.802. Content of notice\n\n       (a)(1) The action to be taken, the reasons for the action, \n     and its effective date;\n       (2) The employee's competitive area, competitive level, \n     subgroup, service date, and three most recent ratings of \n     record received during the last 4 years;\n       (3) The place where the employee may inspect the \n     regulations and record pertinent to this case;\n       (4) The reasons for retaining a lower-standing employee in \n     the same competitive level under Sec. 351.607 or Sec. \n     351.608;\n       (5) Information on reemployment rights, except as permitted \n     by Sec. 351.803(a); and\n       (6) The employee's right, as applicable, to grieve under a \n     negotiated grievance procedure.\n       (b) When an agency issues an employee a notice, the agency \n     must, upon the employee's request, provide the employee with \n     a copy of retention regulations found in part 351 of this \n     chapter.\n\n     Sec. 351.803. Notice of eligibility for reemployment and \n       other placement assistance\n\n       (a) The employee must be given a release to authorize, at \n     his or her option, the release of his or her resume and other \n     relevant employment information for employment referral to \n     State dislocated worker unit(s) and potential public or \n     private sector employers. The employee must also be given \n     information concerning how to apply both for unemployment \n     insurance through the appropriate State program and benefits \n     available under the State dislocated worker unit(s), as \n     designated or created under title III of the Job Training \n     Partnership Act, and an estimate of severance pay (if \n     eligible).\n       (b) When 50 or more employees in a competitive area receive \n     separation notices under this part, the agency must provide \n     written notification of the action, at the same time it \n     issues specific notices of separation to employees, to:\n       (1) The State dislocated worker unit(s), as designated or \n     created under title III of the Job Training Partnership Act;\n       (2) The chief elected official of local government(s) \n     within which these separations will occur; and\n       (c) The notice required by paragraph (b) of this section \n     must include:\n       (1) The number of employees to be separated from the agency \n     by reduction in force (broken down by geographic area);\n       (2) The effective date of the separations.\n\n     Sec. 351.804. Expiration of notice\n\n       (a) A notice expires when followed by the action specified, \n     or by an action less severe than specified, in the notice or \n     in an amendment made to the notice before the agency takes \n     the action.\n       (b) An agency may not take the action before the effective \n     date in the notice; instead, the agency may cancel the \n     reduction in force notice and issue a new notice subject to \n     this subpart.\n\n     Sec. 351.805. New notice required\n\n       (a) An employee is entitled to a written notice of, as \n     appropriate, at least 60 or 120 full days if the agency \n     decides to take an action more severe than first specified.\n       (b) An agency must give an employee an amended written \n     notice if the reduction in force is changed to a later date. \n     A reduction in force action taken after the date specified in \n     the notice given to the employee is not invalid for that \n     reason, except when it is challenged by a higher-standing \n     employee in the competitive level who is reached out of order \n     for a reduction in force action as a result of the change in \n     dates.\n       (c) An agency must give an employee an amended written \n     notice and allow the employee to decide whether to accept a \n     better offer of assignment under subpart G of this part that \n     becomes available before or on the effective date of the \n     reduction in force. The agency must give the employee the \n     amended notice regardless of whether the employee has \n     accepted or rejected a previous offer of assignment, provided \n     that the employee has not voluntarily separated from his or \n     her official position.\n\n     Sec. 351.806. Status during notice period\n\n       When possible, the agency shall retain the employee on \n     active duty status during the notice period. When in an \n     emergency the agency lacks work or funds for all or part of \n     the notice period, it may place the employee on annual leave \n     with or without his or her consent, or leave without pay with \n     his or her consent, or in a nonpay status without his or her \n     consent.\n\n     Sec. 351.807. Certification of Expected Separation\n\n       (a) For the purpose of enabling otherwise eligible \n     employees to be considered for eligibility to participate in \n     dislocated worker programs under the Job Training Partnership \n     Act administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, an agency \n     may issue a Certificate of Expected Separation to a competing \n     employee who the agency believes, with a reasonable degree of \n     certainty, will be separated from Federal employment by \n     reduction in force procedures under this part. A \n     certification may be issued up to 6 months prior to the \n     effective date of the reduction in force.\n       (b) This certification may be issued to a competing \n     employee only when the agency determines:\n       (1) There is a good likelihood the employee will be \n     separated under this part;\n       (2) Employment opportunities in the same or similar \n     position in the local commuting area are limited or \n     nonexistent;\n       (3) Placement opportunities within the employee's own or \n     other Federal agencies in the local commuting area are \n     limited or nonexistent; and\n       (4) If eligible for optional retirement, the employee has \n     not filed a retirement application or otherwise indicated in \n     writing an intent to retire.\n       (c) A certification is to be addressed to each individual \n     eligible employee and must be signed by an appropriate agency \n     official. A certification must contain the expected date of \n     reduction in force, a statement that each factor in paragraph \n     (b) of this section has been satisfied, and a description of \n     Job Training Partnership Act programs, the Interagency \n     Placement Program, and the Reemployment Priority List.\n       (d) A certification may not be used to satisfy any of the \n     notice requirements elsewhere in this subpart.\n\n                Subpart I--Appeals and Corrective Action\n\n     Sec. 351.902. Correction by agency\n\n       When an agency decides that an action under this part was \n     unjustified or unwarranted and restores an individual to the \n     former grade or rate of pay held or to an intermediate grade \n     or rate of pay, it shall make the restoration retroactively \n     effective to the date of the improper action. \n                                  ____\n\n\n     Interim Section 102(b) Report: Electronic Information Systems\n\n [Review and Report on the Applicability to the Legislative Branch of \nSection 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended; submitted by \nthe Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance Pursuant to Section \n   102(b) of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. \n                      1302(b), November 13, 2001]\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       The Board of Directors (``the Board'') is charged with \n     monitoring Federal law relating to terms and conditions of \n     employment and access to public services and accommodations. \n     The Congressional Accountability Act instructs the Board to \n     report to Congress biannually: (1) whether or not those \n     provisions are applicable to the Legislative Branch; and (2) \n     whether inapplicable provisions should be made applicable to \n     the Legislative Branch. Section 102(b)(1)&(2) of the \n     Congressional Accountability Act (CAA), (2 U.S.C. \n     1302(b)(1)&(2)). However, the CAA does not prohibit the Board \n     from reporting to Congress on an interim basis, in \n     appropriate circumstances, when such a report would best \n     effectuate the purposes of the statute.\n\n\n         II. Section 508, Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998\n\n       The Board's December 31, 2000 Report did not address \n     certain 1998 amendments \\1\\ to Section 508 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), which \n     subsequently were implemented by Executive Branch regulation \n     in June 2001.\\2\\ The essence of these amendments requires \n     that Executive Branch agencies provide their disabled \n     employees and disabled members of the public with access to \n     an agency's electronic data and information. For example, \n     visually impaired persons must be able to utilize agency web \n     sites through software that converts visual information to an \n     effective audio format. In those rare instances where such \n     compliance would impose an undue burden on an agency or \n     department, Section 508 permits delivery of those services in \n     alternate manner. Section 508 does not apply to the employing \n     offices covered by the CAA, or to the Congressional \n     instrumentalities GAO, GPO, or Library of Congress.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ P.L. 105-220, 112 Stat. 1202, Sec. 408(a) (Aug. 7, 1998).\n     \\2\\ 65 FR 80500 (Dec. 21, 2000), codified at, 36 CFR part \n     1194 (2001).\n     \\3\\ The CAA applies the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (``ADA'') directly to these instrumentalities. Some of the \n     other statutes referenced in the CAA, such as Occupational \n     Safety & Health Act (``OSHA'') and the Family Medical Leave \n     Act (`` FMLA''), are applied to GAO and the Library of \n     Congress through the CAA, as regulated by the Office of \n     Compliance. The Office has no regulatory authority of any \n     kind with respect to GPO.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The section 508 amendments originated in Senate Bill S. \n     1579. The Labor and Human Resources Committee's Report \n     articulated that this legislation stemmed primarily from the \n     need to ``reestablish[] and realign[] the national workforce \n     development and training system to make it more user-friendly \n     and accessible.'' Sen. Rept. 105-166 at 2 (Mar. 2, 1998). \n     Thus, the legislation was primarily perceived as a vocational \n     rehabilitation and training matter. However, there is no \n     doubt that the particular purpose of the\n\n[[Page S12550]]\n\n     proposed amendments to section 508 was to: require[] each \n     Federal agency to procure, maintain, and use electronic \n     and information technology that allows individuals with \n     disabilities the same access to information technology as \n     individuals without disabilities. Id. at 58.\n       The section 508 amendments require that employees and the \n     general public, irrespective of disability, have comparable \n     access to electronic information systems. The Senate proposal \n     was incorporated as part of the Senate amendments to H.R. \n     1385, the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and largely \n     adopted in the Conference Report.\\4\\\n\n\n III. The Office's Existing Efforts to Enhance Electronic Information \n        Access under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n\n       The Office of Compliance already maintains an active role \n     regarding employee accessibility to electronic information \n     systems through the requirements of the Americans With \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which is applied to employing \n     offices of the Congress in the Congressional Accountability \n     Act (''Act''). Section 201(a) of the Act (2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1311(a)) states, in relevant part, that ``[a]ll \n     personnel actions affecting covered employees shall be made \n     free from any discrimination based on .  .  . (3) disability \n     within the meaning of .  .  . sections 102 through 104 of the \n     .  .  . [ADA]''.\\5\\\n       Section 210 of the Act (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331) applies the \n     ADA's public access requirements to employing offices, and \n     authorizes ADA court proceedings regarding alleged violations \n     by GAO, GPO, and the Library of Congress. The executive \n     branch regulations implementing the public access provisions \n     of the ADA have included the requirements at 28 CFR \n     Sec. 35.160 that:\n       (a) A public entity shall take appropriate steps to ensure \n     that communications with applicants, participants, and \n     members of the public with disabilities are as effective as \n     communications with others.\n       (b)(1) A public entity shall furnish appropriate auxiliary \n     aids and services where necessary to afford an individual \n     with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and \n     enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity \n     conducted by a public entity.\n       28 CFR Sec. 36.302 also requires in relevant part:\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall make reasonable \n     modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when the \n     modifications are necessary to afford goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to \n     individuals with disabilities, unless the public \n     accommodation can demonstrate that making the modifications \n     would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations. .  .  \n     .\n       In 28 CFR Sec. 36.303, the concept of ``auxiliary aids and \n     services'' is set forth as one form of ``reasonable \n     accommodation'':\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall take those steps \n     that may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a \n     disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or \n     otherwise treated differently than other individuals because \n     of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the \n     public accommodation can demonstrate that taking those steps \n     would fundamentally alter the nature of the .  .  . services \n     .  .  . being offered or would result in an undue burden. .  \n     .  .\n       (b) Examples. The term ``auxiliary aids and services'' \n     includes:\n       (1) Qualified interpreters, note takers, computer-aided \n     transcription services, written materials, telephone handset \n     amplifiers, assistive listening devices, assistive listening \n     systems, telephones compatible with hearing aids, closed \n     caption decoders, open and closed captioning, \n     telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's), \n     videotext displays, or other effective methods of making \n     aurally delivered materials available to individuals with \n     hearing impairments;\n       (2) Qualified readers, taped texts, audio recordings,\n       Brailled materials, large printed materials, or other \n     effective methods of making visually delivered materials \n     available to individuals with visual impairments;  .  .  .  .\n       (c) Effective Communication. A public accommodation shall \n     furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where \n     necessary to ensure effective communication with individuals \n     with disabilities.\n       These ADA regulations, already promulgated by the Attorney \n     General pursuant to Title II and Title III of the ADA, and in \n     use in the executive branch, were among those which the Board \n     of Directors of the Office of Compliance submitted to the \n     Senate on January 7, 1997 for final adoption as regulations \n     under the Congressional Accountability Act. The same proposed \n     regulations were submitted to the House two days later. \n     Congress did not approve these proposed regulations. \n     Consequently, pursuant to section 411 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1411), the Executive Branch regulations became \n     applicable ``by default'' to all employing offices under the \n     CAA.\n       In December, 1998, the General Counsel of the Office of \n     Compliance submitted a Report on Inspections for Compliance \n     with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as required by \n     section 210(f)(2) of the CAA. (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(f)(2)). The \n     Report outlined the requirements of the ADA, including the \n     fact that ``[t]he ADA requires that aids to communication, \n     called auxiliary aids, be furnished to persons with \n     disabilities when necessary for effective communication.'' \n     Id. at 8. The Report (at 16) also highlighted the role of \n     electronic communication in this effort:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\4\\ H. Conf. Rept. 105-659, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (July 29, \n     1998).\n     \\5\\ Section 201 of the CAA also applies, for purposes of \n     proscribing employment discrimination, the meaning of \n     ``disability'' as set forth in section 501 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act. However, section 508 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act is a separate and free standing provision \n     and is not incorporated into the CAA simply by reason of the \n     application of section 501.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Legislative Information on the Internet.--A large amount of \n     legislative information is now available on the Internet. The \n     Library of Congress's Thomas site (http://www.loc.gov), for \n     example, has the text of bills and information about their \n     status; copies of the Congressional Record; committee \n     schedules, reports, and selected hearing transcripts; House \n     and Senate Roll Call Votes; and links to other sites with \n     legislative information. Most Senators and Members of the \n     House of Representatives also maintain web sites as a means \n     of communicating with their constituents.\n       Persons with disabilities are often avid users of the \n     Internet and other electronic information services. In \n     addition to making legislative information readily available \n     to individuals with hearing or mobility impairments, the \n     Internet also serves people who are blind. Text on the \n     Internet can be read aloud by a computer equipped with a \n     speech synthesizer and text-to-speech software or can be \n     converted to a Braille format.\n       The usability of the web site for a person who is blind \n     depends on its design. For example, if image maps are used on \n     a Member's web site, there should be an alternate method of \n     selecting options so the text-to-speech software can process \n     the information. Unless this is done, it will be difficult or \n     impossible for a blind user to get access to information on \n     the site. . . .\n       In the past several years, the Office staff has also \n     responded to a number of inquiries from employing offices \n     about the 1998 section 508 amendments to the Rehabilitation \n     Act. The Office has informed offices regarding the section \n     508 required amendments in the Federal Acquisition Regulation \n     (FAR), and has further explained that ``the public access \n     provisions of the CAA do not apply section 508 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act to the entities of the Legislative Branch. \n     . . .''\n       Because the CAA does not give the Office or its General \n     Counsel authority to require that electronic information \n     systems meet applicable accessibility standards absent a \n     specific complaint from an individual with a particular \n     disability, our ADA enforcement activities--as distinct from \n     our educational activities--have been necessarily restricted \n     and reactive rather than pro-active.\n\n\n        IV. The Impact of Section 508's Implementing Regulations\n\n       On December 21, 2000, the Architectural and Transportation \n     Barriers Compliance Safety Board published its final \n     regulations including ``standards setting forth a definition \n     of electronic and information technology and the technical \n     and functional performance criteria necessary for such \n     technology to comply with section 508.'' See note 2 supra. \n     The effective date of those regulations was February 20, \n     2001. The final amendments to the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulation implementing section 508 were published on April \n     25, 2001, and went into effect as of June 25, 2001.\\6\\ There \n     now exists a web site concerning section 508 standards, \n     issues, and developments in the executive branch: \n     www.section508.gov. Individuals with specific questions are \n     encouraged to visit that site.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\6\\ 66 FR 20893 (Apr. 25, 2001), codified at, 48 CFR part 39 \n     (2001).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       There are substantial differences between the standards \n     mandated by Title II of the ADA and by Section 508 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act. Although the two regulatory schemes \n     overlap, there is little question that Section 508 applies \n     significantly more stringent technical requirements for \n     electronic information technology accessibility. While the \n     ADA requires that public entities--including employing \n     offices under the CAA--provide reasonably equivalent access \n     to information, the methodology for delivering that access \n     remains flexible. Thus, for example, if a sight impaired \n     employee or member of the public cannot access material on an \n     employing office's web site, under ADA that office can \n     satisfy its responsibility to either individual by having the \n     relevant material read to that person. Under Section 508, \n     however, an agency of the executive branch must offer \n     technology through its web site that allows all individuals, \n     with or without disabilities, directly to obtain the \n     information through the site itself. For instance, an agency \n     must upgrade its site with a capacity to reformat the \n     information for sight impaired individuals by means of a \n     ``screen reader,'' which translates the visual material on a \n     computer screen into automated audible output.\\7\\ Thus, \n     section 508 requires that the means to access information \n     exist within the electronic medium itself.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\7\\ This document is not the appropriate venue for any \n     extensive technical description of the differences between \n     section 508 and ADA requirements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Consequently, this Office's existing authority, confined to \n     enforcement case-by-case of the ADA requirements and the \n     provision of general information about section 508, does not \n     fully effectuate the public policy goal of the Section 508 \n     Amendments.\n       The Office, therefore, wishes to amplify its December 31, \n     2000 Report to Congress by reporting that the legislative \n     branch is not mandated to meet the higher level of electronic \n     information accessibility which Congress requires of the \n     executive branch pursuant to section 508.\n\n[[Page S12551]]\n\n            V. The Recommendation of the Board of Directors\n\n       When the section 508 amendments were enacted as part of the \n     Workforce Investment Act of 1998, much if not most of the \n     technology necessary to carry out its substantive mandates \n     did not exist. Indeed, even at this stage, some in the \n     electronic information community consider fully compliant \n     technology to be non-existent. In any event, the Executive \n     Branch is fully engaged in reaching Section 508 compliance. \n     Furthermore, both the Library of Congress and the Government \n     Printing Office, each of which maintains extensive and \n     heavily visited web sites (GPO operates approximately 30 web \n     sites for other executive and legislative branch agencies), \n     have announced that they are proceeding voluntarily to \n     achieve section 508 compliance. However, absent Congressional \n     action, universal legislative branch electronic information \n     accessibility will remain optional, and not a legal \n     requirement.\n       The Congress commissioned this Board to monitor and comment \n     on all laws which concern ``access to public services and \n     accommodations.'' This responsibility of the Board helps \n     ensure that the Legislative Branch is kept apprised regarding \n     advances in access to electronic information technology, and \n     is advised ``whether such provisions should be made \n     applicable to the legislative branch.''\n       Pursuant to that mandate, the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance recommends that the Congress enact \n     amendments to sections 201 and 210 of the CAA to incorporate \n     the substantive employee access and public access \n     requirements of section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n     for all CAA-covered employing offices. We further suggest \n     that the Office's existing section 401 and section 210 \n     regulatory and enforcement authorities covering both employee \n     and public access to electronic information systems be \n     extended to include section 508 substantive requirements. \n     Finally, we suggest that section 508 requirements regarding \n     employee and public access also be applied to the Government \n     Printing Office, Government Accounting Office, and Library of \n     Congress.\n       The Office of Compliance stands ready to participate in the \n     coordination of section 508 training and education for those \n     in Congress and in the instrumentalities who are responsible \n     for the maintenance and development of electronic information \n     systems.\n       This Supplemental Section 102(b) Report is also available \n     on the web site of the Office of Compliance, at \n     www.compliance.gov.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/06/senate-section/article/S12551-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. BYRD, from the Committee on Appropriations:\n       Special Report entitled ``Further Revised Allocation to \n     Subcommittees of Budget Totals for Fiscal Year 2002'' (Rept. \n     No. 107-110).\n       By Mr. HARKIN, from the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry, without amendment:\n       S. 1519: A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural \n     Development Act to provide farm credit assistance for \n     activated reservists.\n       By Mr. CLELAND, from the Committee on Armed Services, \n     without amendment and with a preamble:\n       S.

A bill to designate the National Foreign Affairs Training \nCenter as the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training \nCenter; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, it is a great honor to rise today to \nintroduce legislation that would name the Department of State's Foreign \nAffairs Training Center after former Secretary of State George P. \nShultz. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Helms, Hagel, and \nDomenici in honoring this outstanding public servant.\n  Many of my most productive and enjoyable foreign policy experiences \nwere those involving George Shultz as Secretary of State. Secretary \nShultz celebrated the visits of foreign leaders to Washington by \ninviting hundreds of people to a luncheon or dinner at the State \nDepartment. If the guests were, for example, the President of Brazil, \nShultz would identify prominent Brazilian business leaders, \njournalists, and scholars in the United States and a host of comparable \nAmericans with interests in Brazil. He sprinkled the invitation list \nwith members of the Reagan Administration and both houses of Congress. \nOn most occasions, I was invited and introduced to a host of new \nfriends deeply interested in international affairs.\n  When I became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in \n1985, the Secretary invited me to breakfast about once a month when \nCongress was in session. He always had a list of Reagan Administration \nlegislative objectives for me to achieve and good suggestions on people \nand resources needed to accomplish each task.\n  In a two year period, I chaired extensive hearings on the \nPhilippines, South Africa, and the prospects for democracy in Central \nAmerica. Though the recommendations of Secretary Shultz, I co-chaired \nPresidential election observer efforts in Guatemala, El Salvador and \nthe Philippines. These experiences led to considerable post-election \ninterest and diplomacy, especially in the Philippines. These events and \nthe influence of Secretary Shultz played a large role in the context of \nmy book ``Letters to the Next President''.\n  In recent years, I have been a participant in the Asia Roundtable \nmeetings sponsored by Stanford University and inspired by the \nleadership of George Shultz and his ability to bring statesmen from \neach Asian country to his meetings. Similarly, he brings distinguished \nleaders from all over the world to Stanford University Advisory \nCommittee meetings and I have been the beneficiary of those rich \nexperiences.\n  My continuing service in the United States Senate has received \nconstant support from Secretary Shultz. His letters and wise counsel \nduring conversations have made a significant difference in my \nunderstanding of complex issues. From the years at the State Department \ndinners to the present, he has introduced me to a legion of friends in \nmany countries, and\n\n[[Page S12553]]\n\nthis network of friends and advisors has been invaluable.\n  Secretary Shultz decided to back President George W. Bush very early \nin the Presidential Campaign of 2000 and has offered strong support to \nPresident Bush's bold diplomacy and the importance of employing and \nretaining the best foreign service personnel to achieve our \ninternational goals. Naming the National Foreign Affairs Training \nCenter after George P. Shultz will be a fitting tribute to a great \npublic servant who continues to exemplify the hallmark qualities in \nUnited States international leadership.\n  This bill has the full support of the Department of State. In fact, \nit is at Secretary Powell's request that we are seeking to expedite its \nconsideration. Secretary Powell has invited former Secretary Shultz to \nvisit Washington in January. I understand that Secretary Powell hopes \nto announce the dedication of the Foreign Affairs Training Center \nduring Shultz's stay in Washington. It is my hope that the Majority and \nMinority Leader and the Members of the Senate will fine the opportunity \nto move this important legislation in the near term. Congressman Hyde \nand Lantos have offered the same legislation in the House and have \nsimilar hopes for speedy passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1780. A bill to provide increased flexibility Governmentwide for \nthe procurement of property and services to facilitate the defense \nagainst terrorism, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nhelp Federal agencies fight our Nation's war against terrorism. I am \nintroducing this bill at the request of the President and on behalf of \nmyself as ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee and \nSenator Warner, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  For many years, we have accepted that the Federal Government pays a \npremium, both in dollars and time spent, for the goods and services it \nbuys solely because of unique requirements it imposes on its \ncontractors. While the Federal procurement system has been streamlined \nand simplified over the last several years, much red tape and barriers \nto ``commercial-style'' contracting still exist. This is due in part to \ntrying to maintain the proper balance between an efficient procurement \nsystem and accountability when spending taxpayer dollars.\n  In ordinary times and because of recent procurement policy reforms, \nwe believe that a Federal agency can buy most anything it needs quickly \nand efficiently under current law if it has good management practices \nin place and smart, well-trained contracting officers. However, these \nare not ordinary times. Further, we know that the Federal Government is \nnot well-managed and our acquisition workforce is rapidly dwindling. \nWith that said, it is our responsibility to ensure that Federal \nagencies with a role in homeland security can purchase, quickly and \nefficiently, the most high-tech and sophisticated products and services \nto support antiterrorism efforts and to defend against biological, \nchemical, nuclear, radiological or technological attacks.\n  The bill which we are introducing builds on emergency contracting \nauthority already in place for the Department of Defense and other \nagencies and goes further by providing additional contracting \nflexibilities. Today, national security and homeland security have the \nsame kinds of requirements, detection, tracking, preparedness, \nprevention, response and recovery. By providing additional procurement \nflexibilities, the agencies involved in homeland security will be able \nto apply more easily many new and proven defense-related technologies.\n  For example, current law gives agencies the ability to use \nstreamlined, simplified contracting procedures for contracts under \n$200,000 which are made and performed outside the United States in \nsupport of a contingency operation or a humanitarian or peacekeeping \noperation. This bill would raise that threshold to $500,000 for any, \noutside or within the United States, contract awarded for products or \nservices in support of a contingency operation or a humanitarian or \npeacekeeping operation.\n  Current law also provides simplified contracting procedures for the \npurchase of commercial items, goods and services produced for the \ncommercial marketplace and not encumbered by government specifications \nor requirements. The bill would allow goods and services purchased to \nhelp agencies fight against terrorism or biological, chemical, nuclear, \nradiological or technological attacks to be treated as if they were \npurchases for commercial items, in other words, agencies needing these \ngoods and services could use the simpler, expedited procedures. This \nwould allow agencies to quickly buy technologies or products which are \ncutting-edge, but which may not have made it to the commercial \nmarketplace yet.\n  This legislation also encourages the use of current procurement \nflexibilities which are authorized in existing statutes. An agency can \nuse these existing provisions where it is appropriate to provide quick \nand responsive solutions to its emergency contracting requirements. \nFurther, the bill includes language which will allow agencies to use \napproaches other than contracts to buy research and development for new \ntechnologies to fight against terrorism. The Department of Defense \ncurrently has this authority and the bill would extend that authority \nto the rest of the Federal agencies.\n  And finally, this bill would encourage more competition in the \nFederal marketplace by requiring agencies to do ongoing market research \nto identify new companies with new capabilities to help agencies in the \nfight against terrorism.\n  We must ensure that Federal agencies which are preparing to fight \nterrorism have access to a wide variety of traditional and innovative \nsolutions in a timely fashion. The bill we are introducing today will \ngo a long way toward that goal.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I join Senator Thompson in introducing \nthe Federal Emergency Procurement Flexibility Act. This bill will \nprovide emergency contracting relief to Federal agencies in support of \nour Nation's fight against terrorism by allowing agencies to \neffectively buy what is needed to address the threats to our Nation.\n  While the Federal procurement system has improved in the last decade, \nthere are still many areas where changes should be made to support the \ncurrent emergency. This bill provides for streamlining the contracting \nprocess to access new technology, provides for emergency authorities \nfor small purchases, and maximizes the use of existing streamlined \nprocurement authorities.\n  The United States has some of the best ideas and technology in the \nworld. To win the war on terrorism, the government needs to do all it \ncan to gain access to this technology, much of which is located in the \nprivate sector. However, many firms, particularly in the biotechnology \nand information technology sectors, have been deterred from bidding on \ngovernment contracts by the perception that government contracting is \nburdened with red tape and requirements.\n  In this time of crisis, we can not afford to keep these businesses on \nthe sidelines. To promote the participation of these firms in solving \nour homeland defense problems, this bill would authorize the use by \nfederal agencies of ``other transactions'' authority for research and \ndevelopment and prototype projects. ``Other transactions'' authority is \na streamlined acquisition approach currently available only to the \nDepartment of Defense. This authority has been enormously helpful in \nallowing the Department of Defense to gain access to the research and \nexpertise of non-traditional defense contractors. I anticipate that the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services or the Environmental Protection \nAgency, for example, would be able to effectively use ``other \ntransactions'' authority to research and prototype new vaccines, \ndetection systems, and remediation technology to meet the bioterrorist \nthreat.\n  For production, service or research needs where ``other \ntransactions'' authority is not appropriate, this bill authorizes \n``commercial like'' contracting procedures for those contracts that \nfacilitate the defense against terrorism or nuclear, chemical, \nbiological or information attack on the United\n\n[[Page S12554]]\n\nStates. These commercial contracting procedures are exempted from many \ngovernment unique requirements and allow for the use of a more \nstreamlined acquisition approach.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1781. A bill to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a \nvoluntary national registry system for greenhouse gases trading among \nindustry, to make changes to United States Global Change Research \nProgram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I, rise to introduce the Emission \nReductions Incentive Act of 2001. I thank Senator Brownback for his co-\nsponsorship and his cooperation in drafting this bill, along with his \ncommitment to addressing this growing problem.\n  Earlier this year, I announced intentions to consider the \nestablishment of a ``cap and trade'' system for carbon dioxide \nemissions. I am continuing to work with Senator Lieberman on this \neffort. However, the bill which I am introducing today is not in lieu \nof that commitment, but rather in support of it.\n  The bill proposes the establishment of a national voluntary registry \nfor entities to register carbon emissions reductions. The registry \nwould support current voluntary trading practices in private industry \nand other non-governmental organizations. Over the past years, the \nCommerce Committee has heard testimony from several organizations on \ntheir efforts conduct trading programs internally or across a small \nsegment of industry. This registry bill will aid those efforts greatly \nby establishing a national system whereby these companies may be able \nto participate and be assured that a ton of carbon purchased is indeed \na ton of carbon.\n  Establishment of the registry would also require the development of \ncertain standards for measuring, verifying and reporting emission \nreductions to the registry. I believe that with these procedures in \nplace, the registry would be able to withstand any future requirements \nimposed by a mandatory ``cap and trade'' system. The bill would also \nprovide for consideration of credits realized under this program \nagainst any future mandatory system.\n  The bill also proposed changes to the US Global Climate Change \nProgram, USGCRP. It requires a new strategic plan for the next 10 \nyears. The bill would provide for dedicated management to support the \ninteragency USGCRP and have this office report to the Director of the \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy. We feel this will provide a \nneeded channel to the White House for the Federal scientific community \nto be heard. We have also asked the office to work with the agencies' \ndevelopment activities.\n  The bill proposed additional changes to the Partnership for New \nGeneration Vehicles, PHGV, program and provides additional incentives \nfor the licensing of technologies. I hope that we can increase the \ndeployment of technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by \nproviding further incentives to Federal employees, those who are \nultimately responsible for the transfer of the research results. The \nNational Research Council recently made recommendations on the PNGV \nprogram, a cooperative research and development program between the \nFederal Government and the US Council for Automotive Research. The bill \nrequires the Department of Commerce to implement many of those \nrecommendations.\n  As we all know, more than 160 countries recently reached an agreement \non the Kyoto Protocol, which would require industrialized nations to \nreduce their carbon dioxide emissions. There are many US companies that \noperate facilities in other countries. These facilities will have to \nmeet local emissions requirements. The bill requires the Secretary of \nCommerce to study the effects that a ratified treaty will have on the \nUS industry and its ability to compete globally.\n  Again, I thank Senator Brownback for help on this piece of \nlegislation. I understand that other members of the Commerce Committee \nhave recently introduced legislation in this area and look forward to \nworking with them on a comprehensive package.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I am please to join Senator McCain \ntoday in introducing the Emission Reductions Incentive Act of 2001. \nThis bill will put into place a voluntary registry for greenhouse gas, \nGHG, reductions house in the Department of Commerce. Furthermore, the \nbill establishes structure for the independent measurement and \nverification of GHG reductions. This is an important step in providing \nan incentive for companies who wish to reduce their emissions, and it \nwill provide assurance that companies who take positive action on \nclimate change today will be rewarded in the future. All this can be \naccomplished with barely any cost to the government, since it will be \nprivate, third party groups that undertake the burden to measure, \nverify and prove actual greenhouse gas emission reductions.\n  There are those who wonder why such a measure is needed, given the \nfact that there is an existing registry in the Department of Energy and \nthe uncertainty on the climate change issue. First, the new registry \nwill only hold information that has been independently verified. Like \nthe current registry, this new registry would be completely voluntary. \nHowever, unlike the DOE program, this registry will focus on keeping \ntrack of proven greenhouse gas reductions, and will therefore, \nencourage more companies to undertake measures to reduce emissions \nsince they will have the ability to defend these reductions as real if \nfuture regulations are put in to place. Also, since this registry will \nbe housed in the Department of Commerce and verified by independent \nparties, it treats the issue as an investment or transaction between \ncompanies to limit risk, rather than an environmental regulation.\n  Several utilities and other companies who emit high levels of carbon \ndioxide have expressed real concern that they need certainty to be able \nto plan for the life of new power plants and investment decisions which \nwill last for 20 years or more. Currently, there is no certainty with \nregard to how the climate change issue will be handled. This means \ncompanies must plan for an uncertain future which leads to undue \nexpense. This bill will allow companies to decide for themselves how \nmuch action they need to take, and provide a way of taking out an \ninsurance policy, of sorts, on the climate change issue. This is \nimportant because we need more investment in energy infrastructure, \nmore clean coal plants and natural gas plants. Yet these new plants \nwon't move forward if they fear being hit with a high carbon tad in the \nnext 5-10 years.\n  This bill offers industry a way to make investments in GHG reductions \nor carbon sequestration offsets gradually, building up credits that \ncould be used down the road if regulations are put into place. While \nthere is no ``one-for-one'' trade in on these credits, there would be a \ngovernment certified stamp of approval on early actions to reduce \ngreenhouse gases--which any future regulations would have to account \nfor\n  Second, there are those who argue that the science is still unsettled \nwith regard to the climate change issue, and that we should not move \ntoward costly measures which will punish industry for a problem that is \nstill not fully understood. Actually, this is the very reason why we \nshould establish a voluntary, but measured and verified registry now. \nThis bill given industry the opportunity to experiment and get credit \nfor pro-active measures that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nwithout unduly burdening energy consumers. New and better technology is \nthe key to solving this issue, but why would a company employ such \ntechnology now with the uncertainty surrounding how this issue will be \naddressed? They could in fact, be punished for such actions if later \nregulations are put into place which do not account for reductions that \nwere already taken. This is a free-market approach to reward and \nencourage responsible industry to continue and even make a market out \nof reducing greenhouse gases. This registery will help establish and \nencourage the most cost-effective ways to tackle this problem while \nalso finding where difficulties may lie.\n  We can not shrink from difficult challenges, nor should we overreact. \nWhen there is the opportunity to allow market force to work on a \nproblem, we should most definitely encourage that process. I am pleased \nto be joining my\n\n[[Page S12555]]\n\nfriend from Arizona in introducing this legislation and look forward to \npursuing this policy during the upcoming energy debate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Allen, Mr. Cleland, \n        and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1782. A bill to authorize the burial in Arlington National \nCemetery of any former Reservist who died in the September 11, 2001, \nterrorist attacks and would have been eligible for burial in Arlington \nNational Cemetery but for age at time of death; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation for \nmyself, Senator Stevens, Senator Allen Senator Cleland, and Senator \nInouye to provide a exception to the rules governing burials at \nArlington national Cemetery.\n  This very limited legislation will permit individuals with extensive \nmilitary service, who lost their lives on September 11, to be buried at \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  I am introducing this legislation today, along with my colleagues, to \naddress a specific situation that involves Captain Charles F. ``Chic'' \nBurlingame III, a resident of Oak Hills Virginia and others who may \nhave the same accrued entitlement.\n  Captain Burlingame was the pilot of American Airlines flight 77, that \nill-fated aircraft which was hi-jacked by terrorists and used as a \nhorrible weapon of destruction against the Pentagon on September 11.\n  Captain Burlingame, however, was more than the pilot of that plane--\nhe was also a retired veteran of the United States Navy.\n  He served his country with distinction for 8 years by flying fighter \nplanes off aircraft carriers--one of the military's most hazardous \nduties.\n  He continued his military career as a reserve officer, honorably \nretiring with the rank of Captain. Ironically, Captain Burlingame's \nreserve duty was in the Pentagon, a building he knew so well.\n  In the aftermath of September 11 we have learned of many heroic acts \nof those who lost their lives in trying to overcome the terrorists on \nthat tragic morning. This is certainly true in the case of Captain \nBurlingame.\n  Recent information from the FBI indicate that Captain Burlingame was \nkilled by the terrorists prior to the crash of the Flight 77 into the \nPentagon. Clearly, Captain Burlingame gave his life fighting to protect \nthe passengers of the plane and those on the ground. One can clearly \nsee that Captain Burlingame and those who lost their lives on September \n11 were the first casualties of our War on Terrorism.\n  Arlington Cemetery is the resting place for many American heroes who \ngave their lives to protect American freedoms. Certainly, Captain \nBurlingame's service to country and his sacrifice on Flight 77 should \nbe recognized by our nation.\n  Captain Burlingame's widow, Sheri, and his brothers and sisters, \ndesire that Captain Burlingame be buried in Arlington National \nCemetery. Captain Burlingame's superb military service would make him \neligible for burial in any of our other National Cemeteries.\n  The very strict regulations which govern burials at Arlington, \nhowever, do not allow for burial of a person retired from the Reserves \nuntil they reach sixty years of age. Had he merely reached the age of \nsixty, he would have been fully eligible for burial in Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  Additionally, there may be others who lost their lives on September \n11 who are in a similar situation. This bill will also allow those \nperson to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  I respectfully request that my colleagues support this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1782\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     vote on whether to proceed with the statute was 120 in favor \n     to 7 against, with 21 countries abstaining. The United States \n     voted against final adoption of the Rome Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the statute.\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has met \n     regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, \n     including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of \n     Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress following the \n     adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States \n     negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the United \n     States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain \n     critical negotiating objectives\n\n[[Page S12563]]\n\n     of the United States had not been achieved. As a result, he \n     stated: ``We are left with consequences that do not serve the \n     cause of international justice.''\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''.\n       (6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton \n     directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on \n     December 31, 2000. In a statement issued that day, he stated \n     that in view of the unremedied deficiencies of the Rome \n     Statute, ``I will not, and do not recommend that my successor \n     submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until \n     our fundamental concerns are satisfied''.\n       (7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States should \n     be free from the risk of prosecution by the International \n     Criminal Court, especially when they are stationed or \n     deployed around the world to protect the vital national \n     interests of the United States. The United States Government \n     has an obligation to protect the members of its Armed Forces, \n     to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions \n     carried out by the International Criminal Court.\n       (9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court. Particularly if the Preparatory \n     Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of Aggression \n     over United States objections, senior United States officials \n     may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national security \n     decisions involving such matters as responding to acts of \n     terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States, senior officials of \n     the United States Government should be free from the risk of \n     prosecution by the International Criminal Court, especially \n     with respect to official actions taken by them to protect the \n     national interests of the United States.\n       (10) Any agreement within the Preparatory Commission on a \n     definition of the Crime of Aggression that usurps the \n     prerogative of the United Nations Security Council under \n     Article 39 of the charter of the United Nations to \n     ``determine the existence of any . . . . act of aggression'' \n     would contravene the charter of the United Nations and \n     undermine deterrence.\n       (11) It is a fundamental principle of international law \n     that a treaty is binding upon its parties only and that it \n     does not create obligations for nonparties without their \n     consent to be bound. The United States is not a party to the \n     Rome Statute and will not be bound by any of its terms. The \n     United States will not recognize the jurisdiction of the \n     International Criminal Court over United States nationals.\n\n     SEC. ____03. WAIVER AND TERMINATION OF PROHIBITIONS OF THIS \n                   TITLE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Initially Waive Sections ____05 and \n     ____07.--The President is authorized to waive the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections ____05 and ____07 \n     for a single period of one year.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 201, H.R. 2716.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2716) to amend title 38, United States Code, \n     to revise, improve, and consolidate provisions of law \n     providing benefits and services for homeless veterans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, as chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I urge prompt Senate passage of H.R. 2716, the \n``Comprehensive Homeless Veterans Assistance Act of 2001,'' a bill that \nenhances VA's efforts to combat homelessness among our Nation's \nveterans. This bill represents a compromise between S. 739, as passed \nby the Senate on November 15, 2001; and H.R. 2716, which passed the \nHouse on October 16, 2001.\n  This bill sets a rather lofty--but, in my view, attainable--goal of \nending chronic homelessness among veterans within a decade. Unless we \naim high, we will never end the problem. The bill also encourages \ninteragency cooperation to facilitate meeting that goal. With the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and \nHealth and Human Services administering most programs targeting \nhomelessness, it seeks to revive the Interagency Council on the \nHomeless, of which all three agencies are members.\n  I will highlight some of the other key provisions in this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Proposed new section 2062 of title 38, United States Code, is \nintended to authorize VA to provide essential dental care services to \nthose homeless veterans who demonstrate a commitment to rehabilitation \nand reintegration into society. In the course of developing this \nprovision, the Committee members agreed that there is a unique and \nurgent need for basic dental care within the homeless population.\n  Consequently, the bill provides a one-time course of dental care to \nthose homeless veterans who enroll and remain in a specified VA, grant \nor contract assistance, or specialized health program for 60 \nconsecutive days. The treatment is limited to a ``one-time'' course of \ncare that would allow VA to carry out a treatment plan as medically \nindicated by the veteran's needs. The Committee members also recognized \nthere may be a break in treatment services that could occur through no \nfault of the veteran. In those cases, the compromise agreement makes \nallowance for the Secretary to aggregate days of treatment, by \ndisregarding these breaks in continuous treatment.\n  Section 8(a) of the compromise agreement contains a provision \nrequiring that every VA facility develop a plan to treat patients who \npresent themselves at the facility and are in need of mental health \ncare. This can include referral to another facility that has the mental \nhealth treatment capability if the original facility does not. A \nsimilar provision was included in section 8(c) with regard to the \navailability of substance abuse treatment at every VA medical center. \nIt requires VA to have a plan ready to implement should a veteran walk \ninto a VA medical center and require such treatment. Opioid \nsubstitution therapy is specifically mentioned in this section because \nit has proven to be very successful for the treatment of heroin \naddiction.\n  In closing, I acknowledge the tireless efforts of the original \nnamesake of the bill, Heather French Henry, Miss America 2000. She \ndedicated her tenure to raising the Nation's awareness of the plight of \nhomeless veterans, traveling some 20,000 miles a month to visit with \nveterans in recovery programs and offer encouragement.\n  Mrs. Henry's father and uncle provided the inspiration for her to \ncommit herself to the issue, as they both had suffered and recovered \nfrom substance abuse and ultimately homelessness following their \nmilitary service. The work that Heather French Henry has done on behalf \nof homeless veterans did not stop at the end of her reign, but has \ncontinued on. This bill is a testament to her profound dedication.\n  I also thank my good friend and colleague Senator Wellstone for his \nstrong dedication to this issue. His unwavering commitment to homeless \nveterans was exemplified by his introduction of the Senate version of \nthe bill and his tenacious efforts to get it passed. I applaud his \nefforts on behalf of this forgotten segment of the veterans population.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I recognize the hard work of Alexandra \nSardegna of the Democratic staff of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs; \nBill Cahill of the Republican staff of the Committee; and John Bradley \nand Susan Edgerton of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee in \ndeveloping this legislation and seeing it through the legislative \nprocess.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of provisions be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Summary of H.R. 2716 (as Amended): The ``Comprehensive Homeless \n                   Veterans Assistance Act of 2001''\n\n       The Compromise Agreement incorporates provisions from S. \n     739, passed by the Senate on November 15, 2001; with \n     provisions of H.R. 2716, passed by the House on October 16, \n     2001. It seeks to enhance and provide additional support for \n     VA programs that combat homelessness among veterans.\n\n\n                         SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS\n\n       The following is a summary of key provisions in the \n     Compromise Agreement, H.R. 2716:\n       Programmatic Expansions: Authorizes VA to spend up to $60 \n     million per year on the transitional housing Grant and Per \n     Diem program. Requires VA to establish at least twenty new \n     comprehensive service centers for homeless veterans in those \n     metropolitan areas found to have the greatest need. Extends \n     the Homeless Chronically Mentally Ill and Comprehensive \n     Homeless Programs until December 31, 2006.\n       Mental Health Treatment Capability: Requires VA to develop \n     and carry out a comprehensive plan to treat those patients, \n     either on-site or through referral to another\n\n[[Page S12579]]\n\n     facility, who present themselves at VA facilities and are in \n     need of mental health services.\n       Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans: Establishes a \n     Committee that will examine and report to the Secretary on \n     various services provided to homeless veterans.\n       Interagency Council on the Homeless: Requires annual \n     meetings of the Interagency Council on the Homeless, as the \n     Council has yet to get underway.\n       Dental Care: Provides a one-time course of dental care to \n     homeless veterans who complete 60 consecutive days of a \n     rehabilitative program. Makes an exception for those veterans \n     who have a break in services through no fault of their own.\n       Evaluation of Homeless Programs: Encourages the continued \n     support of at least one evaluation center to monitor the \n     effectiveness of VA's various homeless programs. Requires VA \n     to report on both the benefits and health care aspects of \n     combating homelessness.\n       Life Safety Code: Requires that real property of grantees \n     under VA's homeless Grant and Per Diem program meet fire and \n     safety requirements applicable under the Life Safety Code of \n     the National Fire Protection Association.\n       Technical Assistance Grants: Authorizes the Secretary to \n     conduct a technical assistance grants program to assist \n     nonprofit groups in applying for grants relating to \n     addressing problems of homeless veterans. Provides $750,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006 for these \n     purposes.\n       Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program: Extends the \n     Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program and authorizes $50 \n     million a year for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006.\n\n  Mr. REID.
