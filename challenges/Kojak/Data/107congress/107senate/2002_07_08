The Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, \nthe manager of the bill, is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate turns its attention to S. 2673, the \nPublic Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002, \nwhich was reported from the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs on June 18 on a strong 17-to-4 vote.\n  A unanimous consent agreement was entered into with respect to this \nlegislation prior to the Fourth of July recess, which provided that at \n2 p.m. today, Monday, July 8, the Senate would proceed, for debate \nonly, to the consideration of this legislation.\n  I hope to take a fair amount of time to set out the process through \nwhich the committee worked and to discuss the provisions of this \nlegislation.\n  As I understand it, upon convening tomorrow and going back to this \nlegislation, amendments will be in order. There are a couple of \ntechnical amendments that I am hopeful we can approve today by \nunanimous consent. I will be discussing that with the distinguished \nranking Republican member of the committee in the course of the \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of this legislation. \nThis legislation is intended to address systemic and structural \nweaknesses that I think have been revealed in recent months and that \nshow failures of audit effectiveness and a breakdown in corporate \nfinancial and broker-dealer responsibility. In fact, it is very clear \nthat much of this has been happening over the last few years.\n  Hopefully, we have experienced the brunt of it. Who can guarantee \nthat, however, when every day you come to read in the morning paper yet \nanother story, as witnessed this morning with respect to one of the \nmost respected pharmaceutical companies in the country.\n  I believe this bill is urgently needed. I hope my colleagues will \nagree with that and will support its swift passage.\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\n  The House, earlier this year, passed legislation on this subject, but \nI think it is fair to say that the legislation we are bringing to the \nfloor of the Senate is more comprehensive, more thorough, and, I \nbelieve, more effective. But, of course, once we complete our work \nhere, we will have the challenge of going to conference with our \ncolleagues on the other side of the Capitol to work out the differences \nbetween the two versions of the legislation.\n  Let me discuss for a few minutes the backdrop against which this bill \nwas crafted. Our financial markets have long been regarded as the \nfairest, the most transparent, and the most efficient in the world. In \nfact, I think it is fair to say--and many of us have said it time and \ntime again--that the American capital markets are one of the great \neconomic assets of this country and a very important source of our \neconomic strength.\n  It is becoming increasingly clear that something has gone wrong, \nseriously wrong, with respect to our capital markets. We confront an \nincreasing crisis of confidence that is eroding the public's trust in \nthose markets. I frankly believe that, if it continues, this erosion of \ntrust poses a real threat to our economic health.\n  Let me begin with one of the most obvious symptoms of this problem: \nthe extraordinary increase in restatements of corporate earnings. The \nWall Street Journal, citing a study last year by the research arm of \nFinancial Executives International, the organization of the chief \nfinancial officers of corporations, reported that there were 157 \nfinancial restatements by companies in 2000, 207 in 1999, and 100 in \n1998. The 3-year total of 464 was higher than the previous 10 years \ncombined, during which the average number of restatements was 46 each \nyear. This is a dramatic increase in the number of restatements.\n  Last month's revelation by WorldCom is only one example of a problem \nthat is becoming increasingly disturbing. In a recent article titled \n``Tweaking Numbers To Meet Goals Comes Back To Haunt Executives,'' the \nNew York Times described a series of recent corporate failures or near-\nfailures that were characterized by accounting improprieties: Adelphia \nCommunications, ``$3 billion in loans to its founding family'' had been \nconcealed; Computer Associates was investigated ``on suspicion of \ninflating sales and profits by booking revenue on contracts many years \nbefore it was paid''--you raise your revenues, there is no offsetting \ncost, you boost your profits. Global Crossing is being investigated \n``on suspicion of inflating sales and profits by making sham \ntransactions with other telecom companies''; Enron, ``hiding losses and \nloans with partnerships that were supposedly independent but were \nactually guaranteed by the company''--Enron filed for bankruptcy last \nDecember--Rite Aid had ``four former top executives indicted . . . in \nwhat regulators called a securities and accounting fraud that led to a \n$1.6 billion restatement of earnings''; Tyco International is under \ninvestigation ``on suspicion of hiding payments and loans to its top \nexecutives . . . and its ``shares have plunged 75 percent this year as \ninvestigators question whether it inflated its earnings and cashflow''; \nWorldCom, under investigation for ``hiding $4 billion in expenses by \nwrongly classifying short-term costs as long-term investments.''\n  Commentators have made much of the fact that while Enron had very \ncomplicated dealings, off-balance-sheet special entities and a host of \nother things, WorldCom simply took expenses that should have been \ntreated as short-term costs and set them up as capital investments to \nbe amortized over a period of time. Of course, that was a very \nsubstantial reduction in WorldCom's costs. As a consequence, its \nprofits were boosted by $4 billion. The SEC asked them to come clean, \nand now we think there is probably another billion of faulty accounting \nwith respect to their statement.\n  Can you imagine--the company went from showing a substantial profit \nto actually having a loss. People are out in the marketplace making \ndecisions about whether to purchase this stock. Pension plans are \nmaking decisions on behalf of their members. And they are making the \ndecision in the belief that this company is making a good profit. \nInstead, it is losing money.\n\n  I read one story where competitors of WorldCom were apparently \ndebating within their own corporate ranks: How do they do it? How are \nthese people producing this profit record? We can't do it. We are \ncompeting against them. We think we are doing everything we ought to be \ndoing, and we just can't produce the same kind of performance. How are \nthey doing it? What is the secret they have discovered?\n  The secret they had discovered was to hide their expenses by wrongly \nclassifying short-term costs as long-term investments.\n  The Xerox Corporation, one of the pillars of our economic system, \npaid a $10 million fine to the SEC in April, the largest in an \nenforcement case. They reclassified $6.4 billion in revenue and \nrestated financial results for the last 5 years. I could go on and on \nwith other companies: Cendant, MicroStrategy, Waste Management.\n  What has led to this increase in restatements? The practice of \n``backing into'' the forecast earnings has certainly contributed. The \nNew York Times described this practice as follows:\n\n       Some companies do whatever they have to do to make sure \n     they do not miss a consensus earnings estimate. They start \n     with the profit that investors are expecting and manipulate \n     their sales and expenses to make sure the numbers come out \n     right. During the last decade's boom, as executive pay was \n     increasingly based on how the company's stock performed, \n     backing in became more widespread and more aggressive. Just \n     how much so is only now becoming clear.\n\n  The distinguished Columbia Law School Professor John Coffee, noted, \nin summarizing the trend:\n\n       During the 1990s, the quality of financial reporting and \n     analysis appears to have declined. While an earnings \n     restatement is not necessarily proof of fraud, this increase \n     strongly implies that auditors have deferred excessively to \n     their clients.\n\n  Jack Ehnes, the chief executive of the California State Teachers \nRetirement System, which oversees $100 billion in investments, put it \nthis way:\n\n       This looks like the year of the restatement. It's certainly \n     disturbing for investors who expect financial statements to \n     be accurate.\n\n  Clearly, what is transpiring is having a very severe impact on hard-\nworking American families. Corporate wrongdoing is being felt not just \nat the boardroom table, but it is now being felt at the kitchen table \nas well.\n  First of all, there have been tremendous job losses. The Washington \nPost reported that WorldCom was laying off 17,000 employees. The \ncompanies that are going into bankruptcy are shedding employees left \nand right. Enron laid off 7,000 people after it filed for bankruptcy. \nGlobal Crossing laid off 9,300 employees in the last year. Employment \nat Xerox is down 13,000 from 2 years ago. So there is a direct impact \non many working families, simply through the layoffs, as the companies \nfor which they work encounter difficult financial times.\n  In other words, the company is crashing down, and the workers, \namongst others, are paying the price.\n  Second, the adverse impact on employees clearly extends to the impact \nof these corporate failures on employee pension funds, an impact that \nhas led many workers to question the security of their retirement. A \nquick look at the numbers demonstrates how badly public pension funds \nhave been hit.\n  It is reported that 21 States have combined losses of just under $2 \nbillion from their WorldCom investments. The California public \nretirement system reported a loss of $565 million. And the numbers go \non from there. I won't cite them all, but all across the country there \nare tremendous losses being incurred. It is said that the loss of value \nof both WorldCom and Enron has cost public State pension funds $2.7 \nbillion.\n  Of course, in addition to their impact on workers and pension funds, \nthese revelations have had a negative effect on shareholders generally. \nAverage investors are watching their portfolios plummet and their \nretirement prospects decline. Worldcom's market capitalization has gone \nfrom $180 billion at its peak 3 years ago--this is just WorldCom--to \n$177 million last week. Tyco lost $90 billion in market capitalization \nbetween January 2001 and June 2002, and on and on.\n\n  The bond markets have also been affected. WorldCom, for example, has \n$28 billion in outstanding bonds that are due between now and 2025. \nInvestors, including banks and insurance companies, stand to lose much \nof this sum.\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\nSo you are being hit not only if you have a direct connection with \nWorldCom, but also if you have an equity interest in a bank or \ninsurance company that owns WorldCom bonds. The current market value of \nthese bonds is 15 cents on the dollar.\n  The same week that WorldCom's auditing irregularities became public, \nMorgan Stanley observed that the spread between corporate bonds and \ncomparable Treasury bonds had widened by 15 basis points. As the Wall \nStreet Journal wrote on June 27:\n\n       That is a dramatic move that will boost the borrowing costs \n     for all kinds of companies.\n\n  Now, the problems that I have described did not develop overnight. In \nmany ways, they reflect failures on the part of every actor in our \nsystem of disclosure and oversight. Auditors who are supposed to be \nindependent of the company whose books they are reviewing are too often \ncompromised by the fact that they provide consulting services to their \npublic company audit clients. Securities analysts are not in a \nposition, according to observers, to warn investors or direct them to \nother investments.\n  As the New York Times reported in an article earlier this year \nentitled ``A Bubble No One Wanted to Pop'':\n\n       Eager to help their firms generate business selling \n     securities to investors and reap their own rewards and \n     bonuses, Wall Street analysts have made a habit of missing \n     corporate misdeeds altogether.\n\n  I will come back to these issues later. But for the moment I simply \nwant to note that the problems leading to such dramatic lapses are \nwidespread and seem to be built into the system of accounting and \nfinancial reporting. That is what this legislation seeks to address. \nOur committee did not engage in an exercise in finger-pointing and \nplacing blame but we held a series of hearings--I will discuss them in \na minute--directed toward the future; in other words, we focused on the \nchanges we can make that will help to clear up this situation. It is \nserious.\n  The Wall Street Journal, in a recent comment, said:\n\n       The scope and scale of the corporate transgressions of the \n     late 1990s now coming to light exceed anything the U.S. has \n     witnessed since the years preceding the Great Depression.\n\n  One can run through the figures and find some support for that. \nBetween its peak in 1929 and 1931, the Dow fell 79 percent. Over the \nsame period since its peak in March 2000, the Nasdaq has fallen 73 \npercent. But rather than work through these figures, let me simply \nclose this part of my statement with a comment from Benjamin Graham's \nclassic textbook on ``security analysis'':\n\n       Prior to the SEC legislation . . . it was by no means \n     unusual to encounter semi-fraudulent distortions of corporate \n     accounts . . . almost always for the purpose of making the \n     results look better than they were, and it was generally \n     associated with some scheme of stock-market manipulation in \n     which the management was participating.\n\n  He was writing about the year 1929. Regrettably, that description \nfits some of today's events. Now, I am certainly not suggesting that \nthis is the practice of a majority of our business people. In fact, \nmost of them, I think, try very hard to play by the rules, and to be \nhonest and straightforward in their dealings, and they recognize how \nimportant trust is.\n\n  But it is clear, from the number of departures we have witnessed from \nthat standard, that what is involved is more than just a few bad \napples. Those bad apples ought to be punished, and punished very \nseverely. I certainly agree with the President when he makes that \nstatement. But it seems to me we have to move beyond that in order to \naddress the incredible loss of investor confidence that is now taking \nplace.\n  I have been reading the newspaper articles carefully, and sometimes \nthe most apt comments come not from the experts but from ordinary \ncitizens. My colleague from Texas knows that very well because we have \na noted citizen of his State, Dicky Flatt, who is constantly cited.\n  Karl Graf, a financial planner and accountant in Wayne, NJ, is quoted \nin the Bergen Record as saying:\n\n       The integrity of the game is in question for now, and \n     that's a much bigger thing than if the stock market does \n     poorly for two years. You have to have faith in the numbers \n     the companies are reporting, and if you don't or can't, it \n     makes it seem more like gambling all the time. It makes me \n     more cynical, and I'm very discouraged. It's going to take a \n     lot to make people feel confident.\n\n  Bob Friend, an aerospace engineer from Redondo Beach, CA, a stock \ninvestor for 20 years, was quoted in the L.A. Times as saying:\n\n       There's a complete lack of trust in corporate leadership. I \n     think the lack of ethical behavior has destroyed investor \n     confidence.\n\n  Morris Hollander, a specialist in financial disclosure accounting \nwith a Miami firm, was quoted in the Miami Herald as saying:\n\n       We always had the strongest financial markets in the world, \n     and that was because of credible accounting standards. When \n     you see that confidence eroding, it is not good. It is a \n     real serious credibility crisis.\n  A recent poll demonstrates that these views are not unique or \nunusual. When asked this question: ``when it comes to financial \ninformation the major stock brokerage firms and corporations provide to \nyou, do you or do you not have confidence that the information is \nstraightforward and an honest analysis,'' only 29 percent of Americans \nsaid they had confidence the information was straightforward and an \nhonest analysis. A majority, 57 percent, did not have confidence in the \nbasic information that undergirds our equities market.\n  The Washington Post, on June 26, reported:\n\n       According to economists and market analysts, these still-\n     unfolding corporate and accounting scandals have begun to \n     weigh heavily on the stock market, the dollar, and the U.S. \n     economy. And the effects are likely to linger at least \n     through the end of the year.\n\n  The same article quoted the chief economist for one of Wall Street's \nmajor firms as saying:\n\n       The economy and markets right now are in the midst of a \n     full-blown corporate governance shock. . . . To presume \n     somehow that it's over or that the worst is behind us is \n     naive.\n\n  Furthermore, it is not only American investors who are losing \nconfidence in our markets. A recent New York Times article entitled \n``U.S. Businesses Dim as Models for Foreigners'' quoted Wolfram Gerdes, \nthe chief investment officer for global equities at Dresdner Investment \nTrust in Frankfurt, as saying:\n\n       There is unanimous agreement that the United States is not \n     the best place to invest anymore.\n\n  According to the Federal Reserve Board, foreign direct investment in \ncorporate equities has fallen by 45 percent from 2001 to 2002. And \naccording to a new OECD report, foreign inflows from cross-border \nmergers and acquisitions, which in 2001 were greater than direct \nforeign investment into the United States, have fallen sharply in 2002.\n  The Wall Street Journal said:\n\n       The loss of faith by American and overseas investors in \n     U.S. corporate books is churning global financial markets: \n     Share prices are plunging in America and the dollar is losing \n     value, setting off stock-market plunges in Asia, Europe and \n     Latin America. If the flow of foreign capital to the United \n     States is disrupted as a result, the world economy could be \n     jeopardized, because the U.S. relies on overseas money to \n     finance its huge current-account deficit, and Asia and Europe \n     rely on America to buy imports.\n\n  As I draw this preliminary overview of the context in which we are \nworking to a close, I want to speak for a moment about the potential \nloss of world economic leadership for the United States. The Wall \nStreet Journal had an article entitled ``U.S. Loses Sparkle as Icon of \nMarketplace.'' It says:\n\n       The wave of scandals in corporate America is roiling world \n     stock markets. But the controversy may have an even greater \n     impact in the marketplace of ideas, where the U.S. economic \n     model is coming under attack.\n\n  One area of particular importance and now debate is adoption of \naccounting principles. The European Union--and I do not think many \npeople yet in this country have focused on this matter--has indicated \nthat the rules adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board \nwill become mandatory for all companies throughout the European Union \nin 2005.\n  Traditionally, the U.S. has been preeminent in the accounting field. \nWe have by far the largest economy. We have a reputation for high \nstandards for transparency. So generally the American argument on \nbehalf of its standards carried great influence. Now we have the \nEuropean Union, comparable in economic size to the United States, \nmoving to adopt a uniform set\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\nof accounting standards, to be promulgated by the International \nAccounting Standards Board, for all of the European Union countries. So \nthere is a potential for real challenge to American preeminence in this \narea, given what is happening over here.\n\n  In fact, the New York Times reported on June 27:\n\n       There is a groundswell among executives in Europe against \n     the American system of corporate accounting--the so-called \n     generally accepted accounting principles--that was supposed \n     to be the gold standard in disclosure.\n       Before Enron, Global Crossing and WorldCom, America had \n     been winning the argument on accounting standards. But now, a \n     growing number of Europeans are convinced that the American \n     system is both too complex and too easy to manipulate.\n\n  Regrettably, in my view, unless we come to grips with this current \ncrisis in accounting and corporate governance, we run the risk of \nseriously undermining our long-term world economic leadership. Why do \ncountries look to us? They look to our capital markets. They say: your \ncapital markets are the most transparent; they have the greatest \nintegrity; we can rely upon them; we can make rational business \ndecisions using the information that is provided through your system. \nIf that is no longer the case, we can expect growing difficulties as we \ncontinue to argue for our preeminence.\n  The Wall Street Journal gave this summary of the problem, after which \nI will move onto the bill itself:\n\n       The institutions that were created to check such abuses \n     failed. The remnants of a professional ethos in accounting, \n     law and securities analysis gave way to the maximum revenue \n     per partner. The auditor's signature on a corporate report \n     didn't testify that the report was an accurate snapshot, said \n     [Treasury Secretary Paul] O'Neill. He says it too often meant \n     only that a company had ``cooked the books to generally \n     accepted standards.''\n\n  I want to be very clear about this. I believe the vast majority of \nour business leaders and of those in the accounting industry are \ndecent, hard-working, and honorable men and women. They are, in a \nsense, tarnished by the burden of these scandals. But trust in markets \nand in the quality of investor protection, once shaken, is not easily \nrestored, and I believe that this body must act decisively to reaffirm \nthe standards of honesty and industry that have made the American \neconomy the most powerful in the world. That is what this legislation \ndoes, and that is why I urge its adoption by my colleagues.\n  Let me now turn to the hearings and to the bill. I know others are \nwaiting to speak, and I will try to summarize my remarks. We have been \nworking on this for a long time, so obviously I could go on at some \nlength.\n\n  First, we sought to do a very thorough and careful job in developing \nthis legislation. The committee held a total of 10 substantive hearings \nand heard from a broad range of experts, as well as interested parties. \nI am not going to name all our witnesses, but, for example, we heard \nfrom five past Chairmen of the SEC; three former SEC chief accountants; \nformer Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Paul Volcker; former Comptroller \nGeneral and chairman of the Public Oversight Board, Charles Bowsher; \nthe present Comptroller General, David Walker; a number of \ndistinguished academics who have been studying these issues throughout \ntheir careers; leaders of commissions that studied the accounting \nindustry and corporate governance; representatives of the accounting \nindustry; representatives of the public interest community; \nrepresentatives of the corporate community, and SEC Chairman Pitt.\n  It was a very thorough effort to gather the best thinking on these \nissues and to give all interested parties a chance to be heard. My \ncolleagues on the committee, and the ranking member, Senator Gramm, \nparticipated in this effort seriously and with commitment. Senators \nDodd and Corzine early on introduced a bill dealing with oversight of \naccounting and auditor independence. Many of that bill's provisions are \nreflected in this legislation. Senator Enzi, of course, took a \nparticular interest. He is the only certified public accountant in the \nSenate. Many other Members made important contributions as we moved \nalong the way.\n  I will now turn to each title. Title I of the bill creates a strong \nindependent board to oversee the auditors of public companies. Title II \nstrengthens auditor independence from corporate management by limiting \nthe scope of consulting services that auditors can offer their public \ncompany audit clients. This bill applies only to public companies that \nare required to report to the SEC. It says plainly that State \nregulatory authorities should make independent determinations of the \nproper standards and should not presume that the bill's standards apply \nto small- and medium-sized accounting firms that do not audit public \ncompanies.\n  Titles III and IV of the bill enhance the responsibility of public \ncompany directors and senior managers for the quality of the financial \nreporting and disclosure made by their companies. Title V seeks to \nlimit and expose to public view possible conflicts of interest \naffecting securities analysts. Title VI increases the SEC's annual \nauthorization from $481 million to $776 million and extends the SEC's \nenforcement authority. Title VII of the bill mandates studies of \naccounting firm concentration and the role of credit rating agencies.\n  It is my intention to go through the bill title by title in a summary \nfashion, but I will pause for a moment and ask my colleague whether he \nhas any time pressures.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't have a time preference as such. My suggestion is \nwhenever the Senator gets tired of talking and would like me to speak a \nwhile, I can speak, and then he can come back to it. But I have no \nobjection if you want to go through your whole presentation. You \ncertainly have that right. If you think it will work better doing it \nthat way, that is fine. If you want to break at some point and have me \nspeak, that would be fine.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why don't I move ahead, and I will try to compress it a \nbit.\n  Title I creates a public company accounting oversight board. This \nboard is subject to SEC review and will establish auditing, quality \ncontrol, ethics, and independence standards for public company auditors \nand will inspect accounting firms that conduct those audits. It will \ninvestigate potential violations of applicable rules and impose \nsanctions if those violations are established.\n\n  Heretofore we have relied on self-policing of the audit process, \nprivate auditing and accounting standards setting, and, for the most \npart, private disciplinary measures. But questionable accounting \npractices and corporate failures have raised serious questions, \nobviously, about this private oversight system. Paul Volcker stated:\n\n       Over the years there have also been repeated efforts to \n     provide oversight by industry or industry/public member \n     boards. By and large, I think we have to conclude that those \n     efforts at self-regulation have been unsatisfactory.\n\n  That is obviously one of the reasons we are moving, in this \nlegislation, to an independent public company accounting oversight \nboard. We heard extensive testimony in favor of such a board.\n  The board would have five full-time members. Two of the members will \nhave an accounting background. All will have to have a demonstrated \ncommitment to the interests of investors, as well as an understanding \nof the financial disclosures required by our securities law. The board \nmembers would be appointed by the SEC after consultation with the \nFederal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury and would serve \nstaggered 5-year terms. They could not engage in other business while \nthey were doing this work.\n  Of course, the board will have a staff. We would expect staff \nsalaries to be fully competitive with comparable private-sector \npositions in order to ensure a high-quality staff.\n  The bill requires that accounting firms that audit public companies \nmust register with the board. Failure to register or loss of \nregistration would render a firm unable to continue its public company \naudit practice. Upon registering, a company would consent to comply \nwith requests by the board for documents or testimony made in the \ncourse of the board's operations.\n  The board would possess plenary authority to establish or adopt \nauditing, quality control, ethics, and independence standards for the \nauditing of public companies. But this grant of authority is not \nintended to exclude accountants or other interested parties from \nparticipating in the standard-setting process. So the board may adopt\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\nrules that are proposed by professional groups of accountants or by one \nor more advisory groups created by the board.\n  These provisions reflect an effort to respond to the argument that \nyou need the experts to either set the standards or help to set the \nstandards. The experts in the industry can make these proposals, but \nthe board will have the authority to adopt or to modify such proposals \nor to act of its own volition.\n  We provide for the inspection of registered accounting firms by the \nboard. Firms that audit more than 100 public companies are to be \ninspected by staff of the board each year. Firms that audit less than \nthat are inspected every 3 years, although the board has the power to \nadjust these inspection schedules.\n  The board also has investigative and disciplinary authority. Former \nSEC Chairman Arthur Levitt told the committee:\n\n       We need a truly independent oversight body that has the \n     power not only to set the standards by which audits are \n     performed but also to conduct timely investigations that \n     cannot be deferred for any reason and to discipline \n     accountants.\n\n  If the board finds that a registered firm, or one or more of its \nassociated persons, has violated the rules or standards, it will have \nthe full range of sanctions available.\n  The board also has the power to sanction a registered accounting firm \nfor failure reasonably to supervise a partner or employee, but we allow \nan accounting firm to defend itself from any supervisory liability by \nshowing that its quality control and related internal procedures were \nreasonable and were operating fully in the situation at issue. I am \nmentioning this item, even though it may not seem that important in the \ncontext of a bill this complex, to point again to the effort that was \nmade in the committee to balance competing concerns.\n  In effect, we say the firms have this supervisory responsibility. \nThey should not duck this responsibility. Otherwise, how are we going \nto assure the people working for accounting firms are meeting high \nstandards? On the other hand, we realize it is extremely difficult in \nlarge organizations to control right down to the last person. So we \nprovided that if accounting firms have quality control and related \ninternal procedures in place that are reasonable and that are operating \nfully, the operation of those procedures can serve as a defense.\n  The bill applies to foreign public accounting firms that audit \nfinancial statements of companies that come under the U.S. securities \nlaws. The board is subject to SEC oversight, which is important. \nFinally, we formalize the role of the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard in setting accounting standards accounting standards are \ndifferent than auditing standards, which the new oversight board will \nset. The bill provides for guaranteed funding of the new oversight \nboard and the FASB by public companies, something I think we all agree \nis extremely important.\n  Some have asked, why do we need a statutory board? Why not let the \nSEC do something of this sort by regulation? But others have raised \nquestions about the adequacy of the authority the SEC has to accomplish \nall of this by regulation alone. Clearly, a firmer base would be \nestablished, a stronger reference point, if the board were established \nby statute, and the potential of litigation that might arise with \nrespect to some of these disciplinary and fee-imposing powers if they \nwere created solely by the SEC by regulation would be avoided by a \nclear statutory underpinning.\n  Furthermore, I believe, frankly, that we need to establish this \noversight board in statute in order to provide an extra guarantee of \nits independence and its plenary authority to deal with this important \nsituation.\n  Let me turn to title II on auditor independence. This is a very \nimportant issue. Each of the country's Federal securities laws requires \ncomprehensive financial statements. That is what is now required under \nthe securities laws for public companies. They have to have \ncomprehensive financial statements that must be prepared--and I now \nquote from the statute--``by an independent public or certified \naccountant.''\n  The statutory requirement of an independent audit has two sides to \nit. It is a private franchise, and it is also a public trust.\n  The franchise given to the Nation's public accountants is clear. \nTheir services must be secured before an issuer of securities can go to \nmarket, have its securities listed on the Nation's stock exchanges, or \ncomply with the reporting requirements of the securities law. In other \nwords, the accountants have been handed by mandate a major piece of \nbusiness because the statute says to these public companies that they \nmust have comprehensive financial statements prepared by an independent \npublic or certified accountant.\n  So in effect we have directed to them a significant amount of \nbusiness. But the franchise, in a way, is conditional. It comes in \nreturn for the certified public accountant's assumption of a public \nduty and obligation.\n  The Supreme Court stated this well in a decision almost 20 years ago:\n\n       In certifying the public reports that collectively depict a \n     corporation's financial status, the independent auditor \n     assumes a public responsibility. . . . [That auditor] owes \n     ultimate allegiance to the corporation's creditors and \n     stockholders, as well as to the investing public. This public \n     watchdog function demands that the accountant maintain total \n     independence from the client at all times and requires \n     complete fidelity to the public trust.\n\n  Richard Breeden, former chairman of the SEC from 1989 to 1993, under \nthe previous President Bush, said in his testimony before the \ncommittee:\n\n       While companies in the U.S. do not have to employ a law \n     firm, an underwriter, or other types of professionals, \n     Federal law requires a publicly-traded company to hire an \n     independent accounting firm to perform an annual audit. In \n     addition to this shared Federal monopoly, more than 100 \n     million investors in the U.S. depend on audited financial \n     statements to make investment decisions. That imbues \n     accounting firms with a high level of public trust, and also \n     explains why there is a strong Federal interest in how well \n     the accounting system functions.\n\n  What has happened in recent years is that a rapid growth in \nmanagement consulting services offered by the major accounting firms \nhas created a conflict in the independence that an auditor must bring \nto the audit function. According to the SEC, in 1988, 55 percent of the \naverage revenue of the big five accounting firms came from accounting \nand auditing services; 22 percent came from management consulting \nservices.\n  By 1999, 10 years later, these figures had fallen to 31 percent for \naccounting and auditing services, and 50 percent for management \nconsulting services.\n  In fact, a number of experts argue that the growth in the non-audit \nconsulting business done by the large accounting firms for their audit \nclients has so compromised the independence of audits that a complete \nprohibition on the provision of consulting services by accounting firms \nto their public audit clients is required--a complete prohibition. \nAccording to James E. Burton, the CEO of the California Public \nEmployees' Retirement System, CalPERS, which manages pension and health \nbenefits for more than 1.3 million members and has aggregate holdings \nof $150 billion:\n\n       The inherent conflicts created when an external auditor is \n     simultaneously receiving fees from a company for non-audit \n     work cannot be remedied by anything less than a bright line \n     ban. An accounting firm should be an auditor or a consultant, \n     but not both to the same client.\n\n  John Biggs, CEO of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association--\nCollege Retirement Equities Fund, TIAA-CREF, the largest private \npension system in the world, which manages approximately $275 billion \nin pension assets for over 2 million participants in the education and \nresearch communities, told the Committee:\n\n       Because auditors owe their primary duty to the \n     shareholders, questions about the primacy of that duty are \n     raised if the audit firm provides other, potentially more \n     lucrative, consulting services to the company. The board and \n     the public auditor should both see to it that, in fact as \n     well as in appearance, the auditor reports to the independent \n     board audit committee and acts on behalf of shareholders. The \n     key reason why awarding consulting contracts and other non-\n     audit work to the audit firm is troubling is because it \n     results in conflicting loyalties. While the board's audit \n     committee is formally responsible for hiring and firing the \n     outside auditor, management controls virtually all the other \n     types of non-audit work the audit firm may do for the \n     company. Those contracts with management blur the reporting \n     relationship it is difficult to believe that auditors do not \n     feel pressure for\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\n     the overall success of their firm with the client. Even their \n     own compensation packages may be tied to consulting and non-\n     audit services being provided by their firm to the company. . \n     . .\n       By requiring public companies to use different accounting \n     firms for their audit and consulting services, and by \n     establishing an independent board with real authority to \n     oversee the accounting profession you will be taking \n     important steps toward reversing the crisis in confidence in \n     financial markets that exists today.\n\n  We looked at this carefully. We had testimony on the other side. In \nthe end, we took the approach that is outlined in the bill. The bill \ncontains a short list, nine items, of non-audit services that an \naccounting firm doing the audit of a public company cannot provide to \nthat company. These include, for example, bookkeeping or other services \nrelated to the accounting records or financial statements of the audit \nclient, financial information systems design, appraisal or valuation \nservices, actuarial services, management functions or human resources, \nbroker or dealer or investment adviser services, and legal services.\n  The thinking behind drawing this line around a limited list of non-\naudit services, is that provision of those services to a public company \naudit client creates a fundamental conflict of interest for the \naccounting firm in carrying out its audit responsibility. If the \naccounting firm is not the auditor for the company, it can do any of \nthese consulting services--it can do any consulting service it wants. \nBut if it is the auditor--so there is a conflict of interest problem--\nthen we take certain services and say: those services you can't do. And \nthe reason is, first of all, in order to be independent, the auditor \nshould not audit its own work, as it would do if it did financial \ninformation system design or appraisal evaluation services or actuarial \nservices. It should not function as part of the management or as an \nemployee of the audit company, as it would if it were doing human \nresources services, and it should not act as an advocate of the audit \nclient, as it would do if it were providing legal and expert services. \nNor should it be the promoter of the audit client's stock or other \nfinancial interest, as it would be if it were the broker-dealer or the \ninvestment adviser.\n\n  They are the public company's auditors. They have a very defined \nresponsibility as the auditors. The bill doesn't bar accounting firms \nfrom offering consulting services. It simply says that if a firm wants \nto audit the company, there are certain services it cannot perform. And \neven in that case, the bill provides the board authority to grant case-\nby-case exceptions, so if a case could be made why an auditor's \nperforming a consulting service ought to be permitted, there is some \nflexibility to permit it.\n  David Walker, the Comptroller General of the United States, in a \nstatement on June 18 said:\n\n       I believe that legislation that will provide a framework \n     and guidance for the SEC to use in setting independence \n     standards for public company audits is needed. History has \n     shown that the AICPA and the SEC have failed to update their \n     independence standards in a timely fashion and that past \n     updates have not adequately protected the public's interests. \n     In addition, the accounting profession has placed too much \n     emphasis on growing non-audit fees and not enough emphasis on \n     modernizing the auditing profession for the 21st century \n     environment. Congress is the proper body to promulgate a \n     framework [on this important issue].\n\n  There are a lot of other auditing services, other than the nine I \nmentioned, that an auditor may want to provide and whose provision we \ndid not preclude. In other words, the statutory system that we are \nestablishing lists certain consulting services that, if you are the \nauditor, you cannot perform for the public company that is your audit \nclient, unless you can get one of these case-by-case exemptions from \nthe board. And those consulting services were the ones which, upon \nexamination, seemed clearly to raise the most difficult conflict of \ninterest questions that could result in undermining the auditor's \nfulfillment of his auditing responsibility.\n  The public company auditor can provide other non-audit services; that \nis, any but those on the proscribed list, if it clears them with the \naudit committee of the public company's board of directors. We seek to \nstrengthen the audit committee in very substantial ways, including, as \nI will mention later, that they should be the ones to hire and fire the \nauditors--that the auditors really work through the audit committee for \nthe board of directors and that the auditors do not work for the \nmanagement. I think it is very clear, to some extent, and in some \ninstances, it is management working with the auditors that have done \nthese clever schemes for which we are now paying the price.\n  We had the issue of auditor rotation before us. Many witnesses \nthought the audit firm itself should have to rotate every 5 years, \nperiodically. We did not go that far. We recommend here that the lead \npartner and the review partner on audits must rotate every 5 years--not \nthe audit firm itself. But we do provide that audit firm rotation \nshould be further studied and direct the General Accounting Office to \nundertake such a study with respect to the mandatory rotation of the \naudit firm.\n  I will move more quickly and skip over some sections, but I can \nalways, of course, come back to them if there are any questions.\n  We were concerned about the movement of personnel from audit firms to \nthe public company audit clients. There we put a 1-year cooling off \nperiod with respect to the top positions in the company, so that you \ncan't hold out to the audit team the immediate prospect of an important \nposition in the company. Again, we are trying to protect the \nindependence of the audit.\n  The next two titles, III and IV, deal with corporate responsibility \nand enhanced financial disclosure. As I said, we provide for a strong \npublic company audit committee that would be directly responsible for \nthe appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the public \ncompany auditors, which makes it clear that the primary duty of the \nauditors is to the public company's board of directors and the \ninvesting public, and not to the managers. We provide that the audit \ncommittee members must be independent from company management.\n  We require that the audit committee develop procedures for addressing \ncomplaints concerning auditing issues and also that they put in place \nprocedures for employee whistleblowers to submit their concerns \nregarding accounting.\n  Where does an employee go when he sees a problem and is fearful of \ntaking it up with management because his perception is that management \nis involved with the problem? We specifically provide that they should \nbe protected in going to the audit committee.\n  We have a provision prohibiting the coercion of auditors. Some have \nasserted that officers and directors have sought to coerce their \nauditors or to fraudulently influence them to provide misleading \ninformation. Obviously, the auditors ought to be protected from that as \nwell.\n  We have a provision that the CEO and the CFO who make large profits \nby selling company stock or receiving company bonuses while management \nis misleading the public about the financial health of the company \nwould have to forfeit their profits and bonuses realized after the \npublication of a misleading report.\n  We also address the question of remedies against officers and \ndirectors who violate securities laws, something in which the SEC is \nvery interested.\n  We have a provision on insider trades during pension fund blackout \nperiods. We prohibit the insider trades. So you can't have officers and \ndirectors free to sell their shares while the majority of the employees \nof the company are required to hold theirs--as, of course, has happened \nin some instances.\n  On enhanced financial disclosures, we require that public companies \nmust disclose all off-balance-sheet transactions and conflicts. We \nrequire that pro forma disclosures be done in a way that is not \nmisleading and be reconciled with a presentation based on generally \naccepted accounting principles. More companies are doing these pro \nforma disclosures. They really are not accurately reflecting the \nfinancial conditions of the company.\n  We require very prompt disclosure of insider trades--actually, to be \nreported by the second day following any transactions.\n  We require the reporting of loans to insiders. There have been some \nenormous loans made. At a minimum, those need to be disclosed. Some \nargue they ought to be prohibited. We didn't go that far. Some \ntestified there are some good reasons on occasion that a company ought \nto make a loan to one of its\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\nofficers. But, at a minimum, they ought to be disclosed.\n  This is a small item, but it may have a good benefit. We require \npublic companies to disclose to the investors whether they have adopted \na code of ethics for senior financial officers and whether their audit \ncommittee has among it a member who is a financial expert. We don't \nrequire them to have a code of ethics, although we think they should. \nWe just require that they disclose whether they have one or not.\n  Title V deals with analyst conflicts of interest. We have had this \nincredible situation that was brought to the public attention by the \nefforts of the Attorney General of the State of New York, Eliot \nSpitzer, in which research reports and stock trades of companies that \nwere potential banking clients of a major broker-dealer were often \ndistorted to assist the firm in obtaining investment banking business. \nThere was one document that actually acknowledged the conflict and, as \na result, stated:\n\n       We are off base on how we rate stocks and how much we bend \n     over backwards to accommodate banking.\n\n  These analysts would recommend a buy rating on the stock essentially \nto help out the investment banking firm which was trying to get the \ncompany's investment banking business. So they get the analysts to say \ngood things about the company, which will then lead the company to be \nfar more favorably inclined and take on that firm in order to do their \ninvestment banking business.\n  In some instances, they were actually recommending buys and then they \nwere saying to one another what a turkey the company was, but the poor \ninvestor was being taken at the time.\n  We set out a number of provisions in this regard. I will not go \nthrough all of them.\n  We prevent investment banking staff from supervising research \nanalysts or clearing their reports.\n  We prohibit analysts from distributing research reports about a \ncompany they are underwriting.\n  We have a provision to protect analysts from retaliation for making \nunfavorable stock recommendations.\n  We heard moving testimony from someone who said: If you make an \nunfavorable recommendation, who knows what is going to happen to you?\n  We also provide--the bill here focuses on disclosure instead of \nprohibition--that an analyst would have to disclose if he owned the \ncompany stock. If you are doing an analysis and if you are doing a \nreport and a recommendation, you ought to disclose whether you own the \ncompany stocks or bonds, whether you have received compensation from \nthe company, whether your firm has a client relationship with the \ncompany, and whether you are receiving compensation based on investment \nbanking revenues from the company. These are not prohibitions, they are \njust disclosures.\n  The thought behind this is, if you are an investor and an analyst is \nmaking a recommendation and he puts up front in his analysis that he \nowns the company stock, or that he is receiving compensation from the \ncompany, or that his firm has a client relationship with the company, \nor that he is receiving compensation based on investment banking \nrevenues received from the company, someone is going to look at this \nand say: wait a second. I have to take his recommendation in the \ncontext of his involvement.\n  Finally, of major importance is the increase we have provided for the \nbudget of the SEC to, No. 1, provide pay parity for SEC employees; No. \n2, enhance information technology and security enhancement; and, No. 3, \nfund more professionals to help carry out the important investigative \nand disciplinary efforts of the SEC.\n  We provide for two studies. One concerns the consolidation of public \naccounting firms. Senator Akaka was very interested in this. There has \nbeen a constant consolidation trend. We have asked the Comptroller \nGeneral to do the study. And the other is by Senator Bunning directing \nthe SEC to conduct a study of the role of credit rating agencies in the \noperation of the securities markets.\n  In closing, there has been broad support for this legislation. Just a \nfew days ago, the Business Roundtable came out in favor of it. The \nFinancial Executives International early on in the process was \nsupportive, as well as the Council of Institutional Investors.\n  We have tried hard to listen to the concerns people raised.\n  The procedure here was that before the Memorial Day recess--in fact, \nin early May, we put out a committee print. As we approached markup \nshortly before the Memorial Day recess, a number of amendments were \nproposed. It was urged that we put the markup over. We agreed to do \nthat. We took all the amendments that had been put forward, and other \nsuggestions that were being received with respect to the committee \nprint, and went back and reworked it.\n  I have to say to you that, in all candor, many of those suggestions \nwere meritorious and in fact are now reflected in the legislation that \nis before the Senate.\n  So we tried very hard to listen to people at every step of the way. \nWe then reworked the print. We came back with another committee print. \nWe went to markup on June 18. We made a limited number of amendments in \nmarkup and brought the bill out to the floor of the Senate by a 17-to-4 \nvote.\n  I simply close by saying how strongly I believe that financial \nirresponsibility and deception of the sort that we have seen in all of \nthe instances that keep appearing on the front pages of our newspapers \nare a real threat to our economic recovery. We cannot afford to wait \nfor the next corporate deception, followed by the next round of \nlayoffs, followed by the next collapse of a company's pension fund.\n  We need to take action to restore public trust in our financial \nmarkets, and that really begins with restoring public confidence in the \naccuracy of financial information. That is what this legislation seeks \nto accomplish. I urge my colleagues to support this critical \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I begin by thanking Senator Sarbanes for \nworking with me as we have considered this bill. I congratulate him on \nthis day that we are considering the bill in the Senate.\n  We had a series of hearings that I wish every Member of the Senate \ncould have attended. I am not surprised that at the end of those \nhearings good people with the same facts, as Jefferson said so long \nago, were prone to disagree.\n  I find myself in a position where Senator Sarbanes and I agree on \nmany of the key issues of this bill; we differ on others. It is not the \nfirst time in managing a bill that we have been on opposite sides.\n  I reminded Senator Sarbanes this morning that it might very well be \nthis will be the last bill we will ever manage together. Since I am \nleaving the Senate, and we have something like 40 legislative days \nleft, I do not know whether, after this bill is dealt with, the Banking \nCommittee will warrant any of those 40 days.\n  But I would like to say for the record that no one can object to the \nhearings we had, the approach the chairman has taken. Whether you agree \nwith him or whether you do not, I think his approach has been reasoned \nand reasonable.\n  It is clear this issue has attracted a great deal of attention. It is \nclear that there is a mind in the Congress, if not in the country--\nCongress is not always reflective of the thinking of the country--but \nthere is a sort of collective mind that we need to do something, even \nif it is wrong.\n  I lament, as we have gotten into this debate, that the media has \ndecided that the tougher bill is the bill with more mandates; that if \nyou decided to set up a stronger committee, a stronger board with \nbroader powers so they might decide to go beyond the legislative \nmandates, that that is a weaker proposal than having Congress actually \nwrite auditing standards or conflict of interest standards.\n  I would submit to my colleagues--and I guess I would have to say at \nthis point, I do not know that we will follow this adage--but I suggest \nthis is a very important bill. I urge my colleagues, as you look at \nthis bill, to realize we are not just talking about accounting. If this \nbill were just about accounting, it could do some good, it could do \nsome harm, but it could not do too much of either.\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\n  But this bill is far more than just a bill about accounting. This is \na bill that has profound effects on the American economy; therefore, I \nthink it is very important that we try to look at the problem and that \nwe try to come up with a solution that will be good not just for today, \nnot just that will bring forth a positive editorial in a newspaper \ntomorrow, but I submit we want to try to find one that meets the front \nporch of the nursing home test. That is the test where, when we are all \nsitting around in rocking chairs in a nursing home, and we look back at \nwhat has happened under this bill, that we will be proud of what we did \nand how we did it.\n  I want to touch on several things. I want to go through and make \nseveral points, some related to what the distinguished chairman said, \nsome just because I want to say them. I want to talk about what I \nbelieve the problem is. And I want to make it clear that I do not know \nhow to fix it. I do not know that this bill fixes it. I do not believe \nit does. I do not believe my substitute I offered fixes it either. But \nI think somebody needs to talk a little bit about it. Then I want to \ntalk about the bill that we have before us, and where I agree with it \nand where I differ, and what those differences are.\n  I think the good news is--from the point of view of if consensus is a \ngood thing--there is a consensus, and has been from the very beginning, \nthat we need to pass a law. What this President cannot do is provide an \nindependent funding source and a legal foundation for this independent \nboard.\n  I personally believe the President's 10-point program was a good \nprogram. What the Chairman of the SEC cannot do is provide an \nindependent funding source and provide a legislative foundation for the \nboard. The Chairman and I agree on that.\n  There have been people who have reached a conclusion that if you \ndiffered from Senator Sarbanes, you did not really want a bill. I \nbelieve those of us who have differed do want a bill. And the one thing \nthat we agree on, which I think is at the heart of this whole debate, \nis a strong, independent board to make determinations about conflict of \ninterest and about ethics.\n  Now, let me touch on the things that I wanted to touch on.\n  I personally thank Senator Sarbanes for the approach he took in \nfocusing on the problem and on the future. Everybody knows this has now \nbecome a political issue. We know that people are either trying to go \nback and pin this problem on past Presidents or SEC Directors or they \nare trying to pin the problem on the current President and the current \nSEC Chairman. I think it is a testament to Senator Sarbanes' leadership \nthat he has had nothing to do with that.\n  The plain truth is we have had a succession of great SEC Chairmen. \nArthur Levitt and I disagreed on many things, but I do not think \nanybody could argue that he was not an effective SEC Chairman. It is \ntrue that he had the ability, under existing law, to go back and change \nGAAP accounting to set up a board, to do anything he wanted to do, and \nhe did not do it. But it is always so easy to see these things when you \nare looking with that wonderful hindsight.\n  Anybody has to give Arthur Levitt credit that he was the first to \nraise an issue about auditor independence. Whether you agreed when he \nraised it or not that it was a problem, that it was proven, it is clear \nthat he saw a problem which may or may not be the source of our problem \ntoday, but many people believe it is. You have to give him credit. And \nI don't believe anybody else in his position would have done a much \nbetter job than he did.\n  Let me also say that I think Harvey Pitt has done an outstanding job \nin the short period of time he has been at the SEC. Much is made of the \nfact that he did legal work for accounting firms. I continue to be \nstruck by this approach that somehow knowledge is corruption, that \nsomehow the perfect regulator is a guy who just came in off a turnip \ntruck and who knows absolutely nothing.\n  It reminds me of Senator McCain was once telling a story about \ntalking to a journalist who was covering the Vietnam War and asking the \njournalist if he had ever read this seminal work about the history of \nVietnam. And the journalist said: No, he had never read it because he \nwanted to approach the subject with a totally unbiased mind.\n  There is a big difference, I submit, between an open mind and an \nempty mind. We make a grave mistake when we discount knowledge. \nEverybody today, when they are criticizing Harvey Pitt, talks about the \nfact that he represented accounting firms and security firms. I guess \nif he were being more aggressive than is the public mood, people would \nremember that he was probably the most rigorous chief counsel at the \nSEC in its history and, in that process, brought cases against numerous \nmajor companies. They would be saying that that experience had tainted \nhim for his current work.\n  The point is, the man has broad experience as chief counsel to the \nSEC, where he prosecuted major firms, and he has vast experience as \nprobably the Nation's premier security lawyer where he defended \nassociations and businesses. And quite frankly, when in doubt, I will \ngo with knowledge. When in doubt, I will take experience. I do not \nbelieve that experience taints you.\n  Let me also say that there is this current mood that anything having \nanything to do with accountants is somehow bad. Having just praised \nHarvey Pitt, let me point out an area where I disagree with him. When \nhe set up his board to oversee accounting ethics and to look at issues \nsuch as the independence issue, on ethics issues, he does not allow \npeople with an accounting background to vote.\n  Now I would have to say that I strongly disagree with that for two \nreasons: No. 1, since when is a person's background a source of \ncorruption? I will address that a little more in a minute. Secondly, \nwhen you are looking at what is and what is not ethical practice, I am \nnot saying it is absolutely essential, but it is helpful to have \nsomebody who knows something about what practice is.\n  I submit that in all of these approaches, from the SEC approach to \nthe approach of this bill, we are probably going too far in putting \npeople in positions where they are going to have massive unchecked \nauthority and they have no real expertise in the subject area.\n  Anybody who thinks this board is just going to slap around a few \naccountants does not understand this bill. This board is going to have \nmassive power, unchecked power, by design. I would have to say the \nboard that Senator Enzi and I set up in our bill has massive unchecked \npower as well. I mean, that is the nature of what we are trying to do \nhere. I am not criticizing Senator Sarbanes. I am just reminding people \nthat there are two edges of this sword. We are setting up a board with \nmassive power that is going to make decisions that affect all \naccountants and everybody they work for, which directly or indirectly \nis every breathing person in the country. They are going to have \nmassive unchecked powers.\n\n  We need to give some more thought to who is going to be on this board \nand is it going to be something that is attractive enough to make \npeople want to serve.\n  In the proposal Senator Enzi and I put together, I thought we could \nenhance its prestige by making it a little more independent of the SEC. \nUnder the committee bill, which is before us, the SEC would appoint the \nmembers of the board. I thought that given the broad nature of its \npower, which goes far beyond just accounting and far beyond just \nsecurities, it would be helpful to have the SEC appoint two members--\nSenator Enzi and I suggested that one have an accounting background and \none not--have the Federal Reserve Board appoint two; have the CFTC \nappoint two; and then have the President appoint the chairman. I think \nthat board would have a higher profile. With a Presidential appointee \nas chairman, it would raise the prestige of the board, and we would get \nbetter people to serve on the board.\n  I urge my colleagues, think long and hard when you think about this \nboard exerting tremendous, unbridled, unchecked power, about how many \npeople you want on the board who know something about the subject \nmatter. Today, in an environment where accountants are the evil people \nof the world, the enemies of the people, having no accountants on this \nboard or relatively few and not letting them vote when ethics matters \nare being dealt with, I assert that kind of approach means you are not \ngoing to have first-rate people who are going to want to serve.\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\n  Let me finally get it out of my system by saying: I don't know a \nwhole bunch of accountants. I taught at a public university. About a \nthird of my students in economics were accounting majors. I would have \nto say that I have a pretty high opinion of accountants. If I had to \ntrust the safety and sanctity of my children and my wife today, after \nall these revelations about bad accounting, to a politician, a \npreacher, a lawyer, or an accountant drawn at random in America today, \nwithout any pause I would choose an accountant.\n  I am not saying that there are not bad people in accounting. I am not \nsaying there has not been abuse. But I think we have to separate people \nfrom professions.\n  One of my concerns is, we have already had a decline in the number of \npeople majoring in accounting. I am wondering, I don't care what kind \nof law you write, I don't care what kind of board you set up, if we \ndon't attract smart young people into accounting, people who understand \nit is not talent, it is not personality, it is not cool, it is \ncharacter that ultimately counts, then none of these systems are going \nto work very well.\n  Now, I don't buy the idea that legislating something instead of \nsetting up a reasoned system to make decisions is a tougher approach; \nand if it is, I don't want it. But what we have today is an approach \nthat is largely taken in the media that the more mandates you have, \nthat the more things chiseled inflexibly into law, that the more it is \none-size-fits-all, whether it has any rhyme, reason, or responsibility, \nthat that is tougher, and therefore it is better, that in today's \nenvironment is obviously appealing.\n  I hope this doesn't happen, but it would not shock me if we have a \nseries of amendments offered tomorrow when we start dealing with the \nbill, where people try to out-tough each other--maybe one to kill all \nthe accountants and start all over and train new ones. Well, nobody \nwould offer such an amendment, but I think we could very easily get \ninto this oneupsmanship that we can end up regretting. I hope that will \nnot happen. I want to discourage that.\n  Let me give you an example of where Senator Sarbanes and I differ in \nour opinions. Who is right, I don't know. I think maybe being in this \nbusiness for a while convinces you that nobody has a lock on wisdom and \nnobody knows in each and every case what is right and responsible, but \nI want you to understand the difference of our approach. Let me just go \nright to the heart of the matter.\n  The substitute that I offered in committee with Senator Enzi has an \nindependent board. I think it is better, but you can argue that the two \nboards are pretty similar. Ours is a little more independent of the \nSEC; though, in the end, to meet the constitutional test, the SEC has \nto have authority over it. We went a little further in terms of \nindependence and appointing members, and I have already talked about \nthat. But the whole heart of the difference--let's pick one issue--\ncomes down to auditor independence. If you ask me today, should the \nsame company that does an external audit for a firm be able to do \ninternal audits--and I argue today I don't have the knowledge to say \nthis--I would argue today that I really don't know enough about \naccounting practice and how the process works, not just at General \nMotors but at the smallest corporation in America, to make that \ndecision. The bill before us sets out the law. It is written in the law \nthat if you do an external audit, you cannot do any one of these nine \ndifferent things. I don't know, it may well be that after a reasoned \nanalysis a competent board would decide they ought to do those things. \nMy guess is that if I had to decide today, and you forced me to make a \ndecision that was going to be binding on the country, which is a little \nfrightening to me, I might well agree with most, and in some cases all, \nof these things. But I don't believe we ought to be writing that into \nlaw. I don't think anything is gained by writing it into law, and I \nthink a lot is lost by writing it into law.\n  Having read editorials, I know this makes the bill tougher, but I \ndon't think it makes it better. What I believe we should do is set up \nthe best and strongest board we can, make it independent, give it \nindependent funding, and put competent people on it. The way Senator \nEnzi and I did it, and there is nothing magic about it other than that \nwe did it, we decided to have the SEC, the Fed, and the CFTC appoint \ntwo members, one with an accounting background and one without, and \nthen have the President appoint the chairman, and he could decide.\n  I personally think that having more accountants rather than fewer is \na plus, not a minus. I don't think they all ought to have an accounting \nbackground. I don't necessarily say a majority have to have an \naccounting background, but I believe that day in and day out, 20 years \nfrom now when we have all left the Senate and we are not paying \nattention to these things, it would help to have people who know what \nthey are doing. I don't buy the idea that people who don't know what \nthey are doing are more moral, other things being the same, than people \nwho do know what they are doing. In any case, I believe that rather \nthan writing out these nine things by law that you cannot do while you \nare doing an external audit, we ought to set up the strongest board we \ncan, and we ought to give them external funding and plenty of power, \nand we ought to say to them: you need to look at these nine things and \ndo a reasoned analysis. You need to talk to lots of people, such as \nsmart theorists who are accounting professors at our best universities, \nand you probably ought to talk to the bookkeeper in Muleshoe who is \nactually doing bookkeeping work, look at the practical, the \ntheoretical, and make a determination.\n\n  Should you be able to do an external audit and do any one of these \nnine things? You make a decision and set it out in regulation. Why is \nthat better than writing it into law? It seems to me it is better for \ntwo reasons: One, if you are wrong, or if accounting practices change, \nor if your perception of the problem changes, you can go back and \nchange it by regulation. The problem with writing it into law is that \nCongress then has to come back and change the law. As we know from \nGlass-Steagall, it took us 60 years to fix something that had it been \nwritten in regulation by the 1940s, it would have changed. But we \ndidn't change it until 1999.\n  The second reason, which I think is equally important, if not more \nimportant, is the way the bill is now written might very well make \nsense for General Motors. That is, it might make perfectly good sense \nto have a process whereby General Motors might have three or four \ndifferent CPA firms--maybe more--but they are operating all over the \ncountry and all over the world. That is perfectly feasible. But the \nlast time I looked--and I don't know, but some of these may have gone \nout of business and, God willing, maybe some new companies have come \ninto business--the last time my trusty staff looked, there were 16,254 \npublicly held companies in America. I don't care how smart you are, I \ndon't care how good your intentions are, you cannot write a mandate, if \nyou get too far in the detail, that fits General Motors and also fits \nthe 16,254th largest company in America. It just doesn't work.\n  One of the advantages of setting up an independent board, giving them \na mandate to look at these areas, but not chiseling it into stone in \nlegislation, is because they can then say, well, here is the principle \nand if you are General Motors, here is how it applies, but if you are \nXYZ Paint Company in Montana, or Wyoming, or wherever, you might only \nhave one accounting firm operating in the town that you are domiciled \nin. I am not saying you cannot hire accountants to come from the \nCapital City, or wherever, to your town to do work for you, and maybe \nyou ought not to be operating in a little town in a small State; but \npeople choose that, and people who represent small States seem to like \nthese companies being there. I am just saying that giving the board the \nability to set a principle and apply it in one way to General Motors \nand in another way to a small company in a small town makes eminently \ngood sense in practice.\n  Now, I know it is not a mandate in the same sense as writing it into \nlaw, but I think the result would end up being better.\n  One of the amendments that I will offer--and I thank Senator Sarbanes \nfor trying--and one thing I have to say\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\nis that nobody on our committee can say that Senator Sarbanes did not \nlisten. Nobody can say he failed to try to hear them out on their \nconcerns and that, in many cases, he didn't change the bill to try to \nrespond to their concerns.\n  One of the changes that I support is giving the board, with the \nconcurrence of the SEC, the ability to grant waivers to these rules \nand, in fact, to the law. The problem with waivers on an individual \ncompany basis is a practical problem, and that is, if 16,254 companies \nare trying to get waivers under their special conditions--they all come \nto Washington and hire lawyers and lobbyists; they all petition the \nboard and the SEC--if that board has 16,254 petitions in 1 year, and it \ncould have many times that if people are petitioning for different \nkinds of waivers, we are going to shut it down for any other purpose \nexcept waivers.\n  What will happen, not because anybody wants it to happen but because \nof the very nature of Government, the people who will get the waivers \nwill not in general be the most deserving people. They will be the \npeople who hired the best lawyers, who had the best contacts, who knew \nhow to go about it, and who had the money to spend getting the waiver.\n  My guess is the smallest companies that need the waiver the most will \nnot get them. Surely at some point we are going to fix the bill so that \nthe accounting board, with the concurrence of the SEC, can say: OK, \nlook, in applying this, if you fall into these categories, you have \nthese circumstances, you have a waiver to do things in this way. \nClearly, something like that has to make sense.\n  One of the things we have to come to recognize, and I think we all \nrecognize it, is that having a beautiful law in a law book does not \nmake good law. It has to be practical, and it has to take into account \nthe 1,001--in this case, the 16,254 different circumstances that can \napply.\n  What is the problem? I guess there are as many theories about the \nproblem as there are people. I have my own theory about the problem, \nand I will share it with my colleagues and anybody else who is \ninterested.\n  Why is all of this happening now? I believe it is happening because \nof the problems in GAAP accounting. There are other extenuating \ncircumstances, and I want to touch on them, but here is the problem in \nGAAP accounting. Senator Sarbanes used a perfect example of it, and I \nwill just take his example. He talked about how WorldCom saw its market \ncapitalization fall from $100 billion to $100 million. How is that \npossible? I remember when Enron went bankrupt. People said: Where are \nthe assets? When a company goes from $100 billion to $100 million, what \nhappened to the assets?\n  Here is the problem. Increasingly, the asset is a combination of \nknow-how, credibility, and a belief by the public that you are carrying \nout your business in an efficient and ethical way. Increasingly, the \nmodern corporation does not have 12 steel mills. They do not own \nmassive physical assets. Many companies have tried, basically, to get \nout of the asset business into the information business. The value of \nWorldCom was a discounted present value of what the public believed its \nrevenue stream was relative to its cost. It never had $100 billion \nworth of physical assets, anything like it. That is what the value of \nthe ideal was as the public perceived it in a period where our wise \nfriend, Alan Greenspan, talked about irrational exuberance. That is \nwhat they thought that company was worth, but it never had assets that \nwere anything near $100 billion. What it had was know-how, knowledge of \na market, and it had credibility.\n  Enron was like a bank in the 19th century before FDIC insurance. \nTheir reputation was the source of their value, and when they made \nstupid business decisions that called that reputation into question, \nthey collapsed.\n\n  I have a great sympathy for accounting because I used to be an \neconomist, and in economics, we have something called ceteris parabis. \nIt means ``other things being the same.'' So when we do not know what \nthose other things are, we just utter this Latin phrase and pretend \nthey do not exist--literally pretend they do not exist.\n  That is valuable in physics where you talked about force equals mass \ntimes acceleration, or for every action there is equal but opposite \nreaction. That is an assumption. That is a simplification because it \nleaves out friction, and it leaves out gravity. There is nothing wrong \nwith it, but the problem is, accounting cannot do those things.\n  I had a famous and great accounting professor named David McCord \nWright. Nobody remembers him anymore. I can visualize him today easily \ndefining WorldCom. He would have talked about the discounted stream of \nearnings, and he would have talked about the value of their equity or \nmarket capitalization and would have plotted out a projection of \nrevenues and a projection of costs and integrating that area to add it \nup, and that is where the $100 million was.\n  I doubt if WorldCom's physical assets ever totaled $50 million, \nprobably not $20 million. You are an accountant and you have the job \nwith the directions that are available through GAAP, generally accepted \naccounting principles. You have the job of trying to model, for \naccounting purposes, what WorldCom looks like. You do not have the \nability to utter a Latin phrase and wish away things you do not \nunderstand. Our problem today is that our GAAP accounting has not kept \npace with the world in which we live.\n  In this world where knowledge is power, in this world where know-how \nis wealth, it is very hard to model with GAAP accounting. In the decade \nof the 1990s, when this new model was used on a massive basis in the \nAmerican economy, accountants had to figure up how much all this stuff \nwas worth.\n  GAAP accounting has not kept pace with our changing economy. Our \naccounting is based on the old steel mill of the 1940s where you had \nhow much you paid for the furnaces, and you had them a certain period \nof time, and you have depreciated them.\n  How do you depreciate an idea? How do you book having brilliant young \npeople who are committed to the future in your company because they own \nyour stock? How do you put that down in value terms?\n  So when we are pointing the finger at these people who call \nthemselves accountants, when we are blaming them for every problem in \nthe world, accountants did not put WorldCom into bankruptcy. \nAccountants did not put Enron into bankruptcy. Enron put Enron into \nbankruptcy by making bad business decisions. The accounting was a \nproblem because it was slow to show it, but it was there. WorldCom's \nproblems were there. The problem was not accounting. The problem was \naccounting did not show the problem soon enough.\n  So if anyone is listening to this debate and thinks some investment \nis going to be more valuable because we have better accounting, in the \nlong run that is true; in the short run, I am not sure that is true. In \nfact, I argue these companies would have gone broke anyway. Clearly, \nthey would have gone broke, and they would have gone broke quicker had \nthe accounting system been better. It should have been better. It needs \nto be better.\n  The point I am trying to make is the following: When you are trying \nto model a company using GAAP accounting, it is hard. It is something \nnobody has ever done before.\n  We are learning how to do this, and we will--using concepts like \ngoodwill to try to be a proxy for things like intellectual capital and \nknow-how. That is the source of our problems.\n  I think the fact this came at the end of a financial bubble in the \n1990s exacerbated the problem. The problem, in my opinion, is \naccounting was easier--maybe it was not easier initially. We figured \nout how to do it on the old model. We will figure out how to do it on \nthe new model.\n  There is some smart accountant, probably at Texas A right now, \nstudying accounting, who will probably get an MBA, who will figure out \nhow to get all this goodwill off our books--which is a silly concept in \nmy opinion, but it is the only one we have--and come up with models of \nintellectual capital that will have meaning, just as that steel furnace \nin the 1940s and the write-down of it that made sense, but that is not \nthe world in which we live. That has to be dealt with.\n  Something the chairman's bill does, something that I very much am in \nfavor of, is it gives independent funding to FASB. The two things that \nhave to\n\n[[Page S6337]]\n\nbe done and only Congress can do them effectively, in my opinion, are: \nNo. 1, we have to have an independent, self-funded accounting standards \nboard, FASB, and we have to have accountants setting accounting \nstandards. No. 2, we need to set up this board to oversee ethics in \naccounting.\n  I do not think it matters whether it has a majority of accountants or \nnot, but it needs to have a reasonable number of people who have a \nbackground in accounting so they know what they are doing and so they \nhave an intellectual stake in it being done right. It is a dangerous \nthing when there are people with massive power who do not have any kind \nof intellectual stake in the application of that power, and it concerns \nme.\n  So to conclude, let me say this: Senator Sarbanes and I, when we were \nat this point on the financial services modernization bill, were on \nopposite sides. I was for the bill. I saw it as the epitome of all \nwisdom. He was opposed to the bill and saw it in less glowing terms. By \nthe time we got out of conference, it was our bill. We were together on \nit and 90 Members of the Senate voted for it. It passed the Senate \ninitially on a very close vote, a very narrow margin.\n  I do not think that will be the case here. I think this bill will \npass by a very large margin. I also think it is possible that by the \ntime we have reconciled this bill with the House, that we can have a \nbill that will be very broadly supported. At that point, I hope I will \nbe in a position of supporting it.\n\n  There are many good things in the Sarbanes bill. There certainly has \nnot been a bill, since I have been in the Senate, that was better \nintended than this bill. I do think it can be improved. I think it \nlegislates too much. I think it does one-size-fits-all mandates. It \ntakes them a little bit too far. That, to some guy outside government, \ndoes not sound very important, but it is very important when one starts \ntalking about application. If we do this thing right, and if we build a \nconsensus and it works well, that will be the final monument of the \nbill.\n  I hope we can offer germane amendments. As of right now, I think \nthere will probably be two amendments I will offer. One will have to do \nwith this issue about granting waivers on a blanket basis so that \nrather than making every individual company that has specific kinds of \nproblems come in and ask for an individual waiver, that the SEC and the \nboard, when they agree, could simply issue a set of principles, and if \nyou qualify you would get the waiver. If you do not, you do not. Pretty \nstraightforward amendment.\n  The second amendment I believe I will offer will have to do with \nappeals. Under British common law, we have always taken a very strong \nposition in affecting the right of a person to earn a living. We have \nset very high standards when it comes to taking somebody's livelihood. \nI believe there are people who are practicing accounting, or \nveterinarians or economists or any profession, there is somebody in it \nwho ought not to be in it. I think when this board, which is a private \nentity--and again this is not a problem with the Sarbanes bill. This is \na problem of our substitute as well. It is a strange kind of entity. We \nwant it to be private, but we want it to have governmental powers. We \nhave tried to structure it in ways to try to accommodate this.\n  The bottom line is, when this board is taking away somebody's \nlivelihood and that person believes they have been wronged, they ought \nto have a right to go to the Federal district courthouse. They ought to \nhave a right to say: I do not think that was right, and I want my day \nin court.\n  They ought to have to pay for it, and at that point I think all the \nmaterial involved has to be made public, but that is a right I think \npeople have to have. Those two amendments are very narrowly drawn, and \nthey go to the very heart of the bill. I know some of our colleagues \nare thinking about offering a whole bunch of other amendments. I submit \nthat trying to work out a compromise with the House is going to be \ndifficult. I think we will succeed at it, but I think if we get a whole \nbunch of other issues involved, we are making the mountain higher. I \nbelieve we are ready to legislate in this area, and I think if we can \nlimit what we are doing to this area that we can pass this bill, we can \ngo to conference, and we can come back and have a bill signed into law \nbefore we leave. I think if we get into a lot of other areas, I am not \nsaying the world comes to an end if you put an amendment on here--\nhaving us write accounting standards with regard to stock options, for \nexample, that is a tax issue. I would probably want to make the death \ntax permanent as a second-degree amendment, but I am not saying the \nworld comes to an end if we do that.\n  I am saying if we get off into those kind of issues, where you have \nstrong feelings on both sides of the aisle--and that would not be any \nkind of partisan vote--I think it is harder for our chairman and for \nthe members of this committee to get their job done. I hope we will \nhave a limited number of amendments. I hope they will be germane to the \nbill.\n\n  Finally, at some point we are going to take up Yucca Mountain. I am \nnot up high enough in the pecking order to have gotten the word as to \nexactly when that is going to be. Other things being the same, I would \nrather finish this bill first and then go to Yucca Mountain than to \nstop in the middle of it. But it is a highly privileged motion. Any \nMember can make it. It is not debatable. I assume at some point \nsometime tomorrow that motion will be made. As I figure the time limit \nunder that privileged motion, it would take about a day.\n  I don't see any reason this bill should not be finished this week, \nand maybe much sooner if we can stay on the bill, if we don't drift on \ninto these other areas. When people who are for the bill in its current \nform want to stay pretty close to the bill and people who are against \nit in its current form want to stay pretty close to the bill, we ought \nto stay pretty close to the bill.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I look forward to working \non this issue. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dorgan). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, these are interesting times. I hope \ncolleagues have been listening. The two presentations that preceded me \nwere outstanding explanations of both the bill and the financial \nproblems facing the world today. I don't think you can get a clearer \nexplanation of the problems than those given by Senators Gramm and \nSarbanes. They are very detailed and very much to the point and lay the \ngroundwork for what we are about to do.\n  Usually in this Chamber, we have a solution and we are looking for a \nproblem. Today, we have a problem and we are looking for a solution. We \nhave a problem before the Senate. The way this process works, is that \nwe try to place the solution in the best possible form. Under our form \nof government, the Senate will work on its bill; the House works on \nanother bill on the same topic. When those two bills have been \ncompleted, there will be a conference committee and we will work out \nthe differences. Through every one of those processes, there will be \nchanges to the legislation. We get 100 different opinions from 100 \ndifferent backgrounds on any piece of legislation. That is what makes \nour form of government work. At the other end of the building, there \nare 435 people from different backgrounds. They all lend their opinion \nissues that come before the House.\n  It is sometimes a slow process, but it is the best process in the \nworld. It will work on this problem for which we are looking for a \nsolution.\n  If the economy were different today, we would not have this problem. \nWhen there are changes in the economy, we realize accounting problems--\nor at least that is when the accounting problems become apparent. That \nis where we are today.\n\n  I am the lone accountant in the Senate. There is a good reason for \nthat. Accountants are out there doing very detailed work. When you \nlisten to what is in this bill, you are going to hear details that you \ndo not hear with other legislation. It is the nature of the occupation, \nof the profession of accounting. In the last 6 months, there has been \nan increased interest in the accounting profession. Kids in colleges \nhave been asking the Deans about this phenomenon called accounting that \nnobody has talked about for a long time. It is a tremendous opportunity \nfor accountants to finally explain what they do.\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\n  Some of the kids are looking into accounting for the wrong reasons. \nThey want to be one of the green eyeshade people bringing down huge \ncorporations. That is not what it is about. It is an opportunity to \nmake sure everyone understands business in America. Accountants are the \npeople with the very basis who both know it and can explain it. That is \ntheir job.\n  Somewhere along the line, it is possible for people to get distracted \nfrom that main goal. We are trying to bring them back to that main \ngoal--providing a basis where everyone can understand the value of the \ncompanies in which they are investing.\n  Today we are addressing accounting legislation that has been reported \nout of the Banking Committee. It has been through initial scrutiny. It \nhas been through the process that leads us to the floor. I have talked \nabout the floor process, but so far this has only been through the \nhearings process. We had 13 hearings in the Banking Committee. They \nwere on very diverse topics and a very diverse bunch of people who \nunderstood each of those topics testified. I commend Senator Sarbanes \nfor the way he conducted the process of the hearings, and then the \nprocess of negotiations that led up to the committee vote. That \nhappened over the last several months. On this issue, I can think of no \nother Chairman in either the House or Senate who did a more thorough \njob in conducting hearings. The Banking Committee stayed on the \nsubstance and did not allow enormous outside pressures on this issue to \ninterfere with trying to get to the bottom of the real problem. The \nhearings were not finger-pointing. The hearings were an attempt to get \nvaluable information to arrive at the best possible solution.\n  In addition, the witnesses at the hearings presented objective views. \nHad it been my choice to call the witnesses, I would have chosen nearly \nevery person who testified. That shows the care and concern that went \ninto choosing the individuals who provided this basic information. The \nwitnesses offered several different views, and they came from diverse \nbackgrounds.\n  I also thank the Chairman for the way he and his staff conducted \nthemselves through the endless negotiations we had during that same \ntimeframe.\n  Right now, it seems as if everyone is writing an accounting bill--\nincluding myself. In fact, I got calls as soon as Enron occurred from \nsome of the House Members who said they would really like to work on a \nbill with me. Of course, the first question I had to ask them was, What \ndid you find really happened with Enron? Usually the answer was, We \ndon't know yet. Their response was, but we want to get ahead of the \ncurve.\n  I am glad we had the patience to wait, to hold the hearings, and then \nto negotiate through a number of different bills to come up with the \none before the Senate today. Those negotiations by Senator Sarbanes and \nhis staff were both honest and fair. Although we were not able to agree \non everything, which is the basis of negotiation, I believe all \nnegotiations took place in good faith. I thank the Chairman for that. I \ndo think we have a bill that is a good basis for finishing the process \nand going to conference.\n  Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, and the other numerous restatements \nthat are occurring have caused a ripple effect on the trust of \ncorporate executives and their auditors by the public. These \nexecutives, the persons in whom shareholders put their trust, have \nstained the entire corporate community. A few bad apples have spoiled \nthe bunch. As a result, the legislation we will be debating this week \nwill restructure the way executives operate by increasing \naccountability and making it easier to discipline fraudulent behavior \nwhile at the same time increasing penalties for illegal activity.\n  This legislation will force the management of companies to be \naccountable to their shareholders by requiring that they certify the \naccuracy of their financial statements. In addition, the legislation \nwill require that members of corporate audit committees are independent \ndirectors. We provide the audit committee the ability to engage outside \nconsultants and advisers and provide them the resources they need to \ndetermine whether the accounting techniques being used are in the best \ninterests of the shareholders.\n  In addition, all employees should be subject to the same rules when \nselling company stock. In this regard, the bill prevents officers and \ndirectors of a company from purchasing or selling stock when other \nemployees are restricted. And when these officers or directors do sell \nstock in the companies in which they work, they should report the \ntransaction on the next business day.\n\n  However, the cornerstone of this legislation will be to change the \nway in which a company's auditors interact with their clients, and also \nto force them to be more accountable. While I believe that accountants \nhave extremely high ethics and standards, I do believe the current \nenvironment has highlighted a number of problems inherent in the \ncurrent oversight structure of the accounting industry.\n  I do believe it is an awesome task to be the accountant trying to \nexplain this to everybody else. I do need to explain a little bit why \nthere are not more accountants in legislatures or in the Senate or in \nthe House. That is because if you pick up experience in legislating, \nmost of that is done during the tax season and we need the accountants \nduring the tax season. And they need the business during the tax \nseason. If they don't earn at least 70 percent of their revenue during \nthat time, they are out of business, which precludes them from picking \nup legislative experience. There is no requirement that you have to \nhave legislative experience before you come here. There is no \nrequirement that you have any kind of experience. But that is why there \nare fewer accountants here than there are a number of other \nprofessions--it is a matter of timing.\n  While I am hesitant to move forward with the number of changes \nincluded in the bill, I do believe the legislation is necessary given \nthe current lack of faith in accountants.\n  Make no mistake about it, this legislation is federalization of the \naccounting industry. This bill places a Federal Government bureaucracy \nat the helm of accounting regulation. While the legislation doesn't \nprevent the State accountancy boards from continuing to regulate \naccountants registered in their States, it does establish an overlord \nregulator to oversee the firms which audit publicly traded companies. \nMy hope is that this new oversight structure will renew the faith the \npublic has in auditors and the financial statements which they help \nprepare.\n  In addition to my own proposal, over the past several months I have \nseen a lot of different proposals. I have also spoken to and met with \nmany of my colleagues about this issue. I have spoken with groups from \ndifferent industries; I have talked to scholars, consumer advocates, \nand regulators. All the groups agree that steps need to be taken to \nenhance the oversight of accountants.\n  I have examined several existing models of quasi-public regulators \nsuch as the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of \nSecurities Dealers. One point is clear: When these organizations were \nestablished, there was a desire to appoint the most informed \nindividuals, those who actually deal with the industry on a day-to-day \nbasis, as majority members of the boards that oversee the industry.\n  For instance, the National Association of Securities Dealers, NASD, \nhas a large board which must consist of anywhere between 17 and 27 \nmembers. Nowhere in the NASD rules does it state their board members \nmay not serve if they have previously been involved in the securities \nindustry. As such, the majority of the NASD board members have worked \nwithin the industry.\n  Why should the accounting industry be treated so differently? Why \nwould we create a board which oversees the accounting industry and then \nrequire that a minority of its members have ever practiced accounting? \nThe NASD plays just as important a role in the protection of investors \nas the accounting oversight board will, so why shouldn't the persons \nwho sit on this board have the best possible knowledge of the \naccounting industry?\n\n  I do want to thank Senator Sarbanes for the change he made in the \nlegislation. Originally it said there could be no more than two \naccountants on this five-person board. He made the change so that two \nwill be accountants. It is a very significant change so that \naccountants are represented on the board. Previously it would have been\n\n[[Page S6339]]\n\npossible to have no accountants regulating the accounting profession.\n  Every piece of legislation has its handful of unintended \nconsequences, despite how well-meaning Congress can be. I fear the way \nin which the accounting industry will change when a group of non-\naccountants set the standards which accountants must follow. Lawyers do \nnot have non-lawyers setting ethical and professional standards which \nthey must follow, yet I would argue that those standards are as \nimportant as accounting standards and ethics.\n  I don't want my message to be misconstrued. I do believe that a board \nshould be established to oversee the accounting industry. I also agree \nthe board members should have all the tools necessary to effectively \noversee the industry. I agree that the board members should be full-\ntime and independent from the accounting firms. I agree that they \nshould be appointed by government and not by industry. But I do not \nagree that the members of the board should be excluded just because \nthey may have passed a CPA exam 25 years ago.\n  To the contrary, because I believe this board should be as effective \nas possible, I believe the board members should know how an audit \nengagement works and they should know the pressures that are applied to \nan auditor from a client. I believe with this knowledge the board may \nin fact apply stricter standards than a board of non-accountants.\n  As I said, I believe accounting firms should be subject to strict \nscrutiny. However, I do not believe this legislation should pave the \nroad for the trial bar to open frivolous lawsuits against accounting \nfirms. Arthur Andersen no longer exists. Can we really afford to lose \nanother one or two of the final four firms? We used to call them the \nbig five. Now we call them the final four.\n  It was mentioned earlier that there are 16,254 SEC-filed \ncorporations. That is 16,254 to be reviewed, primarily by four \naccounting firms. If the trial lawyers pick off one after another after \nanother of the firms because the Board provides information and because \nthey are handed that information, how will we have those 16,254 audited \nat all?\n  I am hoping there are a lot of young people listening who are going \ninto accounting who may start firms and grow the firm themselves so \nthey can handle an audit of a Fortune 500 company. But it doesn't \nhappen overnight. And we have to make sure that there is auditing, and \nnot just consulting, which some people will point out is where most of \nthe money is these days.\n  It makes me nervous to know that essentially only four accounting \nfirms now have the resources and expertise to audit the world's largest \ncompanies. We rely on these firms to verify the books of diverse and \ncomplex companies because they are the only firms that can provide this \nservice. If we subject them to the will of the trial bar, they will \nsurely continue to be driven from existence, one firm at a time.\n  Instead, we should punish the wrongdoers to the fullest extent \npossible and rely on good managers of companies to do their jobs \neffectively. In the end, we are going to end up making the audit \ncommittee members full-time employees, and then there will not be any \nindependence--another problem about which we have to worry.\n  Having said this, I do believe this legislation is needed at this \ntime. Congress must produce a remedy to help restore investor \nconfidence. We have seen that real penalties, or at least a threat of \nstrong penalties, need to be hung over the heads of corporate \nexecutives to assure they maintain their obligations and \nresponsibilities. The moral and ethical breakdown among some of those \nexecutives is disgraceful, and investors must know these executives \nwill be punished severely when they make selfish judgments.\n  A major concern, as we have gone through this legislation, trying to \nput the bill in its present form, has been the relationship to small \nbusiness. As I mentioned 16,254 companies are the ones that are \nregistered with the SEC. There are thousands of companies out there \nthat are not SEC registered businesses. There are thousands of entities \nout there that hire auditors to give confidence in the financial \nstatements they have that are not SEC filed.\n  One of our concerns has been that we not change business so \ndrastically that these small businesses will no longer be able to \nafford auditors. So we built in protections for the small businesses. \nOur intent with this bill is not to have the same principles that apply \nto the Fortune 500 companies apply to the mom-and-pop business. When \nthey hire an auditor, they want that auditor to give them every bit of \ninformation they possibly can so the information they get improves \ntheir business and doesn't hide anything from investors. Mom and pop \nare the investors.\n  We have taken a lot of care to be sure we are not cascading the \nprovisions down into small business. We will look at additional ways, I \nam sure, to make sure that does not happen. This is not a license to \nStates to do the same thing that we are doing on a Federal basis. There \nis recognition that on a Federal basis there is a bigger problem than \non a State-by-State basis.\n  I also want to point out there is also a responsibility by the \nindividual investor. They have to learn to diversify and not to keep \nall of their eggs in one basket. I hope we can turn this situation into \na chance to educate small investors as to how best to manage and invest \ntheir money. Nothing will bring back the billions of dollars employees \nof some of these companies have lost. But hopefully the collapse in \nconfidence will ensure that individuals will never again lose their \nlife savings because of a lack of diversification or knowledge of \nfinance.\n  What will this legislation provide? It will provide a strong \noversight body to watch the accounting industry. It will provide a set \nof corporate governance laws that will require corporate executives to \nbecome accountable for their financial statements. It will provide \nassurances that corporate boards watch the management of the company \nwith a more critical eye--no longer will board memberships be cushy \njobs with no responsibility.\n  It will also provide assurances to the American people that Congress \nwill not allow these millionaire and billionaire executives to \nsteamroll their obligations to the shareholders. It will also ensure \nthat research analysts aren't being told what to say by the investment \nbankers.\n  To a great extent, I believe the marketplace has made remarkable \nchanges to address a number of the issues which were highlighted by \nthese corporate failures. First and foremost, corporate boards and \naudit committees will no longer turn their head when management wants \nto engage in questionable ethical engagements. Also, credit rating \nagencies will impose much more scrutiny on the companies they rate to \nprotect financial institutions and other lenders. Lenders themselves \nwill require more information about the stability of the companies in \nwhich they invest. Research analysts will ask more questions about the \ncompany, and more importantly, they will demand more answers from \nexecutives. But perhaps, most important of all, is the fact that \ninvestors, both institutional and individual, will be more critical.\n  Shareholders will wake up and learn about the power of their votes on \ncorporate actions. We've already seen great strides from some \ninstitutional investors in that they plan to use their votes in \nshareholder meeting to keep executives honest and accountable. They \nalso plan to use their votes to impact executive compensation packages. \nThese private sector solutions will be more effective than any \nlegislation which can be passed out of Washington.\n  One of our country's greatest strengths rests in the dominance of our \ncapital markets. But the strength of our markets is only as strong as \nthe underlying confidence in the listed companies. When these companies \nbuild facades instead of standing on principle, it shatters the entire \nsystem. Congress and the SEC must find a middle ground where we allow \nthe marketplace to continue to operate in the capital markets to the \ngreatest extent possible but also assures investors, both domestic and \ninternationally, that the U.S. capital markets will continue to be \nworthy of their investments. We must continue to convince investors, \nthat at the core of the American capital markets, there must be a high \nlevel of integrity and ethics by all players.\n  I want to reiterate another message that has been prevalent this \nafternoon.\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\n  As we get into this bill, there are virtually no limits on what \namendments can be put on--at least unless there is a cloture motion.\n  I hope people will recognize the need to have something done, the \nneed to get it done quickly, and not try and make this a vehicle for \neverything they ever thought needed to be done with corporations.\n  The purpose of this bill is not to solve the international problems \nof business for everything that we ever thought of.\n  I hope my colleagues will constrain their amendments, keep them to \nthe corporate governance and accounting area we are working on, and \nhelp us to get this bill finished as quickly as possible.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Sarbanes and Senator Gramm for their \ntremendous efforts and insight which they provided in the previous \nexplanation of this, and for the hours of work they have put into the \nsolution that is before us today. I hope we can keep it to a limited \nsolution, take care of the problems that are recognizable, and reach \nagreement so we can get this to conference and get a bill to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to send an amendment to the desk and have it immediately \nconsidered. This amendment makes two simple changes to the bill. One is \na technical change to conform to the budget rules, and a conforming \nchange involving the definition of ``issuers.'' We have discussed this. \nIt has been cleared. I would like to go ahead and take care of that \nbusiness, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there isn't any objection. I think this \nclarifies the bill. I think it is something that both sides are for, \neven though we had a previous agreement not to do any amendments today. \nIt is simply so technical that I don't think anybody would have any \nconcerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4173\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4173.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To make technical and conforming amendments)\n\n       On page 65, line 11, strike ``All'' and insert ``Subject to \n     the availability in advance in an appropriations Act, and \n     notwithstanding subsection (h), all''.\n\n       On page 76, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       (d) Conforming Amendment.--Section 10A(f) of the Securities \n     Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78k(f)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Definition'' and inserting \n     ``Definitions''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following: ``As used in this \n     section, the term `issuer' means an issuer (as defined in \n     section 3), the securities of which are registered under \n     section 12, or that is required to file reports pursuant to \n     section 15(d), or that will be required to file such reports \n     at the end of a fiscal year of the issuer in which a \n     registration statement filed by such issuer has become \n     effective pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. \n     77a et. seq.), unless its securities are registered under \n     section 12 of this title on or before the end of such fiscal \n     year.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4173) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I first want to extend my appreciation to \nthe Senator from Maryland for this bill. It is really well timed and \nwell done.\n  I received a letter today from the Secretary of State of the State of \nNevada, a Republican.\n  By the way--the Senator from Connecticut is in the Chamber--the \nSecretary of State worked very closely with the Senator from \nConnecticut. As the Senator will recall, he is a very fine man. I wish \nhe were a member of the Democratic Party. He is not. But he is an \noutstanding public servant.\n  He wrote me a letter, which said:\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: Investor confidence in the integrity of \n     U.S. securities markets has been badly shaken as a result of \n     Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, and other alleged \n     wrongdoing. The failure of several large corporations to \n     police themselves cries out for reform before the negative \n     impact on our markets damages our National economy.\n       The Senate is to begin consideration of S. 2673, The Public \n     Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of \n     2002, on Monday, July 8. I fully support S. 2673 and oppose \n     any efforts to weaken its provisions.\n\n  If I could have the attention of the Senator from Maryland, the \nmanager of this bill, I have here a letter from the secretary of state \nof the State of Nevada, who says:\n\n       I fully support S. 2673 and oppose any efforts to weaken \n     its provisions.\n\n  I say to the Senator, one of the things the Secretary of State of \nNevada is worried about is someone attempting to weaken the bill that \nyou have brought forward to prevent State securities agencies from \nlooking at wrongdoings in the State of Nevada.\n  As the Senator from Maryland knows, the attorney general from New \nYork, who has been here, is very concerned about this. It is my \nunderstanding this bill does nothing to weaken that; is that true?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is correct. At one point there was talk of an \namendment floating around but----\n  Mr. REID. But the point is, it is not in the bill?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, it is not in the bill.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of the secretary of state of Nevada, who I \nindicated earlier worked closely with the Senator from Connecticut in \nbringing forward a very good election reform bill--he is very \nprogressive, and a fine secretary of state--throughout this letter, he \nacknowledges how important this legislation is. I wanted this to be \nspread on the Record before my friend's attention was diverted.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate the Senator's comments.\n  Mr. REID. My friend, secretary of state Heller, goes on to say:\n\n       As Nevada's chief securities regulator, I believe there is \n     an immediate need to restore investor confidence in our \n     securities markets.\n       I stand with my fellow state securities regulators in \n     endorsing Title V, Analyst Conflicts of Interest, in its \n     current form and strongly oppose any amendment to this title \n     that would reduce our ability to investigate wrongdoing and \n     take appropriate enforcement actions against securities \n     analysts. However, an industry amendment has been circulated \n     that would prohibit state securities regulators from imposing \n     remedies upon firms that commit fraud if it involves \n     securities analysts and perhaps even broker-dealers that \n     serve individual investors. If Nevada's investigative and \n     enforcement authority in this area are weakened, so too will \n     the confidence of Nevada investors.\n\n  He certainly opposes this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from our \nsecretary of state be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Office of the Secretary of State,\n\n                                                     July 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Reid: Investor confidence in the integrity of \n     U.S. securities markets has been badly shaken as a result of \n     Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, and other alleged \n     wrongdoing. The failure of several large corporations to \n     police themselves cries out for reform before the negative \n     impact on our markets damages our national economy.\n       The Senate is to begin consideration of S. 2673, The Public \n     Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of \n     2002, on Monday, July 8. I fully support S. 2673 and oppose \n     any efforts to weaken its provisions. As Nevada's chief \n     securities regulator, I believe there is an immediate need to \n     restore\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\n     investor confidence in our securities markets.\n       I stand with my fellow state securities regulators in \n     endorsing Title V, Analyst Conflicts of Interest, in its \n     current form and strongly oppose any amendment to this title \n     that would reduce our ability to investigate wrongdoing and \n     take appropriate enforcement actions against securities \n     analysts. However, an industry amendment has been circulated \n     that will prohibit state securities regulators from imposing \n     remedies upon firms that commit fraud if it involves \n     securities analysts and perhaps even broker-dealers that \n     serve individual investors. If Nevada's investigative and \n     enforcement authority in this area are weakened, so too will \n     the confidence of Nevada investors.\n       An amendment may be offered on the Senate floor under the \n     guise of creating national uniform standards for securities \n     analysts. Its real intent, I fear, is to eliminate remedies \n     that state securities regulators may impose on firms should \n     fraudulent activity be unearthed in an investigation. This \n     approach is clearly ill-advised in today's climate of \n     investor uncertainty.\n       As Nevada's Secretary of State, my office is charged with \n     administering the Nevada Uniform Securities Act. My office is \n     in current negotiations with Merrill Lynch regarding a \n     possible settlement of analyst conflicts discovered in a \n     lengthy investigation by the New York Attorney General's \n     office. My staff is also participating in a task force \n     investigation of UBS Paine Webber/UBS Warburg. This amendment \n     would greatly hamper our ability to investigate analyst \n     conflicts and would have a detrimental effect on Nevada \n     investors.\n       I urge you to support S. 2673 and to vote against any \n     amendment to weaken the enforcement powers of state \n     securities regulators. The result of an amendment such as \n     this could be that virtually every one of the thousands of \n     actions brought by state securities regulators every year \n     would be preempted, as well as all civil suits and \n     arbitrations under state law. In light of the recent Enron \n     and WorldCom debacles, it simply does not make sense to limit \n     or preempt the state's ability to bring enforcement actions \n     against analysts who lie to Nevada investors. The public is \n     looking for elected officials to help them regain their \n     confidence in corporate America.\n       As Nevada's Secretary of State, I have a duty to protect \n     our state's investors. Any measure that dilutes my authority \n     as the state's chief securities regulator is counter to the \n     mission of my office and to state securities regulators \n     nationwide. Accordingly, I again urge you to vote against any \n     amendment to S. 2673 that would weaken the enforcement powers \n     of state securities regulators.\n       Please call me at (775) 684-5709 if you have any questions \n     or need additional information\n           Sincerly,\n                                                      Dean Heller,\n                                               Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our Nation is experiencing a crisis in \nconfidence among the investing public. Americans hear on the news and \nread in the papers every day more and more cases of corporate \nexecutives bilking employees and investors, and of auditors who looked \nthe other way, of boards of directors failing to provide the oversight \nexpected of them, and of well-connected investors buying and selling \nstock based on insider information. Investors do not know who they can \ntrust.\n  We have been in a mad rush the last many years to make sure that the \nquarter you are involved in has a good financial statement. People go \nto whatever ends they can to make sure that that quarterly statement \nlooks good to keep the stock price up. That is all that matters. It \ndoes not matter whether the company is losing money. It does not matter \nif their employees are being laid off. It does not matter, as long as \nthey do everything they can to do what can be done to make sure that \nstock price stays the same or goes up.\n  I have spoken previously on efforts of Senators to secure the future \nfor American families. In fact, Senate Democrats are using that as a \ntheme: to secure the future for all American families. Securing our \nfuture means not only making sure our borders are safe but also \nsecuring educational opportunities for all our children and access to \naffordable prescription drugs and affordable health care.\n  We must also provide pension protection for American families. In \npart, that means extending pension coverage. There will be an \nopportunity, before this legislative year ends, where we can have a \ngood debate.\n  The vast majority of workers in Nevada have no pensions. As a \nconsequence, they face their retirement years with inadequate \nresources. Senator Bingaman, chairman of a task force, has raised \nawareness of the lack of pension coverage for American workers and is \nworking on legislation to address that problem.\n  My colleagues have also led the way with other legislative \ninitiatives to restore investor confidence and provide safeguards to \nsecure Americans' investments, pensions, and retirement savings.\n  Chairman Sarbanes has introduced important legislation that will \ncreate a strong, independent oversight board to oversee the conduct of \nauditors of public companies, and he has done this on a bipartisan \nbasis. That bill was reported out of committee, as I recall, by a vote \nof 17 to 4, with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  This legislation would establish guidelines and procedures to assure \nthat auditors of public companies do not engage in activities that \ncould undermine the integrity of the audit. It ensures greater \ncorporate responsibility by setting standards for audit committees and \nfor corporate executives, but it would, we would hope, impose penalties \nwhen standards are violated. It would establish additional criteria for \nfinancial statements and require enhanced disclosures regarding \nconflicts of interest.\n  This legislation also directs the Securities and Exchange Commission \nto adopt rules to improve the independence or research and disclose \npotential conflicts of interest. It also would provide a significant \nboost in funding for the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nto help it carry out its responsibilities in a fashion that would help \nrestore investors' confidence in the markets.\n  This legislation goes a tremendous distance in addressing some of the \nmajor concerns I have heard from people in Nevada. And I am pleased \nthis bill has gained, as I have indicated, bipartisan support.\n\n  Indeed, it seems that after staying silent for so long, and after \nallowing a permissive atmosphere where businesses could do no wrong, \nthe President, our President, and Republicans in Congress, quite \nfrankly, are now reversing course. Some are falling all over themselves \nto jump on the bandwagon and support this legislation. They have done \nit after hearing from an outraged public. And that is good.\n  Tomorrow I will be eager to hear what the President has to say in New \nYork. I hope that he does not say we are going to have to enforce the \nlaw that we have, because the law we have has not been enforced, \nespecially by the people who surround this President and his \nadministration.\n  For him to go to New York and say we need to enforce the law more \nstrongly will not do the trick. He needs to jump on the bandwagon with \nthis legislation. We need additional legislation.\n  The President ran a campaign based on themes such as responsibility \nand accountability, but recent news reports suggest that both have been \nlacking in his explanations of his past dealings in the business world.\n  Prior to holding public office, our President has parlayed his \nconnections as a member of a wealthy and powerful family to arrange a \nnumber of, some would call, sweetheart deals. In editorials they have \nbeen referred to that way for the past several days. Despite a string \nof business failures, our President always seemed to land on his feet \nand seemed to profit.\n  Now there are disturbing indicators that he has played fast and loose \nwith some of the rules that he is now being asked, through his \nadministration, to enforce. When asked about his business dealings, the \nPresident has not accepted personal responsibility, instead shifting \nblame to accountants and lawyers or implying that he was just doing \nbusiness as usual.\n  I would have to say there are questions not only about the Harken \nbusiness dealings but about the business and accounting practices of \nHalliburton, where Vice President Cheney enriched himself, walking away \nwith tens of millions of dollars.\n  So the problems we have heard go far beyond Enron and the President's \nfriend, as he referred to him, ``Kenny boy,'' Kenny Lay. They are not \nlimited to the handful of companies getting most of the media coverage \nin recent weeks. Instead, there are fundamental and systematic problems \nthat have to be corrected. That is what this legislation is all about.\n  I applaud the chairman and the committee for reporting out this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  I hope, I repeat, that the President will join in supporting this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\nWe need to make sure that those who serve as corporate executives and \non boards accept the responsibility of their roles when they sign their \nname on a financial report. The American people need to be able to \ntrust corporate leaders.\n  Likewise, the President, and those in his administration who came to \noffice from the corporate world, need to show more transparency in \nletting the American people know how they are making policy decisions, \nwho has access to them, who is influencing them, who is meeting with \nthem.\n  I joined in an amicus brief with the General Accounting Office to \nhave the Vice President disclose who he met with to come up with energy \npolicy that this administration enumerated. We need to know with whom \nhe met, when he met with them, and why he met with them. They refused \nto give us that information. That is why I joined in that litigation.\n  This administration must set aside what I believe and agree with \nsome--again, it is replete in the editorials of the last few days--is \ntheir arrogance and secrecy and instead be open and forthcoming public \nservants.\n  This legislation is timely. The Banking Committee jumped right on it. \nMost of us thought the Enron thing was something that was a rare \ndealing in corporate America. We have come to find out it is not a rare \ndealing in corporate America. It has happened since then time and time \nagain. We have only seen the beginning of it, I am sure.\n  The Banking Committee is to be applauded for moving this legislation \nforward on a bipartisan basis. By a vote of 17 to 4, it was reported \nout of committee. I would hope we can get this bill out of the Senate \nas quickly as possible. It is good legislation. It is legislation that \nthe American people need to reestablish confidence in corporate America \nand those people they rely on so that they feel better about having \ntheir pensions supplemented with investments made in the stock market.\n  The stock market is an indication, as far as I am concerned, of how \npeople feel about what is going on in business. As we know from recent \ndays, people have not felt very good about it. We have had tremendous \nlosses. I heard the chairman of the committee, Senator Sarbanes, speak \nabout the Nasdaq losing some 74 percent of its value. That is a \nsignificant loss to our country.\n  I know the Members of the Senate understand the importance of this \nlegislation. I hope that they understand why it is important to move it \nas quickly as possible. We have a few short weeks to complete lots of \nextremely important legislation prior to the August recess. As I have \nsaid on four separate occasions, this legislation is as important as \nanything we could do, and it is very timely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks by commending the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee. I have said on other \noccasions and in other places that for students of the Congress who \nwish to find a good example of how to prepare a committee and \nultimately the Chamber for a moment such as this, a good model to use \nwould be the hearings conducted by the chairman of the committee on \nthis very question.\n  There were 10 hearings--there may have been more, certainly 10 full \nhearings--to which were invited virtually everyone from across the \nspectrum on this question. This was hardly a set of hearings where we \nheard from one side. We literally invited the best experts in the \ncountry; they came and shared with us their views and thoughts on what \nsort of steps we should be taking to reform the accounting profession, \nto reform the rules affecting the accounting profession.\n  I begin by extending my compliments to the chairman and his staff for \nthe tremendous job done to lay the groundwork. Oftentimes we will see, \nparticularly in light of a crisis that occurs, there is a rush to \njudgment. We will come very quickly to the floor with a sort of a cut-\nand-paste job with the legislation. I am not suggesting intentions are \nnot good, but that is oftentimes how we react.\n  This set of hearings did, very deliberately, with a great deal of \npatience and thought, lay out the foundation for the legislation now \nbefore the Senate.\n  Certainly, while there will be ideas offered to improve the \nlegislation, we think the committee has produced a very fine product. \nThe best evidence of that is the fact that 17 of us in the committee \nfound this proposal to be worthy of our support. There were four \ndissenters. I think even among dissenters, there was a sense that we \nwere heading in the right direction. Some may have fundamentally \ndisagreed, but if there were one in the four, I don't know which one it \nwould have been. Most thought we were doing the right thing, either \nthat we went a little too far or didn't go far enough possibly, but \nthis is a very balanced approach.\n  I urge our colleagues to be careful of two potential actions in the \ncoming days. One would be to dilute this product in some way. We are \nnot suggesting we have written perfection here, but we think this is a \nwell-balanced proposal.\n  Senator Sarbanes has worked closely with our colleague from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi, who is the only Member of this body who is actually a \nformer member of the accounting profession. He brings a wealth of \npersonal knowledge and awareness to the issue. He worked very closely \nwith him and other members of the minority, as well as with those of us \non the majority side, to finally bring this product to the Chamber. It \nalready has involved some compromise.\n  At this hour, when investor confidence is going to be absolutely \ncritical and the steps that we take and the language we use will in no \nsmall measure contribute to the restoration of confidence, it can just \nas easily do the opposite, if we are not careful. This is a critical \nmoment in the economic history of our country.\n  The steps taken by those who are in significant positions to affect \nthe outcome of the course we are on are going to be critically \nimportant.\n  The second caution I express is that we don't try to also overburden \nthis bill to say that this is the only opportunity for us to deal with \nevery other issue affecting corporate business life in America. I am \nnot suggesting the ideas Members will want to bring to the table are \nbad. But we can so load down a good bill that we can sink this effort \nif we are not careful. I urge my colleagues as well to be restrained in \nthe temptation to bring up every other idea and incorporate it as part \nof an accounting reform proposal. Those are the two cautionary notes I \nhave.\n\n  Let me also add my voice to those who have expressed theirs earlier \ntoday. Tomorrow I know the President of the United States is going to \ngive a very important speech on Wall Street in New York, the financial \ncapital of our country. I commend him for doing so. I think it is \nextremely important that he actually go to Wall Street to share his \nviews.\n  My hope would be that this evening, as he makes the final \npreparations for his remarks, he would come out four square and endorse \nthis proposal that we have brought out of our committee by a vote of 17 \nto 4. I can't think of anything more the President could do in the next \n24 hours, aside from the rhetoric he will offer, than to endorse this \nbill and to say this was a good effort and to talk about the laborious \nhearings we have held to learn exactly what was necessary to \nincorporate in this legislation.\n  Lastly, I would hope we would get this bill done fairly soon and not \nlet this go on too long. We would love to be able to not only finish \nour work here but to go to conference with the House, which has another \nproposal. It is a weaker proposal, in my view, but nonetheless we will \nhave to work with them to resolve our differences and to send a bill to \nthe President for his signature.\n  I would hope that before we leave for our August break less than 3 \nweeks from today we would actually be able to give to the President a \nbill for his signature and not let it drag on over into September and \nOctober. It is important we act in a timely fashion.\n  With those background thoughts, I would like to share some general \ncomments about the bill itself. The importance of this issue cannot be \noverstated. Anyone who has read a paper or turned on the news or \nflipped on their computer is aware of the crisis in our financial \nmarkets and, in fact, beyond that, in our Nation. No rule or regulation \nis enough to address this fundamental problem.\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\n  The issue causing all of this turmoil is about the simple word of \n``trust.'' The question that the world is asking is not whether our \ncompanies or corporations or the workers who toil in them or the \nproducts and services are competitive, but simply whether we are \ntelling the truth. Are we telling the truth?\n  The reason people of the world so often have come here and invested \ntheir hard-earned resources is not because there is a better deal to be \nmade financially speaking. It is because there is a sense that our \nstructures are sound, transparent, and they are fair. You may end up \nlosing your investment; you may make money on your investment. That is \nalways a risk when you make a financial investment. But the one thing \nyou could always say about the United States, as opposed to almost any \nother place around the globe, is that when you come to America and \ninvest your money, there is a sense of fairness and trust and soundness \nto our financial institutions and the structures that we created to \nprotect them.\n  That trust has been fractured by the events that have occurred over \nthe last 9 months, And it continues to be fractured with daily reports. \nSo it is vitally important that we respond in an appropriate and \nthoughtful manner as the Congress of the United States. We have done \nso, in my view, with the proposal the chairman has brought to our \nattention. The very integrity of our markets is being questioned, and \nthe Congress must respond cautiously, prudently, and also \nexpeditiously.\n\n  Enron's collapse in December was, of course, an enormous shock to all \nof us. Seven or eight months later, we have seen that Enron was not an \nisolated incident. There have been a whole host of corporate accounting \nscandals and collapses--names such as WorldCom, Global Crossing, Tyco, \nAdelphia, the list goes on and on. I fear, as my colleagues do, that \nthe latest corporate accounting scandal with WorldCom will not be the \nlast. I hope it will be, but my fear is it will not be.\n  The Congress should address the critical issue of accounting reforms \nas quickly as we can. America's financial engine does not need a \ntuneup, it needs an overhaul. We must disassemble it in some ways, \nexamine every nut, bolt, and working part, and reassemble it to reflect \nthe days in which we live.\n  The fact is, if we fail to act on serious reforms, America will see a \ncontinuation of the dangerous and discredited corporate accounting \npractices that have, in the past 7 months alone, cost American \nshareholders and workers billions of dollars in their savings and \npensions. This has deeply shaken investor confidence, and that serves \nas a cornerstone of our economic system.\n  It is important to note that in the dozens of hearings surrounding \nEnron's collapse, no committee has engaged in a more nonpartisan \nexamination, focused not just on what went wrong with Enron but, far \nmore important, what Congress can do to prevent future Enrons from \noccurring in the days ahead.\n  On March 8 of this year, Senator Jon Corzine and I introduced \nlegislation, S. 2004, that addressed what we thought were some of the \ntough issues on improving regulatory oversight of the accounting \nprofession and restoring investor confidence. I worked closely with the \nchairman, as did Senator Corzine, to incorporate some of the language \nand spirit of S. 2004 in the legislation before us today.\n  I thank the chairman for including in the product before us much of \nwhat we wrote in S. 2004. I thank his staff, and I also thank my \ncolleague from Wyoming.\n  Congress must act quickly. If nothing else, we must address the most \nprominent cause of the recent corporate scandals, the practices \ninherent and common to the accounting profession, and particularly the \nability to audit a company's books while simultaneously providing other \nservices to that same corporation. We saw this with Enron and Andersen. \nNow we see it with WorldCom and the pending investigations that have \ngreatly contributed to the public's loss of confidence in our financial \nmarketplace.\n  Since the beginning of the year, while our economy has been \nrebounding from last year's economic downturn and most economic \nindicators point to a bull market, the Nasdaq is down more than 20 \npercent, the Dow is down more than 3 percent, and trading volume has \ndeclined. One reason may be investor skepticism that companies are not \nas financially healthy as they have said they were. More restatements \non corporate earnings have been filed in the past 7 months than in the \nlast 10 years combined. Most of these restatements dramatically \ndowngrade the financial health of the companies in question.\n  Not surprisingly, the public is quickly losing trust in disclosed \ncorporate financial information. Although the investing public may be \nreacting to the bad behavior of a few, the possibility of conflicts of \ninterest between accounting firms and the companies they audit creates \na perception that this aggressive accounting is commonplace, even when \nit may not be. This perception, which takes on its own sense of \nreality, has led to a very dangerous, least-common-denominator thinking \nin which the estimated worth of all public companies may become \nundervalued because some are proven to be seriously overvalued.\n\n  The fact is, a few key reforms included in this bill can go a very \nlong way toward shoring up the public's confidence in the integrity of \nAmerica's financial marketplace.\n  Most importantly, to enhance auditor independence, the legislation \nrestricts the ability of accounting firms to audit a company's books \nwhile simultaneously providing other services. It also addresses the \nrevolving door through which executives from one firm leave to work for \nthe companies they audit.\n  This reform legislation includes the creation of an independent body \nto oversee the accounting profession, with substantial authority to \nensure auditor discipline and improve audit quality. The Securities and \nExchange Commission will also be given the resources to hire more \naccounting ``cops'' to handle increasingly complex oversight \nresponsibilities and improve the agency's investigative and \ndisciplinary capabilities. The Government must be able to assure the \npublic that audits meet the high standards of independence and \nobjectivity that have been the hallmark of America's accounting \nprofession.\n  The accounting profession is a great profession. There are thousands \nof highly qualified, talented, ethical people in the accounting \nprofession. I feel for them at this hour. Because of the malfeasance \nand fraud committed by some, the many who work in this profession feel \ntainted by it. I regret that. The best way I know to recover the \nconfidence people have in this profession is to provide some regulatory \nframework that would allow for auditor independence and for \nprofessionalism to be restored at a time when it has been so badly \ndamaged.\n  Investors are depending upon us to act on this issue and set aside \npartisan conflicts. As I said, we should not dilute this legislation \nand make it far less important, less meaningful, or overburden it by \ntrying to add too much to the bill. It is not an easy path to walk \ndown. I urge my colleagues to listen to those of us who worked on this \nbill, particularly the chairman, as we try to balance the particular \nneeds of our members and the desire to come up with a good, competent, \nbipartisan piece of legislation. This is not an easy path to walk down, \nbut it is critically important if we are going to contribute to the \nrestoration of investor confidence as part of our responsibilities as \nmembers of this historic Chamber.\n  The purpose of the original securities laws of the 1930s was to \nincrease public trust in America's financial markets, the reliability \nof disclosed corporate financial information. The resulting openness \nand accuracy of corporate disclosures to the investing public paved the \nvery way for America's rise as the unrivaled economic superpower that \nwe had achieved. The collapses of Enron, WorldCom, and other \ncorporations, and the accounting scandals have ended any question about \nwhether these laws need reexamination. They do. We know that reforms \nare mostly needed to protect and strengthen the public trust in \nAmerica's financial markets, and the time to enact them is now. I am \nconfident and hopeful that we will do just that in the ensuing days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator from \nConnecticut for his kind remarks about our work together on the \ncommittee as we tried to move this legislation forward. I particularly \nwant to underscore the very substantial and significant contribution \nthat the Senator from Connecticut and his colleague from New Jersey, \nSenator Corzine, made when they came forward fairly early on in the \nprocess with S. 2004.\n  Much of that legislation is included in this legislation, and it was \na seminal contribution early on in our consideration and it helped us \nto move ahead. I am grateful to him for that and for his efforts and \nsupport throughout this process as we have tried to move this \nlegislation forward.\n  The Senator from Connecticut, of course, is a chairman of one of our \nsubcommittees and has been enormously effective within the committee in \nhis efforts on this legislation, and I appreciate that. I am very \nhopeful that we are going to get a good product at the end of the \npath--of course, we are not there yet--which the President will sign \nand which will make a substantial difference.\n  It is a tragedy, in a sense. The founder of the accounting firm \nArthur Andersen was a man of great rectitude and very high principles. \nHe had the slogan ``think straight and talk straight'' to guide him.\n  His successor, Leonard Spacek, also was a man of very high principle. \nFor that company with those origins, in that tradition, to in effect \nhave happen what has happened to it is a tragedy, there is no question \nabout it.\n  We are anxious to reassure accountants all across the country that we \nthink this legislation will help bring the profession back to the \nstandards that marked it at an earlier time and which standards more \nthoughtful and more responsible members hope will mark it once again.\n  The point the Senator from Connecticut made in that regard is an \ninteresting and important one.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dodd). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I begin by saying the Senator from \nMaryland has done this Senate and this country a great service, along \nwith his colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, by writing \nlegislation that addresses a critically important topic at a very \nimportant time in this country.\n  As much as I appreciate the work done on this bill, I would still \nlike to speak about a few ways in which we can strengthen it. I \nlistened with some attention in the last hour or so as I presided in \nthe Senate to the suggestion that we ought not change it much. I do not \ndisagree with that assessment, but we ought to change it some, in my \njudgment. There are some areas we can strengthen, and I hope we can \nstrengthen this legislation and send it on to the President and have \nthe expectation the President will sign it.\n  This Chamber has long been the site of debates about excesses and \nabuses, especially in America's poverty programs. We have heard over a \ncouple of decades, and appropriately so, anecdotal stories about the \nCadillac welfare queen who spends food stamp money to buy cigarettes. \nCongress has clamped down on all of that and said: Shame on you, you \ncannot do that, that is abusing the public trust. And it is. So we have \ntaken aggressive action as we have seen these abuses.\n  Today this discussion is not about the abuse of the poverty program \nor the abuse at the bottom, this is about fraud in the boardroom; it is \nabout abuse at the top. It is important for all of us to understand \nthat accountability and responsibility do not just apply to poor people \nin this country, accountability and responsibility apply to everyone, \nand that includes the people at the top of the corporate structure.\n\n  I wish to talk about fraud in the boardroom, about deceiving \ninvestors, about cooking the books, about accounting firms that cannot \naccount, about law firms that turn a blind eye. I wish to talk about \nthe situations the country has seen in recent weeks and months that we \nhave not seen for many decades in this country.\n  The victims, of course, are the people in this country who have \ninvested in stocks, who believed in the certification of financial \nstatements by some of the biggest accounting firms in the country that \nthese were good corporations, that they had good income, that they were \nmoving in the right direction, taking steps so that the funds in \ncorporations were accounted for properly. And now we discover that was \nnot necessarily the case in all too many instances.\n  Of course, there are a lot of wonderful corporations in this country, \nwonderful companies with terrific top executive officers who do the \nright thing, always do the right thing. Yes, they take some risks, but \nthey do it in anticipation of gain for the stockholders. We ought not \ntarnish with the same brush all American corporations, but we ought to \ndetermine what is happening within some of these corporations that has \ncaused the collapse and the devastation of a lifetime of savings for \nmany Americans.\n  Let me use Enron as an example. We spent a fair amount of time with \nEnron hearings in the Commerce Committee. We had top executives of that \ncompany who had been cashing out prior to Enron going bankrupt. I have \na chart that shows the way in which the top management of Enron made \nfortunes on the sale of Enron stock, from 1998 to the present, at the \nsame time that they were driving their company into the ground.\n  Contrast this with a call I received from a fellow in North Dakota \none day who said: I worked for Enron for a good number of years. I had \na retirement plan, and all my retirement plan was in Enron stock. Mr. \nLay and others repeatedly encouraged us to do that. My retirement plan \nwas in Enron stock. It was worth $330,000. Now it is worth $1,700. He \nsaid: That is what happened to my life savings--$330,000 to $1,700.\n  What happened to the folks at the top of the ladder in Enron? Mr. \nLay, the chairman of Enron, from 1998 to the present, sold $101 million \nworth of stock. That is what he received. Mr. Rice, $72.7 million; Mr. \nSkilling, $66.9 million; Mr. Fastow, $30 million.\n  Mr. Fastow was able to have an equity role in the special purpose \nentities, the off-the-books partnerships, and in one of them he \nactually invested $25,000 of his own money. He invested $25,000, and 2 \nmonths later paid himself $4.5 million. I do not know anybody who gets \nreturns like that anywhere in America, except by cheating.\n  In the year 2001 in American corporations, the average pay for top \nCEOs increased by 7 percent, despite falling profits and stock values. \nIs there a relationship at the top between people who run the companies \nand the performance of the companies themselves? It does not look like \nit, does it?\n  In 1981, the average executive compensation of the top 10 highest \npaid CEOs was $3.5 million. In the year 2001, the average was $155 \nmillion. So we can see what has happened in this country at the top in \nthe boardroom.\n  Let's look at the number of times that CEO pay exceeds average worker \npay: In 1980, they made 42 times the pay of the average worker in the \ncompany. In 1990, they made 85 times the pay of the average worker in \nthe company. But in the year 2000, it was 531 times. So forty-twofold \nto five hundred and thirty-onefold. That is what has happened to \nexecutive compensation at the top of the corporate ladder.\n  We have seen story after story about what is happening in some of the \nboardrooms. There are a lot of wonderful companies, and I do not think \nthis ought to tarnish all American corporations, but we ought to be \nvery concerned about what is happening inside some publicly traded \ncorporations and why the safeguards have not been able to provide early \nwarning to investors and others.\n  Adelphia: The drop in their stock value is 99 percent. The question \nis whether it failed to properly disclose $3.1 billion in loans and \nguarantees to the family of the founder.\n  Dynegy: Whether the Project Alpha transactions served primarily to \ncut taxes and artificially increase cashflow, 67 percent of their value \nlost.\n  Enron lost 99.8 percent of its value. In fact, as I have mentioned \nbefore, the\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\nEnron board of directors commissioned a report called the Powers Report \nwhich looked at only three partnerships, and they described what was \nhappening inside this company was ``appalling.'' The board of directors \nof the company itself said what was happening inside the company was \nappalling. They said that in one year they reported $1 billion of \nincome they did not have.\n  Global Crossing: Whether it sold its telecom capacity in a way that \nartificially boosted 2001 cash revenue, 99.8 percent loss in value.\n  Halliburton: Whether it improperly recorded revenue from cost \noverruns on big construction jobs.\n  The list, of course, goes on.\n  Qwest: Whether it inflated revenue for 2000 and 2001 through capacity \nswaps and equipment sales.\n  On the weekend talk shows, I heard a panel discussion about this, and \none of the panelists who is kind of an academician said the market is \njust adjusting. That is an antiseptic way, by an economist I suppose, \nto ignore the fact that families are losing their life savings.\n  Sure, the market is adjusting, but it means families are losing \neverything they have. It means investors with 401(k)s see that 401(k) \nshrink so their life savings are disappearing right before their eyes.\n  The question with all of these issues is: What has changed? Why, with \nbig accounting firms taking a look at what is going on--and today there \nis a hearing on WorldCom in the House of Representatives--why, with big \naccounting firms looking over their shoulder, has this sort of thing \noccurred?\n  With Arthur Andersen and Enron, they had a $25 million relationship \nby which Arthur Andersen audited the Enron Corporation, and Arthur \nAndersen was also paid $27 million by the Enron Corporation for \nconsulting services. That is one of the things that is at the root of \nthis bill: Is that not a clear conflict of interest? Is there not \nenormous pressure on the accounting firm then to become an enabler for \nthat corporation? The answer clearly is yes, and that is why this \nlegislation takes action to deal with some of those issues.\n\n  I was driving in the car over the weekend in North Dakota and saw \nthat the Xerox Corporation had a substantial restatement of earnings. \nIt indicated that the SEC had previously taken a look at it and fined \nXerox $10 million, which seems to me like pretty much a slap on the \nwrist when you consider the billions of dollars involved in the \nrestatement. Then we hear this big story this weekend about yet another \nrestatement. So what we have is a restatement, and then a restatement \nof the restatement of earnings.\n  What is the cause of all of this, and what is enabling it? With \nEnron, for example, it was an accounting firm that became an enabler; \nit was a law firm that became an enabler; it was CEOs who became \ngreedy, officers of the corporation who did not pay much attention, who \nalso, incidentally, were making a great deal of money selling stock, \nboard members selling stock. It all became a carnival of greed.\n  I indicated, after having spent a lot of time looking at Enron, that \nthere was a culture of corruption inside that corporation. The CEO of \nEnron took great exception to that, but it is clear every passing day, \nwith more and more evidence of what happened inside that company, that \nthere was in fact a culture of corruption.\n  How do we respond to that, and how do we deal with that? I think \nthat, first of all, the rules have to be changed some, and that is what \nthis legislation attempts to do. Second, even if there are changes in \nthe rules, there must be an effective referee, a regulator. In this \nsystem of ours, we have to have effective regulation. And frankly, that \nhas been lacking.\n  Mr. Pitt, who is the head of the SEC, I know has taken great \nexception to statements that have been made by my colleagues and \nmyself. But the fact is that a system like this cannot work unless \nthere is effective oversight and regulation, and that has been lacking.\n  Consider some of the statements that Mr. Pitt has made. This is Mr. \nPitt speaking at the AICPA, which represents the accounting industry:\n\n       For the past two decades, I have been privileged to \n     represent this fine organization and each of the big five \n     accounting firms that are among its members. Somewhere along \n     the way, accountants became afraid to talk to the SEC. Those \n     days are ended.\n\n  That was to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\n  Then Mr. Pitt, who is, again, the head of the SEC, said:\n\n       The agency I am privileged to lead has not, of late, always \n     been a kinder and gentler place for accountants; and the \n     audit profession, in turn, has not always had nice things to \n     say about it.\n\n  So Mr. Pitt was concerned about ensuring a ``kinder and gentler'' \nSEC.\n  The New York Times did a story as a result of the initial speeches \nMr. Pitt gave when coming to the SEC. It noted that Pitt ``spoke \nfavorably of pro forma earnings reports in ways that no doubt heartened \naccountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst \nprofit figures look pretty.''\n  It also noted that ``A major embarrassment for accountants is having \nthe SEC force a client to restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief \naccountant, Robert Herdman, are sending signals that fewer such demands \nwill be made.''\n  We can change the law, but if we do not have a tough, no-nonsense \nregulator, then it will not work.\n  We all watch basketball games, and we see referees. They are the ones \nwho enforce the rules in basketball. We see a game from time to time \nwhere it is quite clear right at the start the referees are not going \nto call them close, and then pretty much it is ``Katy bar the door,'' \nand things get out of hand. Then we see other games in which it is \nquite clear they are going to call up close, and nothing gets out of \nhand. The same is true with the attitude and mindset of Federal \nregulators. We have regulatory agencies for a purpose. That purpose is \nto enforce the rules. Fairly, yes, but also aggressively.\n\n  If someone who comes from that industry and says, I represented all \nof you, and suggests it will be a kinder and gentler place, I wonder \nwhether that is the regulator we ought to have.\n  No matter who is heading the SEC, I want that person to be a fierce \nadvocate on behalf of the rules that protect investors. I want someone \nthat can make this system work and require everyone to own up to their \nresponsibilities. So people who never enter a corporate office or know \nnothing about a corporation but who want to invest in American \nbusiness, can buy a share of stock, having never met an officer of the \ncompany, having never visited the company, and can have confidence that \nwhat the accounting firm has said about that company, what the \nfinancial statements represent about that company, are absolutely fair \nand accurate.\n  That is the only way in which the American people can participate in \nthe raising of capital for America's business. If we do not do that and \ndo that quickly, we undermine the entire system by which we raise \ncapital in this country. We undermine the entire system. That is why \nthis piece of legislation is important and timely.\n  There are several amendments I would like to have considered, some I \nhope will be accepted, and some, perhaps, we will discuss at some \nlength, and I may or may not prevail. There are some amendments that \ncan strengthen and improve this legislation.\n  One of the provisions in the legislation calls for CEOs to return \nprofits and bonuses they wrongfully reaped in the 12 months following a \npublished earnings report that require a restatement. I would propose \nthat this provision apply when a company goes bankrupt, as well. This \nidea has been endorsed by former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, Goldman \nSach CEO Henry Paulson, and others.\n  There also ought to be some provision with respect to loans to CEOs \nby corporate boards of directors. I don't know what that limit ought to \nbe, but I mentioned one corporation where over $3 billion was loaned to \none family of the founder. This is a publicly traded corporation. I \nbelieve we ought to discuss that.\n  I may offer a provision dealing with something called inversion, a \nmechanism whereby some American corporations have decided they want to \nrenounce their American citizenship and move their official \nheadquarters to another country--Bermuda, for example. I want to be \ncertain that CEOs of such\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\ncompanies cannot escape the requirement of this bill that they certify \nthe accuracy of their financial statements. I do not think that, in \naddition to avoiding their fair share of U.S. taxes, these companies \nought to be held to a lesser standard of reporting accuracy than U.S.-\nbased firms. So I will offer an amendment, if needed, and visit with \nthe chairman and the ranking member about that subject.\n  Another issue, one requiring disciplinary proceedings to be open to \nthe public was discussed in committee. Transparency and having those \nhearings open to the public are important. I hope we can consider an \namendment on that.\n  The other issue that was discussed in the committee at great length: \nWhat is the definition of the division of responsibilities between \nauditing and consulting? That definition, determined by the SEC or the \nCongress, is critical to determining whether there is a conflict.\n  Having said all that, let me say to the Senator from Maryland, we are \nin the Senate the first week after the Fourth of July. I listened to \nthe Senators from Texas and Wyoming and Connecticut and others speak \nabout this bill. This is a good start. If this legislation passed \nwithout one word changed, it would make a magnificent contribution to a \nproblem we face, a gripping problem in this country.\n  Having said that, I do not subscribe to those on the committee who \nsay not to change anything. That is not what the chairman said. There \nare some suggestions that will come from other parts of the Senate that \ncan strengthen and improve this legislation, a couple of which I \nsuggested. When it goes to conference with the House, we will have \nsomething we can be proud of.\n  The most important thing is to show to the investors in this country \nwho have lost, in many cases, their life savings, that we are taking \naction to respond to the conditions that caused this to happen.\n  When we talk about the people at the top getting rich and the people \nat the bottom losing their life savings, the American people have every \nright to ask: By whose authority can this happen in this kind of \neconomy? It cannot happen if the rules are fair. It cannot happen if \nthe rules are enforced.\n  The American people have a right to expect the regulators, the SEC, \nand the Congress to take action now to address these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wellstone). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I initially came to the floor to talk about \nthis bill and another issue. The Water and Power Subcommittee of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee is holding a hearing on \nWednesday, and I asked to testify about the views of Missouri on the \nMissouri River issue. Initially, the staff said I was not going to be \nable to testify, and I was going to therefore have to share my \ntestimony with the entire body. However, I have now been advised by the \nchairman of the committee I will have an opportunity to testify, so I \nwill save my comments for the committee hearing.\n  I thank the chairman for giving me that opportunity.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me explain to the Senator what my hope was. The \nSenator asked to testify, quite properly. The Missouri River manual \nissue is a highly controversial issue. The Senator has been involved \nwith it for some long while. We are having a hearings. The Corps of \nEngineers and many others are testifying. My hope had been we could \nhold a hearing with all of those groups, then have a separate meeting, \nhearing from all Members of Congress who want to testify. It appears \nthat that will not be the case.\n  We will hear from Senators at the front end of that hearing. I assume \nit will take some time. As the Senator from Missouri knows, having \nindicated, yes, we would entertain his testimony, there are a number of \nother Senators who have already gotten in line saying, if that is the \ncase, please hear my statement, as well. Of course we will.\n  It was never a case where we would not hear testimony. The question \nwas whether we would have a separate hearing and hear Members of the \nSenate. I understand the Senator's concern. Senators Daschle, Johnson, \nConrad, Carnahan, and many, many other Senators have great concerns \nabout this issue.\n  I will lose some sleep Tuesday night with great anticipation hearing \nyour testimony on Wednesday morning.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my good friend from North Dakota and assure him I \nhope to be brief and to the point. I am somewhat disappointed I will \nnot share all that testimony with my colleagues, but there will be \nanother opportunity.\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for his kind indulgence.\n  Today I rise to join in expressing my concern about recent accounting \npractices in publicly held companies and their auditors. As a former \nState auditor, I have an interest in that profession being performed \nproperly. Obviously, something is seriously broken. We hear about \nEnron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, and Arthur Andersen. The people of \nAmerica are very concerned. We have seen millions of families with \ntheir investments diminished or even wiped out. That is not acceptable. \nThe vast majority of investments were not in the volatile sectors, or \nnot what we thought were the volatile sectors of the stock market. They \nwere invested in the so-called blue chip companies. The families who \nmade those investments on their strong belief in the integrity of our \nfinancial markets and accounting industry now find that because of \ncorporate shams, accounting gimmicks, and inadequate auditing, they \nhave lost significantly the investments they planned for education or \nretirement--for their families.\n\n  As far as we know, overall the overwhelming majority of publicly \ntraded companies are in full compliance with corporate accounting \nstandards. But the fact that there has been a significant deception by \na handful of companies raises suspicions of all companies. In addition, \nwe don't know how many others will come forward in coming weeks.\n  We must restore the public's confidence in the market. Without this, \nthe economic recovery which should be beginning will remain elusive.\n  While much of the focus in the debate here and in the news media is \non the auditing problems of the big conglomerate companies, \nunfortunately little attention has been paid in this bill to how the \nimpact will fall on small publicly traded companies and small auditing \nfirms. As the ranking member on the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have some concerns, after reviewing this bill, that \nwe may be pushing ahead without considering the serious effect and the \nunintended consequences the bill could have on smaller firms--both \nsmall auditing firms and small publicly traded companies.\n  The bill is clearly targeted towards abuses in extremely large \nbusinesses, which we all think should be dealt with. I personally hope \nit will result in prison sentences for people who are proven to have \ncommitted criminal acts in their accounting activities.\n  But the SEC is not even aware of how many small auditing firms there \nare auditing small, publicly traded companies. There are some 2,500 \nsmall companies, and we believe many of them are audited by small- and \nmedium-size auditing firms. For small auditors, the bill will require \nmany new elements including registration, annual filing requirements, \nas well as partnership rotation of lead auditors. In addition, the bill \nwould codify a list of banned services or nonauditing services that an \nauditing company might conduct for a company that it audits.\n  While some of these elements clearly are necessary to restore \nconfidence, and I think are going to be dealt with by regulatory action \nand maybe even by the industry itself, no one knows how these \nrequirements will affect the small firms. It has been argued that the \nbill allows for a case-by-case exemption, but that exemption process \nitself could be extremely costly and untimely for small firms and lead \nto inconsistent results.\n  I fear that some of these small auditing firms will not have the \nresources to implement these requirements and will stop auditing \nservices or just go out of business. The result may be that small, \npublicly traded companies may not be able to obtain auditing services \nat reasonable cost. As a result, the bill might be setting up a hurdle \nfor small companies to reach the public markets, one\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\nthat is too expensive and too great to overcome.\n  Clearly, when we deal with the major problems we ought not cause \nsignificant problems for the smaller, growing entrepreneurial sector of \nour country.\n\n  As for publicly traded companies, the bill also places new \nrequirements for auditing committees and for corporate responsibility. \nAgain, many of these may be necessary. However, we need to look at how \nthese requirements will affect the small, publicly traded companies.\n  The entrepreneurial spirit of our country is really the envy of the \nworld. People know that entrepreneurship works in America. That is \nwhere we get the new ideas. That is where we get the growth. That is \nwhere we get the new services and the products. We should be careful as \nwe adopt reforms not to put a disproportionate burden on these \ncompanies, dampening the entrepreneurial spirit or impeding access to \nthe public markets.\n  I fully support accounting reform and the taking of steps necessary \nto restore investor confidence in the market. I think we should pass a \nbalanced bill that will not overburden small firms and not create \nadditional hurdles that will impede them from growing. We don't want an \nincidental consequence of this bill to be a monopoly of large \naccounting firms when it comes to corporate audits.\n  I agree with the other speakers that the American public is looking \nto us for answers. I intend to work to see that the needs of the small \nbusinesses, publicly traded small companies, and small auditing firms \nare protected. I am committed, and I think we all are committed, to \nrestoring the public's confidence in the markets so families can feel \nsafe once again in investing in America and in America's future.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure a balanced \nbill which will do that without bringing unnecessary hardship on the \nentrepreneurial sector of our economy.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for the courtesy in allowing me to \ngo ahead. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the course of the Fourth of July \nrecess, I traveled through Pennsylvania holding some 16 town meetings, \nand I found many concerns among my constituents: The issue of \nprescription drugs; the concern about what is happening with respect to \nIraq; the issue of terrorism, which confronts the United States; the \nconcern about what might happen on July 4; concern about the suicide \nbombers from the Palestinians terrorizing Israel.\n  But high on the list of public concern was what has happened with \nEnron, WorldCom, and many other companies on the stock exchange, where \nso many of my constituents in Pennsylvania--like tens of millions of \nAmericans, really, and even more--have had their savings decimated in \ntheir retirement accounts of a variety of sorts. The issue that was \nraised consistently was: What happens next?\n  I think it is very good that the Senate is now considering \nlegislation to deal with the fraudulent conduct that has plagued so \nmany companies in corporate America. There is no doubt that there is a \nclear-cut conflict of interest for an accounting firm to be both an \nadviser and an auditor. An adviser has a close relationship with a \ncompany--call it cozy, or intimate, or friendly--but that is very \ndifferent from the function of an auditor, which ought to be at arm's \nlength, scrutinizing what the company has done. That kind of a conflict \nshould certainly be prohibited in the future. If the accounting firms \ndo not have enough understanding of the ethics, then laws have to be \nenacted, with very tough penalties to follow. When you find companies \nhaving so much debt off the books, subsidiary corporations, that is a \nmatter of fraud. Fraud is a misrepresentation of a fact where someone \nrelies to their detriment, and that is a crime. When you have companies \nputting expenses in, say, a capital account that shows billions of \ndollars in additional income or assets of the corporation, that too is \nfraud.\n  A good part of my career has been as an assistant DA and then as \ndistrict attorney. I believe this kind of white-collar crime is \ncertainly susceptible of deterrence, providing that standards are \nestablished and penalties are provided for a breach. It is my hope that \nfrom the Senate's current consideration, some very tough legislation \nwill follow.\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/08/senate-section/article/S6347-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6347-S6351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LOW MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENTS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for a considerable period of time, there \nhave been a number of counties in Pennsylvania that have been suffering \nfrom low Medicare reimbursements, which have caused them great \ndisadvantage because their nurses, their medical personnel, are moving \nto surrounding areas. I refer specifically to Luzerne County, \nLackawanna County, Wyoming County, Lycoming County, Mercer County, and \nColumbia County in northeastern Pennsylvania. Those counties are \nsurrounded by MSAs--metropolitan statistical areas--in Newport, New \nYork, to the north; in Allentown to the southeast; and to the \nHarrisburg MSA to the southwest.\n  When these counties are so surrounded by--and a similar situation \nexists in Mercer County, which has higher rates in immediately adjacent \nareas--there has been a flight of very necessary medical personnel. \nLast year, in the conference on the appropriations bill covering the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, the \nconferees were in agreement that there should be relief for these areas \nin Pennsylvania that were surrounded by areas that had higher MSA \nratings. At the last minute, word came from the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee that there would be an objection to including \nlanguage in our conference report because it was not included in either \nbill--in the House or in the Senate. That does make it subject to a \npoint of order, so we had a discussion. I went to the office of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and did my best \nto persuade him to make an exception in this case because of the \nextraordinary hardship. Senator Byrd, understandably, declined.\n  We then talked about bringing the matter forward in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I thought it highly likely that, given the \nimmediate history, we could accomplish this accommodation, this \ncorrection, in this appropriations bill. The House of Representatives \ncame forward, and the House leadership on the Ways and Means Committee \nand the House leadership generally agreed with Congressman Sherwood, \nwho represents these counties in northeastern Pennsylvania in the House \nof Representatives, and also Congressman Phil English, who represents \nMercer County, that these were indeed meritorious--not that there were \nnot other counties that had similar problems, but these counties were \nmeritorious and should have a change in the MSA.\n  When the matter reached the Senate floor and I filed an amendment to \nhave a similar result, there was resistance because, after all, it was \nin the House bill and it could be taken up in conference. It is custom \non a matter that a colloquy was entered into between Senator Byrd and \nmyself, and Senator Byrd said he would give every consideration to it \nin the conference.\n  It is true that there are other places in the United States that have \nproblems, but I believe none is so pressing as what is occurring in \nthese counties in Pennsylvania, as is evidenced by the fact that the \nleadership in the House of Representatives--as I say, the Ways and \nMeans Committee chairman and the leadership of the House--agreed to \nthese changes.\n  A week ago today, on July 1, I visited in Wilkes-Barre, PA, at the \nGossinger Clinic, with representatives of the hospitals and went over \nwith them the situation that had occurred and asked that they submit \nmemoranda, which showed the extreme plight, which I could then share \nwith my colleagues in the Senate, which I am now doing, and it will be \nin the Congressional Record for everyone to see.\n  A memorandum prepared by Bernard C. Rudegeair of the Greater Hazleton \nHealth Alliance pointed out the following:\n\n       With competing institutions located within a 30- to 60-\n     minute drive from our front\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\n     doors--and able to pay up to $4 per hour more to attract \n     staff--the Greater Hazleton Health Alliance has experienced \n     an outmigration of clinical staff to those areas.\n       In the last 18 months, 52 employees--including registered \n     nurses, licensed practical nurses, pharmacists, radiology \n     technologists and physical therapists--have resigned.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       Nearly three-quarters of our inpatient population are \n     Medicare recipients. It is often difficult for them to find \n     reliable transportation to out-of-town healthcare facilities.\n\n  So they are serviced at Greater Hazleton causing these hardships and \nlosses.\n  The senior vice president of operations at Geisinger Wyoming Valley \nMedical Center, Conrad W. Schintz, wrote on July 3 as follows:\n\n       There are 10 vacancies in the support departments, such as \n     laboratory and radiology. A significant factor in these \n     vacancies is the higher wages and benefits that are paid in \n     the Philadelphia and New York metropolitan areas that are \n     within a 2.5 hour drive from our hospital.\n\n  Similar concerns were noted by the Community Medical Health Care \nSystem of Scranton, PA, where Dr. C. Richard Hartman, president and \nCEO, wrote a detailed memorandum, a part of which is as follows:\n\n       Community Medical Center Healthcare System's exit \n     interviews with employees indicate greater opportunities \n     outside the MSA.\n\n  The hospital currently has 67 openings, 45 full-time-equivalent \npositions, and further noted the problems with retaining nurses there.\n  Similar concerns were expressed in a memorandum from Mr. William Roe, \nvice president of finance for the Moses Taylor Health Care System, \npointing out that ``while 30 percent of all hospitals in Pennsylvania \nhad negative total margins for the 3-year period between 1999 to 2001, \nnine (9) of the thirteen (13) hospitals located in this MSA have had \nnegative total margins.''\n  Then the memorandum from Mr. Roe goes on to point out the \ndifficulties which have occurred as a result of outmigration of medical \npersonnel.\n  Similar comments were made by Vice President William J. Schoen of \nAllied Services from Clarks Summit who points out:\n\n       Pocono and Allentown area hospitals are recruiting [our] \n     workers by offering more generous wage and benefit packages.\n\n  Of course, that is made possible by the higher reimbursement because \nthe MSA area is different.\n  A similar note was offered by Mr. James E. May, president and chief \nexecutive officer of Mercy Health Partners who pointed out:\n\n       The Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton MSA is surrounded by \n     facilities with significantly higher Medicare reimbursements.\n\n  The balance of his memo, which I will ask be printed in the Record, \ndetails further the difficulties which his hospital system faces.\n  The Wyoming Valley Health Care System, in a letter dated July 5 from \nDr. William Host and Mr. Michael Scherneck, the president and chief \nexecutive officer and the senior vice president and chief financial \nofficer point out the problems in retaining registered nurses because \nof the lower MSA which the Wyoming Valley Health Care System has.\n\n  CEO Robert Spinelli from Bloomsburg Hospital wrote to my executive \ndirector in Harrisburg, Andrew M. Wallace, dated July 3:\n\n       The current wage index rates have contributed to three \n     years of deficit income, which has resulted in the inability \n     to recruit qualified staff.\n\n  The Wayne Memorial Hospital, which is in the Newburgh, NY, area in a \nletter from director of finance, Michael J. Clifford, dated July 3 made \nthe same point:\n\n       The increase in Medicare payments that would result from \n     this change in MSA to Newburgh, New York, would mean \n     approximately $450,000 of additional Medicare reimbursement \n     for Wayne Memorial.\n\n  Tyler Memorial Hospital in Tunkhannock, PA, sent a memorandum \nexpressing the same basic point.\n  A similar letter has been submitted by the Marian Community Hospital \nby Chief Financial Officer Thomas L. Heron from Carbondale, PA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these memoranda and \nletters all be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. These letters set forth in some detail, Mr. President, \nwhich I will not take the time to read now, but the theme is the same. \nThese are hospitals in great financial distress. These are hospitals \nwhich are serving an aging population in northeastern Pennsylvania. \nSimilar circumstances exist in Mercer County. The way to correct this \nis to make the adjustment which is present in the House bill which can \nbe accomplished by the Senate receding to the House position.\n  As I say, last year on our conference report, we had agreed among the \nconferees to make the adjustment, and then did not proceed in that way \nbecause there was a technical problem with the provision not having \nbeen included in either bill. But this year, the leadership of the \nHouse of Representatives has included these corrections for these \nareas, and now I call upon my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee to recede and I call upon my colleagues in the full Senate to \napprove a conference report which will include these very important \ncorrections for these six counties in Pennsylvania which perform great \nservice. But because of their being surrounded by other hospitals with \nMSAs, metropolitan statistical areas giving greater reimbursement, they \ncannot compete with nurses and other medical personnel.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Points for Conference Committee on Wage Index--Bernard C. Rudegehir, \n                    Greater Hazleton Health Alliance\n\n       With competing institutions located within a 30- to 60-\n     minute drive from our front doors--and able to pay up to $4 \n     per hour more to attract staff--GHHA has experienced an \n     outmigration of clinical staff to those areas.\n       In the last 18 months, 52 employees--including registered \n     nurses, licensed practical nurses, pharmacists, radiology \n     technologists and physical therapists--have resigned. More \n     than half of them cited the opportunity to earn higher wages \n     at other hospitals as the reason for their departure.\n       And though our staff is mobile and may be willing to \n     commute up to an hour for a more lucrative position, our \n     patient base is not.\n       Nearly three-quarters of our inpatient population are \n     Medicare recipients. It is often difficult for them to find \n     reliable transportation to out-of-town healthcare facilities.\n       As of July 1st, our malpractice insurance increased nearly \n     50 percent. Staff continues to find opportunities elsewhere, \n     driven by higher wages and attractive sign-on bonuses. We \n     have been forced to adjust salaries to stay competitive. That \n     has had a significant impact on our bottom line--a $3.2 \n     million loss in fiscal year 2000.\n       In this new age of domestic security awareness, our \n     hospitals have become even more important fixtures in our \n     communities. In the event of a tragedy or terrorist event (a \n     nuclear power plant is located just miles away), our \n     communities would look to our hospitals, not only as sources \n     of emergency medical care, but as places of refuge, \n     information and comfort.\n       Our elderly patients are the ones who need us most. Many of \n     them toiled in the local coal mines and served our country in \n     foreign wars. Their strong work ethic and love of country has \n     often led to illness and injury that will plague them for the \n     rest of their lives. This is a proud population that we are \n     committed to caring for far into the future.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Geisinger Health System,\n\n                                   Wilkes Barre, PA, July 8, 2002.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Scranton, PA.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you very much for your \n     continued work on the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) \n     Amendment Issue. This is a most important topic for the \n     future well-being of hospitals in Northeastern Pennsylvania, \n     including Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center.\n       There are a number of ways in which Geisinger Wyoming \n     Valley Medical Center is currently disadvantaged due to our \n     region's rural designation for Medicare reimbursement.\n       Our area is losing a tremendous amount of health care \n     professional talent to neighboring areas with urban \n     classifications and higher wage and salary structures. RNs R \n     Us advertised in the Wilkes-Barre last week specifically to \n     transport nurses to both the Allentown and Philadelphia \n     areas. Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center recently lost \n     one registered nurse to the Philadelphia area and two \n     registered nurses to Sacred Heart Hospital in Bethlehem for \n     better wages.\n       Despite our intensive recruitment efforts over the past 6-\n     12 months, it is obvious that we cannot recruit nurses from \n     the Allentown/Bethlehem area due to the higher wages offered \n     in that area.\n       Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center and other local \n     hospitals have lost numerous nurses over the years to \n     Philadelphia hospitals--where the nurses work two, 16 hours\n\n[[Page S6349]]\n\n     weekend shifts, receive full time wages and full time \n     benefits.\n       Geisinger Wyoming Valley experienced a 47% increase in \n     insurance costs from the previous year ($1.8 to $2.7 \n     million).\n       Uncompensated Care for fiscal year 2002 (annualized May) at \n     Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center is approximately $2.4 \n     million. This includes charity care, bad debt and community \n     services.\n       Reclassification of the MSA would result in an \n     approximately $2 million Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical \n     Center. Such an improvement to our bottom line would allow us \n     to further invest in providing excellent health care for the \n     people of Northeastern Pennsylvania. Once again, thank you \n     for your efforts on our behalf.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Conrad W. Schintz,\n     Senior Vice President/Operations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Community Medical Center\n\n\n                                            Healthcare System,\n\n                                       Scranton, PA, July 3, 2002.\n     Re Wage Index (Medicare), Scranton/Wilkes Barre/Hazleton MSA, \n         Financial Condition of Hospitals.\n\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I want to thank you for your \n     commitment expressed July 1, 2002 and your efforts on behalf \n     of the hospitals in the Scranton/Wilkes Barre/Hazleton MSA \n     relative to rectifying the Medicare Wage Index issue. As \n     requested, and knowing of your active interest and efforts in \n     attempting to find solutions to restoring the financial \n     viability to the hospitals of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I am \n     writing to you on the issue and request your continued \n     assistance and support. The events of September 11 and \n     bioterrorism threat have reinforced the need to ensure that \n     the healthcare delivery system's infrastructure of \n     Northeastern Pennsylvania, by virtue of its location to \n     multiple major metropolitan areas, remains intact.\n       Nationally, operating margins of hospitals continue to \n     exceed that of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The Voluntary \n     Hospital Association's (VHA) HBS International benchmarking \n     system is reporting a 3.7% operating return nationally and a \n     2.6% Mid-Atlantic Region for 2001. Pennsylvania continues to \n     be viewed negatively on Wall Street, thus placing access to \n     capital in jeopardy. Moody's short term forecast cites risk \n     and uncertainty arising from the sector.\n       Healthcare providers here in Northeastern Pennsylvania have \n     not received adequate, fair reimbursement under the Medicare \n     Program. Our facilities have been and continue to be \n     penalized for managing the costs of delivering healthcare in \n     light of this. The May 2002 release from the Pennsylvania \n     Health Care Cost Containment Council's Annual Report on the \n     Financial Health of Pennsylvania's Hospitals regarding the \n     Fiscal Year 2001 financial performance confirms this. \n     According to the report, Pennsylvania's average operating \n     margin is 2.1%. Region 6 facilities, which include \n     Northeastern Pennsylvania and the majority of Scranton/Wilkes \n     Barre/Hazleton MSA hospitals, collectively produced an \n     average negative 1.51% operating margin, the worst in the \n     Commonwealth.\n       As requested, I am providing you some specific information \n     relative to Community Medical Center, Scranton, PA, and my \n     concerns despite CMC's ability to continue to provide access \n     to vital services to our community as of this date. CMC \n     provides many tertiary and secondary services including being \n     the Regional Trauma Center, and Cardiac Surgery, \n     Neurosurgery, Neonatal Intensive Care Program, etc. CMC \n     incurred a $3.1 Million operating loss during Fiscal Year \n     2001 and will be posting another year of operating losses \n     this year. CMC's Net Patient Service Revenue Per Adjusted \n     Discharge, when compared against similar facilities, is \n     approximately $1,200 per adjusted discharge less. (Note: \n     CMC's annual adjusted discharges approximates 20,000.) With \n     respect to Medicare reimbursement above, CMC receives \n     significantly less than others providing the same services in \n     surrounding MSAs. The need to retain our talent critical to \n     these highly specialized services cannot be underestimated.\n       Medicare--Base Rate: CMC's current Medicare Base Rate is \n     $3,708; July 1, 1984's Medicare Base Rate was $3,421.\n       Net increase over 18 years to CMC: $287; 8.4% change over \n     18 years.\n       Re: Not kept pace with inflation, wage increases, \n     technology etc. A comparison of all MSA's Base Rates (today \n     vs 1984) would demonstrate Northeastern Pennsylvania's \n     dilemma. In the material attached, you will find a graphical \n     representation of CMC's Medicare Base Rate vs the Market \n     Basket Increase. A lot has happened in healthcare since 1984.\n       In addition, the uncertainty surrounding the further \n     regulations (HIPAA) effects of the new Outpatient Prospective \n     Payment System and proposed less than Market Basket increases \n     for FY 2003 make this initiative critical for NEPA.\n       I am disappointed to learn that without this ``area \n     adjustment'', based on the Preliminary regulations (Federal \n     Resister Vol. 67, No. 90) and despite the collective efforts \n     of the fiscal intermediary, and the hospitals in the \n     Scranton/Wilkes Barre/Hazleton MSA, our Medicare Regional \n     Wage Index, a critical variable in calculating Medicare \n     reimbursements to provides in projected to not exceed the \n     rural wage index for all of Pennsylvania (.8525).\n       The issues facing Northeastern Pennsylvania hospitals \n     include:\n       Immediate financial pressures on ``core operations'', \n     medical malpractice crisis. CMC's medical malpractice \n     increase alone on the primary layer went from $512K to $1.2 \n     Million on 9/1/01 and our carrier has exited writing medical \n     professional liability insurance in our Commonwealth. In \n     addition, number of our physicians (OB) have retired or left \n     the state to practice elsewhere (e.g., Neurosurgery) as a \n     result of the increases. We are concerned with what we face I \n     just over 2 months (anticipate > 100% increase) in addition \n     to the continued exportation of talent.\n       Labor/Wage pressures as a result of shortages, retention \n     needs, and an industry need to attract talent. CMC's exit \n     interviews with employees indicate greater opportunities \n     outside the MSA. For example, a significant number of \n     vacancies exist at CMC. Currently CMC has 67 openings (45 \n     FTEs). CMC's RN vacancy rate is 18%. Recruitment activity \n     from outside the MSA is commonplace. CMC has seen a 15% RN \n     turnover rate.\n       Dramatic reductions (greater than 2x anticipated) in \n     Medicare reimbursement along the delivery continum as a \n     result of the Balance Budget Act (``BBA'') of 1997 with a \n     partial return of the excess reduction retrieved through the \n     Balanced Budget Refinement Act and BIPA.\n       Managed Care (``cost'') pressures on operating margins \n     through a variety of techniques including the domination of \n     few payers, utilization management, and further reimbursement \n     pressures.\n       Soaring pharmaceutical expenditures and new technological \n     introductions at a rate far in advance of appropriate \n     reimbursement recognition with little supply side pricing \n     constraints.\n       An increase in uncompensated care being provided by our \n     hospitals, in particular our Trauma Center. In addition, \n     access to services such as CMC's trauma services, given the \n     malpractice crisis, for our community is threatened. CMC has \n     incurred in excess of $5 Million in uncompensated care year-\n     to-date.\n       Employer Health Insurance premium cost are increasing in \n     the double digit ranges (Financing Side of the System) with \n     limited or no relief to hospitals (Delivery System) as \n     providers of care for such cost exigency.\n       The financial market's performance that its effect on \n     earnings and cash reserves of the organization directly \n     limiting our ability to plan for and reinvest in facilities, \n     etc.\n       In closing, thank you for the opportunity to express my \n     concerns for our delivery system and allowing the expression \n     of the desire that a fair, adequate return be provided to \n     hospitals, specifically here in Northeastern Pennsylvania, \n     which have served the residents of Northeastern Pennsylvania \n     with quality, cost effective healthcare. The economic impact \n     of the healthcare system on Northeastern Pennsylvania is \n     significant.\n       As you have seen day in and day out, our healthcare \n     delivery system in Northeastern Pennsylvania is undergoing \n     rapid change and challenges. As such, time is of the essence \n     within this marketplace. I look forward to your support and \n     successful outcome in the Conference Committee. Feel free to \n     contact me should you require further information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               C. Richard Hartman,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Moses Taylor\n\n\n                                            Healthcare System,\n\n                                                     July 8, 2002.\n\n\n                                  memo\n\n     ReMSA Amendment\n\n     Senator Arlen Specter.\n       Several important factors highlight why the thirteen \n     hospitals located in the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Hazleton-MSA \n     need relief. Reports produced by the Pennsylvania Health Care \n     Cost Containment Council (PCH4) and the American Hospital \n     Association indicate that all of the hospitals are very \n     efficient and effective healthcare institutions. Despite that \n     fact this region has suffered losses substantially above both \n     the state and national level.\n       The Financial Analysis of all Pennsylvania Hospitals is a \n     report produced by PHC4. The most recent report shows that \n     while thirty (30) percent of all hospitals in Pennsylvania \n     had negative total margins for the three year period between \n     1999-2001, nine (9) of the thirteen (13) hospitals located in \n     this MSA have had negative total margins.\n       Every hospital in the MSA has had a negative operating \n     margin over that period. These losses are causing a \n     significant reduction in the capital base of the institutions \n     in this MSA. An MSA where over 45% of the Net Patient \n     Revenues are provided by Medicare patients.\n       In the AHA Hospital Statistics guide from 2001, the \n     efficiency of the Hospitals in this MSA is apparent.\n       In terms of the total labor expense per adjusted inpatient \n     day, the MSA is 25% below the national average and 22% below \n     the state average. (MSA--$826.92, United States--$1,102.61, \n     Pennsylavania--$1,052.53).\n       In terms of total full time equivalent personnel compared \n     to volume the MSA also compares favorably. The MSA utilizes \n     15% less FTE's than the nation and 12% less than the state. \n     (MSA--4.01 fte's per adjusted occupied bed, United States \n     4.61, Pennsylvania 4.52).\n\n[[Page S6350]]\n\n       This MSA has very efficient, very effective hospitals (see \n     the Hospital Performance report published by PHC4) that are \n     losing significant amounts of money while serving the \n     Medicare population.\n       In addition to losing significant amounts of capital, the \n     MSA like the nation is undergoing a nursing shortage. Every \n     institution in the MSA has a number of open nursing \n     positions, especially RN's. The situation is exacerbated by \n     the fact that most if not all of the adjacent MSA's advertise \n     locally for nurses. Ads appear on a regular basis from \n     Allentown, Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Monroe County each \n     extolling the fact that they can offer higher wages. This has \n     forced the local hospitals to use agency nurses at \n     considerable expense.\n       As I am sure, you are aware CMS recognizes that there are \n     issues with the data used for the wage index. For one example \n     most if not all hospitals in our MSA, employ their own \n     dietary and housekeeping personnel and provide benefits to \n     these positions. This decision actually hurts our wage index \n     number as many other areas of the country now contract for \n     those services. Quoting from the Federal Register of May 9th \n     page 31433, ``Therefore, excluding the costs and hours of \n     these services if they are provided under contract, while \n     including them if the services are provided directly by the \n     Hospital, creates an incentive for hospitals to contract for \n     these services in order to increase their hourly wage for \n     wage index purposes.'' I do not believe that the Congress \n     intended the wage index to drive low hourly rate employees \n     off hospital payrolls.\n       There are other examples including the amount and type of \n     administrative personnel that affect the wage index. 'We \n     believe that several of the proposed alterations to the data \n     collection process for the wage index will help to address \n     some of those concerns. However, our MSA cannot wait for \n     these measures to take effect, the wage index currently lags \n     3 to 4 years behind the current data. Any substantive change \n     will take at least 5 to 7 years to make an impact on the \n     payments to our MSA. We need help now.\n       Thank you for your efforts in this regard.\n                                                      William Roe,\n     Vice President of Finance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Allied Services,\n\n                                  Clarks Summit, PA, July 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Specter: The following are some information points \n     regarding the wage index and how a re-classification would \n     aid Allied Services:\n       As northeastern Pennsylvania's largest rehabilitation \n     medicine provider, Allied experiences a high volume of \n     patients covered under Medicare. This, coupled with a low \n     wage index rate, impacts Allied's ability to recruit and \n     retain healthcare workers. Re-classification to the Newburg, \n     NY, MSA would provide over $6 million in additional funds \n     while re-classification to Allentown adds over $3 million for \n     use in employee recruitment/retention programs.\n       Pocono and Allentown area hospitals are recruiting NEPA \n     workers by offering more generous wage and benefit packages. \n     This is being promoted through ads in local newspapers, on \n     radio stations and on billboards. This impacts our workers as \n     recruitment for healthcare workers is extremely difficult. \n     This problem is further exacerbated when competing providers \n     recruit away workers thanks to their higher wage rate \n     reimbursements.\n       Despite staff shortages, the need to provide services \n     continues to be high. This is particularly so given the large \n     elderly population in northeastern Pennsylvania. A wage rate \n     re-classification is a fair way to ``level the playing \n     field'' for healthcare providers.\n       In 2001, Allied Services provided $2,751,610 in charity \n     care/uncompensated care/and governmental subsidy. Services \n     are provided without regard to patients' abilities to pay. \n     This impacts Allied's financial health.\n       Hopefully, this helps outline some important points \n     regarding the wage index issue. All of us here thank you for \n     your work on this issue and stand ready to assist in helping \n     you achieve a successful conclusion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William J. Schoen,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Mercy Health Partners,\n\n                                       Scranton, PA, July 3, 2002.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I want to thank you and Congressman \n     Sherwood for meeting with the representatives of all the \n     hospitals in Northeastern Pennsylvania on June 1, 2002. Your \n     continual efforts in seeking a resolution to our Medicare \n     wage index problem, and in particular your support of \n     Congressman Sherwood's amendment to the 2002 Supplemental \n     Appropriations Bill, is critical for the survival of our \n     hospitals.\n       The Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazelton MSA is surrounded by \n     facilities with significantly higher Medicare reimbursement. \n     Our hospitals have struggled for many years now with an \n     unfair Medicare reimbursement rate. We at Mercy have \n     continued to lose health professionals to other regions \n     around us. On a weekly basis our local newspapers carry \n     employment ads recruiting these individuals from our \n     facilities as well as local colleges and universities outside \n     our area. An example of these ads are attached for your \n     review. Even billboards have sprung up within our MSA such as \n     the one discussed in the November 11, 2001 Times Leader. I \n     have attached this as well to illustrate our point.\n       Our problem will further deteriorate when the proposed \n     Fiscal Year 2003 wage indexes based on our 1999 fiscal year \n     that we were published in the May 2002 Federal Register are \n     finalized in September 2002. Our MSA has once again fallen \n     below the Pennsylvania rural rate. This has occurred from \n     1999 through 2001, a period when employment expenses have \n     risen 14%.\n       This will put even greater pressure on our institutions \n     which in turn jeopardizes the quality of care that our \n     institutions provide to our communities in general and our \n     large Medicare age population in particular.\n       This reduction could not come at a worse time. Per the most \n     recent Pennsylvania Cost Containment Council Financial \n     Analysis. Our region, Region 6-Northeastern Pennsylvania, had \n     the worst operating margin of all Pennsylvania Hospitals--\n     1.51% and a total margin at -0.23%. I have attached this \n     report for your review as well.\n       These statistics are even more eye-opening when you compare \n     them to national averages. The average total margin for \n     hospitals across the country is 4.5% based on the latest \n     American Hospital Association data in conjunction with the \n     Center for Medicare Services.\n       In closing, I would like to once again emphasize the \n     importance of this legislation and its impact on the Mercy \n     Health System. Listed below is our Net Operating Income for \n     our last three fiscal years and the first five months of \n     2002.\n       FY 1999 ($1,827,000).\n       FY 2000 ($7,071,000).\n       FY 2001 ($6,001,000).\n       May 2002 ($2,582,000).\n       These net operating losses couples with competition in \n     recruitment from surrounding areas make it imperative that \n     this legislation be passed.\n       Thank you again. I hope this information will be helpful as \n     you work on our behalf.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James E. May,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n         Wyoming Valley, Health Care System, Wilkes-Barre General \n           Hospital,\n                                   Wilkes-Barre, PA, July 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of Wyoming Valley Health \n     Care System, Its Board of Directors, and the entire Wilkes-\n     Barre/Scranton community, we would like to thank you for the \n     efforts that you, Representative Sherwood, and your \n     respective staffs have committed to addressing the disparity \n     caused by the Medicare wage index.\n       While you certainly have developed an appreciation for the \n     challenges facing the hospitals in our region, we would like \n     to share with you the following points that we believe are \n     relevant to our situation:\n       WVHCS-Hospital (comprised of Wilkes-Barre General Hospital \n     and Nesbitt memorial Hospital), the largest provider in both \n     the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Metropolitan Statistical Area and \n     the Northeastern Pennsylvania region (Region 6) as defined by \n     the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (HC \n     4), has suffered operating deficits in each of the \n     fiscal years since the year ended June 30, 1998. The smallest \n     operating deficit was $5,542,000 in 1998, and the operating \n     loss for the year just ended is expected to exceed \n     $10,000,000.\n       In the face of adversity, our Hospital has done everything \n     possible to manage the extent of those losses, including \n     numerous staff reductions. The total number of paid full time \n     equivalents (FTE's) for 1998 was 2,708 FTE's As of may 31, \n     2002, that figure had dropped to just over 1,809 FTE's, a \n     reduction of almost 900 FTE positions.\n       Medicare beneficiaries account for almost \\2/3\\'s of the \n     inpatient days within our Hospital. Furthermore, the Medicare \n     payment program has become the basis for several other \n     payment programs in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n     including auto insurance and workers compensation services. \n     There is no opportunity for a shortfall in Medicare payments \n     to be absorbed by other payers, which had lead to our \n     significant operating deficits.\n       Luzerne and Lackawanna counties have the highest \n     concentration of Medicare beneficiaries of all counties \n     throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with populations \n     of 200,000 residents or greater. And, the proportion of \n     Medicare beneficiaries within those counties are among the \n     highest of any major county throughout the country.\n       Based upon data presented by the HC4 for the \n     2001 fiscal year, seven of nine regions within Pennsylvania \n     enjoyed positive operating results ranging from 0.81% \n     (Northwestern Pennsylvania) to 3.75% (Lehigh Valley). Altoona \n     area hospitals experienced a slight operating deficit of \n     -0.27%. Most notable in the most recent HC4 \n     release was the fact that hospitals in Northeastern \n     Pennsylvania were faced with operating deficits averaging \n     -1.51% of revenue.\n       Of the 13 hospitals within our metropolitan statistical \n     area, the four largest providers experienced operating \n     deficits ranging between -2.56% and -4.81%. Five of the \n     remaining nine hospitals also experienced significant \n     operating deficits.\n       As the largest hospital in Luzerne County, and sponsor of a \n     very active family practice residency program, WVHCS-Hospital \n     provides a significant amount of free care. For\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\n     the year just ended, it is estimated that WVHCS-Hospital \n     provided uncompensated care valued at over $6,000,000. In \n     addition, there were almost 18,000 patient encounters within \n     our family practice residency program, the majority of which \n     were to Medical Assistance or other uninsured/underinsured \n     patients who otherwise would have ended up in emergency \n     rooms.\n       Under the current rules, Medicare applies the wage index to \n     about 71% of the average hospital's non-capital cost pool. \n     Based upon our calculations, the portion of our costs to \n     which that index should be applied is estimated to be far \n     less, approximately 58%. The result is that areas like ours, \n     where the wage index is less than 1.00, are paid less than \n     cost for a portion of their supply expenses.\n       For the 2002 fiscal year, we have experienced registered \n     nurse (RN) staffing turnover approximating 15% of our total \n     RN pool. This is driven by the fact that the average wage \n     rate which we can afford to offer for a registered nurse is \n     $20.28, well below other contiguous metropolitan statistical \n     areas. In addition, the current vacancy rate for certified \n     registered nurse anesthetists is 25%. Despite the fact we \n     operate one of the largest and most successful schools of \n     nurse anesthetists in the nation, surrounding areas are \n     paying $5 to $6/per hour more than our region.\n       Registered nurses are not the only area of need with which \n     we are faced. For example, radiology/imaging technologists \n     are earning (an average hourly rate of $14.88, again, well \n     below other nearby metropolitan statistical areas). The \n     result is that for the first half of 2002, we have \n     experienced almost 20% turnover in imaging technicians, \n     particularly in the areas of nuclear medicine, CT scanning, \n     magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and general radiology \n     services.\n       Without additional relief, we are losing staff to \n     surrounding communities!\n       In addition to these labor related pressures, we are faced \n     with other issues affecting costs including the malpractice \n     insurance crisis, bioterrorism preparedness, as well as, \n     added regulatory requirements under the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). While it is not \n     our intention to redirect wage-related reimbursements to \n     those areas, the fact remains that the amount of funds which \n     we will have available to address our staffing needs will be \n     even further limited.\n       Once again, we would like to thank you, Representative \n     Sherwood, Representative Kanjorski, Senator Santorum and each \n     of your respective staffs for all of the efforts which you \n     have put into this important cause. In particular, we would \n     like to thank you and Representative Sherwood for spending \n     time with representatives from area hospitals on Monday, July \n     1, 2002.\n       We look forward to hearing from you as to when the \n     conference committee hearings will be scheduled as we would \n     like to be present to represent our community and this \n     critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     William R.

As a \n     community hospital located in Northeast Pennsylvania, the \n     current wage index rates have contributed to three years of \n     deficit income, which has resulted in the inability to \n     recruit qualified staff. In addition, our hospital has had to \n     furlough individuals and not fill positions as vacancies \n     become available.\n       Your help in this wage index change is greatly appreciated. \n     Thank you.\n       I will be available to attend the Conference Committee \n     meeting.

We truly appreciate all your efforts on our \n     behalf to assure that Medicare Reimbursements to providers of \n     services are adequate.\n       I am summarizing a few of the issues facing us in our \n     fiscal 2003, which began on Monday, July 1, 2002, the same \n     day as your briefing.\n       We are anticipating an increase in our Medicare payment \n     rate of approximately 3% effective with the beginning of the \n     next federal fiscal year on 10-1-02. The increase is based on \n     a Market Basket increase less .55%, as I recall has been the \n     reduction factor over the last several years. Medicare is \n     saying that, inflation is running 3.55% and we'll give you a \n     3.00% increase in rates. This makes it extremely difficult to \n     keep net revenues above expenses when by definition, expenses \n     are increasing faster than revenue or rates. Capital costs \n     are included in this same methodology. Wayne Memorial is \n     currently in a planning process that may well identify the \n     need to spend capital dollars. Medicare reimbursement will \n     not change as a result of this capital project and the \n     proposed increase for fiscal 2003 will make it difficult to \n     cover additional debt service on any new debt that may be \n     required.\n       We have also recently absorbed an 80% increase in our \n     annual General and Professional liability (malpractice) \n     insurance premium that must be paid from this 3% increase \n     from Medicare. We are facing serious physician recruitment \n     issues related to the malpractice crisis here in \n     Pennsylvania, as well. The increase in our malpractice \n     premium will total over $725,000 on an annual basis. The \n     increase in Medicare payments that would result from this \n     change in MSA to Newburg, New York would mean approximately \n     $450,000 of additional Medicare reimbursement for Wayne \n     Memorial.\n       I want to thank you again for your hard work on these \n     serious issues facing healthcare providers in Pennsylvania \n     and hope that all of our efforts, together, can move us \n     toward a Medicare payment system that is more adequate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Michael J.

Mr. President, all of us are just returning from the Fourth \nof July recess. It is a grand time, I am sure, across the United \nStates. It was particularly a grand time in Wyoming. I get to go to a \nlot of parades and fairs and rodeos. It is really our only time \noutdoors to get a little bit of suntan that, unfortunately, goes from \nthe wrist to the tip of the fingers, and the neck up. But it is a grand \ntime. I want to share with my colleagues one of the adventures of this \nFourth of July recess.\n  I got to be in a place called Lovell, WY. It is in the northern part \nof Wyoming. They had a dedication of a veterans memorial center that \nfeatures a huge mural that includes pictures from all of the wars in \nwhich we have participated. The mural goes down into a rocky beach that \ncontains rocks from different wars that we have been in as well. They \nhad a dedication of this veterans memorial center.\n  The dedication was also attended by Commander Lovell, whose town is \nnow his namesake. That is the Lovell of Apollo 13 fame and ingenuity.\n  Of course, it reminded me of that time in 1957 when the United States \nrealized that we were behind in all of the scientific races. It \nchallenged many of us to improve education in the United States. I \nthink that continues today. The United States met that challenge. I \nremember when Sputnik went up I was appalled and I immediately became \none of those rocket boys, one who was anxious to learn as much about \nscience and space as possible.\n  I am pleased to say the Explorer Post that I was in launched a rocket \nwith electronic ignition the second time we did it. We also learned on \nthe first one that you have to clear that with the FAA so you don't \nshoot down airplanes. There have been a lot changes in that.\n  I got to go to this parade and dedication of the mural. It was very \npatriotic. At the beginning, as they unfurled this new flag on a huge \nnew pole, we did say the Pledge of Allegiance. There was a reaction to \nthe previous Wednesday's Ninth Circuit announcement because when the \nwords, ``under God'' were said, they were louder than the whole rest of \nthe pledge, just as an affirmation that the people of Wyoming were \nupset with the decision that had\n\n[[Page S6352]]\n\nbeen made. But it was that kind of event that makes your heart swell \nand brings tears to your eyes.\n  There was a song about heroes sung by elementary students. It \nreminded me that community, and communities across this country, are \nmade up of heroes. Heroes are just ordinary people who do extraordinary \nthings. Fortunately, in America we have a lot of those.\n  We are in a rapidly changing world. In April, I had an opportunity to \ngo over to Russia with three interpreters. We worked on an \ninternational agreement of cooperation on controlling weapons of mass \ndestruction, on export controls. That meeting was a tremendous shock \nfor me. All the time I was growing up, Russia was our enemy--the Soviet \nUnion where the people were out to get us. I was sitting across the \ntable from their equivalent of the Senate and House talking about \ncooperation.\n\n  I also had an opportunity to meet with some small businessmen while I \nwas over there. I think it was an even bigger shock for them to be \ntalking to a capitalist about free enterprise. I think we will learn a \nlot from each other as the world changes.\n  I have to tell you that the people in Russia today have a tremendous \namount of respect for us. Part of it comes from the action the United \nStates took in Afghanistan. We did in 1 month what Russia wasn't able \nto do in 7 years. That did get us some respect.\n  The rest of the world anticipates that the reason we are able to do \nthings such as that is the tremendous technology we have, the \ninventions and weapons we have developed. Some people think it is \nbecause of this capitalism, of businesses--and businesses deserve \ntremendous applause for the role they have played.\n  Since there was a parade that day and a lot of Tootsie Rolls were \nthrown out to the kids along the streets, it reminded me that Tootsie \nRolls had been a part of every war since World War II. That company has \ndonated Tootsie Rolls. It is one of those chocolates that don't melt in \nthe heat. For Afghanistan, they donated eight semis loaded with Tootsie \nRolls. But I also heard about a little event that happened in Korea. \nThey used to be able to call in the plane, and the plane would dump \nTootsie Rolls on little parachutes. But one day, they got a little \nconfused on the code word, and when a bombing run was called in on \nNorth Korea, they used Tootsie Rolls for the code word for it, and the \nNorth Koreans had Tootsie Rolls dropped on them.\n  We have businesses that participate in all kinds of ways in making \nsure our country is a better country. But what they usually miss in all \nof the discussions about why America is great doesn't have to do with \ntechnology. It doesn't have to do with capitalism. It has to do with \nthe people. As a people, we have developed over the years of our \nexistence the promotion to the rest of the world of the kind of \ngovernment that works, and that has worked better and longer than any \nother government. But it isn't the Government either. It is the people. \nWe have people who have values, enthusiasm, ideas, and community.\n  That came out on September 11. On September 11, there were a lot of \npeople around the world who were pretty sure there was a major tragedy \nwhich hit this country and that we would fall apart. Instead, what they \nsaw was America coming together. We came together with a sense of \ncommunity which they didn't expect, with patriotism that has been \nunequalled, I think, in our history, with voluntarism, and, most of \nall, faith. Those are the things that make us different from the other \ncountries. Those are the things that have made us great.\n  It is exciting to have an opportunity to participate in ceremonies, \nsuch as the Lovell Veterans Memorial Center dedication.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the speech of MG Ed Boenisch, Adjutant \nGeneral of the Wyoming Military Department, given at that dedication be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dedication--Lovell Veterans Memorial Center, June 29, 2002\n\n\n   Speech by Maj Gen Ed Boenisch, Adjutant General, Wyoming Military \n                               Department\n\n       I'm honored to be here sharing the podium with an \n     astronaut. I'm proud to be here with proud civic leaders, \n     citizens and veterans who make dreams a reality.\n       Today renews my hope and faith in the spirit of America and \n     in our great flag and the freedoms it represents. This \n     spectacular memorial is a fitting honor to the men and women \n     who sacrificed so we can be here today, free and safe.\n       Today is 29 June 2002. It's been 291 days since terrorists \n     attacked our country. Remember all the innocent civilians who \n     were killed that terrible day. It's been 265 days since we \n     began our Global War on Terrorism. Remember the 51 U.S. \n     military men and women who have died in that war. Remember \n     all those who are deployed today, fighting our War on \n     Terrorism so our country and our world can be safe for our \n     children and our grandchildren.\n       I am so encouraged when I see the spirit of Americans \n     manifested in displays of patriotism, respect and \n     remembrance, especially with a beautiful and permanent \n     display such as this Lovell Veterans Memorial Center.\n       Thank you for having such a grand and beautiful dream! \n     Thank you for your financial contributions and hard work to \n     make this a reality. Thank you for remembering!\n       May God bless you!\n       May God bless America!\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speech \nwhich Commander Lovell gave at that ceremony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Dedication of Veterans Memorial Center, July 29, 2002, Lovell, Wyoming\n\n       Ladies and Gentlemen: My son Jay and I want to thank the \n     people of Lovell for the wonderful hospitality we received \n     during our visit--and it is an honor for me to say a few \n     words in the dedication of Veterans Memorial Center honoring \n     the men and women who served in our Armed Forces.\n       In 1944, Journalist Ernie Pyle wrote these words to \n     describe the beginning of the Normandy invasion.\n       ``Darkness enveloped the whole American armada. Not a \n     pinpoint of light showed from those hundreds of ships as they \n     surged on through the night toward their destiny, carrying \n     across the ageless and indifferent sea tens of thousands of \n     young men, fighting for . . . for, well, at least each other. \n     For Americans, these words paint a picture of the fear and \n     confusion surrounding soldiers on the eve of battle. Yet, \n     they also impart the sense of determination those young men \n     must have felt. Through his words, Ernie Pyle puts us in \n     touch with our understanding of who we are and how we came to \n     be a nation.\n       Even more, these words impel us to remember the cost of \n     bringing America this far and also forces us to admit the \n     price is not yet paid in full. This is what the dedication of \n     the Veteran's Memorial symbolizes--when the people of Lovell \n     can take a clear look at both your past and your future. And \n     acknowledge the debt we owe to those men and women who--\n     because they so cherished peace--chose to live as warriors.\n       Could anything be more contradictory than the lives of our \n     servicemen? They love America, so they spend long years in \n     foreign lands or at sea far from her shores. They revere \n     freedom, so they sacrifice their own that we may be free. \n     They defend our right to live as individuals, yet yield their \n     individuality in that cause. Perhaps most paradoxically of \n     all, they value life, and so bravely ready themselves to die \n     in the service of our country.\n       For more than 220 years our military has provided a bastion \n     against our enemies. In that time, our world has changed and \n     our armed forces have changed with it, but the valor, \n     dignity, and courage of the men and women in uniform remain \n     the same. From Valley Forge to Enduring Freedom, from San \n     Juan Hill to Pearl Harbor, the fighting spirit of the \n     American Serviceman permeates the history of our nation.\n       The founders of the United States understood that the \n     military would be the rampart from which America would guard \n     its freedom. George Washington once stated, ``By keeping up \n     in Peace a well regulated and disciplined militia, we shall \n     take the fairest and best method to preserve for a long time \n     to come the happiness, dignity and Independence of our \n     country.'' The prophecy of those words has been fulfilled \n     time and again.\n       The cost of that vision has been tremendous, for the \n     periods of peace our country has enjoyed are few. The longest \n     time of complete tranquility for our armed forces was the 23 \n     years between World Wars One and Two. Since the Revolutionary \n     War, more than 42 million men and women have served in \n     America's military. More than 600,000 of those dauntless, \n     selfless warriors died in combat.\n       But why are we so seemingly willing to fight and, if need \n     be, to die? The answer to that question is as simple--and yet \n     as complex--as the soul of America itself. We fight because \n     we believe. Not that war is good, but that sometimes it is \n     necessary. Our soldiers fight and die not for the glory of \n     war, but for the prize of freedom. And, the heart of America \n     is freedom, for ourselves and all nations willing to fight \n     for it. Yes, the price is high, but freedom is a wealth no \n     debt can encumber.\n       But, what of the soldiers whose death has brought the \n     liberty of our nation? Soldiers\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\n     who did not even enjoy the status of veteran? They were all \n     different; yet share a sameness that is deeper than the \n     uniform they wore. They were black, white, man, woman, \n     Hispanic, Indian, Asian, Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, \n     Buddhist, Muslim, and a hundred other variations and \n     combinations. What is most important--regardless of race, \n     creed, color, or gender--they were American.\n       These courageous men and women, each so different in \n     heritage and background, shared the common bonds of the armed \n     forces--duty and sacrifice. All of them reached a moment in \n     their lives when race and religion, creed and color made no \n     difference. What remained was the essence of America--the \n     fighting spirit of a proud people. They are servicemen who \n     paid the price for freedom.\n       As we dedicate this memorial to the brave veterans of the \n     past, we must also look to the future. In today's world, of \n     terrorism freedom comes cloaked in uncertainty. America still \n     relies on her sons and daughters to defend her liberty. The \n     cost of independence remains high, but we are willing to pay \n     it. We do not pay it gladly, but we pay it with deep \n     reverence and thanks to those who have sacrificed their lives \n     for America. We know that in the years to come, more brave \n     soles will sacrifice their lives for America. We should \n     include them in our thoughts when we view this symbol of \n     freedom.\n       Let me conclude my remarks by reading a few excerpts from a \n     letter that exemplifies why we honor our people in uniform. \n     It was written by Sullivan Ballou, a Major in the 2nd Rhode \n     Island volunteers, to his wife Sarah a week before the battle \n     of Bull Run.\n       Dear Sarah: The indications are very strong that we shall \n     move in a few days--perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be \n     able to write again, I feel impelled to write a few lines \n     that may fall under your eye when I am no more. Our movements \n     may be of a few days' duration and full of pleasure--and it \n     may be one of some conflict and death to me. If it is \n     necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my \n     Country, I am ready.\n       I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the \n     cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or \n     falter. I know how American Civilization now leans on the \n     triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to \n     those who went before us through the blood and sufferings of \n     the Revolution. And I am willing--perfectly willing--to lay \n     down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this \n     Government, and to pay that debt.\n       Sarah my love for you is deathless, and yet my love of \n     Country comes over me like a strong wind and burns me \n     unresistably on to the battlefield.\n       The memories of the blissful moments I have enjoyed with \n     you come crowding over me, and I feel most gratified to God \n     and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And it is hard \n     for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future \n     years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved \n     together, and seen our sons grown up to honorable manhood. If \n     I do not return my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love \n     you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battle field, \n     it will whisper your name. Forgive my many faults, and the \n     many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I \n     have often been.\n       But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and \n     flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near \n     you; in the brightest days and in the darkest nights, always, \n     and if a soft breeze falls upon your cheek, it shall be my \n     breath, as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall \n     be my spirit passing by. Sarah do not mourn me dead; think I \n     am gone and wait for me, for we shall meet again.\n  Sullivan Ballou was killed a week later at the First Battle of Bull \nRun.\n  That is why I am proud to be in Lovell, today to participate in the \ndedication of the Veteran's Memorial honoring the men and women who \nserved our country.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I know it was a great day across America \nwhen we celebrated the Fourth of July. I look forward to the future \nFourth of July and the daily events when patriotism and community and \nfaith are shown in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/08/senate-section/article/S6353-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN (SELECT) BENNY G.

It is \nmy privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him \nfor the superb service he has provided the Navy, the great State of \nMississippi, and our Nation.\n  Captain Green enlisted in the Navy in September 1972. After an \ninitial tour at the Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department at \nBarbers Point, Hawaii, he attended Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL \nTraining in Coronado, California, and graduated with class 83, for \nfurther assignment to SEAL Team One. Captain Green received a Bachelor \nof Science Degree from the University of Louisville in 1980, and was \ncommissioned an Ensign in 1981. He attended flight school at Pensacola \nNaval Air Station and upon graduation was assigned to Fighter Squadron \nEleven at Naval Air Station, Oceana, VA as a Radar Intercept Officer. \nHe flew numerous combat missions over Lebanon in response to the 1983 \nterrorist bombing attack of the Marine Barracks in Beruit. In February \n1985, Captain Green returned to the Special Forces and was assigned to \nSEAL Team Four, in Little Creek, VA, as the Platoon Commander of the \nnewly formed Sixth Platoon. In his next assignment, Captain Green was a \nplank owner of SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team One Detachment Hawaii, on \nFord Island, Oahu, HI, where he served as Dry Deck Shelter Platoon \nCommander. Other operational tours in Naval Special Warfare include: \nDry Deck Shelter Department Head, SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two; \nOperations Officer, SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two; Maritime Special \nPurpose Force Commander for Central Command Amphibious Ready Group 3-\n91; Executive Officer, SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two; Naval Special \nWarfare Task Unit Commander for the Theodore Roosevelt Battle group 1-\n96; Operations Officer, Naval Special Warfare Group Two; Chief Staff \nOfficer, Naval Special Warfare Group Two; and Requirements Officer for \nNaval Special Warfare Development Group. Captain Green also completed a \njoint tour as the Counter-narcotics and Maritime Officer, Special \nOperations Command, Pacific.\n  As Commanding Officer, SBU-22, Captain Green's leadership firmly \nestablished his unit as the premier facility to train special \noperations forces in the riverine environment. His determination and \noversight hastened the construction of new state-of-the-art facilities \nthat provide for the training in the maintenance and repair of \ncombatant craft, an armory, a supply building, a swim training tank, \nand a detachment building/administrative headquarters, with plans under \ndevelopment for a land-water range, a 30-unit housing facility, and a \nmini Navy Exchange/gas station. His rapport with senior military \nleadership was essential to theater commander exposure to SBU-22 \ncapabilities in support of Special Operations Forces, SOF, throughout \nthe world. During his tenure, SBU-22 hosted two major Joint Combined \nExchange for Training, JCET, exercises, executed 13 counter-drug \nmissions in South America, and trained over 450 foreign military \npersonnel in all facets of riverine operations. His realignment of the \nCombatant Craft Training Curriculum fully addresses the requirements of \nthe Naval Special Warfare Force-21 initiative and is typical of the \nexceptional foresight Captain Green demonstrated throughout his tour as \nCommanding Officer of SBU-22. His vast Special Operations experience \nproved to be a major resource in the identification, testing and \nimplementation of the new Special Operations Craft-Riverine, SOC-R, \nthat promises to revolutionize riverine tactics and capabilities.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Captain Green has served the \nUnited States Navy and the Nation with pride and excellence. He has \nbeen an integral member of, and contributed greatly to, the best-\ntrained, best-equipped, and best-prepared naval and special operations \nforces in the history of the world. Captain Green's superb leadership, \nintegrity, and limitless energy have had a profound impact on SBU-22 \nand will continue to positively impact the United States Navy, our \nSpecial Operations Forces, and our Nation. Captain Green relinquishes \nhis command on July 12, 2002 and reports as Director, Concept \nDevelopment Directorate at Special Operations Command Joint Forces \nCommand, in Norfolk, VA where he will continue his successful career. \nOn behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Captain \nGreen ``Fair Winds and Following Seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/08/senate-section/article/S6353-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6353-S6354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COLONEL DOUGLAS JOHN WREATH OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE RESERVE.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on March 29, 2002, Douglas John Wreath \nwas promoted to the grade of Colonel in the United States Air Force \nReserve. Major General Mike Hamel, USAF, administered the military oath \nof office\n\n[[Page S6354]]\n\nto Colonel Wreath on that date in a ceremony that was held in the \nReserve Officers Association of the United States Building, in \nWashington. It is my pleasure to join those who are congratulating \nColonel Wreath on this achievement.\n  Since 1997, Colonel Wreath has been an active duty Reservist, \nassigned to the United States Air Force Office of Congressional \nAffairs. During part of this time, Colonel Wreath served as the Acting \nDirector of the United States Liaison Office in the Senate, where he \nbecame known to many Senators and members of their staffs. Colonel \nWreath is currently assigned to the United States Air Force \nHeadquarters, at The Pentagon, where he is implementing the \nrecommendations of The Commission to Assess United States National \nSecurity Space Management and Organization, as well as serving as the \nAir Staff Legislative Liaison for Space Integration issues.\n  Colonel Wreath is a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy. \nHe has also earned the degree of Master of Science in Systems \nManagement from the University of Colorado.\n  Doug Wreath began his career in the United States Air Force as a \nSpace Shuttle Navigation Analyst in 1984, leavings, as a Space \nOperations Officer in 1992, when he transferred into the Reserve. While \non active duty, Doug Wreath performed a variety of command and support \nactivities at three duty stations, and as the Personal Assistant to the \nCommander of the Air Force Space Command, he assisted in establishing \nthe operational plans and policies of the Air Force National Space \nProgram.\n  Colonel Wreath is an outstanding American who has developed an \nimpressive record of achievement through his service to our Nation. I \nam pleased to commend Colonel Wreath on his promotion and I extend my \nbest wishes to him for much continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/08/senate-section/article/S6354-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 25 in \nWashington, DC. Two minors attacked two gay men leaving a gay bar in \nDuPont Circle. Before attacking the victims, the assailants shouted \nderogatory, anti-homosexual slurs at them. Local police have arrested \none of the perpetrators.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/08/senate-section/article/S6354-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6354-S6355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHRISTEN O'DONNELL EQUESTRIAN HELMET SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Chafee, and I introduced legislation to provide greater safety \nfor children and adults who ride horses in the United States. Each year \nin our country, nearly 15 million people go horseback riding. Whether \nit be professionally or for pleasure, Americans of all ages and from \nall walks of life enjoy equestrian sports. And, while everyone \nacknowledges that horseback riding is a high-risk activity, there are \nserious safety issues related to equestrian sports that can and should \nbe addressed.\n  I first became aware of the problem of equestrian helmets when Kemi \nO'Donnell, a constituent of mine in Connecticut, called my office to \nrelate her family's tragic experience. The story she shared opened my \neyes to the danger posed by certain equestrian helmets. In 1998, Kemi's \ndaughter, Christen O'Donnell, was a young 12-year-old resident of \nDarien, Connecticut, and a 7th grader at New Canaan Country School. \nActive and sporty, Christen was a talented intermediate rider who had \nfive years of riding experience under her belt when she mounted her \nhorse on the morning of August 11. As always, Christen wore a helmet \nand was accompanied by her trainer when she began a slow walk through \nthe ring. Suddenly, without warning, the horse she was riding shook its \nhead, and Christen was thrown off onto 4 inches of sand. Even though \nher horse was only at a walk, and Christen was wearing a helmet, that \nhelmet offered her little protection, and she sustained severe head \ninjuries as a result of the fall. She was rushed to Stamford hospital \nwhere, despite efforts to save her, she died the next day. The \nmagnitude of their loss has been compounded by the thought that, had \nChristen been wearing a better constructed helmet, it is possible she \ncould have survived this accident.\n  My colleagues may be shocked to learn, as Christen's parents were, \nthat there are no government standards in existence for the \nmanufacturing of equestrian helmets. Some helmets are voluntarily \nconstructed to meet strict American Society of Testing and Materials \n(ASTM) testing requirements, but the vast majority of helmets sold in \nthe U.S. offer little or no real protection and are merely cosmetic \nhats--a form of apparel. Frequently, parents of young riders like \nChristen--and even more mature riders--do not know that they are buying \nan untested and unapproved item when they purchase a riding helmet. \nIndeed, most riders believe that when they buy a helmet at the store, \nthey are purchasing a product that meets standards designed to provide \nreal and adequate head protection. Bike helmets are built to minimum \nsafety requirements, as are motorcycle helmets.\n  Apparel helmets, like the one worn by Christen, offer little or no \nhead protection, while ASTM-approved helmets are designed to \nsignificantly reduce head injury. The difference in aesthetic design \nbetween the two is minimal, but the underlying support structures of \nthese types of helmet are substantial. ASTM-approved helmets offer a \nhigh degree of head protection, increase the survivability of \nequestrian accidents and, in my view, should be the standard for all \nequestrian helmets.\n  This lack of adequate safety standards in riding helmets is why USA \nEquestrian (USAEq), one of the largest equestrian organizations in the \ncountry, recently mandated that ASTM-approved helmets must be worn in \nall USAEq-sanctioned events. While this decision effectively eliminates \nthe danger posed by ``apparel helmets'' at these events, each day many \nmore students ride in lessons and in private shows that are not USAEq-\nsanctioned. For their safety, I believe that Congress should establish \nminimum safety standards for all equestrian helmets sold in the United \nStates, so that all riders can obtain headgear that offers actual \nprotection against head injury. This is not an unprecedented \nsuggestion. As I stated before, Congress has already acted to similarly \nensure the safety of bike helmets. The legislation that I and Senator \nChafee introduce in Christen's memory today is modeled on this \nsuccessful bike helmet law and would go a long way toward reducing the \nmortality of equestrian accidents.\n\n  The Christen O'Donnell Equestrian Helmet Safety Act would require \nthat the Consumer Product Safety Commission establish minimum \nrequirements, based on the already proven ASTM standard, for all \nequestrian helmets in the United States. Thus, there would be a uniform \nstandard for all equestrian helmets, and riders could be confident that \nthe helmet they buy offers real head protection. Let me be clear. This \nmodest legislation does not mandate that riders wear helmets. That is a \nmatter better left to individual states. But, it would take a \nsignificant step toward improving the survivability of equestrian \naccidents and would bring the United States in line with other \nindustrialized countries with sizable riding populations. Countries \nlike Australia and New Zealand have enacted similar safety legislation, \nand the European Union has set standards to make sure that helmets for \nequestrian activities meet continental standards. It is time for the \nUnited States to take similar steps.\n  This bill is supported by a wide-ranging coalition of equestrian, \nchild safety, and medical groups. This bill has received the \nendorsement of the National SAFEKIDS coalition, an organization \ndedicated to preventing accidental injury to children, and the\n\n[[Page S6355]]\n\nBrain Trauma Foundation, a leading medical group dedicated to \npreventing and treating brain injury. Additionally, USAEq has passed a \nrule in support of the concept of the bill, requiring all children to \nwear ASTM approved helmets and strongly recommending that all adults do \nso as well. Further, in the Chronicle of the Horse, the trade \npublication for the Master of Foxhounds Association, the U.S. \nEquestrian Team, the U.S. Pony Clubs, The National Riding Commission, \nthe Foxhound Club of North America, the National Beagle Club, the U.S. \nDressage Foundation, the American Vaulting Association, and North \nAmerican Riding for the Handicapped Association, and the \nIntercollegiate Horse Show Association, an article was published \nendorsing the ASTM rule. Given the wide range of organizations that \nendorse this bill, or have endorsed the ASTM rule, it is clear that \nriders, coaches, and medical professionals alike recognize the need for \na standard, tested helmet design.\n  I would like to draw my colleague's attention to some alarming \nstatistics that further demonstrate the importance and expediency of \nthis bill. Emergency rooms all across America have to deal with an \ninflux of horse-related injuries each year. Nationwide in 1999, an \nestimated 15,000 horse-related emergency department visits were made by \nyouths under 15 years old. Of these injuries, head injuries were by far \nthe most numerous and accounted for around 60 percent of equestrian-\nrelated deaths. These injuries occurred, and continue to occur, at all \nages and at all levels of riding experience. That an inadequately \nprotected fall from a horse can kill is not surprising when you examine \nthe medical statistics. A human skull can be shattered by an impact of \nless than 6.2 miles per hour, while horses can gallop at approximately \n40 miles per hour. A fall from two feet can cause permanent brain \ndamage, and a horse elevates a rider to eight feet or more above the \nground. These statistics make it evident that horseback riding is a \nhigh-risk sport. While all riders acknowledge this fact, reducing the \nrisk of serious injury while horseback riding is attainable through the \nuse of appropriate head protection. We should pass this bill, and pass \nit soon, to ensure that head protection for equestrian events is safe \nand effective.\n\n  American consumers deserve to be confident that their protective \ngear, should they choose to wear it, offers real protection. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/08/senate-section/article/S6355-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4954.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the Federal \n     Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 211\n\n       Whereas, In 1934, Federal Prison Industries (FPI) was \n     created as a wholly owned government corporation. Today, FPI \n     operates 103 factories, with over 21,000 inmate workers and \n     annual sales of more than $500 million per year. The \n     operation offers over 150 products. FPI enjoys significant \n     advantages over private manufacturers making similar products \n     because of government procurement policies, including a \n     ``mandatory source'' requirement for government agencies; and\n       Whereas, With obvious personnel and benefits advantages \n     over private sector firms, there is a clear penalty to \n     employers and workers under the current situation. Some of \n     the most respected companies in many fields suffer \n     significantly from the unfair competition from FPI; and\n       Whereas, In Michigan, the impact of current FPI policies \n     has been strongly felt by many working families. Last year, \n     Michigan lost thousands of manufacturing jobs; and\n       Whereas, Congress is presently considering a measure that \n     would bring comprehensive reforms to the operations of FPI. \n     The Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act \n     would address directly the present unfair government \n     purchasing policies. This legislation, H.R. 1577, includes \n     specific requirements that FPI would have to follow to \n     achieve fairness and promote the training of inmates. Under \n     the Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act, \n     FPI would compete for contracts in a manner that minimizes \n     unfair advantages and ensures that government agencies get \n     the best value for taxpayer dollars. The legislation also \n     includes numerous accountability measures, increased emphasis \n     on preparing inmates for a return to society, and enhanced \n     restitution for victims of crime; and\n       Whereas, A more appropriate approach to prisoner-based \n     manufacturing will not only bring fairness to the marketplace \n     and thousands of America's working families, but it also will \n     enhance the federal corrections system; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact the Federal Prison Industries \n     Competition in Contracting Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-264.

Roosevelt, by Executive \n     order of July 26, 1941, brought the Philippine Commonwealth \n     Army into the service of the United States Armed Forces of \n     the Far East under the command of Lieutenant General Douglas \n     MacArthur; and\n       Whereas, under the Executive Order of July 26, 1941, \n     Filipinos were entitled to full veterans benefits; and\n       Whereas, approximately 200,000 Filipino soldiers, driven by \n     a sense of honor and dignity, battled under the United States \n     Command after 1941 to preserve our liberty; and\n       Whereas, the vast majority of American soldiers who opposed \n     the Japanese invasion of the Philippines from December 1941, \n     through March 1942, were Filipinos, who gallantly fought down \n     the length of the Bataan peninsula, and endured unbearable \n     hardships during the siege of Corregidor; and\n       Whereas, following the surrender of Corregidor, Filipino \n     soldiers, isolated from the rest of the world with only the \n     hope that American forces might someday return, courageously \n     waged guerrilla warfare against the Japanese occupation; and\n       Whereas, Filipino soldiers fought bravely alongside \n     returning Allied forces to liberate the Philippines and \n     restore order in the war-torn islands until the official end \n     of hostilities in 1947; and\n       Whereas, there are four groups of Filipino nationals who \n     are entitled to all or some of the benefits to which United \n     States veterans are entitled;\n       (1) Filipinos who served in the regular components of the \n     United States Armed Forces;\n       (2) Regular Philippine Scouts, called ``Old Scouts'', who \n     enlisted in Filipino-manned units of the United States Army \n     prior to October 6, 1945; and prior to World War II, these \n     troops assisted in the maintenance of domestic order in the \n     Philippines and served as a combat-ready force to defend the \n     islands against foreign invasion, and during the war, they \n     participated in the defense and retaking of the islands from \n     Japanese occupation;\n       (3) Special Philippine Scouts, called ``New Scouts'', who \n     enlisted in the United States Armed Forces between October 6, \n     1945, and June 30, 1947, primarily to perform occupation duty \n     in the Pacific following World War II; and\n       (4) Members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army who on July \n     26, 1941, were called into the service of the United States \n     Armed Forces, including organized guerrilla resistance units \n     that were recognized by the United States Army;\n       Whereas, the first two groups, Filipinos who served in the \n     regular components of the United States Armed Forces and Old \n     Scouts, are considered United States veterans and are \n     generally entitled to the full range of United States \n     veterans benefits; and\n       Whereas, the other two groups, New Scouts and members of \n     the Philippine Commonwealth Army, are eligible for certain \n     veterans benefits, some of which are lower than full veterans \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, United States veterans medical benefits for the \n     four groups of Filipino veterans vary depending upon whether \n     the person resides in the United States or the Philippines; \n     and\n       Whereas, the eligibility of Old Scouts for benefits based \n     on military service in the United States Armed Forces has \n     long been established; and\n       Whereas, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs \n     operates a comprehensive program of veterans benefits in the \n     present government of the Republic of the Philippines, \n     including the operation of a federal Department of Veterans \n     Affairs office in Manila; and\n       Whereas, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs does \n     not operate a program of this type in any other country; and\n       Whereas, the program in the Philippines evolved because the \n     Philippine Islands were a United States possession during the \n     period 1898-1946, and many Filipinos have served in the \n     United States Armed Forces, and because the preindependence \n     Philippine Commonwealth Army was called into the service of \n     the United States Armed Forces during World War II (1941-\n     1945); and\n       Whereas, our nation has failed to meet the promises made to \n     those Filipino soldiers who fought as American soldiers \n     during World War II; and\n       Whereas, Congress passed legislation in 1946 limiting and \n     precluding Filipino veterans that fought in the service of \n     the United States during World War II from receiving most \n     veterans benefits that were available to them before 1946; \n     and\n       Whereas, many Filipino veterans have been unfairly treated \n     by the classification of their service as not being service \n     rendered in the United States Armed Forces for purposes of \n     benefits from the federal Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n       Whereas, other nationals who served in the United States \n     Armed Forces have been recognized and granted full rights and \n     benefits, but the Filipinos, American nationals at the time \n     of service, are still denied recognition and singled out for \n     exclusion, and this treatment is unfair and discriminatory; \n     and\n       Whereas, on October 20, 1996, President Clinton issued a \n     proclamation honoring the nearly 100,000 Filipino veterans of \n     World War II, soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, \n     who fought as a component of the United States Armed Forces \n     alongside allied forces for four long years to defend and \n     reclaim the Philippine Islands, and thousands more who joined \n     the United States Armed Forces after the war; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-First Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2002, that the \n     President and the Congress of the United States are \n     respectfully requested in the 107th Congress to take action \n     necessary to honor our country's moral obligation to provide \n     these Filipino veterans with the military benefits that they \n     deserve, including, but not limited to, holding related \n     hearings, and acting favorably on legislation pertaining to \n     granting full veterans benefits to Filipino veterans of the \n     United States Armed Forces; and be it further\n       Resolved, that certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-265. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Hawaii relative to the establishment of a sister-state \n     relationship between the State of Hawaii of the United States \n     of America and the Municipality of Tianjin in the People's \n     Republic of China; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 99\n\n       Whereas, Tianjin, a city in northeastern China, is one of \n     four municipalities under the direct control of the central \n     government of the People's Republic of China, and in 2001 had \n     a population slightly over 10,000,000; and\n       Whereas, the city is made up of 13 districts, five \n     counties, 126 villages, 93 towns, and 133 street communities; \n     and\n       Whereas, the history of Tianjin begins with the opening of \n     the Sui Dynasty's Big Canal (581-617 AD). Beginning in the \n     mid-Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), Tianjin became the nexus for \n     the transport of foodstuffs and silk between south and north \n     China. During the Ming Dynasty (1404 AD), the city figured \n     prominently as a military center. In 1860, its importance as \n     a business and communications center began to grow; and\n       Whereas, Tianjin is known as the Bright Diamond of Bohai \n     Gulf and is the gateway to China's capital of Beijing. \n     Tianjin is one of China's biggest business and industrial \n     port cities and, in north China, is the biggest port city. \n     Tianjin now ranks second in importance and size in terms of \n     industry, business, finance, and trade in the north. Its \n     industrial production and trade volume is second only to \n     Shanghai in the south; and\n       Whereas, the city's traditional industries include mining, \n     metallurgy, machine-building, chemicals, power production, \n     textiles, construction materials, paper-making, foodstuffs, \n     shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, petroleum \n     exploitation and processing, tractor production, fertilizer \n     and pesticide production, and watch, television, and camera \n     manufacturing; and\n       Whereas, in 1994, Tianjin's economic goal was to double its \n     gross national product by the year 2003. With its 1997 gross \n     national product reaching RMB 124 billion yuan (about RMB \n     8.26 yuan to US$ 1), Tianjin is poised to reach that goal. By \n     the end of 1998, 12,065 foreign-owned companies were \n     established in Tianjin that invested a total of RMB 21.017 \n     billion yuan (about US$ 2.5 billion). About RMB 9.291 billion \n     yuan (about US$ 1.1 billion) of that amount was used for \n     development of Tianjin; and\n       Whereas, in the past, business and other forms of \n     industrial enterprises were primarily state-owned throughout \n     China. However, under on-going nationwide reform, the \n     proportion of businesses that are state-owned is being \n     reduced. In Tianjin, the percentage of state-owned \n     enterprises in 1997 was 35.7 per cent versus 16.6 per cent \n     for collective ownership, and 47.7 per cent for other forms, \n     including private ownership. In the retail sector, the \n     respective proportions were 23.7 per cent, 17.3 per cent, and \n     59 per cent, respectively; and\n       Whereas, Tianjin has a broad science and technology base \n     upon which to build, for example, it is home to 161 \n     independent research institutions (117 local and 44 \n     national). Aside from its several universities and colleges, \n     Tianjin has six national-level laboratories and 27 national \n     and ministerial-level technological test centers and has \n     plans to increase its science and technology educational \n     goals; and\n       Whereas, in 1984, the State Council issued a directive to \n     establish the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area \n     (TEDA), situated some 35 miles from Tianjin. Recently, some \n     3,140 foreign-invested companies have located to TEDA with a \n     total investment of over US$ 11 billion; and\n       Whereas, at present, TEDA has developed four pillar \n     industries: electronics and communications, automobile \n     manufacturing and mechanization, food and beverages, and bio-\n     pharmacy, and is promoting four new industries: information \n     software, bioengineering, new energies, and environmental \n     protection; and\n\n[[Page S6357]]\n\n       Whereas, in 1996, TEDA began offering a technology \n     incubator to help small and medium-sized enterprises with \n     funding, tax breaks, personnel, etc. Within the TEDA high-\n     tech park, Tianjin offers preferential treatment in the form \n     of funding, land fees, taxes, and facilities (such as water, \n     gas, and hearing). Residential and other services, \n     shopping, and educational and recreation facilities are \n     either already in place or are being planned; and\n       Whereas, for the eleven months ending November 2001, total \n     exports from TEDA was US$ 3.53 billion, of which foreign-\n     funded enterprises accounted for US$ 3.49 billion while total \n     foreign investment in TEDA amounted to US$ 2.3 billion; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii has been, since its early days, the \n     destination of many Chinese immigrants who have helped to \n     develop the State and its economy; and\n       Whereas, compared to the rest of the country, Hawaii is \n     advantageously situated in the Pacific to better establish \n     and maintain cultural, educational, and economic \n     relationships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, \n     especially the People's Republic of China; and\n       Whereas, the new century we have embarked upon has been \n     described by some as the ``century of Asia'' or the ``China's \n     century''; and\n       Whereas, like Tianjin, Hawaii is also striving to diversify \n     its economy by expanding into environmentally clean high-\n     technology industries including medical services and \n     research; and\n       Whereas, the State also emphasizes the importance of higher \n     education in order to create a solid foundation and workforce \n     to serve as the basis from which to launch initiatives in \n     high-technology development; and\n       Whereas, both Hawaii and Tianjin share many common goals \n     and values as both work towards achieving their economic and \n     educational objectives in the new century, and the people of \n     the State of Hawaii desire to form a mutually beneficial \n     relationship between the State of Hawaii and the municipality \n     of Tianjin to share our knowledge and experiences in order to \n     better assist each other in reaching our goals; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-First Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2002, That Governor \n     Benjamin Cayetano, of the State of Hawaii, or his designee, \n     be authorized and is requested to take all necessary actions \n     to establish a sister-state affiliation with the municipality \n     of Tianjin of the People's Republic of China; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Governor or his designee is requested to \n     keep the Senate of the State of Hawaii fully informed of the \n     process in establishing the relationship, and involved in its \n     formalization to the extent practicable; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the municipality of Tianjin be afforded the \n     privileges and honors that Hawaii extends to its sister-\n     states and provinces; and be it further\n       Resolved, That if by June 30, 2007, the sister-state \n     affiliation with the municipality of Tianjin of the People's \n     Republic of China has not reached a sustainable basis by \n     providing mutual economic benefits through local community \n     support, the sister-state affiliation shall be withdrawn; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     Governor of the State of Hawaii, the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, Hawaii's congressional delegation, and the \n     President of the People's Republic of China and the Mayor of \n     the municipality of Tianjin through the Los Angeles Consulate \n     General of the People's Republic of China.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-266.

A Senate concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to the \n     acquisition by the United States National Park Service of \n     Kahuku Ranch for expansion of the Hawaii Volcanoes National \n     Park and of Ki'ilae Village for expansion of Pu'uhonua O \n     Honaunau National Historical Park; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 36\n\n       Whereas, the Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island \n     consists of 217,000 acres and is one of only two national \n     parks in this State; and\n       Whereas, the Volcanoes National Park attracts about \n     1,500,000 visitors each year who enjoy the natural beauty of \n     the lava fields, native forests, and ocean cliffs; and\n       Whereas, a large parcel of land lying to the south and west \n     of the Volcanoes National Park known as Kahuku Range \n     consisting of 117,000 acres has come up for sale; and\n       Whereas, the Kahuku Ranch parcel contains outstanding \n     geological, biological, cultural, scenic, and recreational \n     value, and is the sole habitat for at least four threatened \n     and endangered bird species endemic to Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service since 1945 has \n     recognized that the property contained nationally significant \n     resources and in fact, in its 175 Master Plan, the National \n     Park Service identified the property as a ``potential \n     addition to improve the geological, ecological, and scenic \n     integrity of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park''; and\n       Whereas, the 181-acre Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National \n     Historical Park was established in 1961 to save a sacred lace \n     of refuge that for centuries offered sanctuary to any who \n     reached its walls; and\n       Whereas, adjacent to Pu'uhonua O Honaunau are the remains \n     of Ki'ilae, an ancient Hawaiian settlement dating back to the \n     late 12th or early 13th centuries, and which remained active \n     until about 1930, making it one of the last traditional \n     Hawaiian villages to be abandoned; and\n       Whereas, significant portions of this ancient Hawaiian \n     village remain outside of national park boundaries; and\n       Whereas, including these lands within the boundaries of \n     Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park has been a goal \n     of park management for more than three decades; and\n       Whereas, the park's 1972 Master Plan identified Ki'ilae \n     Village as a proposed boundary extension and in 1992, a \n     Boundary Expansion Study completed for the park called for \n     adding the ``balance of Ki`ilae Village''; and\n       Whereas, within the Ki`ilae lands the National Park Service \n     is seeking to acquire, more than 800 archaeological sites, \n     structures, and features have been identified, including at \n     least twenty-five caves and ten heaiu, more than twenty \n     platforms, twenty-six enclosures, over forty burial features, \n     residential compounds, a holua slide, canoe landing sites, a \n     water well, numerous walls, and a wide range of agricultural \n     features; and\n       Whereas, in June 2001; Senator Inouye and Senator Akaka \n     introduced a bill to authorize the addition of the Ki`ilae \n     Village lands to Pu`uhonua O Honaunau National Historical \n     Park and in October 2001, this bill passed the United States \n     Senate and it is anticipated that the authorization bill will \n     pass the House of Representatives as well; and\n       Whereas, these acquisitions offer an opportunity rarely \n     imagined because they would give the National Park Service an \n     excellent chance to expand and protect native plants and \n     archaeological sites from destruction; and\n       Whereas, these opportunities can benefit current and future \n     generations of residents and tourists, because expansion of \n     Volcanoes National Park and Pu`uhonua O Honaunau National \n     Historical Park will preserve more open space, add to the \n     natural environment, protect affected native species, and \n     preserve cultural and historical sites; and\n       Whereas, in January 2001, the National Park Service held a \n     series of public meetings to receive comments from the public \n     regarding possible purchase of Kahuku Ranch and Ki`ilae \n     Village, and the nearly 400 people in attendance at the \n     meetings expressed overwhelming support and endorsement; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Twenty-First Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2002, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the Legislature supports the \n     acquisition by the United states National Park Service of \n     Kahuku Ranch for expansion of the Hawaii Volcanoes National \n     Park and of Ki`ilae Village for expansion of Pu`uhonua O \n     Honaunau National Historical Park;

A Senate concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to urging \n     adequate financial impact assistance to providing services to \n     citizens of the freely associated states who reside in the \n     State of Hawaii; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 127\n\n       Whereas, the Compact of Free Association is an agreement \n     established in 1986 between the United States and the \n     Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands, and in 1994 with the Republic of Palau; and\n       Whereas, under the Compact, the United States provides \n     direct economic assistance, federal services, and military \n     protection to these nations, in exchange for defense rights; \n     and\n       Whereas, the U.S. State Department should consider the \n     impact of Freely Associated States citizens on Hawaii during \n     this year's renegotiation of the compacts; and\n       Whereas, citizens of these Freely Associated States (FAS) \n     are also allowed to freely enter the United States without a \n     visa or other immigration requirements; and\n       Whereas, drawn by the promise of better medical care and a \n     better education for their children, over 6,000 Freely \n     Associated States citizens have migrated to and are currently \n     residing in Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, the Compact's enabling legislation authorizes \n     federal compensation for impact costs incurred by United \n     States areas, including Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, the 1996 federal welfare reform act cut off access \n     to federal welfare and medical programs forcing citizens of \n     these Freely Associated States to rely on state aid; and\n       Whereas, the cost of supporting FAS citizens, largely in \n     healthcare and education, was $86 million between 1996 and \n     2000; and\n       Whereas, FAS students have higher costs than other students \n     due to poor language and other skills; and\n       Whereas, due to FAS students entering and leaving school a \n     few times each year their integration into the school system \n     difficult; and\n       Whereas, since the Compact went into effect in 1986 until \n     2001, the State spent over $64 million to educate FAS \n     citizens and their children in our public schools, $10 \n     million in 2000 alone; and\n       Whereas, FAS citizens continue to have a fast-growing \n     impact on our public school system; and\n       Whereas, last year, the number of FAS students in our \n     primary and secondary public schools increased by 28%, \n     resulting in costs to the State of over $13 million for the \n     academic year, bringing the total cost since 1988 to about \n     $78 million; and\n       Whereas, during the academic school year 2001-2002, the \n     University of Hawaii lost over $1.2 million in tuition \n     revenue as a result of students from the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the \n     Republic of Palau paying resident rather than non-resident \n     tuition; and\n       Whereas, inadequate and delayed federal compensation to \n     Hawaii's education system will be at a cost to our own \n     children, and contributes to Hawaii being substantially below \n     many other states in per pupil expenditures for its public \n     school children in kindergarten through 12th grade; and\n       Whereas, state Medicaid payments for FAS citizens from 1998 \n     to 2001 totaled $12.4 million; and\n       Whereas, the financial stability and viability of private \n     hospitals and medical providers is threatened by staggering \n     debts and write-offs resulting from medical services to FAS \n     citizens, in spite of state Medicaid reimbursements; and\n       Whereas, the Queen's Medical Center alone has incurred \n     operating losses of $16 million between 1995 and 1999, and is \n     owed over $11 million by Compact of FAS nations; and\n       Whereas, community health centers estimate an annual cost \n     of $420,000 for services to FAS residents; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Health has also been \n     significantly impacted by the cost of public health services \n     to FAS immigrants with $967,000 spent on screening \n     vaccination and treatment of communicable diseases and \n     $190,000 spent for immunization and outreach by public health \n     nurses; and\n       Whereas, FAS citizens may face unfair criticism and refusal \n     of medical services from medical providers; and\n       Whereas, inadequate and delayed federal compensation \n     threaten to overwhelm Hawaii's health care systems, leading \n     to potential cutbacks in services and personnel that would \n     impact all of Hawaii's citizens; and\n       Whereas, it is imperative that Hawaii be granted immediate \n     and substantial federal assistance to meet these mounting \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, Guam has been asking for--and receiving--financial \n     impact assistance for the last ten years; and\n       Whereas, the fact that Micronesians should qualify for \n     federal benefits, while residing in Hawaii and the rest of \n     the United States, can best be summed up by the resolution \n     which was passed on September 9, 2001, in Washington, D.C., \n     by a national group called Grassroots Organizing for Welfare \n     Leadership supporting the insertion of language in all \n     federal welfare, food, and housing legislation because \n     Micronesians are eligible for these and other benefits as \n     ``qualified non-immigrants'' residing in the United States; \n     and\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\n       Whereas, the United States government is not owning up to \n     its responsibility for what the United States did to the \n     Micronesian people by refusing them food stamps and other \n     federal benefits when they came to Hawaii and the rest of \n     United States seeking help; and\n       Whereas, the excuse being used by the U.S. government to \n     deny any aid to the Micronesians in the U.S. is the word \n     ``nonimmigrant'' used in the Compact of Free Association to \n     describe Micronesians who move to Hawaii and the U.S.; and\n       Whereas, on Dec. 7, 1993, then President Bill Clinton \n     formed an Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments \n     which documented human radiation experiments; and\n       Whereas, based on some of these documents, researchers \n     indicate that all of Micronesia was affected, not just the \n     Marshall Islands; and\n       Whereas, it is the intent of this Resolution to encourage \n     the responsible entities to implement the provisions of the \n     Compact of Freely Associated States, which authorizes compact \n     impact funds to be made available to states that welcome and \n     provide services to the people of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of \n     Palau, because most of the FAS citizens that come to Hawaii \n     do so for medical problems related the United States' \n     military testing of nuclear bombs; and\n       Whereas, Micronesians are recruited to serve in the U.S. \n     military and ``aliens'' are not similarly recruited into the \n     U.S. military; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Twenty-First Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2002, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the Bush Administration and \n     the U.S. Congress are requested to appropriate adequate \n     financial impact assistance for health, education, and other \n     social services for Hawaii's Freely Associated States \n     citizens; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Bush Administration and the U.S. \n     Congress are requested to insert language in all federal \n     welfare, food, and housing legislation which says that \n     Micronesians are eligible for federal food stamps, welfare, \n     public housing, and other federal benefits as ``qualified \n     nonimmigrants'' residing in the United States; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Bush Administration and the U.S. \n     Congress are requested to restore FAS citizens' eligibility \n     for federal public benefits, such as Medicaid, Medicare, and \n     food stamps; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Hawaii's congressional delegates are \n     requested to assure financial reimbursements, through the \n     establishment of a trust, escrow, or set-aside account, to \n     the State of Hawaii for educational, medical, and social \n     services and to Hawaii's private medical providers who have \n     provided services to Freely Associated States citizens; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, United States State Department, President of the \n     United States Senate, Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation, Governor, Attorney General, Superintendent of \n     Education, Director of Health, Director of Agriculture, \n     Director of Human Services, Grassroots Organizing for Welfare \n     Leadership, Micronesians United, United Church of Christ, \n     Hawaii Conference of Churches, United Methodist Church of \n     Honolulu, national negotiating teams of the Compact of Free \n     Association, and Presidents and Hawaii Consulates of the \n     Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands, and Republic of Palau.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-269. A Senate resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii relative to supporting the acquisition by \n     the United States National Park Service of Kahuku Ranch for \n     expansion of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and of \n     Ki'ilae Village for expansion of Pu'uhonua O Honaunau \n     National Historical Park; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution, No. 16\n\n       Whereas, the Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island \n     consists of 217,000 acres and is one of only two national \n     parks in this State; and\n       Whereas, the Volcanoes National Park attracts about \n     1,500,000 visitors each year who enjoy the natural beauty of \n     the lava fields, native forests and ocean cliffs; and\n       Whereas, a large parcel of land lying to the south and west \n     of the Volcanoes National Park known as Kahuku Ranch \n     consisting of 117,000 acres has come up for sale; and\n       Whereas, the Kahuku Ranch parcel contains outstanding \n     geological, biological, cultural, scenic, and recreational \n     value, and is the sole habitat for at least four threatened \n     and endangered bird species endemic to Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service since 1945 has \n     recognized that the property contained nationally significant \n     resources and in fact, in its 1975 Master Plan, the National \n     Park Service identified the property as a ``potential \n     addition to improve the geological, ecological, and scenic \n     integrity of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park''; and\n       Whereas, the 181-acre Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National \n     Historical Park was established in 1961 to save a sacred \n     place of refuge that for centuries offered sanctuary to any \n     who reached its walls; and\n       Whereas, adjacent to Pu'uhonua O Honaunau are the remains \n     of Ki'ilae, an ancient Hawaiian settlement dating back to the \n     late 12th or early 13th centuries, and which remained active \n     until about 1930, making it one of the last traditional \n     Hawaiian villages to be abandoned; and\n       Whereas, significant portions of this ancient Hawaiian \n     village remain outside of national park boundaries; and\n       Whereas, including these lands within the boundaries of \n     Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park has been a goal \n     of park management for more than three decades; and\n       Whereas, the park's 1972 Master Plan identified Ki'ilae \n     Village as a proposed boundary extension and in 1992, a \n     Boundary Expansion Study completed for the park called for \n     adding the ``balance of Ki'ilae Village''; and\n       Whereas, within the Ki'ilae lands the National Park Service \n     is seeking to acquire, more than 800 archeological sites, \n     structures, and features have been identified, including at \n     least twenty-five caves and ten heaiu, more than twenty \n     platforms, twenty-six enclosures, over forty burial features, \n     residential compounds, a holua slide, canoe landing sites, a \n     water well, numerous walls, and a wide range of agricultural \n     features; and\n       Whereas, in June 2001, Senator Inouye and Senator Akaka \n     introduced a bill to authorize the addition of the Ki'ilae \n     Village lands to Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical \n     Park and in October 2001, this bill passed the United States \n     Senate and it is anticipated that the authorization bill will \n     pass the House of Representatives as well; and\n       Whereas, these acquisitions offer an opportunity rarely \n     imagined because they would give the National Park Service an \n     excellent change to expand and protect native plants and \n     archaeological sites from destruction; and\n       Whereas, these opportunities can benefit current and future \n     generations of residents and tourists, because expansion of \n     Volcanoes National Park and Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National \n     Historical Park will preserve more open space, add to the \n     natural environment, protect affected native species, and \n     preserve cultural and historical sites; and\n       Whereas, in January 2001, the National Park Service held a \n     series of public meetings to receive comments from the public \n     regarding possible purchase of Kahuku ranch and Ki'ilae \n     Village, and the nearly 400 people in attendance at the \n     meetings expressed overwhelming support and endorsement;

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Alaska relative to the construction and operation of \n     the Alaska Highway Natural Gas Pipeline route; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Legislative Resolve No. 50\n\n       Whereas the Alaska North Slope (ANS) has the largest known, \n     discovered natural gas resources, estimated to be 35 trillion \n     cubic feet, in the United States and estimated, undiscovered \n     gas resources in excess of 100 trillion cubic feet; and\n       Whereas demand for natural gas in the lower 48 states is \n     expected to experience record growth, rising from \n     approximately 22 trillion feet a year in 2000 to 30-35 \n     trillion cubic feet a year in 2020, with some experts \n     predicting demand to be as large as 50 trillion cubic feet a \n     year in 2020; and\n       Whereas the lower 48 states have an inadequate resource \n     base to meet this expected demand, and experts expect that \n     more natural gas will have to be imported from Canada and \n     from other countries in the form of liquefied natural gas \n     (LNG); and\n       Whereas the near record drilling in the last two years in \n     the lower 48 failed to provide any significant gas supply \n     increase and many experts are questioning whether other \n     United States frontier areas like the deepwater Gulf of \n     Mexico will be able to deliver material new gas supplies and, \n     therefore, more imports may be required than previously \n     thought; and\n       Whereas it is important for the United States to have a \n     reliable and affordable source of domestic natural gas for \n     its citizens and businesses, and for national security, \n     especially given the recent tragic events; and\n       Whereas energy supply disruptions have significant negative \n     effect on the United States economy, including the losses of \n     tens of millions of United States jobs; and\n       Whereas, if the United States imports significant amounts \n     of LNG, it can be subjected to the market power of the \n     exporting country through mechanisms such as embargoes and \n     price making; and\n       Whereas ANS is one of the few known locations in the United \n     States that can supply significant natural gas supplies to \n     the lower 48 for years to come; and\n       Whereas, given these supply and demand projections, several \n     companies and entities have studied different pipeline \n     routes, including a ``northern'' route, running off the\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\n     shore of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the Beaufort \n     Sea to the Mackenzie Delta and south through Canada to the \n     lower 48; a ``southern'' route along the Alaska Highway \n     through Canada to the lower 48; and an ``LNG'' route adjacent \n     to the Trans Alaska Pipeline System pipeline to Valdez and \n     LNG tankers for delivery to California; and\n       Whereas, in 1976, Congress passed the Alaska Natural Gas \n     Transportation Act of 1976 (ANGTA) authorizing the President \n     to select a route to transport natural gas from ANS to the \n     lower 48 and providing procedures to expedite the \n     construction and operation of the selected route; and\n       Whereas, in 1977, following lengthy public hearings and \n     negotiations with Canada, the President issued a decision \n     (``President's Decision'') choosing the southern route and \n     selecting the predecessor of a consortium of pipeline \n     companies headed by Foothills Pipe Lines, Ltd. (Pipeline \n     Companies'') to construct and operate the Alaska segment of \n     the project; and\n       Whereas the Alaska Gas Producers Pipeline Team \n     (``Producers'') has proposed new federal enabling legislation \n     that is currently being debated in the United States Senate; \n     and\n       Whereas the Majority Leader of the United States Senate has \n     introduced the Energy Policy Act of 2002, which contains the \n     Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 2002 (``Pipeline \n     Act''); and\n       Whereas the Pipeline Act is not opposed by the Pipeline \n     Companies, and they desire certain amendments to the ANGTA to \n     modernize it; and\n       Whereas ANGTA granted the State of Alaska ``authoriz[ation] \n     to ship its royalty gas on the approved transportation system \n     for use within Alaska and . . . to withdraw such gas from the \n     interstate market for use within Alaska,'' which rights will \n     be impaired if a northern route is followed; and\n       Whereas President Carter's decision in support of the \n     southern route explicitly recognized that it could ``supply \n     the energy base required for long-term economic development'' \n     within Alaska and it could supply natural gas to communities \n     within Alaska along the route as well as other Alaska \n     communities through local distribution lines, and these \n     potential benefits will be lost if a northern route is \n     followed; and\n       Whereas the United States Senate has concurred with the \n     United States House of Representatives to oppose the northern \n     route and has expressed its support for the southern route; \n     and\n       Whereas the southern route presents the United States with \n     petrochemical extraction opportunities in the United States \n     while the northern route does not; and\n       Whereas a northern route pipeline could not easily be \n     expanded to increase the volume of gas when needed; and\n       Whereas the southern route provides petrochemical \n     extraction opportunities in the United States and other \n     marketing opportunities for ANS gas, including gas to liquids \n     (GTL) and LNG, to the West Coast or Asia; and\n       Whereas it is widely recognized that maximum benefit to \n     Alaskans from the commercialization of ANS natural gas lies \n     in market exposure for that gas, opportunities for in-state \n     use of the natural gas, and for participation by Alaskans in \n     construction, maintenance, and operation of the gas pipeline \n     transportation project, and the recovery of revenue by the \n     state from the development, transport, and sale of ANS gas \n     reserves; and\n       Whereas the Alaska State Legislature has expressed a \n     preference for the expedited construction and operation of a \n     natural gas pipeline along a southern route and has \n     authorized funds to conduct various studies regarding a \n     natural gas pipeline, including the study of in-state natural \n     gas demand, natural gas supply, a natural gas fiscal system, \n     and the effect of natural gas sales on the Prudhoe Bay \n     reservoir; and\n       Whereas the Twenty-Second Alaska State Legislature \n     established the Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipeline \n     (``Joint Committee'') to take whatever action may be \n     appropriate to ensure that the best interests of the state \n     are protected; and\n       Whereas it is vital for the continued exploration and \n     development of natural gas resources on the ANS that oil and \n     gas companies that do not have an ownership interest in the \n     pipeline (``Explorers'') have access to it on fair and \n     reasonable terms and have the ability to seek expansion of \n     the pipeline when economically and technically feasible; and \n     the Joint Committee adopted recommendations supporting \n     enactment of these provisions in federal law; and\n       Whereas it is vital for the economic development of Alaska \n     that Alaskans and Alaska businesses have access to gas from \n     the pipeline on a fair and reasonable basis, and that the \n     Regulatory Commission of Alaska participate with the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission to develop methods to provide \n     for such access; and the Joint Committee adopted \n     recommendations supporting enactment of these provisions in \n     federal law; and\n       Whereas the Joint Committee has issued various \n     recommendations requesting that Congress reaffirm the \n     validity of ANGTA and modernize it; and\n       Whereas natural gas prices in the lower 48 states \n     periodically fluctuate below those required to adequately \n     cover investment; and\n       Whereas governmental involvement, including tax incentives, \n     is essential and quite common on major projects to enable \n     private enterprises to undertake the risks; be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature strongly urges \n     the President of the United States, the United States \n     Congress, and appropriate federal officials to actively \n     support the expeditious construction and operation of a \n     natural gas pipeline through Alaska along a southern route;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to Cuba; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the Members of the One Hundred and \n     Twentieth Legislature of the State of Maine now assembled in \n     the Second Regular Session, most respectfully present and \n     petition the Congress of the United States as follows:\n       Whereas, the relationship between the United States and \n     Cuba has long been marked by tension and confrontation, and \n     further heightening this hostility is the 40-year-old United \n     States trade embargo against the island nation that remains \n     the longest-standing embargo in modern history; and\n       Whereas, there has been significant change in relations \n     between Cuba and the United States since 1962, when the \n     prohibitive trade sanctions were imposed; and\n       Whereas, the export ban was imposed during a period of much \n     fear caused by the threat of nuclear attack due to the Cold \n     War between the former Soviet Union and other communist \n     regimes and the United States; and\n       Whereas, that threat no longer exists and it is no longer \n     United States policy to prohibit trade with a communist \n     country, as we already have heavy trade with China and are \n     establishing trade with countries like Vietnam; and\n       Whereas, with complete normalization of trade relations, \n     Cuba could become a $1 billion market for United States \n     agricultural producers within 5 years, making it our 3rd \n     largest market in the Americas after Mexico and Canada; and\n       Whereas, agriculture in Maine has developed into a diverse \n     industry and could greatly benefit from the market \n     opportunities that free trade with Cuba would provide. Maine \n     is the largest producer of brown eggs and wild blueberries in \n     the world and ranks 8th in the nation in the production of \n     potatoes and 2nd in the production of maple syrup. It ranks \n     2nd in New England in milk and livestock production; and\n       Whereas, rather than depriving Cuba of agricultural \n     products, the United States trade embargo succeeds only in \n     driving Cuba's purchasers to competitors in other countries \n     that have no trade restrictions; and\n       Whereas, the United States has much to gain by trading with \n     Cuba, not only in agriculture but also in many other sectors \n     of the economy and culture; and\n       Whereas, the Cuban people also have much to gain and are \n     more likely to move toward liberty as they see our way of \n     life and the success of our free market system: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, urge the Congress of \n     the United States to lift trade sanctions and establish \n     permanent, normal trade relations with Cuba; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W.

RUSSIAN TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, in addition \n     to rogue states, are known to be working to acquire weapons \n     of mass destruction, and particularly nuclear warheads.\n       (2) The largest and least secure potential source of \n     nuclear warheads for terrorists or rogue states is Russia's \n     arsenal of nonstrategic or ``tactical'' nuclear warheads, \n     which according to unclassified estimates numbers from 7,000 \n     to 12,000 warheads. Security at Russian nuclear weapon \n     storage sites is insufficient, and tactical nuclear warheads \n     are more vulnerable to terrorist or rogue state acquisition \n     due to their smaller size, greater portability, and greater \n     numbers compared to Russian strategic nuclear weapons.\n       (3) Russia's tactical nuclear warheads were not covered by \n     the START treaties or the recent Moscow Treaty. Russia is not \n     legally bound to reduce its tactical nuclear stockpile and \n     the United States has no inspection rights regarding Russia's \n     tactical nuclear arsenal.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--(1) One of the most likely \n     nuclear weapon attack scenarios against the United States \n     would involve detonation of a stolen Russian tactical nuclear \n     warhead smuggled into the country.\n       (2) It is a top national security priority of the United \n     States to accelerate efforts to account for, secure, and \n     reduce Russia's stockpile of tactical nuclear warheads and \n     associated fissile material.\n       (3) This imminent threat warrants a special \n     nonproliferation initiative.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after enactment of this \n     Act, the President shall report to Congress on efforts to \n     reduce the particular threats associated with Russia's \n     tactical nuclear arsenal and the outlines of a special \n     initiative related to reducing the threat from Russia's \n     tactical nuclear stockpile.\n\n                       Subtitle B--Other Matters\n\n     SEC. 1211.
