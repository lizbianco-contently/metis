Bless them with sacred wisdom \nthat they may truly lead us through the complex issues that confront \nour people. Give them the courage to hold to what they believe to be \nright, and the humility to receive more truth than they possess.\n  Most of all, O God, we ask that You will give these leaders Your own \ngreat dreams for our life together, dreams that are greater than party \nallegiances, and certainly greater than the ambition any individual \nwould carry into this Chamber. By Your Holy Spirit accommodate Your \nwill to our political process that it may be used to lead this Nation \nto a future which is filled with hope.\n  And when the day is done and the Chamber is again empty, may all who \nhave come here to serve the Republic know that their work has not been \nin vain. Encourage them in the certain conviction that You will use \nthis day to build Your own great kingdom on Earth. This we ask in the \nname of the Lord, whose way we prepare.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nreturn to the consideration of the Cantwell amendment which is the \nmatter that was pending when we started this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3234\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my \nelectricity consumer protection amendment to improve what I believe is \na flawed deregulation provision in the underlying energy bill.\n  It is not widely known that the electricity title of this bill \nincludes a new provision to further deregulate our energy markets. \nIndeed, many of these provisions were included, I believe, without \nadequate consideration and review by this body.\n  For the first time this bill gives the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission the statutory authority to allow market-based rates, a key \ncomponent of deregulation. It also lowers the standard by which mergers \nof utilities can take place, and it repeals a current law that has been \nthe cornerstone of consumer protection.\n  Given the sweeping changes in this bill, I think it is important that \nwe proceed cautiously on this path, and that we put safeguards in \nplace, which my amendment does, to protect consumers as FERC is given \nthis new responsibility.\n  After last year's energy crisis, we should be asking ourselves, how \ndo we better protect consumers, not how do we loosen the rules for \nutility companies so that they can have better controls in the \nmarketplace.\n  My amendment is written to protect consumers basically across the \ncountry from the same mishaps that happened in the western markets that \nhave caused consumers in the West so much harm. After all we learned \nfrom the energy crisis and the collapse of Enron, it is plain that we \nneed to move forward and set a clear set of rules to ensure that, in \nderegulated markets, consumers are protected. The fact is that \nconsumers deserve efficient electricity markets with adequate \nprotections and efficient oversight.\n  As the bill now stands, we are giving the Enrons of the world more \npower to manipulate markets. In fact, without this consumer protection \namendment this bill sends some of those people the opportunity, I \nbelieve, to actually end up overcharging consumers.\n  These are commonsense ideas and that is why this amendment has gained \nsupport from a wide range of consumer, industry, local government and \nenvironmental groups. They are united behind the idea that consumers \nshould be protected as this bill moves towards deregulation.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Dayton, Wellstone, Feingold, \nBoxer,\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\nWyden, Murray, and Stabenow in this effort.\n  Groups ranging from AARP to the American Public Power Association, to \nthe Consumers Union and the Sierra Club, to the U.S. Conference of \nMayors stand behind the consumer protection measures in this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a full list of the organizations which \nsupport this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Support the Consumer Protection Package\n\n       Amendment No. 3097, offered by Senators Dayton, Wellstone, \n     Feingold, Cantwell, Boxer and Wyden, would add crucial \n     consumer protections to the electricity title of the Senate \n     energy bill, incorporating lessons learned from the Western \n     electricity crisis and Enron's collapse.\n       Air Conditioning Contractors of America.\n       American Association of Retired Persons.\n       American Public Power Association.\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n       Consumers for Fair Competition.\n       Consumers Union.\n       Electricity Consumers Resource Council.\n       National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates.\n       National Environmental Trust.\n       National League of Cities.\n       National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association.\n       Natural Resources Defense Council.\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n       Public Citizen.\n       Sierra Club.\n       Transmission Access Policy Study Group.\n       U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n       Union of Concerned Scientists.\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n       Vote ``yes'' on the Consumer Protection Package.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, their voice is loud and clear. After \nlast year's energy crisis, it is unacceptable to launch a new round of \nderegulation without first putting in place adequate consumer \nprotections.\n  I would like to read from a letter signed by the Consumers Union, \nSierra Club, NRDC, Consumer Federation of America, and others. It \nreads:\n\n       This amendment would add important and much-needed \n     protections to legislation that actually repeals already weak \n     consumer protections in current law. S. 517 repeals most of \n     the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA), including \n     provisions that have been in place for over six decades, and \n     does almost nothing to ensure that consumer protections will \n     be maintained. Now, with the exposure of Enron's questionable \n     trading deals, we need these protections more than ever to \n     prevent energy companies from manipulating prices and supply. \n     We need to strengthen consumer protections, not weaken them.\n\n  Consumers for Fair Competition wrote:\n\n       In the wake of the West Coast electricity crisis and Enron \n     collapse, Congress should only pass electricity legislation \n     if it takes needed steps to protect consumers and prevent a \n     repetition of these crises.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport that I have received from these organizations.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 15, 2002.\n\n Defend Electricity Consumers' Rights--Support the Consumer Protection \n                      Package: S.A. 3097 to S. 517\n\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you to support S.A. \n     3097, the consumer protection amendment to the Senate energy \n     bill (S. 517), offered by Senators Dayton, Wellstone, \n     Feingold, Cantwell, Boxer, and Wyden. This amendment would \n     add important and much-needed protections to legislation that \n     actually repeals already weak consumer protections in current \n     law. S. 517 repeals most of the Public Utility Holding \n     Company Act (PUHCA), including provisions that have been in \n     place for over six decades, and does almost nothing to ensure \n     that consumer protections will be maintained. Now, with the \n     exposure of Enron's questionable trading deals, we need these \n     protections more than ever to prevent energy companies from \n     manipulating prices and supply. We need to strengthen \n     consumer protections, not weaken them.\n       This consumer protection package would:\n       Ensure that mergers in the energy sector ``advance the \n     public interest,'' based on objective criteria that would be \n     evaluated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). \n     In repealing the higher merger standards of PUHCA, S. 517 \n     would simply require a determination for a merger approval \n     that the merger is ``consistent with the public interest.'' \n     Given the wave of mergers sweeping through the electric \n     industry and the collapse of meaningful competition in \n     California and other states, we believe that a more \n     protective standard is necessary to adequately protect \n     consumers from abuse. FERC must hold the public interest \n     paramount in evaluating any potential energy company mergers. \n     The amendment would: establish criteria for FERC to consider \n     in order to determine that a merger would ``advance the \n     public interest,'' including efficiency gains, impact on \n     competition, and its ability to effectively regulate the \n     industry; clarify that these provisions would apply to all \n     potential financial arrangements (not just stock \n     acquisitions) which could lead to exertion of control over \n     the entity, including partnerships; and clarify that FERC \n     review applies to all electric and gas combinations.\n       Direct FERC to precisely define a competitive market and \n     establish rules for when market-based rates will be \n     permitted. In addition, it would put in place market \n     monitoring procedures so that FERC can better detect problems \n     before they lead to a complete breakdown in the market, and \n     give FERC more authority to take action to protect consumers \n     when the market is failing. This change is necessary to \n     ensure that electricity suppliers do not continue to \n     manipulate the market to the detriment of consumers, as they \n     did in the western electricity market in 2000-2001.\n       Require that transactions between utilities and their \n     affiliates be transparent, and it would shield consumers from \n     the costs and risks of these transactions. It provides for \n     FERC review of utility diversification efforts so that \n     consumers are not victims of abusive affiliate transactions.\n       Require that state and federal regulators have enhanced \n     access to books and records. It would require FERC, in \n     consultation with state commissions, to conduct triennial \n     audits of the books and records of holding companies. \n     Regulators could initiate proceedings based upon their \n     reviews and violations could be corrected earlier, minimizing \n     the damage done to consumers. Since holding companies would \n     be responsible for paying the cost of the audits, regulators \n     would have adequate resources to do their job. Enhanced \n     access to books and records is critical to avoid further \n     Enron-like collapses.\n       Help ensure fair and functional markets, increasing the \n     likelihood that energy companies will invest in new, \n     innovative, and clean technologies such as solar and wind \n     power.\n       Consumers have been grossly and unacceptably short-changed \n     in the Senate energy bill. S.A. 3097 will begin to rectify \n     the problems this bill creates for consumers. Federal energy \n     legislation should increase, not decrease, consumers' \n     economic and energy security. Please adopt this basic \n     consumer protection package to address these serious consumer \n     concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n       Adam J.

As it now stands, the electricity portion (Title II) \n     of this bill fails to adequately address issues of market \n     power and abusive affiliate transactions.\n       NAFC is also concerned about lack of opportunity to \n     thoroughly explore the implications and consequences of Title \n     II through the full committee process. Had the committee \n     process not been circumvented, there would have been ample \n     opportunity to craft language to protect consumers and \n     preserve true competition. Regrettably, Title II of S. 517 \n     increases the potential for abuses in these areas--by, among \n     other things, repealing the Public Utility Holding Company \n     Act (PUHCA)--without providing needed offsetting protections.\n       Senators Cantwell, Wellstone, Dayton, Feingold and Boxer \n     will offer a package of provisions to protect electricity \n     consumers and ensure fair and effective oversight of \n     electricity markets. The package will:\n       Require that proposed utility mergers promote the public \n     interest in order to be approved;\n       Establish clear rules--and enforcement--for when market \n     rates can be charged to prevent a repeat of soaring \n     electricity rates when markets are not truly competitive;\n       Protect consumers from assuming the cost and risks of \n     utility diversifications into non-utility businesses;\n       Prevent utilities from subsidizing affiliate ventures and \n     competing unfairly with independent businesses;\n       Provide effective review of utility books and records.\n       Amendment #3097, the Dayton-Wellstone-Feingold amendment, \n     and the second degree\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\n     offered by Sen. Cantwell and others would add crucial \n     protections to the electricity title of the Senate energy \n     bill, incorporating lessons learned from the Western \n     electricity crisis and Enron's collapse.\n       We urge you to support these amendments when they are \n     offered.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Tony Ponticelli,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Washington Public Utility\n\n\n                                        Districts Association,\n\n                                      Seattle, WA, April 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: On behalf of the Washington Public \n     Utility Districts Association (WPUDA), I would like to \n     express our strong support for the amendment you are \n     cosponsoring, the Consumer Protection Package (#3097). This \n     amendment adds crucial consumer protections to the \n     electricity title of the Senate energy bill, incorporating \n     lessons learned from the Western electricity crisis and \n     Enron's collapse.\n       As you correctly stated on the Senate floor on April 10th, \n     the electricity title in S. 517 is of primary significance to \n     the citizens of Washington, and the Northwest region--we have \n     already suffered huge rate increases and cannot bear the \n     consequences of another ``failed experiment.'' Because the \n     underlying bill repeals the Public Utility Holding Company \n     Act (PUHCA) without including adequate consumer protections, \n     your package of amendments is essential to ensure that the \n     consumer is not overlooked and adversely affected. For \n     example, your amendment requires clear, upfront rules on \n     market-based rates. In doing so, it reduces the instances in \n     which corrective actions will be needed by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC).\n       Once again, WPUDA thanks you for your leadership and \n     supports this critical amendment that seeks to protect the \n     public interest.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Steve Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, my constituents and the constituents of \nmy colleagues from the West, particularly California, Oregon, and \nIdaho, have seen first hand the devastation caused by the Western \nenergy crisis: wholesales rate spikes of more than 1,000 percent; \naluminum workers put of out of work because electricity costs were too \nhigh for their companies to operate; and an economic slump in \nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington directly related to last year's high \nenergy prices.\n  In my home state of Washington we are still paying the price for the \nlack of consumer protections during the energy crisis. Ratepayers in my \nhome of Edmonds, WA are paying almost 60 percent more than they did \nbefore the crisis, with no relief in sight.\n  Nowhere do consumers know the importance of proper safeguards more \nacutely than in the West. In the wake of what happened there, why would \nwe even consider reducing consumer protections and lowering legal \nstandards? Why would we promote further deregulation and at the same \ntime abandon consumer protections?\n  Ask anyone from California whether they want more deregulation \nwithout consumer protection. They will all tell you the same answer: \nAfter Enron and the western energy crisis we should strengthen consumer \nprotection laws, not weaken them. They know that without adequate \nconsumer protections, electricity markets may not work to protect \nconsumers.\n  One need look no further than a February 2001 poll in which \nCalifornia residents were asked if they supported the legislature's \ndecision to deregulate the electricity market. By nearly 40 percent, \nCalifornians opposed the deregulation plan.\n  There are many other public opinion polls across this country that \nshow consumers are very concerned about any move toward more \nderegulation without sufficient consumer protection. A July 2001 survey \nby the Mellman Group revealed that North Carolinians opposed \nderegulation by a 14 percent margin and by a 40 percent margin thought \nthat deregulation would cause rate increases. In March of this year, a \ndifferent Mellman survey showed that 60 percent of Montanans thought \nthat deregulation had caused higher electricity rates.\n  The public voice is clear.\n  I think it is important to review how we got to this point, beginning \nwith the first major piece of legislation to protect ratepayers, passed \nduring the first term of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Presidency.\n  In the 1920s our system of utility regulation began to fail \nconsumers. Complex corporate structures made it impossible to offer \nadequate consumers protections. By 1932, 45 percent of all electricity \nwas controlled by three groups. Because of their market power and \ncomplex and misleading corporate structure, the utilities owned by \nthese holding companies were able to charge excessive rates, which were \npassed directly to consumers.\n  In response to this situation, this body passed into law the Public \nUtilities Act of 1935 to help bring the system under control and offer \nconsumers adequate safeguards. The two key titles of the Public \nUtilities Act--PUHCA and the Federal Power Act--put in place important \nconsumer protection regulations. PUHCA required utilities to either \nlargely operate within a single state, or be subject to strict federal \nregulation by the SEC. The Federal Power Act created a consumer \nprotection framework for the transmission of electricity in interstate \ncommerce and wholesale rates for electricity.\n  Today, we are faced with an energy bill that repeals key consumer \nprotections from these pieces of legislation.\n  Albeit, I know the chairman of our committee wants those laws to be \nmore effective, and to be more effective under FERC, while I agree \nthere can be authorities new at FERC, I want to make sure that, while \nwe change from the SEC to FERC, we don't repeal the legal standards or \nthe framework for consumer protection.\n  Just think about the energy crises of the past. In the 1920s, when \ncorporate structures got out of control and retail consumers suffered \nthe consequences, we responded with the Public Utilities Act. During \nthe 1970s energy crisis, we responded with the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act.\n  But today we are faced with the prospect of responding to the Western \nenergy crisis of 2001 with more of the same that helped cause the \ncrisis in the first place. I believe the Western energy crisis was \nreally precipitated by two factors: obviously, California adopted a \nrestructuring plan without adequate thought and deliberation, and the \nfact that FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, signed off on \nit. That is right, they signed off on the California plan. Then FERC \nallowed generators in the West to charge market-based rates without \nfirst ensuring that those markets were sufficient in their competition \nand that they were adequately monitoring those markets over time.\n  The definition of insanity is watching something fail and then doing \nit again. And that is what we are headed towards doing. It would be \ninsane for us to enact further flawed deregulation without at least \naddressing the importance of providing consumer protections.\n  Consumers know that they are ultimately the ones who will get stuck \nholding the check. And they are right. It is wrong policy to deregulate \nwithout protecting consumers. And ultimately, it hurts them where it \nhurts most: in their pocketbooks.\n  This amendment addresses the need for consumer protection from \nderegulation by creating safeguards from potential market failures and \nabuses.\n  The amendment would prevent a repeat of soaring electricity rates in \nderegulated markets by directing FERC to establish rules and \nenforcement procedures for market monitoring to protect electricity \nconsumers.\n  The market rate provisions of this amendment are actually quite \nsimple in concept.\n  As I said earlier, for the first time in this legislation, the \nunderlying authority is given to FERC instead of to the SEC. While \ngiving this new power to FERC, we need to make sure consumers are \nprotected by making sure they do not lower the standard.\n  I believe it is critical that within this legislation we not lower \nthe legal standard by which these mergers were held in the past. FERC \ncan have new responsibility, but we must make sure we are not lowering \nthe legal standard by which we allow these companies to merge. FERC \nneeds statutory guidance on just what factors it should consider before \nit allows market-based rates to be charged. That is, before FERC opens \nup the energy market, it should have to ensure that those markets are \ngoing to operate efficiently and not gouge consumers.\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\n  The bill currently does not adequately offer consumer protection, \nespecially in view of the House of Representatives' electricity bill, \nwhich I think goes too far in giving a wish list to the big energy \ncompanies. The electricity provisions of this bill right now actually \nlower the overall merger standard.\n  This amendment would maintain current law with regard to that merger \nstandard. It is a very important point--that current law be the \nstandard for FERC.\n  In fact, there have been something like 30 major utility mergers and \nacquisitions over the past few years alone. That is a testament to the \nneed for laws to protect consumers from consolidation which is \nhappening in the utility sector.\n  It is also a powerful reminder that current law is in no way too \nprescriptive. Maintaining the legal merger standard currently on the \nbooks--I think it is important to do this--is a critical part of the \namendment.\n  The electricity provisions in this bill also fall short, in my view, \non the issue of insulating consumers from the economically devastating \neffects of the energy markets which have gone horribly awry.\n  The primary difference between the Senate energy bill as it is \ncurrently written and what we are trying to accomplish with this \namendment is simple. It is the difference between preventing \ndysfunctional markets from happening in the first place, and post hoc \ninvestigations that are unlikely to provide better relief for consumers \nharmed by skyrocketing energy prices.\n  What I mean by that is, without these specific requirements in place, \nand new mergers and market-based rates happening, and without the \noversight, it is very hard, once consumers are gouged, to then come \nback and ask for records and information that show what kind of \nprotections should have been on the books.\n  I do not think many of my colleagues realize that, for the very first \ntime, this legislation, the underlying bill, gives FERC explicit \nstatutory authority to allow companies to charge market-based rates. So \nnowhere had FERC ever been given that statutory authority. They had \nalways been cost-based rates. But this legislation will, for the first \ntime, give FERC statutory authority to allow companies to charge \nmarket-based rates that they decided administratively to start allowing \nin the mid-1980s.\n  While the Energy Policy Act of 1992 affirmed the direction FERC was \nmoving in regard to opening of the Nation's transmission system, it did \nnot contain this explicit authority for FERC to grant market-based \nrates.\n  I believe this is a very important point because if we are going to \nmove forward in saying that market-based rates should be there, then we \nmust make sure those consumer protections are in place as well.\n  In sifting through the ashes of the California experiment, it is now \nobvious that FERC did not pause to consider the constraints--whether \nreal or manipulated--on natural gas transportation into the State, \nwhich, in turn, drove up the price of electrical generation. FERC \napproved a system without assessing the market power of what became \nknown as the big five energy companies in the California crisis, \nincluding Enron, and the impact they had.\n  It is also clear that FERC approved the California proposal without \nassurances that the State's independent system operator could \neffectively monitor market conditions. I have heard from numerous \nutilities involved in the California market that the ISO began \ndeclaring emergencies purely subjectively because its mechanisms for \nassessing where physical megawatts actually existed--and whether these \nshortages were real or imagined--were so incredibly flawed.\n  In addition, it has been repeatedly alleged that the ISO declared \nthese emergencies for political reasons because utilities, as such in \nthose States, were obligated to sell into the California market, first \nunder a Department of Energy order, and later under an order from FERC \nitself, when emergencies were declared. FERC did not have the market \nmonitoring practices in place that would have been the protections the \nconsumers needed.\n  So why give them more authority now to do market-based rates without \nmaking sure the legal standards are in place and making sure that \nconsumer protections are in place?\n  In summary, I want it to be clear to my colleagues that this \namendment today should do its job to prevent a flawed deregulation bill \nand to help protect consumers.\n  This legislation specifically does several things: It helps maintain \nthe competitive markets, it effectively monitors markets, it prevents \nthe abuse of market power and manipulation, and it ensures the \nmaintenance of just and reasonable rates.\n\n  The amendment would also require utility mergers to serve the public \ninterest and for utility books to be fully open. It would protect \nconsumers from absorbing the costs of utility diversifications and \nprevent them from being basically subject to the various tactics in \nwhich consumers are held to higher costs when the markets are \nconsolidated or market-based rates are charged and things can actually \ngo awry.\n  This amendment does not take away any of FERC's authority to allow \nmarket-based rates. It does not stop the move toward deregulation. In \nfact, it is consistent with the concept of deregulation. It simply says \nwe need a roadmap for consumers. We need protections for this new \nmarket-oriented approach.\n  I am reminded by something that FERC Chairman Pat Wood said on March \n11:\n\n       I'm probably the world's biggest believer in markets.\n\n  But Mr. Wood also said:\n\n       But I'm also the world's biggest believer that people will \n     take advantage of it if they don't have a cop walking down \n     the street.\n  This amendment provides the ``cop walking down the street'' for our \nelectricity markets in protecting consumers. With all that we have read \nand seen of what happened during the Western energy crisis and the role \nthat Enron and other power companies played in it, how can we even \nconsider further deregulation without putting in place real consumer \nprotections? It is practically malpractice for us to think about these \nnew deregulations without thinking about how to protect consumers.\n  That is why we are offering this amendment today. We need to say to \nthe people of this country, we are going to protect you from the crisis \nthat has happened in California and in Washington and in Oregon. And we \nare going to make sure the markets operate in a way in which consumers \nare protected.\n  This is a critical amendment and should be adopted as a part of this \nbill. We need to say to the consumers that we are thinking about their \nneeds, their protections, and the high price of electricity throughout \nthe country.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise to say that I welcome the amendment \nby Senator Cantwell and others that greatly strengthens the amendment \nthat I previously brought to the floor. I compliment the Senator from \nWashington, who has done an extraordinary amount of work on this \nmeasure, for her leadership in bringing together Senators, consumer \ngroups, and others who would be affected by this legislation.\n  I think her work has been extraordinary. I know from my own \nobservation that her work behind the scenes over the last days and \nweeks has been phenomenal. She has put countless hours into bringing \nthis coalition together, bringing these amendments together, and \nbringing them to the floor for our consideration today.\n  Again, I want the Record to show that the Senator from Washington has \nbeen extraordinary in her efforts to bring this to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak against the amendment \nthat my colleague from Washington and the Senator from Minnesota have \noffered. This is an issue on which I think we need to refresh people's \nmemory because it has been a few weeks since we had votes on this \nportion of the energy bill.\n  But let me recall for Senators and their staffs exactly with what we \nare dealing. This is the electricity title of\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\nthe energy bill. We have worked hard on that title, those of us who \nhave been involved on the issue for a long time. Senator Thomas, in \nparticular, and myself have worked hard to come up with language which \nwe believe ensures that consumers are protected and which ensures that \nmergers and acquisitions are properly reviewed before they are \npermitted to go forward or are turned down if they do not meet strict \ncriteria. We have put together language we believe is very favorable to \nconsumers.\n  Part of what we are proposing is that the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act be repealed. That is an issue that continues to be the \nsubject of controversy. I understand that. And I understand the \namendment, of course, that we are now presented with would try to \neliminate the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act and keep \nthat current law.\n  This is a legitimate issue. In the Energy Committee, in the most \nrecent hearing we had on energy-related issues, we had a hearing on \nthis issue. I am trying to get the whole list of witnesses so that I \ncan inform people about that. But we had one of the Commissioners from \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, which currently has \nauthority and responsibility to enforce the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act. The testimony of that Commissioner was very clear. Their \ntestimony was that they do not support keeping that authority at the \nSEC. They do not support keeping the Public Utility Holding Company Act \non the books. They have taken that position for the last 20 years. They \ncontinue to take that position. That was the position under the Clinton \nadministration and that was the position under the Bush administration. \nAnd there was unanimous testimony to our committee that, in fact, we \nshould shift this responsibility over to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, as we are proposing to do in this legislation.\n  Let me clarify that the problems the Senator from Washington refers \nto are very genuine problems.\n  I am sympathetic to those problems. I do think there were some \nshortcomings on the part of the Federal regulators as well as others in \nthe way the crisis on the west coast was dealt with, but I point out \nthat all of that happened under current law. All of that happened with \nPUHCA in force--with the Public Utility Holding Company Act in force--\nand we are proposing the repeal of that and a change in the authority \nso that it can be done much more effectively.\n  Our bill does nothing to deregulate electricity markets. It \nrecognizes that the market depends on competition. It gives the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission the tools to be sure that competition does \nin fact work for consumers. We have enhanced FERC's authority over \nmergers and market-based rates. We have required new disclosure rules. \nWe have required the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules to protect \nconsumers.\n  We take authority away from the SEC, as I mentioned, because the SEC \nhas never enforced this law. We take the authority away from them and \ngive it to FERC, which does understand the industry. It is the agency \nwith the appropriate expertise to actually look out for consumers in \nthis regard.\n  The bill we have brought to the Senate floor and on which Senator \nThomas and I have worked very hard requires four things before any \ndisposition or consolidation or acquisition of utility assets is \npossible.\n  It requires, first, that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \ndetermine that the proposed disposition or acquisition be consistent \nwith the public interest. That is a pretty good indication.\n  A second would be that they make a determination it will not \nadversely affect the interests of consumers of the electricity utility. \nThat again is an important safeguard.\n  Third, it requires that any acquisition, any consolidation that is \napproved by FERC be determined by FERC not to impair the ability of \nregulators to regulate the utility.\n  The final thing we have required FERC to determine is that any \nacquisition that might be approved would not lead to cross-\nsubsidization of associated companies. We believe that is also \nimportant. If in fact we are going to permit companies to purchase \nutilities, to acquire utilities, to acquire utility assets, we do not \nwant to see the ratepayers of the utility having their rates go to \ncross-subsidize other companies. We require that FERC make that \ndetermination.\n  We believe the provisions we have in the bill are not only adequate \nbut strengthening provisions. There are requirements in the amendment \nproposed here that go substantially further. There is a requirement \nthat there be a determination that the transaction enhanced competition \nin wholesale markets. We do not believe it is an appropriate role for \nus to be blocking an acquisition unless it can be proven that it \nenhances competition. We believe a ``do no harm'' standard is the right \nstandard for a regulatory agency. Clearly, that is where we come out.\n  The one other provision which is in their amendment which we believe \ngoes too far is it requires that the transaction produce significant \ngains in operational and economic efficiency. I hope very much that any \ntime there is an acquisition of a utility asset or a merger or a \nconsolidation of any kind, it does produce significant gains in \noperational and economic efficiency. That would be a wonderful thing. I \ndon't think it is reasonable to say all acquisitions, consolidations, \nand mergers should be blocked unless they can demonstrate that they \nwill in fact demonstrate or produce significant gains in operational \nand economic efficiency.\n  We believe the provisions we have in the bill are the appropriate \nones. For that reason, I will have to resist the amendment and hope \nSenators will oppose it.\n  I know Senator Thomas has worked very hard on this issue as well. I \nknow he is anxious to speak about it at some point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise to speak on the amendment now \nbefore the Senate. As the Senator from New Mexico mentioned, he and I \nand others have worked very long and hard on this electricity portion \nof the energy bill. When the Daschle-Bingaman bill was brought to the \nfloor, we went into it and tried to work at it to make it more workable \nand, indeed, more simple, to give the States more authority but \ncontinue to have the protection, of course, for consumers. So that is \nwhat we sought to do.\n  I believe this amendment is not necessary. Certainly it does not add \nto but, in fact, detracts from that goal of protecting consumers and \nmaking the system more simple.\n  It seems we have heard an awful lot about the California problem, and \nit was a difficult one. It affected the rest of the west coast States, \nof course. Senator Bingaman held two hearings to examine the California \ncollapse and the Enron collapse and its impact on the energy markets. \nThe result of these hearings was a clear consensus that Enron had \nlittle, if any, impact on wholesale or retail electric markets. So this \ncontinued effort to do something with FERC because of that simply \ndoesn't connect. I hope we can deal with it as it is in reality.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the pending amendment. The amendment \nproposes a major change in the standard FERC would use to review asset \nsales, mergers, and acquisitions. Under the proposed standard, in order \nto approve an asset sale, merger, or acquisition, FERC would have to \naffirmatively find that the action would, at a minimum, enhance \ncompetition in the wholesale markets, produce significant gains in \noperational and economic efficiency, and result in a corporate and \ncapital structure that facilitates effective regulatory oversight.\n  This proposed change in the review standard, when coupled with an \nearlier amendment adopted by the Senate, expands the type of actions \nFERC must review and puts industry restructuring into gridlock. We are \nalways talking about the overamount of regulation and so on, and we \nhave sought a balance here between States and FERC. This adds back to \nthe problem that we sought to resolve. It will take FERC forever to go \nthrough the procedural steps necessary to allow even the most mundane \nasset sale.\n  Slowing restructuring and competition would be bad for both \ncompetition and consumers. The amendment also\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\nestablishes a full new set of rules and procedures for FERC to follow \nin regulating the wholesale power market. It gives FERC sweeping \nauthority to do just about anything it wants to do--the very provisions \nthat the bipartisan Thomas amendments adopted by the Senate struck from \nthe underlying Daschle-Bingaman bill. That is what we voted on before. \nNow we are seeking to go back to what we tried to eliminate and did \neliminate.\n  The amendment also modifies the Banking Committee PUHCA repeal \nprovisions. For example, the pending amendment takes away the \nprovisions dealing with State access to utility books and records. That \nis a part of the Banking-reported bill. The amendment also imposes a \nhost of new transaction approval requirements under the guise of so-\ncalled transaction transparency. The transaction transparency \nprovisions of the amendment do not just require the disclosure of \ninformation, they require FERC preapproval of all interaffiliated \npurchases, sales, leases, or transfer of assets, goods or services, and \nfinancial transactions.\n  Talk about creating a regulatory nightmare--Federal bureaucratic \nredtape--this is it.\n  Madam President, it is not clear what problems this amendment is \nintended to address that are not already addressed by other provisions \nor existing law.\n  It cannot be aimed at curbing market power since it makes it more \ndifficult for utilities to sell assets, such as generation and \ntransmission.\n  It cannot be aimed at protecting consumers from undue price increases \nbecause, under existing law, FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale rates \nand the State public utility commissions have jurisdiction over retail \nrates.\n  With or without this amendment, the retail/wholesale electric rates \nhave been and will continue to be subject to State and Federal review. \nMoreover, this issue is already addressed in the bipartisan electricity \namendments adopted by the Senate on March 13.\n  For the benefit of the Senate, let me read some of the language from \nthe amendment adopted by the Senate.\n  Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, as amended by the bipartisan \namendment, will read:\n\n       No public utility shall, without first having secured an \n     order of the Commission authorizing it to do so . . . merge \n     or consolidate, directly or indirectly . . . by any means \n     whatsoever.\n       The Commission shall approve the proposed disposition, \n     consolidation, acquisition or control, if it finds that the \n     proposed transaction--\n       (A) will be consistent with the public interest;\n       (B) will not adversely affect the interest of consumers; \n     and\n       (C) will not impair the ability of FERC or any State \n     commission . . . to protect the interests of consumers or the \n     public.\n\n  Exactly. It is already there. Frankly, we are wasting our time with \nthis.\n  In addition, there are other consumer protection provisions already \nin the underlying bill.\n  For example, in the PUHCA title there are provisions which \nspecifically give FERC and State public utility commission access to \nbooks and records so that they can do their job to protect consumers. \nIn the PUHCA title there is a Federal task force to review the status \nof competition. In the PUHCA title there is a provision requiring a GAO \nstudy and report on competition. And in another amendment, the Senate \nhas already adopted an office of Consumer Advocacy in the Department of \nJustice.\n  Mr. President, in today's rapidly changing electric marketplace, \nutilities need to be able to buy and sell generation and other assets \nin order to be able to respond quickly to market conditions. This \namendment will tie FERC and industry restructuring up in red tape.\n  I ask: How does slowing industry restructuring and handicapping \ncompetition benefit consumers?\n  We know the answer. It doesn't.\n  Requiring utilities to wait months--possibly years--for FERC to \nreview and approve even relatively routine transactions simply does not \nmake sense. It satisfies no public purpose, and it threatens to bury an \nalready overburdened FERC staff in a blizzard of needless paper \nshuffling.\n  In sum, the proposed amendment appears to be a heavy-handed solution \nin search of a non-existent problem to solve. It is an extreme \namendment that is intended to overturn a bipartisan, Senate-adopted \namendment. It appears to be a thinly-disguised attempt to throw sand in \nthe gears of competition, not to improve the legislation.\n  The amendment should be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to proudly support the \nCantwell amendment which I am very pleased to be cosponsoring.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for all of his leadership, \noverall, on this important energy package. He has had a thankless job. \nThere has been a tremendous amount of work. While I respectfully \ndisagree with his position on this amendment, I commend him for his \nincredible leadership in this effort.\n  I am very pleased to support this amendment which would add important \nand much-needed consumer protection to the Senate energy bill. The \nSenate energy bill repeals most of what is called PUHCA. Many people \nare not aware of what that is and how important it is in terms of \nprotecting consumer prices as it relates to electricity. It is the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act. This would repeal it without \nputting in place any protections to ensure that consumers are in fact \nprotected.\n  Now, in light of what happened with Enron, what happened on the west \ncoast with the electricity crisis, we need to be strengthening consumer \nprotections, not weakening them. Last spring, when the Senate Banking \nCommittee took up PUHCA repeal, I in fact was the only member of the \ncommittee who voted against that because I believed we should not be \ndoing that independently of a larger focus to guarantee that if the \nbill were repealed--the statute--we in fact would keep the consumer \nprotections in the act which are so critical. So I voted against that \nbill.\n  I believe we should be including this in the context of a broad bill, \nsuch as the Senate energy plan, that would include consumer and \ncompetitive protections. I believe this amendment puts into place those \nimportant consumer protections and competition protections.\n  This amendment would ensure that utility company mergers ``advance \nthe public interest'' in order to be approved by FERC. That is a very \nimportant principle. FERC would assess the impact on the public \ninterest by examining such criteria as the merger's effects on \ncompetition, economic efficiency, and regulatory oversight. We need to \nensure that utility mergers promote, and not undermine, competition. \nThat is what this amendment would do.\n  This amendment would also establish clear rules and enforcement \nprocedures to prevent a repeat of soaring electricity rates in \nderegulated markets that are not really competitive. This amendment \nwould also protect consumers from unjustified rate hikes and help \nensure fair and competitive markets.\n  The amendment also would provide more transparency in the utility \nmarket to protect consumers from situations like Enron. The amendment \nwould require public disclosure of financial transactions between \nholding companies, utilities, and their affiliates, as well as FERC \npreapproval of transactions that are not publicly disclosed.\n  This has been a real issue for small businesses in Michigan. The \namendment would protect consumers from the costs and risks of utility \ndiversification and prevent utilities from unfairly subsidizing their \naffiliates that compete with small businesses, with independent \nbusinesses--those that sell the furnaces, air-conditioners, and so on. \nThis has been an important issue in Michigan where many of my small \nbusinesses have been concerned about competing against utility \ncompanies that are able to have their prices subsidized.\n  Finally, the amendment would give State and Federal regulators \nenhanced access to books and records. If we are going to move to a \ntruly competitive utility market, we need to reshape FERC's role in the \nmarket. We need to increase the market transparency and make certain \nthat consumer protections are maintained.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I believe it \nis absolutely necessary as we move into this deregulated marketplace to \nmake sure\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\nthere really is competition to lower prices, there is accountability, \ntransparency, and in fact in the end all of our consumers, the citizens \nof the country, are protected.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise in support of amendment 3234 \noffered by my colleague from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, and I am pleased \nto be a cosponsor.\n  I support and have been actively involved in the drafting of this \namendment, which includes provisions from the sponsors of amendment \n3097, Mr. Wellstone and Mr. Dayton, on mergers as well as provisions \nfrom the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  These amendments would improve on the bill by making clear the \nactions that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, must \ntake in determining that proposed mergers in the electric power sector \nadvance the public interest in order to secure Federal regulatory \napproval. Those of us who have worked on this package are deeply \nconcerned about the effects of deregulation of the electric power \nsector.\n  The underlying bill says that FERC would have to determine that \nmergers be ``consistent with'' the public interest, a more typical \nstandard used by other agencies reviewing other mergers, like the \nFederal Trade Commission.\n  My concern is that electricity is not just like other commodities. \nElectricity is essential to public well-being. When this bill is \nenacted and the Public Utility Holding Company Act is repealed, a \nstrong incentive will exist for large utilities with the financial \nresources and the potential to exercise market power to get larger. \nAlready, the electric utility industry is undergoing rapid \nconsolidation. As my colleague from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, noted \nearlier in the debate on this bill, in the last past 3 years alone, \nthere have been more than 30 major utility mergers and acquisitions, \nincluding several in my own home State and with utilities in Minnesota \nthat serve Wisconsin. Many merchant generating companies have seen \ntheir stock prices plunge and credit ratings downgraded, and these \ncompanies are now prime buy-out targets.\n  I acknowledge that utility mergers are not inherently bad and should \nnot be prevented. Such mergers can produce efficiencies, economies of \nscale and cost savings for electrical consumers. A merger can, however, \nalso reduce competition, increase costs, and frustrate effective \nregulatory oversight.\n  In Wisconsin, we have been concerned about efforts to aggressively \npush electricity deregulation, because we are served in my state by a \ndiverse number of local utilities: municipal utilities, electric \ncooperatives and investor-owned utilities. This diversity of electrical \nsuppliers, about which my colleagues from Minnesota have eloquently \nspoken, are absolutely critical parts of our small rural communities.\n  In many cases, Wisconsin's rural coops and rural municipal utilities \nare the only entities interested in serving the electrical needs of the \nrural parts of my State. If we deregulate, we shouldn't create an \nenvironment that leaves these communities behind.\n\n  Federal electricity merger review policy should distinguish between \nthose mergers that promote the public interest and protect our local \nsources of electrical power and those that don't. In proposing to amend \nthe Federal Power Act to change FERC's merger review standard we are \nseeking to require merger applicants to show that the merger, which \neliminates a competitor in a marketplace, provides affirmative benefits \nto the public that are not achievable without merger. Thus, the utility \nseeking the merger approval would need to show that the merger provides \ntangible public benefits by increasing competition or lowering prices \nthrough increased efficiency.\n  The amendment would improve on the language in the underlying energy \nbill in several ways. First, the language requires that proposed \nmergers promote the public interest in order to secure Federal \nregulatory approval. Second, the amendment spells out specific \nstandards for assessing the impact on the public interest, including \neffects on competition, operational and economic efficiency, and \nregulatory oversight. Finally, this amendment prevents utilities from \nskirting Federal review by using partnerships or other corporate forms \nto avoid classification as a ``merger.''\n  I want to address concerns that some of my colleagues may have about \nthe scope of this amendment. This amendment does not impose new \nregulatory requirements on proposed utility mergers. Rather, the \nstandards contained in the amendment mirror those contained in the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act, or PUHCA, which the bill before us \nwould repeal. While the standards are comparable, the amendment \nprovides greater flexibility than exists under PUHCA. PUHCA requires \nthat utilities be physically integrated in order to merge; the \namendment waives that requirement. PUHCA also prevents the merger of \nmulti-State electric and gas utilities; the amendment waives that \nrequirement while providing for FERC review of such mergers.\n  I also want to speak in favor of language that my colleague from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden, and I developed on transactions between utility \ncompany affiliates. This amendment protects consumers from assuming the \ncosts and risks of utility diversification into non-utility businesses \nand prevents utilities from subsidizing affiliate ventures and \ncompeting unfairly with independent businesses.\n  The language that the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, and I worked to \ninclude in this package does three things. First, it extends to \nelectricity suppliers the requirements we placed upon \ntelecommunications companies when we repealed PUHCA in the \ntelecommunications sector in 1996 in the Telecommunications Act. \nSecond, it requires utilities to disclose all transactions with \naffiliates, including those that are off the books or with overseas \naffiliates. Finally, it establishes safeguards regarding the purchase \nof goods and services between the utility and their affiliates.\n  These provisions are needed, because we are already experiencing \nconcerns about utilities expanding into electricity related services \nand out competing small businesses in my State. Small contractors can't \ncompete against big utilities in areas like energy efficiency upgrades \nto private homes, when big utilities can use existing assets like \npersonnel, equipment, and vehicles to perform those services. When \nPUHCA is repealed, utilities will be able to expand into other business \nareas, and we should make certain that we protect small businesses.\n  This amendment is good public policy, and it will strengthen the \nSenate's position in conference with the House of Representatives. I \nurge my colleagues concerned about ensuring a diversity of energy \nsupply and fairness in a deregulated system to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to speak for a moment about the \nConsumer Protection Amendments being offered by Senator Dayton and a \nnumber of co-sponsors, including myself. I want to thank all of my \ncolleagues who have been working hard to improve this bill, \nparticularly, my colleague from Washington, Senator Cantwell, who has \npushed to bring this amendment to a vote today.\n  This consumer protection amendment improves this bill by providing a \nnumber of much needed consumer protections for electricity customers. I \nhave spoken a number of times expressing my concern regarding enacting \nbroad, far-reaching electricity de-regulation in these turbulent times. \nCalifornia's attempts to deregulate electricity markets were \ndisastrous. We are all still trying to figure out what happened to \nEnron and thousands of retirement and saving accounts. Consumers in the \nPacific Northwest are still paying for some of the aftereffects of \nthese events.\n  Repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act, which was enacted \nin 1935, without adding strong consumer protections would be \nirresponsible. In this energy bill, we are also contemplating major \nchanges to the Publicly Utility Regulatory Policies Act and the Federal \nPower Act.\n  When making these changes, it is essential that we make sure \nconsumers do not suffer. A number of people have indicated that \nappropriate consumer protections are already in place in the underlying \nbill.\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\n  I disagree. I think that additional consumer protections are \nnecessary.\n  This amendment strengthens the consumer protections by: ensuring \nelectric holding company mergers advance the public interest; requiring \nFERC monitor and prevent market power abuses; ensuring market abuses \nare remedied; ensuring open access to utility holding company records \nby State Regulatory Commissions; and, requiring transparency in market \ntransactions.\n  These provisions will greatly improve the electricity title of this \nbill and I am proud to be a co-sponsor. I encourage my colleagues to \nalso lend their support.\n  Energy is very important to our quality of life, particularly in the \nPacific Northwest. The electricity title of this bill continues to \nconcern me and many in the Northwest. However, it is important that we \nall work together to develop an energy bill that will benefit the \nentire country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I want to take an opportunity to \nrespond to a few points my colleagues made about this amendment, which \nI think is necessary in protecting consumers.\n  It does repeal PUHCA and takes that measure off the books. What is \nimportant about that is, while we can say our current law didn't \nprotect us from the mishaps in the California market and the Western \nenergy crisis, it certainly means we should not be lowering the \nstandard and taking away more consumer protections.\n  I applaud the chairman of the committee for trying to focus more \nattention in a particular area of energy expertise, to say let's look \nat these problems. But what we are doing by also saying let's have the \nenergy expertise within FERC look at these problems, we are also \nsaying, look at these problems within a framework that is less onerous \non the energy companies; let's lower the legal standard by which they \nhave to come before the Commission. And, basically, instead of saying \nthey have to serve the public interest, they go for a lower standard by \nwhich those mergers can be completed.\n  It gives FERC the ability, with market-based rates, something they \nhave never statutorily had. So instead of the consumers being able to \nhave cost-based rates on electricity, we are saying, for the first time \nin statutory authority, they can charge market-based rates.\n  But we are saying charge market based-rates, and we are saying you \ndon't have to consider some of the same things that ought to be \nconsidered, given that we are repealing PUHCA; and that is: What is in \nthe public interest, and how is it advancing the public interest, how \nis it preventing unjust and unreasonable rates?\n  If we have learned anything from the California experience, it is \nthat there has not been enough clout within a singular agency in the \nFederal Government to adequately protect consumers from unjust and \nunreasonable rates. They have not had enough protection.\n  That is why the AARP, the American Public Power Association, the \nConsumers Union, the Sierra Club, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nAir Condition Contractors of America, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, the Consumers for Fair Competition--all these organizations \nsupport this amendment, including the Electricity Consumers Resource \nCouncil, the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, \nthe National Environmental Trust, the National League of Cities, the \nNational Rural Electric Co-op Association, the National Resources \nDefense Council, the Transmission Access Policy Study Group, the Union \nof Concerned Scientists, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n  All these organizations are warning us, telling us, there are not \nenough consumer protections as this bill moves from having the PUHCA \nlaw on the books and having the SEC involved to FERC authority, which \nalbeit could play a more responsible role and one with larger \noversight, but we are not giving them the direction to do so in this \nbill. We are repealing those statutes that would give them specific \nstandards by which to measure both these issues of market-based rates \nand mergers. We are giving new responsibility to an organization and \ntaking away the consumer protections.\n  It does not make sense, in this time and era of an energy crisis in \nthe West, where consumers have been gouged, where FERC has not been \nable to protect consumers before the incident in reviewing statistics \nand after the incident, to now say, Let's lessen the standard by which \nFERC should be involved, let's give them more authority to allow the \nenergy companies to move more quickly, to move more aggressively \nwithout oversight on increasing electricity rates.\n  We cannot say to the consumers of America that we learned nothing \nfrom the Western energy crisis. We cannot say that to them. We have to \nadopt this amendment and say we know that, while we are repealing some \nlaws and putting more responsibility on FERC, we are going to make sure \nconsumers are protected.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this very needed consumer protection \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a brief \nannouncement?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we expect a vote on this matter within the \nnext 15 or 20 minutes. All Senators should be aware there will be an \neffort to vote in the near future. All Senators should be aware of \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Maria \nCantwell, and Senator Dayton for bringing this amendment to the floor. \nI am a strong cosponsor of it.\n  Senator Cantwell made a point that we need to learn what happened to \nthose of us on the west coast who went through a terrible crisis in \nelectricity and runaway price hikes. We all know if we do not look at \nhistory and the mistakes that were made, we are going to repeat those \nmistakes.\n  What the Senator from Washington is trying to do--and some of us are \nstrongly behind her--is to tell the rest of our colleagues that we hope \nthey prepare against what happened to us and make sure consumers are \nnot forgotten.\n  I am stunned that there would even be objection to this amendment. \nAll we are doing is ensuring that since PUHCA was repealed, we want to \nmake sure the standard is not lowered. We want to make sure consumers \nare protected.\n  I can guarantee that those who vote for this bill, if this amendment \ngoes down, are going to be back here complaining that they really did \nnot understand what we were doing when we did not protect consumers. \nHow do I know this? Because it is clear. What did we learn from Enron? \nRemember Enron? We learned that they did everything in secret. They did \neverything in secret. They sold the same electricity 15 times over. \nThis is according to testimony from the people in California who \nsuffered the consequences.\n  I guess, I say to my colleague, if the rest of this Senate wants to \nsee an energy crisis happen in their States, all we can do is offer up \nthis amendment as a way to stop it. But in the underlying bill, there \nis very little transparency. We need to make sure the books and records \nof these companies are open and they are clear so that my colleagues in \ntheir States can see why their prices are going up 100 percent, 200 \npercent, 300 percent. In our case, it was over a 500-percent increase \nin the price of electricity. By the way, demand was going down.\n  It is extraordinary. One year ago, April 2001, wholesale electricity \nwas selling for $201 per megawatt. A year earlier before the crisis \nbegan, it was $32 per megawatt. It went up $32 to $201. That is a 528-\npercent increase.\n  Why did it happen? Because of deregulation. The problem is, there was \nno transparency. Everyone was paying more. We had rolling blackouts. We \nhad horrible problems. Believe me when I tell you, Madam President--you \nknow this because you have visited California often--this is a State \nthat, if it was a nation, according to our gross domestic product, \nwould be the fifth largest nation in the world. When I started in \npolitics, we were ninth. It shows you how long I have been in politics, \nbut it also shows the incredible growth of our agricultural sector and\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nSilicon Valley and their need to have electricity.\n  Mind you, it is not wasted. California now is the No. 1 State in \nenergy efficiency per capita. During the crisis, our demand went down. \nNo one can tell us our prices went up because demand went up, which is \nwhat the Vice President said. Our demand went down. We have been \namazing at saving.\n  Someone has to look out for the consumer, and that is why I support \nwhat Senator Cantwell is doing.\n  I, frankly, believed repealing PUHCA in the underlying bill was not \nthe way to go. That was my opinion. But since we have taken the matter \nof PUHCA and transferred those responsibilities to FERC, let's at least \nmake sure FERC has the same opportunity to learn the facts as the SEC \ndid under PUHCA. That is why this amendment is so important.\n\n  This is what Loretta Lynch, the president of the California Public \nUtilities Commission, testified last week before the Commerce Committee \nabout FERC and the weakening of its reporting requirements. Ms. Lynch \ntestified:\n\n       FERC has over the past few years at the urging of Enron and \n     others diluted the reporting requirements, loosened the \n     accounting rules and exempted large classes of energy sellers \n     from making required disclosures.\n\n  This is not from me. This is from someone on the ground, the head of \nour public utilities commission. Then she goes on to say:\n\n       FERC does not even require the same data to be filed in its \n     quarterly reports, allowing companies like Enron to hide the \n     true nature and extent of activities through skeletal public \n     reporting and not be called to account by FERC.\n\n  The bottom line is, with this amendment, we are trying to restore \nsome transparency. We need to see what these companies are doing.\n  As I say, it is stunning to me that we do not have support for this \namendment, which is very modest in what it tries to do. The Senator \nfrom Washington has taken the critiques of this amendment and has \nanswered one point at a time. The critiques we have heard in this \ndebate simply are not right.\n  One of the claims is that we keep PUHCA on the books. How ridiculous. \nPUHCA is repealed. We do not bring it back. All we are saying is now \nthat the underlying bill gives the responsibility of PUHCA to FERC, \nthere ought to be some rules that show we care about the consumer and \nthat the consumer will not be forgotten.\n  In closing, I think the Senator from Washington knows her stuff on \nthis. She is on the Energy Committee. She gets it. She is taking the \nlessons of the west coast, what happened to our consumers, which was \ndevastating, and saying to everyone: Please listen to us. We want to \navoid this in the rest of the country. That is why she has the support \nof the AARP. Older Americans are the ones who get caught. They live on \nfixed incomes. When those electricity prices go up, it is not fun and \ngames. This is real people suffering. They suffered in Oregon, they \nsuffered in Washington, and they suffered in California.\n  So what are we doing in this bill? Nothing to really help them. We \nare ensuring this cannot happen elsewhere, and that is why we have so \nmany others supporting this amendment, such as the Consumer Federation \nof America, the Consumers for Fair Competition, the Consumers Union, \nthe Electricity Consumers Resource Council, the National Alliance for \nFair Competition, the National Association of State Utility Consumer \nAdvocates, the National Environmental Trust, the National League of \nCities, the National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association, the \nNatural Resources Defense Council, the Physicians for Social \nResponsibility.\n  This is a health issue when people cannot turn on the air-\nconditioning. If we do not protect the consumers, we have problems. \nPublic Citizens supports this amendment, the Sierra Club, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the U.S. \nPublic Interest Research Group. This is the consumer protection \npackage.\n  My colleague from Washington did a good job. She took amendments from \nthose of us who were looking at different areas where we thought the \nbill did not reach the level of consumer protection it should and put \nthem into an omnibus amendment. I congratulate her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from California on the amendment. I also appreciate her support \nfor it and her articulation of the problem.\n  I ask the Senator from California--obviously, both of our States are \nbeing greatly impacted from this crisis. I think we have had numerous, \nthousands, of constituents who ask us how we got into this situation \nand ask us exactly how this situation occurred to this degree and why \nthere were not more Federal protections in place.\n  Given the impact to both Washington and California, consumers want to \nknow how is it this kind of deregulation went through at the State \nlevel and then certain protections were not in place at the Federal \nlevel.\n  Before the Senator from California leaves the Chamber, I ask if she \nwould answer this question about her constituents' desires to see a \nsafeguard at the Federal level to make sure that further deregulation, \nand the incurring investigation of high energy prices, are adequately \ndealt with and whether consumers believe these protections have been \nadequately up to date, because in my State people have said repeatedly, \nwhere is the Federal role and responsibility in making sure these \nconsumers were not gouged?\n  In California, a new system was put in place. The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission was supposed to oversee that and to judge whether \nit was going to work as far as market-based rates, and clearly it did \nnot work. Not only did FERC approve it, it did not monitor it after it \nwent into place. It did not stop and say that unjust and unreasonable \nrates are gouging consumers in California, until the lights went out.\n  So why would we now say--and I am curious as to the Senator's \nexperience in hearing from constituents about this Federal role--to \nthem, we are going to consolidate and make it even easier; put \nauthority under FERC and weaken the standard? Not only are we going to \ngive them direction, but we are going to say we are going to give them \nless tools to play that role; we are going to give them a lower legal \nstandard by which to review these; we are going to allow them to make \nmarket-based decisions without the criteria of respecting the consumers \nand protecting and advancing their interests as they look at mergers.\n  I am curious as to the California experience. I know the experience \nhas been clear in my State. They wanted unjust and unreasonable rates \nto be looked at when they were being charged 85 percent more. They \nthought it was very clear that was unjust and unreasonable. In my \nState, these people have to live with 8- and 9-year Enron contracts.\n  As my California colleague said, they sold power 15 times to \ndifferent people. They are literally buying power at a cheap rate and \nwithin my State selling it at an increase, double, triple the increase, \nto other consumers in my State. They are getting away with it, and FERC \nis doing nothing to make sure those rates are being investigated as \nunjust and unreasonable, and they are not letting my constituents out \nof those long-term contracts in the next maybe 8 or 9 years of 85-\npercent increases in energy prices.\n  So why would States that have been impacted want to give FERC the \ndirection but say, here are the legal standards, they are less than \nthey were before, so go at this business? So if my colleague from \nCalifornia could comment on her experience in that Federal role and \nwhat it is that safeguards constituents who have been harmed in \npersonal situations and in economic businesses.\n\n  States' economies have been ruined over this situation, and now we \nare saying to them that our colleagues are going to provide less \nprotections for them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is the key. The fact is, in our States--I will just \ntalk to my State--the only agency we had to protect us was FERC. FERC, \nunder the Clinton administration, found that the prices were unjust and \nunreasonable. Then there was a switch in administrations and they never \nrepealed that. They admitted they were unjust\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nand unreasonable, but they did absolutely nothing to help us--for 1 \nyear. We were talking about billions of dollars of costs. The long-term \ncontracts were signed under duress by our Governor because the spot \nmarket was so impossible he tried to get some of the demand away from \nthe spot market, went into these long-term contracts. Fortunately, he \nhas begun to renegotiate those.\n  We have asked FERC to help us renegotiate most of them. It is \nstunning to me that this underlying bill gives so much more power to \nFERC when under the law as it existed they did nothing to help our \npeople for 1 year. They finally put in place the market-based pricing \nand, by the way, it cured our problem.\n  After this administration saying for a year that it would not cure \nour problem, it cured our problem. Those market-based prices are set to \nexpire in September, and already the new Chairman of FERC has hinted \nthat he is not going to reimpose those price caps.\n  So I say to my colleague, the only agency--because we had deregulated \nin our State, and believe me there was enough blame to go around. It \nwas a bipartisan deregulation recommended by Pete Wilson, our then-\nGovernor, and it went through. Enron and others had absolutely no one \nlooking over their shoulder, and the only agency that could have done \nanything to help us against unjust and unreasonable prices was FERC. \nThe bottom line is: They did nothing for a year. It was a disaster.\n  In this underlying bill, we are giving FERC even more work by \nrepealing PUHCA, which was administered by the SEC, and giving it over \nto FERC, and having very few requirements on the open books and \nrecords.\n  So a company such as Enron--Enron is gone. They said California would \nsink, but they sank. We are OK. They sank. But there is going to be \nEnron II and Enron III and Enron IV because, unfortunately, they showed \nhow it could be dealt with, at least in the short term. When that \nhappens under the underlying bill, there is very little that FERC will \nbe able to get at in terms of the transparency of the records.\n  The one thing we learned was there was a lot of secrecy going on. The \nsale of electricity--Enron was a broker, in between the generators and \nthe consumers, so Enron would go buy electricity from a generator at a \npretty good price for the generator but then they would sell it to \nthemselves, 14 times to subsidiaries. Each time they showed a profit on \nthe books to make Enron look more successful, more profitable, and each \ntime they jacked up the rates until it got to the final sale at 520 \npercent--sometimes higher--than it was the year before, and that became \nthe benchmark price. All this was secret.\n\n  We have an opportunity in an energy bill to make sure this experience \ndoes not happen again. What do we do? We step back. That is why the \nconsumer groups in this country are absolutely upset about this bill \nand why they have come together in an unprecedented number. I ask \nunanimous consent to have the list of organizations supporting this \namendment printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Support the Consumer Protection Package\n\n       Amendment #3097, offered by Senators Dayton, Wellstone, \n     Feingold, Cantwell, Boxer and Wyden, would add crucial \n     consumer protections to the electricity title of the Senate \n     energy bill, incorporating lessons learned from the Western \n     electricity crisis and Enron's collapse.\n       AARP.\n       Air Conditioning Contractors of America.\n       Alliance for Affordable Energy.\n       American Public Power Association.\n       Consumers Federation of America.\n       Consumers for Fair Competition.\n       Consumers Union.\n       Electricity Consumers Resource Council.\n       National Alliance for Fair Competition.\n       National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates.\n       National Environmental Trust.\n       National League of Cities.\n       National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association.\n       Natural Resources Defense Council.\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n       Public Citizen.\n       Sierra Club.\n       Transmission Access Policy Study Group.\n       U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n       Union of Concerned Scientists.\n       US Public Interest Research Group.\n       Vote ``Yes'' on the Consumer Protection Package.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. They have come together behind Senators Cantwell and \nDayton to say: Please, fix this bill. Do not do what California did.\n  Just because something is changing does not mean it is changing in a \nright way. We have to be very careful. Did we learn anything in \nCalifornia, Washington, and Oregon? The word ``deregulation'' is a \nbeautiful word. I love it. I wish we didn't need regulations, and I \nwish everyone did everything right. However, in a society where you \nmust have your heat and you must have your air because you must run a \nbusiness, you must make sure an elderly person in summer does not \nsuffer from the dangers of heat exhaustion, you have to have a way to \nmake sure this important need is not forgone.\n  I thank my friend. The California experience is forever seared in my \nmind and heart. I don't want other States to go through the same thing. \nThis amendment will help in that regard. I hope the Senator wins this \namendment. The way things are going, we may not make it. But we are on \nthe right side. We are not going to give up. Just as we learned in \nCalifornia, we can vote a lot of things in, but when the people say, \nWhat are you doing, we come back here pretty darn quick. From my \nexperience in California, this is not the way to go. This underlying \nbill is not the way to go. My friend has pinpointed the need for \nconsumer protections.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank my colleague from California for her articulate \nrendering of what has happened in the California market and the \ncomplexity of this issue. She is right, the consumers have asked, Where \nhave the Federal role and responsibility been? People in our States did \nnot think FERC responded quickly enough and do not believe FERC has all \nthe tools now necessary to protect other States from this same thing \nhappening again or to conduct the investigation that needs to take \nplace to make sure consumers are not gouged after September when the \nexpiration of this current FERC order occurs.\n  We are saying: If you are going to give FERC the responsibilities and \nrepeal PUHCA, and also change from SEC to FERC authority, we are giving \nFERC real responsibility with no statutory guidance. But then we are \nessentially saying--wink, wink--we are not giving you any of the tools \nto enforce these authorities; we want you to just be part of the \nequation but not have any statutory authority to make the \ninvestigations. Let's say instead: You can proceed with market-based \nrates instead of cost-based rates. But if you are going to proceed with \nmarket-based rates, you must make sure there are competitive markets. \nYou must make sure you effectively monitor those markets. You must make \nsure you prevent the abuse of those market powers. You must make sure \nyou are protecting the consumer interests, and you must ensure that \nthere are just and reasonable rates. That seems to me to be very fair, \nthat these consumer issues are protected in legislation. That is all we \nare asking.\n  If we are going to give responsibility to FERC, let's make sure we \ntell them to protect the consumer interests, not the big business \ninterests that have caused so much economic devastation in the West.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will speak briefly in response to some of the \ncomments made, and then I will move to table the amendment.\n  We have had a good debate about it. I will speak about three aspects: \nFirst, the argument, the allegation, that we are, in the underlying \nbill before the Senate, agreed to on a bipartisan basis, lowering the \nlegal standard. That is one of the arguments that has been made. It is \nsimply wrong. We are not lowering the legal standard. The legal \nstandard is, and always has been, that determinations be consistent \nwith the public interest; that acquisitions, mergers, consolidations, \nbe consistent with the public interest.\n  What we are doing is saying that, for mergers, we have enhanced the \nauthority and responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission by saying that not only must they determine\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\nit is consistent with the public interest, which has been the standard \nin the past, we are requiring them to determine that consumers will not \nbe harmed--that is, consumers, ratepayers of existing utilities, will \nnot be harmed. We are requiring them to make a determination that \nregulation, either Federal or State regulation, will not in any way be \nimpaired. And we are requiring FERC to make a determination that there \nwill be no cross-subsidy to any other company than the company being \nacquired or merged.\n  What we are doing is increasing the responsibilities we are imposing \non FERC. A lot of criticism has been leveled against FERC in the way \nthey responded on the west coast. I agree with much of that. I think \nthey were very slow to respond to the spike in prices in California and \nthe Northwest. I was critical at the time, and I continue to be \ncritical that they were slow to respond. We are putting an affirmative \nduty on FERC to step in anytime there is evidence that a market-based \nrate is not just and reasonable. It is FERC's responsibility under the \nlanguage we have to withdraw those market-based rates and to require \njust and reasonable rates.\n  That is a new responsibility we are imposing. It is an appropriate \nresponsibility. The argument that, because they did not move quickly \nenough under current law, we should now go ahead and change the law to \ngive them this new responsibility does not make sense to me.\n  With regard to the provisions the Senator from California was raising \nabout the transparency of books and records, I agree entirely that the \nbooks and records of any and all of these companies that are subject to \nregulation should be open for inspection. The provisions we have in the \nbill require each of these companies to maintain and make available to \nFERC the books, accounts, the memoranda, the records, that the \nCommission deems relevant to the costs that are incurred by that public \nutility. Each affiliate company is also required to do the same.\n  There is a provision saying that the right of States to request \nbooks, records, accounts, memoranda, and other records they identify in \nwriting as needed by the State commissioner--that right for them to \nobtain those is also protected.\n  We have in this underlying bill the protections that are required for \nconsumers. I am persuaded that the enactment of this legislation, this \ntitle 2, this electricity provision, will cure many of the problems the \nSenators from Washington and California have been concerned with--and \nvery rightly concerned with this last year.\n  I think the argument that we are not dealing with these issues is \nwrong. I urge my colleagues to join us in tabling this amendment which \nwould undermine the bipartisan agreement we made on this provision some \nweeks ago.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the amendment No. \n3234.

The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, was the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico in the spirit of a second degree to the Nelson \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is drafted as a substitute for \nthe first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this issue, of course, relates to \nhydroelectric power. This is a subject on which we have been working \nfor several months with interested Members, with the Senator from \nIdaho, the Senator from Oregon, the Senator from Nebraska, and their \nstaffs, in an effort to achieve consensus on a very difficult issue. I \nvery much thank them for all the work they have put into this effort \nand their efforts to come to agreement as to how we should proceed. \nUnfortunately, we have not been able to resolve the issues.\n  I know hydropower plays a very significant role in providing needed \nenergy to the entire Nation and particularly to the Northwest. It is a \nvery important energy source in other parts of the country as well, \nparticularly New England.\n  There are now five first-degree amendments and three second-degree \namendments that have been filed to this bill with regard to the topic \nof hydroelectric relicensing. So the proliferation of amendments \nreflects the fact that, in spite of a lot of good work that has been \ndone, there is no consensus about how to proceed. Unfortunately, I \ncannot support the amendment the Senators from Nebraska and Idaho are \noffering today. In my view, it does not reflect a consensus.\n  At this juncture, given the procedural posture of the bill, I believe \nthe best course is to adopt the amendment I have offered which provides \nthat there be a review undertaken by the relevant agencies with respect \nto two aspects of the hydroelectric relicensing process. Let me recount \nwhat those are.\n  First, whether provisions for alternative mandatory conditions such \nas those included in the Nelson-Craig amendment would work to improve \nthe process and, secondly, methods that should be adopted to streamline \nthe process.\n  The hydroelectric relicensing process has come under criticism. Much \nof that criticism is justified due to its complexity and the length of \ntime it takes to issue a renewal license. These delays are not good for \ngovernment, and they are of great concern to my colleagues and to me as \nwell.\n  There are interagency efforts in place to try to improve that \nprocess. We need to encourage those efforts. We need to try to let \nthose efforts play out.\n  My amendment would do this by requiring all the involved agencies--\nthat includes the Secretary of the Interior, Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Agriculture--to \nreport on whether the alternative would require all the agencies to \nwork together to make recommendations to the Congress on how we can \nimprove the process.\n  The second thing the amendment does is require the agencies to report \non whether the alternative mandatory conditioning authority provisions \nincluded in the underlying amendment would work. My amendment would \nrequire recommendations as to what standard should apply with respect \nto alternative mandatory conditions and the nature of participation of \ninterested parties.\n  In addition, the amendment I have offered would require an assessment \nof whether this new authority would delay an already complex and slow \nprocess, which is a very real concern I have.\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\n  The Nelson-Craig amendment would adopt alternative mandatory \nconditioning authority while doing nothing to streamline the process. I \nam concerned that the amendment, rather than improving the process, \nwill inadvertently add complexity and delay to an already overly \ncomplex and slow relicensing process.\n  I am also concerned that the Craig amendment undermines protections \nfor Federal lands and resources provided for in the Federal Power Act. \nUnder that act, mandatory conditions and prescriptions are developed by \nthe Federal land management or resource agency for inclusion in the \nlicense to protect wildlife refuges, national parks, other Federal \nlands, and Indian reservations. This conditioning authority and these \nstandards have been in place for over 80 years.\n  The Senate energy bill provides new flexibility relating to this \nconditioning authority by including alternative mandatory conditioning \nauthority. But the bill does this in a way that we believe is \nenvironmentally protective in an appropriate way.\n  The amendment by the Senators from Nebraska and Idaho would change \nthis alternative mandatory conditioning authority to make it less \nprotective of Federal lands and resources by modifying the standard for \nalternative mandatory conditions from that included in the bill.\n  Finally, the Craig amendment would give greater weight to the views \nof the license applicants over the views of States and tribes and the \npublic. This is another change we believe is inappropriate and causes \nme to propose the amendment I have called up for consideration.\n  I acknowledge these are difficult issues. Consensus has been \ndifficult to achieve. Rather than proceeding with either the Craig \namendment or the language in the Senate bill, the one before the Senate \nnow, I believe the sound approach is to learn more about the \nimplications of these provisions and seek expert input from the \nagencies involved, and that is what the amendment I have called up \nwould do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment I offer as an \nalternative to the Nelson-Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I commend my colleague from \nNew Mexico for his very able work on bringing forth an energy bill. It \nis with some sadness I find myself opposing his substitute amendment.\n  The substitute amendment is essentially requesting a study in an area \nwhere we already know the results. I support studies when we don't know \nwhat the study will tell us and we don't know the results and we need \nto find out what the situation is. But in this case, we know what the \nsituation is.\n  We have a system that suffers from dispersed decisionmaking authority \nand an inability to balance competing values and a system that is \ncertainly jeopardizing the relicensing of many of our hydropower \nfacilities across the Nation.\n  Nearly every State will have one or more and as much as 99.9 percent \nof its hydroelectric power facilities come up for the licensing review \nwithin the next 15 years. If they have the experience I have had in \nNebraska, they won't have to have a study. They can simply look to see \nwhat has happened in Nebraska to tell them what the future holds for \nthem.\n  The future of Nebraska is dimmed because of the past experience we \nhave had with the relicensing process.\n  We spent $40 million for one hydroelectric powerplant in 14 years to \nrealize this project--a project built in the 1930s. That experience can \ntell you that the system is lengthy, expensive, and it doesn't require \nany of that $40 million that was spent to go into the environment, \nhabitat, wildlife retainment, or anything of that sort. It was money \nspent on application fees, filing of papers, lawyer's fees--$40 million \nto realize this one project in the State of Nebraska, taking 14 years.\n  That was when we had both Senators from Nebraska, the congressional \nRepresentatives, and I, as Governor, supporting the effort to get it \ndone in an expeditious fashion. That is expedition in reverse.\n  The truth is, this system is not expedited; it is expensive, costly, \nand slow. We even had in our situation, nearly at the end of the \nprocess, after we had gone through the process with as many alphabet \nagencies in the Federal Government that I thought we would ever find, \nanother agency that came in and said: All the work you have done is for \nnaught, and we have a requirement we would like to impose at the tail \nend of the process.\n  They could have done it at the beginning of the process. This will \nhelp alleviate and obviate that need. In the State of Washington alone, \nyou are going to be facing the relicensing of 80 percent of your \nhydroelectric power in the next 15 years--21 projects. If you multiply \nthat times $40 million, you can see what the cost really is. Multiply \nthat times the number of staff years, in terms of what it is going to \ntake, and you will see what the internal cost truly is to your power \nauthorities.\n  I would ordinarily support a study. But in this case, we don't need \none. We have had the study, and the study is experience which tells us \nthat we need to make this kind of correction, and we need to make it \nnow, not wait until the study tells us what we already know.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the \nsecond-degree amendment being offered by Senator Bingaman. Truly, \nanother study of this issue will do nothing more than run out the clock \non license holders who must get 53 percent of the nonfederal hydropower \ncapacity in this Nation relicensed within the next 15 years.\n  To give you an example of just how grave a situation this is, there \nare 307 projects under the category, including 49 projects in \nCalifornia, 21 projects in Washington, 23 projects in Wisconsin, 30 \nprojects in New York, 23 projects in Maine, 14 projects in Oregon, and \n14 projects in Michigan. This amounts to over 29,000 megawatts of \ncapacity. To put this into context, it takes 1,000 megawatts daily to \nrun the City of Seattle. So when you figure that 29,000 megawatts are \nat stake, and you figure what it takes to run Seattle, you can imagine \nhow much economic difficulty will ensue if we do not figure out a more \nreasonable way to bring on hydropower relicensing.\n  There have been extensive hearings already during the last two \nCongresses, in the Senate Energy Committee, on the need for hydro \nrelicensing reform. I have attended them all, and there has been a \ncommittee that was chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. \nThat committee has concluded that legislative reforms are absolutely \ncritical if we are to make progress and meet the deadlines that are \nlooming over the energy capacity of this country.\n  There have been administrative attempts to reform the process \nalready. Having the same agencies that have, so far, been able to \ninstitute meaningful reforms further study this issue will provide us \nwith no benefit at all. I urge my colleagues from all parts of this \ncountry, who have hydroelectric power, to please support the Nelson \namendment. It provides modest reforms of a narrow portion of the \nrelicensing process.\n  The time for study is done. The time to ensure that hydropower \nremains an important part of our electricity mix is now. Madam \nPresident, no one knows better than you and I, from the Pacific \nNorthwest, how critical an issue this is for our neck of the woods. I \nalso say that, while all energy production has an environmental \ntradeoff, truly, hydropower puts out no global warming and provides our \npeople with the most renewable, inexpensive, and reliable sources of \nelectricity there are, frankly, on the Earth.\n  I believe if we are serious about reemploying our people, getting our \neconomy moving, we have to be serious about hydro relicensing reform.\n  Madam President, I know a number of environmental groups have opposed \nthe Nelson amendment. I want to also say we have, for those who are \nconcerned about the environmental issue, as we all are, that there is a \nsecond degree that I will be offering that does enjoy the support of \nmany environmental groups, such as Trout Unlimited. I quote their news \nrelease today:\n\n       Senator Smith's amendment improves the Craig-Nelson \n     amendment by reducing the loss in fishery protection from SA \n     3140.\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\n     While we support Senator Smith's amendment, we still urge \n     opposing an amended SA 3140.\n\n  The point I am trying to make is we have improved the underlying \namendment, and we have given the environmental community something that \nwill significantly help them in their advocacy. To demonstrate what we \nare trying to do with the second degree, should the Bingaman study be \ndefeated, this amendment does two important things. While it \nsubstantially, like Senator Nelson's, makes the changes I think provide \nvalue to all of the stakeholders who follow the relicensing process, \nthe first would substitute the words ``fish resources'' for ``fishery'' \nin the underlying text. We want to make it clear that we are trying to \nprotect all fish resources, not just those fish species that are \nharvested either commercially already or with sport fishery.\n\n  Secondly, the amendment would begin this process in 2008. It would \nrequire license applicants to file their applications for a new license \nwith the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 3 years before the \ncurrent license has expired. During the hearings before the Energy \nCommittee, it was clear to me that there was frustration with the \ncurrent statutory requirement to file only 2 years before the \nexpiration of the current licenses. In most instances, this is \ninsufficient time for FERC to review the adequacy of the application \nand to determine any additional studies that might be needed. The \nresult is a string of annual licenses which do not provide certainty \nfor consumers or the utility and results in delays in environmental \nmitigation and enhancement.\n  Licensed applicants are reluctant to spend such funds until they know \nwhat will, in fact, be required of them under any new license. So I say \nto those who care about the environment, the Nelson-Craig amendment \nwill be improved with the second degree that will follow. Truly, what \nwe need, last of all, is another study on a problem that we know only \ntoo well through experience.\n  If you want a study, the study is Senator Nelson, who was Governor \nNelson. His experience is all the study we need that we have a broken \nsystem and we need to repair it. I remind my colleagues that none of us \nhas a job in any industry unless electricity is produced first. \nHydropower is crucial in the mix of America's energy. It is absolutely \nthe backbone of the Pacific Northwest. This is needed, and then we have \na way to protect the environment and a way to improve this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, over the last 6 weeks, while we have \ndebated essential elements of the energy bill, from ANWR and CAFE to \nelectricity deregulation and ethanol, I have joined the sponsors of \nthis amendment, the chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee \nand others in trying to forge a consensus on how best to reform the \nhydroelectric relicensing process.\n  Let me state at the outset, that I share the sponsor's deep sense of \nfrustration and concern with how the existing hydro relicensing process \nworks for all participants.\n  With more than 9,300 megawatts of nonfederal hydropower capacity, \nWashington State is the single most hydro dependent state in the \nNation. The power of the great rivers of the Pacific Northwest has \ncontributed to our economy, created industries and even helped to win \nthe Second World War. There is no area of the country where hydropower \ngeneration has greater importance.\n  At the same time, Washington State also relies on the natural \nabundance of these spectacular rivers. Washington's rivers provide \nyear-round recreation opportunities, including fishing and boating, \nthese features contribute enormously to our economy as well as our \nenvironment. Our rivers are also home to salmon and steelhead runs, the \ncultural soul of the Pacific Northwest.\n  The rivers serve as an important economic and cultural resource to \nseveral Northwest Indian tribes that entered into treaties with the \nU.S. based on the promise to protect and honor their rights and \nresources.\n  Our reliance on hydropower and on the recreational and environmental \nbenefits of our rivers requires us to employ a balanced approach to \ntheir use. Utility operators have shared with me horror stories about \nhow the rising costs, loss of operational flexibility, and lost \ngeneration due to new operating constraints imposed during relicensing \nare impacting their ability to bring power to Washington's consumers. \nAt the same time, 12 runs of Washington State salmon are now included \non the endangered species list.\n  We can and must find the right balance to ensure continued survival \nof these species while maintaining hydropower production.\n  Many hydropower projects, including some in the Northwest, were built \nwithout adequate consideration of impacts on the environment. Most were \nbuilt prior to the enactment of essential environmental laws like the \nClean Water Act and Endangered Species Act. Relicensing offers a unique \nopportunity to reassess the licenses of these hydropower dams, bring \nthem up to modern standards, and ensure the long-term health of our \nrivers.\n  The current process for licensing hydropower projects has had mixed \nresults. On the one hand, we have examples of great successes. The \nCowlitz was once home to some of the most bountiful salmon and \nsteelhead runs in the Pacific Northwest. In August 2000, a landmark \nrelicensing settlement was signed that will open up more than 200 miles \nof renewed habitat. The settlement is supported by Federal and State \nagencies, conservation groups, and the hydro utility. On the other \nhand, the Cushman project has been operating under annual licenses due \nto disputes over appropriate environmental measures. While Tacoma Power \nhas continued operating the project for over 20 years, there remain a \nnumber of serious environmental challenges.\n  And on all sides we have parties pointing the finger at one another \nclaiming that the other is always to blame. I do not believe that any \nof the parties to relicensing, Federal resources agencies, FERC, \ntribes, States, the industry or advocacy groups, are to blame for \nproblems in relicensing. In fact, I believe most parties are good \nactors caught up in an outdated, bureaucratic process desperately in \nneed of reform.\n  There is no question that the existing licensing process can be \nimproved. We can make it faster and cheaper without sacrificing \nenvironmental quality. Quicker licensing would improve the efficiency \nof these projects and improve the environment. This is a goal that I \nwould strongly support, if we were debating such measures today.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what the amendment before us today \naccomplishes. Instead, the amendment creates a new appeals process, \nanother step, to this flawed process without requiring FERC and the \nresource agencies to address the fundamental problems contributing to \nthe delays and skyrocketing costs.\n  I agree with the supporters of this amendment that one part of the \nsolution is to allow participants to propose creative solutions in \nbalancing energy and environmental priorities. While I can't fully \nagree with the approach taken in this amendment, I do agree that \nparties should be rewarded for coming together and proposing innovative \nnew solutions. But more importantly, there will be no real improvement \nuntil Congress requires or FERC and the resource agencies agree to \nsignificant structural reform. This amendment falls far short.\n  Section 306 of the underlying bill provides an opportunity to \nstreamline the licensing process by requiring agencies to work together \nwith FERC in a more cooperative manner. It also requires the \ncoordination of environmental reviews and places a number of \nrequirements on FERC to maintain a better, more transparent schedule \nfor relicensing proceedings.\n  But the amendment before us today deletes section 306, the only hope \nfor real fundamental reform of an obviously flawed process.\n  It is important for the people of Washington State to get this right, \nand soon. We will have to relicense 19 hydropower projects over the \nnext several years. The resulting licenses will set the terms for hydro \nprojects to operate on our rivers for another 30 years. We need a \nprocess that will issue licenses promptly, with full environmental \nprotection, bringing these projects into compliance with modern laws. \nIt is disappointing that this amendment will not do the job.\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n  I reluctantly oppose the Craig amendment because I believe we are \nmissing an opportunity to accomplish real reform. But regardless where \nthe votes are on this amendment, this is not the end of the discussion \nabout hydropower licensing reform, but rather a beginning. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and those in \nindustry, the environmental community, tribes, States, and other \ninterests in order to maintain the tremendous hydropower assets of our \nState while protecting and restoring our environmental future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I want to say that a study \nshould ordinarily tell us something we don't know, bring us to \nconclusions that we have not yet reached, or provide facts that are not \notherwise evidence.\n  But there are no facts that are absent here. There are no conclusions \nthat we cannot draw on the basis of what we know, and there certainly \nisn't an experience yet to be determined. So a study is unnecessary. It \nis very clear, though, action is necessary.\n  Respectfully, I move to table the substitute second-degree amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

''\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I yield my time for commentary to \nthe Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no such right. The Senator \nfrom Idaho can seek recognition at any time.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we just took a very critical and, I \nbelieve, important vote in the Senate pertaining to the Nelson-Craig \namendment, and now second-degreed by the Senator from Oregon. While I \nknow the Senator from New Mexico and I have worked long and hard on the \nissue of hydro relicensing, I think the will of the Senate has spoken \nas it relates to moving this issue to the forefront and making a \nlegislative determination on what the public policy ought to be as it \nrelates to the relicensing of hydro facilities around this country.\n  We have now for well over a decade and a half spent a great deal of \ntime looking at the hydro relicensing process. Many of the licensees \nhave spent millions and millions of dollars trying to shape it and \ndetermine it. Study after study--and here are about 7 of them, some \n1,400 pages of studies over the last decade--have said there is a \nproblem that can only be determined by a legislative fix. That is \nexactly what the Nelson-Craig amendment, now second-degreed by the \nSenator from Oregon, does. It maintains the amendment, and the second \ndegree maintains the current standard in section 4(e).\n  The Secretary of the Interior can determine whether an alternative \ncondition offered by the licensee ensures the adequate protection and \nutilization of the ``Federal reservation.''\n  ``Federal reservation'' is a term of art in the Federal licensing of \nprojects as it relates to protecting the resources, protecting the \nland.\n  The reason this amendment is important is when we go to conference \nwith this bill, the House has said something very different. The House \nsaid, in their version of the hydroelectric relicense reform, that they \nwould change the standard in 4(e), requiring the Secretary of the \nInterior to ensure an alternative condition provides no less protection \nfor the reservation than provided by the conditions deemed initially \nnecessary by a midlevel staff person at the Interior. That is a higher \nthreshold than is currently required under licensing.\n  What is so important is that we take the right language to the \nconference to make sure if we advance or change the relicensing \nprojects of hydro--and the Senator from Nebraska has spoken eloquently \nabout the problems of Nebraska, the Senator from Oregon has talked \nabout the multitude of projects to be relicensed over the next decade; \nwe know that hydro is about 19 to 20 percent of the electrical base of \nthis country--while we want to modernize these facilities, bring them \ninto compliance under better environmental standards, what we cannot \nhave is a multi-multimillion-dollar process that doesn't get us \nanywhere and, in the end, actually reduces the ability of these \nfacilities to produce power.\n  The Senator from Nebraska spoke of a process in his State that cost \n$40 million to relicense a hydro project. My guess is that the project, \nwhen it was initially built some 30 years prior, cost a fourth of that \namount--$8 million, $10 million. And now just to relicense it, just to \ngo through the legal hoops and hurdles and timelines involved it costs \n$40 million? That doesn't talk about the retrofits. That doesn't talk \nabout new concrete poured or concrete taken away or fish ladders \nor rescheduling and reprogramming the flows of waters to accommodate \nfish and habitat downstream. None of that was spoken to--nor the loss \nof generating capacity. Just the process costs that amount of money.\n\n  That is why these studies have shown, time and time again, this is a \nproblem that has to get fixed legislatively. Yes, we have had working \ngroups inside the departments of our Federal Government over the last \nnumber of years.\n  When I first began to examine the hydro relicensing problem 5 years \nago, to the Clinton administration's credit, they began to get all \ntheir agencies together to try to streamline the process. That is in \nthe eye of the beholder, and they did work. But there was nothing in \nthe law that required it. What we were hoping to do is to do that.\n  What we have done instead as an alternative is provide, when the \nlicensee comes up with an approach, and a stakeholder comes up with an \ndifferent approach, that the licensee can say: We can arrive at the \nstandards and meet the needs of the stakeholder for less money in a \ndifferent approach, and the Secretary of the Interior, in this \ninstance, can arbitrate that and make those determinations they can now \nnot make.\n  It ensures a balance and accountability to Federal resource agencies \nthat I think is critically important. Isn't it fascinating that a third \nlevel bureaucrat can make a demand that even the Secretary cannot act \non, that may cost millions and millions of dollars? It may even take \ndown a hydro facility because it can no longer operate in an \neconomically effective way and the licensee would simply walk away and \nthe facility would come down and it would be no longer productive \nbecause someone downline in an agency determined they needed something \nthat could not in any way be arbitrated, that could not in any way be \naccommodated by different approaches, or an alternative review.\n  That is what we offer in the Nelson amendment. That is why it is \ncritical. The Smith amendment, then, gives a little flexibility in time \nthat we think is important. Trout Unlimited has said it is important.\n  We are certainly willing to accommodate this. This in no way is an \nanti-environmental vote. The process itself is still intact. All of the \nplayers get to the table. All of the players' viewpoints are heard.\n  We said, when the licensee comes forward and says I can meet those \nnew standards for less money in a different way, that is a \nconsideration which becomes part of the process that does not now \nexist. We think that is right. We think it is reasonable. That is the \nway government ought to work.\n  If we lose our hydro base in this country--and we could--how do we \nreplace it? Coal-fired plants? A new nuclear plant? It can never be \nmade up by wind and solar because it can never produce that amount of \npower. It would have to be replaced. It is replaced, at least in \nvolume, by the current alternatives I have mentioned. In most \ninstances, and in most States, those alternatives today are somewhat \nunacceptable.\n  That is why it is so critically important that the Nelson-Craig-Smith \namendment move forward as a part of this energy bill and into the \nconference where we can work out our differences and hopefully resolve \na problem that has plagued this process now since it was created nearly \ntwo decades ago.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I do not know anything about that, \nbut I do have some suggestions that I would like to give my friend, my \ncounterpart in the House, Representative DeLay, for a theme. That would \nbe Securing America's Future, the Republican Way.\n  We came up with what we think is a very apt way to describe what we \nare trying to do by securing America's future for all our families. I \nwould like to suggest this to Representative DeLay: The Real List of \nRepublican Slogans.\n  One would be securing a $254 million tax break for Enron; and \nsecuring secret Caribbean tax havens for billionaires.\n  Another that should go on the list would be securing skyrocketing \nprices and huge profit margins for large pharmaceutical companies.\n  The list wouldn't be complete unless we recognize that the \nprescription drug benefit being talked about is for 6 percent of \nAmerican seniors leaving out 94 percent of American seniors.\n  Also on the list we have securing limited well drilling rights in \nwildlife refuges and national parks.\n  Also on the list we have securing crowded classrooms and crumbling \nschools, and leaving those the way they are.\n  Part of the list also, I suggest to my friend, Representative DeLay, \nis securing higher levels of arsenic in drinking water, and, of course, \nsecuring permanent tax breaks for the wealthy paid for by raiding \nSocial Security, and also having deep Social Security benefit cuts.\n  Also on that list would have to be the Vice President's records of \ngiveaways to big energy companies.\n  Also, we could have on the list securing a future with 100,000 \nshipments of deadly radioactive waste crossing America's highways, \nrailways, and waterways.\n  Finally, I would make a suggestion--I have some others, but I know \ntime is short--that we have on that list securing the rights of toxic \npolluters to pass cleanup costs on to the taxpayers.\n  I ask that Representative DeLay and others in that press conference \nwith him to go back and look at his own list of slogans and add to that \nsome of these which I have noted.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Snowe \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Senator Collins of Maine joins me in offering this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the issue that is before us involves cogenerating \nfacilities which create both heat and power. They are highly efficient \nand environmentally attractive. They exist in almost all of our States. \nUnfortunately, section 244 of the Senate energy bill before us would \neliminate the provisions in current law which support both existing \ncombined heat and power generating systems and new ones that are being \ndeveloped. I believe that until competitive conditions in electricity \nmarkets make these existing requirements unnecessary, the changes that \nare incorporated in this bill are premature.\n  Today, combined heat and power plants, which typically produce \nelectricity and deliver steam used for manufacturing purposes, produce \nabout 7 percent of our Nation's electricity. Combined heat and power \nfacilities are, on average, twice as fuel efficient as conventional \nutility plants and thus produce about half the emissions of \nconventional utility plants.\n  The U.S. Department of Energy and our Environmental Protection Agency \nhave set the goal of doubling the Nation's capacity from combined heat \nand power facilities by 2010. Section 244 of the Senate energy bill \nruns counter to this goal by repealing, perhaps inadvertently, \nstatutory support for existing and new combined heat and power \ngenerating facilities.\n  Under existing law, section 210 of PURPA, the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act, has, since 1978, required electric utilities \nto purchase electricity generated by so-called qualifying facilities--\nwhich includes cogenerators and renewable energy facilities--at the \nutility's ``avoided cost.'' ``Avoided cost'' is the cost the utility \nwould have paid to generate the same electricity itself or to purchase \nit elsewhere. PURPA also requires electric utilities to sell qualifying \nfacilities backup power at just and reasonable rates and without \ndiscrimination.\n  So under current law, under PURPA, these qualifying facilities, \ncogenerating facilities, are permitted to sell\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\nthe power that they create at a price that is agreed to at the \nutility's avoided cost. Also, they have the ability to purchase \nelectricity power as it is needed at a reasonable rate and without \ndiscrimination. That is current law. They would lose that ability under \nthe language of the bill that is before us. We do not want them to lose \nthat ability.\n  Section 244 of the bill would terminate the obligation of electric \nutilities, under PURPA, to enter into new contracts to either purchase \nelectric energy from these qualifying facilities or to sell electricity \nto new qualifying facilities.\n  Some would argue that these PURPA requirements are no longer needed \nbecause electricity markets are competitive. In many cases, however, \nelectricity markets are not competitive. I realize in a number of \nmarkets they are. Delaware is among them. But in a number of other \nmarkets, electricity is not competitive, and these qualifying \nfacilities do not have access to competitive options for buying or \nselling electricity.\n  The existing PURPA protections should not be lifted, in my judgment, \nand that of Senator Collins' and our other cosponsors' judgment, until \ncompetitive electricity markets are found to render these protections \nno longer necessary.\n\n  The amendment that Senator Collins and I offer today would modify \nsection 244 of the bill before us by conditioning the termination of \nthe PURPA obligation for utilities to buy electricity from these \nqualifying facilities on a finding by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, that the qualifying facility has access to an \nindependent, competitive, wholesale market for the sale of electricity. \nA FERC finding of a competitive wholesale market assures that there \nwill be real opportunities for a qualifying facility to sell its \nelectrical output, including intermittent power, at a competitive \nprice.\n  This amendment would also modify section 244 in this bill to clarify \nthat the termination of a utility's obligation to sell backup power to \na qualifying facility under PURPA is conditioned on the qualifying \nfacility having the ability to purchase backup power from competing \nretail electricity suppliers. Until a cogenerator can shop for backup \npower from competing suppliers, it is critical to maintain the current \nPURPA obligation for the local utility to sell backup power at just and \nreasonable rates and without discrimination.\n  Let me say, in conclusion, I support reform of PURPA, but I do not \nthink we should do it in a way that runs contrary to our other goals of \ngenerating efficient electricity and developing competitive markets. \nThis amendment does just that. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupport of the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, in offering an \namendment to the energy bill that would keep in place, for a limited \ntime, incentives for the generation of clean, efficient energy using a \ntechnology known as combined heat and power, or cogeneration.\n  Such cogeneration plants use a variety of fuels, from biomass to \nnatural gas, to produce both electricity and steam. Combined heat and \npower currently produces about 9 percent of our Nation's electricity. \nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there are more \nthan 1,000 facilities operating combined heat and power units in the \nUnited States, including hospitals, universities, and industries. There \nare 95 cogeneration facilities in my home State of Maine alone.\n  By capturing the heat that would be rejected by traditional power \ngenerators, combined heat and power is extremely efficient. While a \ntypical coal-fired powerplant only achieves about 34 percent \nefficiency, cogeneration facilities achieve 70 to 85 percent \nefficiency. On average, combined heat and power facilities are twice as \nfuel efficient as conventional utility plants.\n  By keeping in place incentives for using combined heat and power, the \nCarper-Collins amendment adds to the competitiveness of our domestic \nmanufacturing. Because cogeneration is so efficient, it reduces cost. \nThe President's national energy policy makes clear that combined heat \nand power offers energy efficiency and cost savings important to many \nmanufacturers that compete in the international marketplace.\n\n  Our amendment also increases energy security and electric \nreliability. Dispersing power generation at manufacturing sites is an \nimportant tool to reduce the risk to the electricity supply. Generating \nelectricity close to where it will be used reduces the load on existing \ntransmission infrastructure. It reduces the amount of energy lost in \ntransmission while eliminating the need to construct expensive power \nlines to transmit power from large central station powerplants.\n  In addition, cogeneration reduces the U.S. dependency on foreign \nsources of energy by encouraging energy efficiency and fuel diversity \nin electric power generation.\n  Also, our amendment is good for the environment. Because combined \nheat and power facilities are twice as efficient as conventional \nplants, they have fewer emissions. They reduce emissions of the \nchemicals that cause smog and acid rain and cut greenhouse gas \nemissions in half. For this reason, cogeneration is an important \ncomponent of any plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is \nincluded in the President's climate initiative.\n  The U.S. Department of Energy and the EPA have set the goal of \ndoubling U.S. cogeneration capacity by 2010. At industrial facilities \nalone, cogeneration could reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 44 \nmillion metric tons. They could also reduce emissions of smog-forming \nnitrogen oxides by 614,000 tons per year.\n  Let me now add to the comments made by Senator Carper on why this \namendment is necessary. The Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act, known \nas PURPA, requires utilities to sell backup power to qualifying \nnonutility power facilities at just and reasonable rates. It also \nobligates utilities to purchase excess power from cogeneration \nfacilities at prices equal to that utility's own cost of production, \nknown as the avoided cost. The Senate energy bill, however, repeals \nPURPA. Repealing PURPA would be a good idea if competitive electricity \nmarkets existed all across this Nation. Unfortunately, the legislation \nbefore us repeals PURPA even if competitive markets are not achieved.\n  Our amendment would keep certain PURPA provisions in place until \ncompetitive electricity markets were established. For a limited time \nour amendment would keep in place the PURPA provisions requiring \nutilities to provide backup power and buy electricity from qualifying \ncogeneration facilities. As soon as competitive electricity markets \nwere established, these requirements would be repealed.\n  Without competition, there is no incentive for utilities to provide \nbackup power or purchase electricity from combined heat and power \nfacilities even though that electricity is cleaner and more efficient \nthan most other electricity generation. Until a combined cogeneration \nfacility can shop for backup power from competing suppliers and sell \npower at a competitive price, PURPA should not be unconditionally \nrepealed.\n  The amendment Senator Carper and I are offering today will keep in \nplace incentives that continue to operate combined heat and power \nfacilities until true competition exists in electricity markets.\n  This amendment is good for the economy, good for the environment, \ngood for our energy policy, and good for the competitiveness of \nAmerican manufacturing.\n\n  I thank my colleague from Delaware for involving me in this \namendment. I urge our colleagues to support our proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Alaska is \nplanning to come to the floor to speak against the amendment.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. For Members of the Senate, within the next 15 minutes there \nwill be a rollcall vote, so everybody who is off the Hill should start \nheading back. The vote will occur probably around 1:05.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the amendment pending, as I understand \nit, would extend PURPA's mandatory purchase obligation until such time \nas FERC determined that a PURPA ``qualifying facility'' had access to \n``independently administered, auction-based day ahead and real time \nwholesale markets for sale of electric energy.''\n  The amendment would also require purchasing utilities to continue to \nsell backup power to qualified facilities unless competing retail \nelectric suppliers were able to provide electric energy to the \nqualified facility.\n  This basically means that FERC is in charge of certain retail sales \nof electricity--preempting State public utility commissioners on backup \nretail sales, at least for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, \nwith all due respect, I believe the amendment is flawed. It would \ncontinue PURPA's mandatory purchase obligation indefinitely into the \nfuture by conditioning repeal on an affirmative FERC finding on a \npowerplant-by-powerplant basis that the statutory test is met.\n  There are no requirements in the amendment regarding the process or \ntiming for FERC action. Satisfying this test could take virtually \nforever, including numerous court challenges. Nor is there any guidance \nas to how FERC is to define the existence of an ``independently \nadministered, auction-based day ahead and real time wholesale market'' \nfor electricity.\n  I guess the question is, Who knows really what it means? It is not a \nterm of art in the Federal Power Act. Moreover, many areas of the \ncountry likely do not now meet--and may never meet--this test.\n  So I suggest that we not be fooled by claims that the only thing the \nqualifying facilities want is access to the transmission grid. They \nhave that now under FERC order No. 888. It is the law of the land, and \nit has been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n  What do the supporters of this amendment really want? In my opinion, \nthey really want to continue PURPA's mandatory purchases at above-\nmarket rates. Who pays the cost above market rates? Obviously, the \nconsumer--to have their power purchased at the ``avoided cost'' rate, \neven if that rate is far above the market rate.\n  Well, I think this is wrong policy. The language in the underlying \nDaschle-Bingaman bill leaves existing contracts in place; but there \nshould be no new PURPA contracts. I think most Members agree with that. \nSince its enactment--and we have had this debate previously on the \nbill--in 1978, PURPA has forced customers to pay lots of money. It is \nestimated that they have paid tens of billions of dollars more for \nelectricity than would have been the case had it not been enacted.\n  PURPA is incompatible with competitive wholesale markets. It has been \nused by the qualifying facilities that are cogenerators--producing both \npower and steam for industrial uses--in name only.\n  Further, the last three administrations have proposed the repeal of \nPURPA's mandatory purchase obligation, and almost every comprehensive \nelectric bill introduced over the past two Congresses has contained \nnearly identical language to the bipartisan consensus PURPA language \ncontained in the Daschle-Bingaman amendment.\n  Keeping PURPA is contrary to protecting consumers. Thus, in my \nopinion, the amendment should be rejected. I propose that we table the \namendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this time, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have no objection if Senator Carper \nwants to speak, even though the motion was made. I would certainly \ndefer to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kohl). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  With the combined heat and power facilities, we have the ability to \ngenerate energy almost twice as efficiently as we generate it from \ntraditional utilities, traditional generating plants. With combined \nheat and power facilities, we see emissions that are roughly half those \nof traditional powerplants.\n  The administration's national energy plan envisions a doubling and \nrelies on combined heat and power facilities in this country because \nthey are so energy efficient and also environmentally friendly.\n  The downside, unfortunately, is that, inadvertently, the language of \nthis bill before us takes away the ability for FERC to help ensure that \nthese combined heat and power facilities have the opportunity to sell \npower at reasonable prices into the grid and to buy power, if and when \nthey need to buy it, at reasonable prices.\n  I think all of us would agree that to have the ability to create more \nfacilities that are twice as energy efficient as traditional generating \nfacilities and produce half the emissions is a good thing. That is why \nthe administration has offered doubling these facilities in their plan.\n  Unfortunately, if we leave the language as it is in the bill, we are \ngoing to find that the potential that is embodied in the generating \ncapability of the combined heat and power facilities will not be \nrealized. Nobody is interested in utilities having to sell electricity \nat rates that are above market. We want to simply make sure that a \ncombined heat and power facility, which is twice as energy efficient, \nand twice as environmentally friendly, has the opportunity to expand. \nThat is what we seek to do here.\n  With that in mind, I ask our colleagues to oppose the motion to \ntable.\n  Again, I express my thanks to the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, \nfor joining me and a number of colleagues in offering this amendment \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n3197.

In \n     securing such services, any grant, contract, cooperative \n     agreement, or other arrangement authorized by law and already \n     available to the Secretary or the member of the Interagency \n     Task Force securing such services may be used.\n       (d) Transferability of Prior Reports.--Emissions reports \n     and reductions that have been made by a person or entity \n     pursuant to section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 \n     (42 U.S.C. 13385(b)) or under other Federal or State \n     voluntary greenhouse gas reduction programs may be \n     independently verified and registered with the registry using \n     the same guidelines developed by the Secretary pursuant to \n     this section.\n       (e) Public Comment.--The Secretary shall make such \n     guidelines available in draft form for public notice and \n     opportunity for comment for a period of at least 90 days, and \n     thereafter shall adopt them for use in implementation of the \n     registry established pursuant to this title.\n       (f) Review and Revision.--The Secretary, through the \n     Interagency Task Force, shall periodically thereafter review \n     the guidelines and, as needed, revise them in the same manner \n     as provided for in this section.\n\n     SEC. 1106. VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In furtherance of the purposes of this \n     title, any person or entity, and the Secretary, may \n     voluntarily enter into an agreement to provide that--\n       (1) such person or entity (and successors thereto) shall \n     report annually to the registry on emissions and sources of \n     greenhouse gases from applicable facilities and operations \n     which generate net emissions above any de minimis thresholds \n     specified in the guidelines issued by the Secretary pursuant \n     to this title;\n       (2) such person or entity (and successors thereto) shall \n     commit to report and participate in the registry for a period \n     of at least 5 calendar years, provided that such agreements \n     may be renewed by mutual consent;\n       (3) for purposes of measuring performance under the \n     agreement, such person or entity (and successors thereto) \n     shall determine, by mutual agreement with the Secretary--\n       (A) pursuant to the guidelines issued under this title, a \n     baseline emissions level for a representative period \n     preceding the effective date of the agreement; and\n       (B) emissions reduction goals, taking into consideration \n     the baseline emissions level determined under subparagraph \n     (A) and any relevant economic and operational factors that \n     may affect such baseline emissions level over the duration of \n     the agreement; and\n       (4) for certified emissions reductions made relative to the \n     baseline emissions level, the Secretary shall provide, at the \n     request of the person or entity, transferable credits (with \n     unique assigned serial numbers) to the person or entity \n     which, inter alia--\n       (A) can be used by such person or entity towards meeting \n     emissions reductions goals set forth under the agreement;\n       (B) can be transferred to other parties or entities through \n     a voluntary private transaction between persons or entities; \n     or\n       (C) shall be applicable towards any incentive, market-\n     based, or regulatory programs determined by the Congress in a \n     future enactment to be necessary and feasible to reduce the \n     risk of climate change and its impacts.\n       (b) Public Notice and Comment.--At least 30 days before any \n     agreement is final, the Secretary shall give notice thereof \n     in the Federal Register and provide an opportunity for public \n     written comment. After reviewing such comments, the Secretary \n     may withdraw the agreement or the parties thereto may \n     mutually agree to revise it to finalize it without \n     substantive change. Such agreement shall be retained in the \n     national registry and be available to the public.\n       (c) Emissions in Excess.--In the event that a person or \n     entity fails to certify that emissions from applicable \n     facilities are less than the emissions reduction goals \n     contained in the agreement, such person or entity shall take \n     actions as necessary to reduce such excess emissions, \n     including--\n       (1) redemption of transferable credits acquired in previous \n     years if owned by the person or entity;\n       (2) acquisition of transferable credits from other persons \n     or entities participating in the registry through their own \n     agreements; or\n       (3) the undertaking of additional emissions reductions \n     activities in subsequent years as may be determined by \n     agreement with the Secretary.\n       (d) No New Authority.--This section shall not be construed \n     as providing any regulatory or mandate authority regarding \n     reporting of such emissions or reductions.\n\n     SEC. 1107. MEASUREMENT AND VERIFICATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce, through the \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology and in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall develop and \n     propose standards and practices for accurate measurement and \n     verification of greenhouse gas emissions and emissions \n     reductions. Such standards and best practices shall address \n     the need for--\n       (1) standardized measurement and verification practices for \n     reports made by all persons or entities participating in the \n     registry, taking into account--\n       (A) existing protocols and standards already in use by \n     persons or entities desiring to participate in the registry;\n       (B) boundary issues such as leakage and shifted \n     utilization;\n       (C) avoidance of double-counting of greenhouse gas \n     emissions and emissions reductions; and\n       (D) such other factors as the panel determines to be \n     appropriate;\n       (2) measurement and verification of actions taken to \n     reduce, avoid or sequester greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (3) in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, \n     measurement of the results of the use of carbon sequestration \n     and carbon recapture technologies, including--\n       (A) organic soil carbon sequestration practices;\n       (B) forest preservation and re-forestration activities \n     which adequately address the issues of permanence, leakage \n     and verification; and\n       (4) such other measurement and verification standards as \n     the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, and \n     the Secretary of Energy shall determine to be appropriate.\n       (b) Public Comment.--The Secretary of Commerce shall make \n     such standards and practices available in draft form for \n     public notice and opportunity for comment for a period of at \n     least 90 days, and thereafter shall adopt them, in \n     coordination with the Secretary of Energy, for use in the \n     guidelines for implementation of the registry as issued \n     pursuant to this title.\n\n     SEC. 1108. CERTIFIED INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES.\n\n       (a) Certification.--The Secretary of Commerce shall, \n     through the Director of the National Institute of Standards \n     and Technology and the Administrator, develop standards for \n     certification of independent persons to act as certified \n     parties to be employed in verifying the accuracy and \n     reliability of reports made under this title, including \n     standards that--\n       (1) prohibit a certified party from themselves \n     participating in the registry through the ownership or \n     transaction of transferable credits recorded in the registry;\n       (2) prohibit the receipt by a certified party of \n     compensation in the form of a commission where such party \n     receives payment based on the amount of emissions reductions \n     verified; and\n       (3) authorize such certified parties to enter into \n     agreements with persons engaged in trading of transferable \n     credits recorded in the registry.\n       (b) List of Certified Parties.--The Secretary shall \n     maintain and make available to persons or entities making \n     reports under this title and to the public upon request a \n     list of such certified parties and their clients making \n     reports under this title.\n\n     SEC. 1109. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after guidelines are issued for the \n     registry pursuant to this title, and biennially thereafter, \n     the President, through the Interagency Task Force, shall \n     report to the Congress on the status of the registry \n     established by this title. The report shall include--\n       (a) an assessment of the level of participation in the \n     registry (both by sector and in terms of national emissions \n     represented);\n       (b) effectiveness of voluntary reporting agreements in \n     enhancing participation in the registry;\n       (c) use of the registry for emissions trading and other \n     purposes;\n       (d) assessment of progress towards individual and national \n     emissions reduction goals; and\n       (e) an inventory of administrative actions taken or planned \n     to improve the national registry or the guidelines, or both, \n     and such recommendations for legislative changes to this \n     title or section 1605 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 \n     U.S.C. 13385) as the President believes necessary to better \n     carry out the purposes of this title.\n\n     SEC. 1110. REVIEW OF PARTICIPATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 5 years after the date of \n     enactment of this title, the Director of the Office of \n     National Climate Change Policy shall determine whether the \n     reports submitted to the registry represent less than 60 \n     percent of the national aggregate greenhouse gas emissions as \n     inventoried\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\n     in the official U.S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions \n     and Sinks published by the Environmental Protection Agency \n     for the previous calendar year.\n       (b) Mandatory Reporting.--If the Director of the Office of \n     National Climate Change Policy determines under subsection \n     (a) that less than 60 percent of such aggregate greenhouse \n     gas emissions are being reported to the registry--\n       (1) all persons or entities, regardless of their \n     participation in the registry, shall submit to the Secretary \n     a report that describes, for the preceding calendar year, a \n     complete inventory of greenhouse gas emissions (as reported \n     at the facility level), including--\n       (A) the total quantity of each greenhouse gas emitted by \n     such person or entity, expressed in terms of mass and in \n     terms of the quantity of carbon dioxide equivalent;\n       (B) an estimate of the emissions from products manufactured \n     and sold by such person or entity in the previous calendar \n     year, determined over the average lifetime of those products; \n     and\n       (C) such other categories of emissions as the Secretary \n     determines by regulation to be practicable and useful for the \n     purposes of this title, such as--\n       (i) direct emissions from stationary sources;\n       (ii) indirect emissions from imported electricity, heat, \n     and steam;\n       (iii) process and fugitive emissions; and\n       (iv) production or importation of greenhouse gases; and\n       (2) each person or entity shall submit a report described \n     in this section--\n       (A) not later than the earlier of--\n       (i) April 30 of the calendar year immediately following the \n     year in which the Director of the Office of National Climate \n     Change Policy makes the determination under subsection (a); \n     or\n       (ii) the date that is 1 year after the date on which the \n     Director of the Office of National Climate Change Policy \n     makes the determination under subsection (a); and\n       (B) annually thereafter.\n       (c) Exemptions From Reporting.--\n       (1) In general.--A person or entity shall be required to \n     submit reports under subsection (b) only if, in any calendar \n     year after the date of enactment of this title--\n       (A) the total greenhouse gas emissions of at least 1 \n     facility owned by the person or entity exceeds 10,000 metric \n     tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas (or such \n     greater quantity as may be established by a designated agency \n     by regulation);\n       (B) the total quantity of greenhouse gas produced, \n     distributed, or imported by the person or entity exceeds \n     10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse \n     gas (or such greater quantity as may be established by a \n     designated agency by regulation); or\n       (C) the person or entity is not a feedlot or other farming \n     operation (as defined in section 101 of title 11, United \n     States Code).\n       (2) Entities already reporting.--A person or entity that, \n     as of the date of enactment of this title, is required to \n     report carbon dioxide emissions data to a Federal agency \n     shall not be required to report that data again for the \n     purposes of this title. Such emissions data shall be \n     considered to be reported by the entity to the registry for \n     the purpose of this title and included in the determination \n     of the Director of the Office of National Climate Change \n     Policy made under subsection (a).\n       (d) Enforcement.--If a person or entity that is required to \n     report greenhouse gas emissions under this section fails to \n     comply with that requirement, the Attorney General may, at \n     the request of the Secretary, bring a civil action in United \n     States district court against the person or entity to impose \n     on the person or entity a civil penalty of not more than \n     $25,000 for each day for which the entity fails to comply \n     with that requirement.\n       (e) Resolution of Disapproval.--If made, the determination \n     of the Director of the Office of National Climate Change \n     Policy made under subsection (a) shall be considered to be a \n     major rule (as defined in section 804(2) of title 5, United \n     States Code) subject to the congressional disapproval \n     procedure under section 802 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 1111. NATIONAL ACADEMY REVIEW.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after guidelines are issued for the \n     registry pursuant to this title, the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Interagency Task Force, shall enter \n     into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to \n     review the scientific and technological methods, assumptions, \n     and standards used by the Secretary and the Secretary of \n     Commerce for such guidelines and report to the President and \n     the Congress on the results of that review, together with \n     such recommendations as may be appropriate, within 6 months \n     after the effective date of that agreement.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for a period of up to 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dayton are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time that was \nused by the Senator from Minnesota be counted against the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3256 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 3256 be \nconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself, Mr. \n     Breaux, and Mr. Miller, proposes an amendment numbered 3256.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in Title II, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Not withstanding any other provision in this Act, \n     ``3 cents'' shall be considered by law to be ``1.5 cents'' in \n     any place ``3 cents'' appears in Title II of this Act.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. The amendment I called up, sponsored by Senator Breaux, \nSenator Miller, Senator Voinovich, and myself, will reduce the penalty \nif a utility doesn't achieve the renewable standard that is set in the \nlegislation.\n  The legislation says that 10 percent of the electricity produced has \nto be from renewable sources. Renewable sources are defined as wind and \nsolar, biomass--interestingly enough, not hydro. That is a very \ndifficult standard to achieve. I am not sure any State can achieve it \nnow or any State will be able to achieve it in the future. We will have \nto see.\n  Varying States have different renewable standards. I am all in favor \nof that, whatever States want to decide. We are getting ready to have a \nFederal mandate that says: 10 percent of your power has to be from \nrenewable sources. Most people think renewables is nonfossil fuel, but \nthat is not the case here. We are talking about primarily wind, solar, \nand biomass. Nuclear fuel is not included. Hydro, or at least old \nhydro, is not included. But if you don't achieve that 10 percent \nstandard, there is a penalty.\n  How do you get to the 10 percent? Let's say you do everything you \ncan, but primarily most of the production in your State is fossil fuel. \nYou run off coal or natural gas generators. And if you are short of the \n10 percent, what do you do? Under the bill, you can buy it from other \nutilities, if they have surplus credits, or you can pay the Federal \nGovernment. You can pay the Government for the credits. You could call \nthem credits. You could call them a tax. You could call them a penalty. \nBut you have to pay, if you don't meet this 10 percent standard. \nActually, the standard starts at 1 percent and it is phased up to 10 \npercent in the year 2019.\n  If you don't make the standard, you have to pay something. It is a \ntax. Your utility has to write a check to the Federal Government, a \nlarge check. In many cases, it could be hundreds of millions of \ndollars. In many cases, the cost to the utilities--and I will enter \ninto the Record some statements from different utilities--could be \nbillions of dollars, because they have to pay 3 cents per kilowatt hour \nfor whatever they are short of this target we are getting ready to \nmandate.\n  How much is 3 cents per kilowatt hour? Most of us don't know. When we \npay our utility bill, we don't know how much utilities really cost. The \nwholesale price of electricity right now, nationwide, is about 3 cents. \nIf you don't meet the target, basically you have to\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\npay 100 percent of whatever you are short on renewables in electricity \ncost. That is a lot, for 10 percent of your power.\n  If you produce no electricity from the renewables, this bill is the \nequivalent of a 5-percent surcharge because you are paying in effect a \n100-percent increase for that last 10 percent. If you average that over \nyour entire cost, it is about a 5-percent increase in your utility \nbill.\n  I will tell you, few if any utilities will meet this standard in this \nbill, even those utilities that are very progressive and aggressive in \ntrying to meet renewable standards and have renewable energy sources \nsuch as wind, solar, and biomass. Few are able to meet this standard \nthat is in this bill. So you are going to have to buy these credits and \npay a lot of money.\n  The essence of this amendment is, let's reduce that 3-cent penalty to \na penny and a half. You might say, where did you get the penny and a \nhalf? It happens to be half of what is in the underlying bill, and it \nalso happens to be half of what the Clinton administration proposed.\n  President Clinton, in 1999, proposed that we have a renewable \nstandard. Incidentally, he didn't go up to 10 percent; he only went to \n7.5 percent of your electricity would have to be renewable. He also \nsaid: If you don't meet that objective, the penalty will be a penny and \na half. That is the cost of the credits.\n  Secretary Bill Richardson--many of us got to know him over the years \nand enjoyed working with him in Congress--when he was Secretary of \nEnergy, that was the penalty, a penny and a half, not 3 cents.\n  So the amendment Senator Breaux, Senator Miller, Senator Voinovich, \nand I have is to reduce the penalty from 3 cents to a penny and a half. \nThat sounds as if we are talking about pennies. We are talking about \nbillions of dollars, because we are talking about, 10 percent of all \nthe electricity that is produced in the United States must come from \nrenewables, and if you don't make it, you have to pay this 3 cents per \nkilowatt hour.\n  What does that mean? I will cite a couple of letters. I have them \nfrom different companies and different States.\n  I will start with my State. Oklahoma Gas and Electric said the \npenalty under the bill, as written right now--their estimate is it \nwould cost $794 million through the year 2020. We would cut that in \nhalf. We have almost every utility in the country supporting of this \namendment. This is a rather large utility called Southern Company. I \nmentioned the largest one in my State, Oklahoma Gas and Electric. \nSouthern Company, which is in several Southern States, said it would \ncost them from $676 million to $1.014 billion annually by the year \n2020.\n  I hope my colleagues understand this. I have a letter I will also \nhave printed in the Record from the president of Southern Company, one \nof the largest utilities in America that says the total cost across \nseveral states could be over a billion dollars--from $676 million up to \nover a billion dollars a year--if the 3-cent penalty stays in the bill. \nWe would cut that in half under our amendment.\n  I could go on and on. Is it going to cost the utilities ultimately? \nProbably not. They are going to pass it, if they can; and I expect that \nthey can. Residential consumers and industrial consumers will pay for \nit. Frankly, if industrial consumers are paying for it, they are going \nto pass that on, too.\n  If you want to set about an inflationary spiral, we are doing that. \nWe are increasing utility costs if we allow the Daschle-Bingaman 3-cent \npenalty per kilowatt hour to stay in the bill. I think it should be \nzero. Senator Kyl had an amendment to strike out the renewable section, \nbut I am coming up with half a loaf. I am saying cut it in half. I am a \nlegislator. If we can pass a bill half as damaging, I am willing to do \nit. If we can reduce the numbers by half, I think we will have made a \nbig step in the right direction. Why in the world would we have a cap \nor a penalty higher than the Clinton administration proposed?\n  Incidentally, it didn't pass. Some people said we should not pass it \nbecause it costs too much.\n  Look at some of the other States that are involved. Kansas City Power \nand Light said it would cost over $300 million, and that is the current \ncap. We would cut that in half.\n  Different companies have used different ways of stating the costs. \nPinnacle West in Arizona talks about it costing billions of dollars to \ncomply. They even said it may have a residential rate increase of 28 \npercent.\n  In Pennsylvania, PP, which has facilities in Pennsylvania and \nMontana, estimates penalties at $178 million per year in 2006, growing \nto $260 million by 2020. The reason they start out low is the renewable \nsection starts out low, at 1 percent, but it grows every year, up to \nthe very expensive 10 percent by 2019.\n  Let me mention a couple letters, which I will enter into the Record, \nso that this won't just be little excerpts from my floor speech. This \nis a note from Allegany Energy. It says:\n\n       The rates under the restructuring initiative to lower \n     consumer costs may restrict Allegany Energy, a conservative--\n     1 percent requirement would cost $13 million annually, and a \n     10 percent requirement would cost $135 million annually, \n     assuming no growth in customer electricity consumption.\n\n  I think most people would assume the consumption would go up over \nthat period of time. That is a very conservative estimate.\n  Exelon: I will read various segments of this:\n\n       Meeting the Bingaman RPS amendment will cost our customers \n     between $2.3 billion and $4.6 billion more than they would \n     otherwise pay for electricity between 2005 and 2020.\n\n  I hope my colleagues have a chance to absorb some of these numbers. \nThis is a very large utility, and they are primarily in Illinois and \nPennsylvania. They said it could cost $4.6 billion if we don't change \nthe Bingaman amendment. Our amendment says we will cut it in half. I \nhope the Senators from Pennsylvania, the Senators from Illinois, and \nothers will stop and say, wait a minute, who pays for that? Are we \nreally passing something where we know what we are doing? Are we going \nto mandate those cost increases on consumers?\n  Wait a minute, we are giving people a chance to cut it in half. That \nis what this amendment does. Listen to this comment made from Bill \nRichardson before a House committee in June 17 of 1999:\n\n       To hold program costs down, the administration's proposal \n     would allow electricity sellers to purchase credits from the \n     Department of Energy at a cost of 1.5 cents per kilowatt \n     hour. As a result, sellers would not be forced to pay \n     excessive amounts for credits that are sold by other \n     electricity providers that exceed the 7.5 percent RPS \n     requirement.\n\n  This bill has a 10-percent requirement, and if you don't meet it, it \nsays you have to pay 3 cents per kilowatt hour. As I have mentioned by \na few examples, the cost is absolutely enormous.\n  I want to mention a couple others. This is a the Public Service \nCommission for the State of Florida:\n\n       However, in order to mitigate the ``tax impact'' of this \n     poorly conceived national program, we support the Nickles \n     amendment to lower the amount of penalty from 3 cents to 1.5 \n     cents per KWH. This would reduce the potential cost of this \n     federal mandate on Florida ratepayers.\n\n  That is a copy of a letter to Senator Gramm.\n  This is a note from American Electric Power. It says:\n\n       AEP is joining in this effort with Allegany Energy, Console \n     Energy, Peabody Energy, and the U.S. Mineworkers of America. \n     AEP and Allegany are the two largest utilities in West \n     Virginia and are responsible for all the electricity \n     distributed in the State.\n\n  I will enter into the Record a letter from Southern Company. This is \nsigned by Allen Franklin, chairman and president and CEO:\n\n       The cumulative cost of the RPS mandate to Southern Company \n     through the year 2020 will be from $3 billion to $6.5 \n     billion. This does not include substantial transmission and \n     interconnection costs for remote wind turbines located in the \n     upper Midwest. . . .\n\n  I will enter this into the Record. That is a major company, covering \nseveral States, saying this will cost billions of dollars over the next \n15 years. I just tell my colleagues that when we talk about a penalty \nof a penny and a half and 3 cents per kilowatt, that doesn't sound like \nmuch. When you multiply it times all the electricity and mandate that \n10 percent of the electricity meet the standard and, if it doesn't, \nthey have to pay this 3 cents--basically a 100-percent tax on \nelectricity, equal to the value of 100 percent of wholesale cost of \nelectricity--\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\nyou are talking about an enormous utility increase. We have a chance to \nmitigate that; we have a chance to reduce it by basically agreeing to \nthe same standard that was proposed by the Clinton administration in \n1999. I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letters to which I referred \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Southern Company,\n\n                                 Atlanta, Georgia, April 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: As the Senate continues its \n     consideration of S. 517, the Daschle/Bingaman energy bill, I \n     wanted to thank you for your continued efforts to improve the \n     Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) mandate in the bill. This \n     ill-advised policy will mandate the use of un-economic \n     generation and is not practical in several regions of the \n     nation.\n       In many parts of the country, the RPS mandate can not be \n     achieved due to the lack of wind resources and the \n     intermittent nature of solar energy. The requirement to \n     purchase penalty credits under such circumstances equates to \n     a tax on consumers in those regions with no resulting benefit \n     for those same consumers. The cumulative cost of the RPS \n     mandate to Southern Company through the year 2020 will be \n     from 3 billion dollars to 6.5 billion dollars. This does NOT \n     include substantial transmission and interconnection costs \n     for remote wind turbines located in the upper Midwest, which \n     is the likely location for such an option. Obviously these \n     dramatic costs would increase the price of electricity to our \n     customers and threaten their lifestyles and the economic \n     health of their communities.\n       One way to reduce these costs would be to lower the 3-cents \n     per kilowatt-hour penalty contained in the Bingaman RPS \n     language. This penalty is double the 1.5-cents per kilowatt-\n     hour renewable credit cost in a renewable portfolio standard \n     proposed by the Clinton Administration. I understand you \n     intend to offer an amendment to lower the RPS penalty to 1.5-\n     cents per kilowatt-hour, and we will support you in that \n     regard. This will not remove the negative impacts on our \n     customers of an ill-advised RPS mandate, but it will at least \n     lessen those costs significantly.\n       We appreciate your continued efforts to improve energy \n     legislation as it moves through Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     Allen Franklin\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             OGE Energy Corp.,\n\n                                Oklahoma City, OK, April 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Blanche L. Lincoln,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: On behalf of Oklahoma Gas & Electric \n     (OG) I strongly urge your support of an amendment to be \n     offered by Senator Don Nickles to reduce by half the cost to \n     Arkansas consumers of the mandatory Renewable Portfolio \n     Standard provision in the pending energy bill, S. 517. The \n     Nickles amendment would reduce the cost of the renewable \n     energy credit from 3 cents per kilowatt-hour to 1.5 cents per \n     kw/hour.\n       Based on the year 2001 actual total retail sales and full \n     implementation of the 10% RPS requirement, we calculate that \n     it would cost our customers an additional $73 million per \n     year, suggesting an increase of 5% in our retail rates. OG \n     opposes such federal mandate on investor-owned utilities \n     since it will skew the competitive playing field toward \n     cooperatives and public power that have been unfairly \n     exempted from the federal RPS mandate. The exemption of the \n     coops and public power utilities is equivalent to a 5% \n     penalty for our Company and a 5% windfall for coops and \n     public power. Although we are opposed to renewable mandates, \n     OG is willing to purchase power generated by renewable \n     sources if customers desire to purchase it. But thus far, our \n     customers in Arkansas and Oklahoma have not evidenced a \n     willingness to purchase higher priced renewable power to \n     justify our investment in these sources. Instead, our \n     customers clearly prefer the highly reliable and much less \n     expensive range of generation options that we currently \n     offer. The RPS provision in the energy bill will force our \n     Arkansas customers to pay more for a renewable product they \n     do not yet want enough to pay for. In so doing, the RPS will \n     raise costs to residential and business customers without \n     countervailing benefit either to them or to the Fort Smith \n     regional economy.\n       Senator Nickles' amendment would at least reduce the \n     economic impact of the RPS provision by half. It makes real \n     sense to me. I hope you will support Senator Nickles' effort. \n     If you have any questions, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Steven E. Moore,\n\n                                     Chairman, President and Chief\n     Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                         Progress Energy Service Company, LLC,\n\n                                      Raleigh, NC, April 22, 2002.\n     Senator Don Nickles,\n     Senate Hart Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: As the Senate continues debate on the \n     energy bill (S. 517), I must share with you my company's \n     strong conviction that this legislation is poor energy policy \n     for our customers and the country. The bill represents an \n     enormous policy reversal that gives important state \n     jurisdiction directly to the federal government.\n       Progress Energy was formed in 2000 when Carolina Power & \n     Light merged with Florida Progress. Through two subsidiaries, \n     the company provides electricity to nearly three [2.8] \n     million customers in the Carolinas and Florida by employing a \n     diverse generation portfolio of more than 20,000 megawatts. \n     Our service territory has enjoyed substantial growth based, \n     in part, on our ability to produce reliable low-cost energy. \n     We use the market to select the best fuel mix for energy \n     production, a process that is grossly jeopardized by the \n     mandated renewable portfolio standards (RPS).\n       Under the RPS cap of 3 c/kWh, between 2005 and 2020, \n     Progress Energy's customers would be forced to absorb $3.5 \n     billion in extra costs. This RPS mandate would eventually \n     sidetrack economic growth. Additionally, the RPS could limit \n     the benefits of emissions-free energy our customers currently \n     enjoy since we use a large percentage of electricity \n     generated with nuclear and hydropower.\n       Thank you for your interest and concern regarding the RPS \n     amendment and please know that we would be very supportive of \n     any relief you could give on this mandate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David G. Roberts,\n     Director Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 State of Florida,\n\n\n                                    Public Service Commission,\n\n                                  Tallahassee, FL, April 22, 2002.\n     RE: S. 517, the Energy Bill\n\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The Florida Public Service Commission \n     (FPSC) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on \n     three areas of amendments to S. 517, the energy bill. These \n     areas are: (1) The Renewable Portfolio Standards; (2) the \n     Landrieu amendment on participant-funded transmission \n     expansion; and (3) the amendments referred to as the consumer \n     protection package.\n\n\n   (1) nickles amendment to the renewable portfolio standards section\n\n       The FPSC continues to oppose the Federal Renewable \n     Portfolio Standards. Florida utilities will have difficulty \n     meeting the federal standards. We believe that state \n     legislatures are best suited to set policies on renewable \n     standards for their state. In fact, during the current \n     legislative session, the Florida legislature directed the \n     FPSC to complete a study on renewables by February 2003. A \n     strict one-size-fits-all standard could put companies in the \n     position of having to purchase credits from elsewhere or of \n     being in noncompliance. The impact will ultimately be on the \n     retail ratepayer. Again, we oppose the Federal Renewable \n     Portfolio Standard. However, in order to mitigate the ``tax \n     impact'' of this poorly-conceived national program, we \n     support the Nickles amendment to lower the amount of the \n     penalty from 3 cents to 1.5 cents per KWH. This would reduce \n     the potential cost of this federal mandate on Florida \n     ratepayers.\n\n\n(2) landrieu amendment on ``participant-funded transmission expansion''\n\n       We believe this amendment to place the costs of \n     transmission expansion on the cost causer has merit, but we \n     do have some concerns about the provisions included in the \n     amendment. For example, there is a provision on market \n     monitoring that possibly could be interpreted to view the \n     Regional Transmission Organization as the primary market \n     monitor. Surely, that is not the intention of the amendment. \n     Moreover, the FPSC has initiated its own RTO proceeding to \n     address a Florida-specific RTO. That proceeding may also \n     address the entity appropriate to cover market monitoring. \n     The language within that provision is positive regarding the \n     RTO publicizing: (1) Projects that increase capacity or \n     transfer capability of the transmission system, and (2) the \n     tradeable transmission rights and costs associated with the \n     project. Thus, perhaps the section could be revised to \n     address only the ``RTO Publication of Information'' instead \n     of ``Market Monitoring,'' or the section could be deleted. \n     Thus, we believe the amendment has merit, but should be \n     revised.\n\n\n                    (3) consumer protection package\n\n       In general, the amendments, referred to as ``the Consumer \n     Protection Package'' look superior to the language in S. 517, \n     as amended by Senator Thomas. They create a standard on \n     proposed mergers that they must ``advance the public \n     interest'' which is a higher standard than ``consistent with \n     the public interest.'' Also, the package expands the list of \n     factors to be considered by FERC in reviewing mergers.\n       In addition, the amendments require public disclosure of \n     transactions, and establish clear standards on affiliate \n     transactions. Also, there would be access to utility holding \n     company books and records. We see benefit to these \n     provisions, and they are consistent with this Commission's \n     Bedrock Principles on National Energy Policy.\n       We do want to raise a concern, however, that States not be \n     preempted. In particular, there is the provision on market \n     based rates which directs FERC to remedy market flaws\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\n     and abuses. To the extent that one of those remedies might be \n     to require divestiture of a utility's assets, we believe the \n     FERC should be required to consult with those state \n     commissions that have statutory authority prior to ordering \n     such a remedy. Thus, in general we commend the ``consumer \n     protection'' package of amendments, but urge that any \n     potentially preemptive language be closely scrutinized.\n       We appreciate your staff staying in close contact with FPSC \n     staff, and hope this information is useful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lila A. Jaber,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Great Plains Energy,\n\n                                  Kansas City, MO, April 17, 2001.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: On behalf of the employees of Great \n     Plains Energy, including our regulated subsidiary Kansas City \n     Power & Light, I am writing to express my appreciation for \n     your leadership and support on an issue of great concern.\n       During the Senate's recent consideration of S. 517, the \n     energy bill, you spoke about the adverse effect a renewable \n     portfolio standard (RPS) would have on utilities and cited \n     information from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) \n     that the cost of purchasing credits in lieu of complying with \n     a renewable mandate would cost KCPL $16 million--in your \n     words, ``a pretty good hit.''\n       Unfortunately, EIA grossly understated the costs of a 10 \n     percent mandate to KCPL, and ``the hit'' is much worse than \n     that. We project the total costs of purchasing the credit to \n     be more than $300 million over the 15-year period between \n     2005 and 2020, when the RPS would ramp up to the full 10 \n     percent. For a company of our size, these costs are \n     intolerable.\n       While we appreciate the need to diversify our energy mix, \n     doing so by imposing a federal mandate that ignores the \n     availability and cost-effectiveness of renewable resources is \n     not sound public policy. In our area, wind energy, for \n     example, certainly would not be competitive with fuels such \n     as coal, oil, natural gas, or nuclear. That is why we \n     strongly support your efforts to amend the RPS by reducing \n     the credit cost from $0.03 per kWh to $0.015 per kWh. Even \n     with the credit cut in half, we would still be saddled with \n     extraordinary costs.\n       We pride ourselves on providing reliable and affordable \n     electric service, yet the hidden tax imposed by the RPS may \n     be felt by many who can ill afford higher electricity prices.\n       We appreciate your efforts to reduce the burden of the \n     renewable energy mandate, and offer our assistance to enact a \n     more reasonable approach.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     Bernie Beaudoin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            American Corn Growers Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2002.\n     Hon. John B. Breaux,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Breaux: I am writing to urge your support for \n     the amendment that Senator Nickles plans to offer to the \n     renewable portfolio standard of the energy bill, S. 517. Wind \n     energy is fast becoming a major new ``crop'' for the farming \n     and ranching community in many areas of the nation. The \n     American Corn Growers Association (ACGA), has developed its \n     Wealth From the Wind Program for farmers, and has strongly \n     supported wind energy tax credits in the Energy Bill as well \n     as other favorable legislative initiatives in the Energy \n     Title of the Farm Bill. ACGA also supports a fair and \n     equitable renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requiring a \n     portion of the nation's energy to come from renewable \n     sources. However, while we want to do everything we can to \n     promote renewable production by farmers we must oppose undue \n     mandates that will impose additional fuel costs on all rural \n     consumers.\n       Senator Nickles' amendment will significantly reduce the \n     cost of complying with the standard, and in turn protect \n     rural America from excessive price increases for electricity, \n     by cutting the energy credits from 3 cents per kilowatt-hour \n     to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n       As you know fuel prices have fluctuated wildly over the \n     last two years and some regions have seen shortages of \n     electricity. With the price of gasoline and diesel rising \n     steadily now is not the time to add to these uncertainties.\n       We urge you to support the amendment offered by Senator \n     Nickles.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Mitchell,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n         MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company,\n                                   Omaha Nebraska, April 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Republican Leader, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: Thank you for your continued support \n     of the inclusion of electricity modernization provisions in \n     the Senate energy bill. The bipartisan vote yesterday by the \n     Senate to maintain the bill's electricity title was a great \n     step forward.\n       With regard to your concerns about the renewable portfolio \n     standard (RPS) in the Daschle/Bingaman energy bill, \n     MidAmerican Energy Company has analyzed this proposal and \n     developed estimates of the increase in costs that will result \n     from enactment of the RPS. According to our preliminary \n     calculations, implementing the RPS in S. 517 will begin \n     increasing electricity costs for MidAmerican's regulated and \n     competitive customers in 2007 by almost $600,000, with costs \n     rising to more than $40 million in 2019.\n       Because of the comparatively high availability of \n     affordable renewables in the region served by MidAmerican, we \n     based our calculations on an estimated additional cost of 1.5 \n     cents/kilowatt hour for qualifying sources. As a major \n     developer of renewable electricity through our CE Generation \n     subsidiary, MidAmerican believes that renewables can and \n     should play an increasing role in the nation's electric \n     generation mix, and the Company has expressed its support for \n     Senator Bingaman's overall efforts to promote increased use \n     of these resources. At the same time, MidAmerican has long \n     believed that applying a reasonable cap on the cost of \n     renewable credits would ensure that consumer costs do not \n     escalate beyond those anticipated by RPS proponents.\n       I understand that you are holding ongoing discussions with \n     Chairman Bingaman about the possibility of adjusting the cost \n     cap in the underlying legislation to address some of your \n     concerns about the RPS. We have contacted Chairman Bingaman's \n     staff to express our hope that a mutually acceptable \n     compromise can be reached on this issue. Thanks again for \n     your inquiry and continued support for PUHCA repeal and other \n     important industry modernizations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David L. Sokl,\n     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Electric Consumers' Alliance,\n\n                                 Indianapolis, IN, April 16, 2002.\n     Re: Consumer support for Sen. Nickles' Amendment to S. 517 \n         regarding Renewable Portfolio Standards\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Electric Consumers' Alliance, \n     its more than 300 member organizations representing all 50 \n     states, and its tens of millions of residential and small \n     business constituents, I am writing to indicate our strong \n     support for Senator Nickles' proposed amendment to S. 517, \n     the pending energy bill. Simply put, Sen. Nickles seeks to \n     implement the mandatory Renewable Portfolio Standard in a way \n     that is more equitable and cost effective for consumers \n     across the nation by reducing the renewable energy credit \n     from 3 cents to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n       Renewable energy resources can and will play an important \n     role in America's future energy infrastructure. As such, ECA \n     supports their development, including the creation of \n     subsidies to accelerate their deployment. At the same time, \n     however, we are cognizant that our members will continue to \n     expect a reliable, affordable supply of electricity over the \n     next decade, and this will come predominantly from \n     traditional resources. It is important to encourage the \n     development of new resources, but this must be tempered \n     against the more important goals of maintaining service that \n     is reliable and affordable. There is a danger in transferring \n     too much of the cost burden for development of these \n     resources to consumers, rather than encouraging the market to \n     work.\n       The mandated RPS requirement will not necessarily lessen \n     the need for or reliance on traditional generation in the \n     short-term. This is because of the intermittent nature of \n     renewable resources. Consumers won't wait for the sun to \n     shine or wind to blow to turn on appliances or flip the \n     lights. The renewable credits that are to be paid under S. \n     517 will likely be an adder to the cost of electricity for \n     consumers. As a result, these credits--while well-\n     intentioned--will almost certainly have a direct impact on \n     raising the price of electricity for many Americas (assuming \n     reliability is not compromised, which we certainly do not \n     advocate).\n       The Nickles proposal is a reasonable attempt to mitigate \n     the impact of the almost certain consumer price hike that \n     will be caused by mandated RPS. At a time when energy \n     affordability is an issue for a growing number of residential \n     and small business consumers, it is an appropriate balancing \n     of the interests at stake. If consumers are to shoulder the \n     burden for development of renewable resources through \n     credits, which S. 517 requires, then that cost burden should \n     be mitigated to more reasonable levels. Sen. Nickles' \n     proposal to reduce this impact by reducing the credit from 3 \n     cents to 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour is a reasonable \n     compromise. It deserves your support.\n       Thank you for your kind consideration.\n                                                Robert K. Johnson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Hon. John B. Breaux,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles and Senator Breaux: The undersigned \n     associations thank you for your leadership in offering your \n     amendment to reduce the costs of the renewable portfolio \n     standard (RPS) contained in the pending Daschle/Bingaman \n     amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2002 (S. 517).\n       Your amendment would make a modest, but economically \n     critical, change to the cost cap aspect of the RPS program. \n     The current RPS provisions mandate that an increasing\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\n     percentage of electricity sold be generated from renewable \n     resources. The RPS program further provides that those \n     electricity generators that cannot economically achieve the \n     required level of generation using renewable energy sources \n     can purchase ``credits'' from the Department of Energy to \n     meet their shortfall. The bill price for these credits is \n     three cents per kilowatt hour. This credit price is intended \n     to act as a cap on the cost increases that will result as \n     demand for renewable power increases in response to the RPS \n     requirement.\n       Unfortunately, this three-cent credit price is simply set \n     too high. Current wholesale electricity prices are only \n     slightly above three cents per kilowatt hour in most areas of \n     the country. With a three-cent credit, the result will be \n     that in most areas of the country the cost of electricity \n     mandated by the RPS provision could be almost double the \n     current wholesale cost of electricity. These higher costs \n     will be passed on to businesses and homeowners across the \n     country.\n       Your amendment would halve the credit price to one and one-\n     half cents per kilowatt hour. This is the same price set by \n     the Clinton Administration in its RPS proposals made in 1999. \n     Consumers will still pay more for electricity, but the cost \n     to consumers will be only half as much as it would be with a \n     three cent cost cap. Thus, the Nickles/Breaux amendment would \n     reduce the overall cost of the RPS provision.\n       Your amendment will ensure that businesses and homeowners \n     alike will have more affordable electricity supplies in the \n     future; reduce the economic costs of the federal renewable \n     portfolio standard program in the energy bill; and to promote \n     economic growth and prosperity for all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alliance for Competitive Electricity, American Chemistry \n           Council, American Gas Association, American Iron and \n           Steel Institute, American Petroleum Institute.\n         American Portland Cement Association, Associated \n           Petroleum Industries of Pennsylvania, Association of \n           American Railroads, Carpet and Rug Institute, Coalition \n           for Affordable and Reliable Energy.\n         Edison Electric Institute, Electric Consumers Alliance, \n           Electricity Consumers Resource Council, Greater Raleigh \n           [NC] Chamber of Commerce, Indian River [FL] Chamber of \n           Commerce.\n         International Association of Drilling Contractors, \n           Manhattan [NY] Chamber of Commerce, Massachusetts \n           Petroleum Council, Metropolitan Evansville [IN] Chamber \n           of Commerce, Missouri Oil Council.\n         Naperville [IL] Chamber of Commerce, National Association \n           of Manufacturers, National Electrical Manufacturers \n           Association, National Federation of Independent \n           Business, National Lime Association.\n         National Mining Association, National Ocean Industries \n           Association, Natural Gas Supply Association, Nebraska \n           Restaurant Association, Nevada Hotel & Lodging \n           Association.\n         Nevada Restaurant Association, Nuclear Energy Institute, \n           Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Stowe \n           [VT] Area Association, Tacoma-Pierce County [WA] \n           Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I did not want to speak if the chairman \nwanted to speak at this time, but in the absence of his desire to speak \nat this particular moment, I will make a few comments on the Nickles-\nBreaux amendment.\n  I have joined the Senator from Oklahoma in cosponsoring this \namendment. This is a good amendment. It is good for consumers, \ncertainly, it is good for the renewable energy industry in this \ncountry, and it is also good for the traditional suppliers of energy in \nthis country.\n  Let me state at the very beginning that I support the so-called \nrenewable portfolio standard. If I were in Louisiana, I would try to \nexplain it by saying it is a requirement of the Federal Government that \npower companies have to look for renewable sources of energy in \nproducing energy in this country.\n  What do we mean by that? Windmill power, for instance, biomass power, \nrenewable alternative forms of energy that should be encouraged in this \ncountry. I am for that. I am from a traditional oil-and-gas-producing \nState, but I found out that we also have one of the largest \nmanufacturers of windmills in Louisiana for the production of energy \nthrough wind power. That makes sense. It is not going to solve all of \nour problems, but it can contribute to a proper mix of renewable \nenergy, as well as traditional forms of energy.\n  We have a substantial number of tax credits in this energy bill \ncoming from our Finance Committee to encourage these alternative \nsources of energy. As an example, there is already in the legislation a \n1.7 cent production tax credit to be received by wind and biomass \nproducers. Mr. President, 1.7 cents per kilowatt is a lot when one \nconsiders that the wholesale price of energy is about 3 cents a \nkilowatt. When we are giving people who produce alternative sources of \nenergy a 1.7 cent per kilowatt subsidy, that is significant. The person \nwho produces those windmills in Louisiana are going to say: Wow, look, \nif I get a 1.7 cent per kilowatt tax credit, this is a good deal. \nPeople are going to want to buy power from windmill producers if it \nmeans 1.7 cents less per kilowatt than the ordinary regular 3 cent per \nkilowatt wholesale price of energy in this country. The legislation, as \nit is, encourages these alternative sources of energy through the Tax \nCode.\n  This is the second issue we are talking about right now. The \nlegislation also requires energy producers to reach a certain standard, \na percentage, required by Congress using these alternative sources of \nenergy by the year 2019. The legislation currently says 10 percent of a \npower company's production in the year 2019 shall come from these \nalternative sources of energy. Some people wanted it at 20 percent. It \nis down to 10 percent. I support that. That is an achievable goal that \npower companies can reach, especially if we give them a 1.7 cent per \nkilowatt subsidy to encourage them to do it. That is good public \npolicy.\n  The concern is there is an additional subsidy that is proposed in the \nlegislation, and this is what the Nickles-Breaux amendment addresses. \nThe legislation says, if you do not reach that 10-percent goal of using \nalternative sources of renewable energy, we are going to, in essence, \npenalize you 3 cents per kilowatt; that you are going to have to make \nup that 10-percent goal by purchasing power from other producers that \nhave met that goal or purchasing power from the Department of Energy \nthrough tax credits, and you are going to have to pay up to 3 cents per \nkilowatt for that extra energy you will be required to buy from other \ncompanies that have met that standard.\n\n  What does that mean in the real world, to the person in their home \nwho turns on the light switch every day and is concerned about the cost \nof electricity? What it means is if you add the 3 cents plus the 1.7 \ncent tax credit, you are talking about a huge subsidy which I think is \nfar more than it needs to be.\n  The problem is that if they are required to purchase that tax credit \nfrom the Department of Energy at 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour, they \ncould be looking at doubling the cost of electricity per kilowatt hour.\n  The concern I have is, who is going to pay for this? It is not going \nto be the power companies. If they have to purchase additional electric \ntax credits at 3 cents a kilowatt, they are just going to pass the cost \non to the consumer, back to the person in the house who flicks the \nswitch. That person is going to pay not 3 cents but double that price \nper kilowatt for the electricity they use.\n  Power companies are going to pass it through, and in a deregulated \nmarket they are going to add it to their bill at the end of the month. \nIn a regulated market, they are going to go to the public service \ncommission and say: Look, we are having to pay 3 cents more per \nkilowatt and we want it to be passed on to our rate base; we are just \ngoing to charge you 3 cents a kilowatt more than you are paying now. \nYou are already paying 3 cents, so we are going to pay 3 cents more.\n  That is too much. We do not need more incentives than are necessary.\n  The tax credit of 1.7 cents per kilowatt hour and the Nickles-Breaux \namendment with a penalty, in essence, of another 1.5 cents is a \nsubstantial incentive to encourage the development of what we call the \nrenewable portfolio standard on the use of alternative sources of \nenergy.\n  It is interesting. I have a letter from the Electric Consumers' \nAlliance which says:\n\n       On behalf of Electric Consumers' Alliance, its more than \n     300 member organizations representing all 50 states, and its \n     tens of millions of residential and small business \n     constituents, I am writing to indicate our strong support for \n     Senator Nickles' proposed amendment to S. 517, the pending \n     energy bill.\n\n  The only disagreement now is the Nickles-Breaux amendment. But the \nsupport from consumers is clear. Support from people who provide \nelectricity is very clear. They support it.\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\n  The simple fact is that, when put together, the credit price of 1.5 \ncents, coupled with the tax credit of 1.7 cents, means consumers and \ntaxpayers will be providing a subsidy to wind power and to these \nbiomass producers at a level of 3.2 cents. That is currently above the \nwholesale cost of power. That is a huge subsidy and incentive to \ndeveloping sources of power.\n  With the Nickles-Breaux amendment, we will still have a substantial \nsubsidy, but it will be at a less cost to taxpayers and consumers of \nelectric power. Bear in mind, every time we add 1 cent or half a cent, \nit is going to be passed on to the consumers of electricity in this \ncountry.\n  The Nickles-Breaux amendment is a good approach and one that should \nbe supported.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe Electric Consumers' Alliance, to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 Electric Consumers' Alliance,\n\n                                 Indianapolis, IN, April 16, 2002.\n     Re Consumer support for Sen. Nickles' Amendment to S. 517 \n         regarding Renewable Portfolio Standards.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Electric Consumers' Alliance, \n     its more than 300 member organizations representing all 50 \n     states, and its tens of millions of residential and small \n     business constituents, I am writing to indicate our strong \n     support for Senator Nickles' proposed amendment to S. 517, \n     the pending energy bill. Simply put, Sen. Nickles seeks to \n     implement the mandatory Renewable Portfolio Standard in a way \n     that is more equitable and cost effective for consumers \n     across the Nation by reducing the renewable energy credit \n     from 3 cents to 1.l5 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n       Renewable energy resources can and will play an important \n     role in America's future energy infrastructure. As such, ECA \n     supports their development, including the creation of \n     subsidies to accelerate their deployment. At the same time, \n     however, we are cognizant that our members will continue to \n     expect a reliable, affordable supply of electricity over the \n     next decade, and this will come predominantly from \n     traditional resources. It is important to encourage the \n     development of new resources, but this must be tempered \n     against the more important goals of maintaining service that \n     is reliable and affordable. There is a danger in transferring \n     too much of the cost burden for development of these \n     resources to consumers, rather than encouraging the market to \n     work.\n       The mandated RPS requirement will not necessarily lessen \n     the need for or reliance on traditional generation in the \n     short-term. This is because of the intermittent nature of \n     renewable resources. Consumers won't wait for the sun to \n     shine or wind to blow to turn on appliances or flip on \n     lights. The renewable credits that are to be paid under S. \n     517 will likely be an adder to the cost of electricity for \n     consumers. As a result, these credits--while well-\n     intentioned--will almost certainly have a direct impact on \n     raising the price of electricity for many Americans (assuming \n     reliability is not compromised, which we certainly do not \n     advocate).\n       The Nickles proposal is a reasonable attempt to mitigate \n     the impact of the almost certain consumer price hike that \n     will be caused by mandated RPS. At a time when energy \n     affordability is an issue for a growing number of residential \n     and small business consumers, it is an appropriate balancing \n     of the interests at stake. If consumers are to shoulder the \n     burden for development of renewable resources through \n     credits, which S. 517 requires, then that cost burden should \n     be mitigated to more reasonable levels. Sen. Nickles' \n     proposal to reduce this impact by reducing the credit from 3 \n     cents to 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour is a reasonable \n     compromise. It deserves your support.\n       Thank you for your kind consideration.\n                                                Robert K. Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will be very brief. I wish to recognize the effort \nby Senator Nickles to remind us all of the obligation we have with \nregard to the cost of renewables. We have had an extended debate \npreviously. This amendment obviously would change the fee and the \nrenewable portfolio standard from 3 cents to 1.5 cents.\n  We have already seen the estimate by the Energy Information \nAdministration, from the Department of Energy, relative to the \ncalculation of what a 3-cent renewable would cost the economy and the \nconsequence to the ratepayers, $88 billion over the next 20 years. \nChanging the credit from 3 cents to 1.5 cents will save about $44 \nbillion through the year 2020.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to respond to \nthe comments that have been made and to oppose the amendment that my \ncolleague from Oklahoma has offered.\n  First, to put this in perspective for Senators, this is the fourth \namendment we have seen that is designed to either eliminate or \ndramatically weaken the renewable portfolio standard we have in the \nbill. There were three others we voted on earlier that were not \nsuccessful. A majority of Senators did not favor weakening the \nstandard, and accordingly those amendments were not successful.\n  I think the structure we have in the bill is important if we are \ngoing to actually accomplish the purpose of bringing renewable \ntechnologies into use in this country, and that is the purpose of the \nrenewable portfolio standard. What we are saying in the renewable \nportfolio standard is each utility is directed to begin, starting in \nthe year 2005, to produce or obtain some of the power that it sells \nfrom renewable sources. They do not have to produce it from those \nsources, but they have to obtain it from those sources.\n  We are saying you do not have to do anything this year, you do not \nhave to do anything next year, you do not have to do anything the next \nyear, but in the year 2005 you have to achieve 1 percent. One percent \nof the power you sell must come from renewable sources.\n  There are obvious ways that one can go about this. First, one can add \nsome renewable power generation capability to the mix of sources for \ngenerating power. That is one option. That is, of course, what we are \nintending to facilitate and to incentivize with this provision.\n  A second thing that can be done is if one does not want to add it \nthemselves, they can contract with someone who has that power or who is \nwilling to provide that power from renewable sources. That is a second \noption.\n\n  A third option, under the bill, the way we have it drafted, is one \ncan buy a credit from somebody who does have more than the 1 percent--\nand there are a lot of utilities today that are in a position, \nbeginning in the year 2005, to try to sell their credits. That is good. \nWe are providing for that. We are saying, OK, if a particular utility \ndoes not want to either produce the power from renewable sources or buy \nthe power, someone who is producing it from renewable sources can then \ngo buy a credit.\n  The provision we have in the bill is patterned after the provision in \nthe Texas renewable portfolio standard legislation that President Bush \nsigned into law, and that has been acclaimed by all as a model kind of \na bill. It has had great success in Texas in encouraging more use of \nrenewables and diversifying the supplies of energy upon which they \ndepend.\n  What that Texas provision said was we would not charge 3 cents per \ncredit. What we charge in Texas is 5 cents per credit. That is what \nPresident Bush signed into law, in Texas, when he was Governor of \nTexas. It would either be 5 cents per credit or 200 percent of the \naverage price of traded credits, whichever is less, so that if one \ncould not go ahead and buy the credit from someone who is producing \npower, who has an extra credit, then as sort of a last option, they \ncould go to the State of Texas and say, OK, I will pay 5 cents per \ncredit or I will pay 200 percent of the tradable price of credits at \nthis time.\n  What has the tradable price of credits turned out to be in Texas? It \nis five-tenths of 1 cent. Half of a cent is the tradable price of \ncredits today in Texas.\n  So essentially what the Texas provision says is that one would have \nto pay 200 percent of the trading price for credits, which would be a \nfull cent, so 200 percent of the half cent would be a full cent, and \nthat would be the price that would have to be paid to the State of \nTexas to get a credit; not the 5 cents but the 1 cent. That is under \ntheir provision.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me finish my comments and then I will be glad to \nyield for a question.\n  We took that provision and we said, let's do the same thing at the \nFederal level and try to say we do not need to have a 5-cent credit; \nlet us have a 3-cent credit, but let us also put that\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\nprovision in 3 cents or 200 percent of the average price of traded \ncredit, whichever is less.\n  So if, in fact, the same thing happens nationally that has happened \nin Texas, which I think it likely would--credits would be trading for \nsubstantially less than the 3 cents--then it is very likely the credits \nthat would be purchased from the Government, if a utility decided to go \nthat step and purchase credits from the Government, would be \nsubstantially cheaper.\n  All of this, to some extent, is estimating where we think things will \nbe once this legislation becomes law, if it does become law. I am glad \nto join with my colleague from Oklahoma or any other Senator in urging \nthe Energy Information Agency to update their models, update their \nstudies, and give us good information about what the right amount of \ncredit ought to be. I am not certain 3 cents is the right amount, but \nit seems like the right amount based on what we know today.\n  Based on the review of the numbers of different economic analyses, we \nhave determined that 5 cents is too much. We have also determined that \nthe 1.5 cents is probably too little. So our estimate is the 3 cents is \nabout where it ought to be.\n\n  The reason we think it ought to be at 3 cents is because we believe \nall of the different types of renewable energy ought to be encouraged \nto be developed under this proposal.\n  We have a chart, which I would like to put up, to make the point. The \nrenewable portfolio standard requirement can be met; renewable energy \ncan be generated from any of a variety of sources. The main ones we \nthink about are biomass and biofuels resources, solar insulation \nresources, geothermal resources, and wind resources. Those are the four \nlogical areas.\n  The concern is that if we lower the cost of this credit too much, the \nprice of this credit too much, that this will skew away from the use of \nseveral of these and wind up favoring one over the others. In that \nregard, let me cite a letter to my colleagues. This is a letter \ndirected to all Senators, I believe. This was dated April 18 and it is \nfrom a large group of organizations. It is from the Alliance for \nAffordable Energy, Louisiana; American Bioenergy Association; Citizen \nAction Coalition of Indiana; Citizen Action/Illinois; Dakota Resource \nCouncil; Hoosier Environmental Council, Iowa Citizen Action Network; \nIowa SEED Coalition; I-Renew, Iowa; Michigan Environmental Council; \nMinnesotans for an Energy-Efficient Economy; North Dakota SEED. There \nare a whole range of organizations that have signed on to this letter.\n  Their letter says:\n\n       The undersigned environmental, consumer, and industry \n     groups urge you to oppose an amendment that would be offered \n     by Senator Nickles to further weaken the renewable portfolio \n     standard contained in Senate bill S. 517. The Nickels \n     amendment is the latest in a sustained attempt by power \n     companies to undermine efforts to diversify America's energy \n     supply with clean renewable energy.\n\n  Then they go on to say further down in the letter:\n\n       Under a lower priced cap--\n\n  And that is what Senator Nickles is recommending here, 1.5 cents--\n\n     only the very lowest-cost renewable energy technologies can \n     benefit from the RPS--primarily wind power at the very best \n     sites. Biomass, geothermal, and solar would be at a \n     significant disadvantage to meet this standard.\n\n  That is three of the four on this chart.\n  They say biomass would be a substantial disadvantage; solar, \ngeothermal. The Nickles amendment would reduce benefits to Western \nStates with good geothermal resources, to the Midwest, Southeast, and \nNortheast that have good biomass resources, and reduce benefits to all \nother States with good solar resources.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 18, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned environmental, consumer, and \n     industry groups urge you to oppose an amendment that may be \n     offered by Senator Don Nickles to further weaken the \n     renewable portfolio standard (RPS) contained in Senate Energy \n     Bill (S. 517).\n       The Nickles amendment is the latest in a sustained attempt \n     by power companies to undermine efforts to diversify \n     America's energy supply with clean renewable energy. The \n     Nickles amendment would reduce the cost cap for procuring \n     renewable energy credits under the RPS from 3 cents per \n     kilowatt-hour to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. This provision \n     would:\n       Reduce the number of technologies and states that would \n     benefit from the RPS--states with biomass, geothermal and \n     solar resources would be especially disadvantaged;\n       Reduce the amount of renewable energy developed by \n     encouraging companies to pay a penalty rather than developing \n     or procuring more renewable energy; and\n       Undermine the RPS competitive mechanism and potentially \n     even increase costs to consumers.\n       The Nickles amendment would reduce diversity of \n     technologies and states that benefit from the RPS.--Under a \n     lower price cap, only the very lowest-cost renewable energy \n     technologies can benefit from the RPS--primarily wind power \n     at the very best sites. Biomass, geothermal and solar would \n     be at a significant disadvantage to meet the standard. The \n     Nickles amendment would therefore reduce benefits to Western \n     states with good geothermal resources; reduce benefits to the \n     Midwest, Southeast and Northeast states which have good \n     biomass resources, and reduce benefits to all other states \n     with good solar resources.\n       The Nickles amendment would reduce the amount of renewable \n     energy developed.--An Energy Information Administration (EIA) \n     study of a 1.5-cent price cap (in a stronger RPS than the \n     Bingaman proposal) found that it could reduce the amount of \n     new renewable energy generated by the RPS by 84%. (AEO 2000)\n       As Governor of Texas, President Bush signed a RPS law that \n     included a 5-cent per kWh price cap for renewable energy \n     credits. That law is working well and is one of the most \n     successful examples of a state RPS in existence today. The \n     Bingaman 3-cent price cap represents a reasonable compromise \n     between the 1.5 cent price cap proposed in the 1999 Clinton \n     RPS and the 5 cent price cap signed by President Bush as \n     Governor of Texas.\n       The Nickles amendment would undermine the RPS competitive \n     mechanism and potentially even increase costs to consumers.--\n     The RPS is designed to create competition among many \n     renewable energy technologies to reduce their costs. EIA also \n     found that it would create new competition for fossil fuels--\n     reducing fossil fuel prices for electricity generators and \n     consumers. According to the most recent EIA analysis, these \n     reduced prices will save energy consumers over $13 billion \n     through 2020.\n       By setting the price cap too low, the Nickles amendment \n     would reduce competition among many types of renewable \n     energy. It would reduce the total amount of renewable energy \n     developed, undermining the potential of renewable energy to \n     restrain fossil fuel price increases. Electric companies \n     would have to buy credits from DOE for 1.5 cents, but without \n     new renewables necessarily being developed. Therefore, the \n     Nickles amendment could actually increase electricity prices.\n       Please don't believe the industry's claim that the RPS will \n     cost too much. The Bush Administration's EIA found that a 10% \n     RPS would save consumers money. Please reject the Nickles \n     amendment and any other weakening amendments, and preserve \n     the diversity, environmental and consumer benefits of the \n     Daschle/Bingaman RPS.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for Affordable Energy, Louisiana.\n       American Bioenergy Association.\n       Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana.\n       Citizen Action/Illinois.\n       Dakota Resource Council.\n       Environmental & Energy Study Institute.\n       Environmental Law & Policy Center of the Midwest.\n       Hoosier Environmental Council.\n       Iowa Citizen Action Network.\n       Iowa SEED Coalition.\n       I-Renew, Iowa.\n       Michigan Environmental Council.\n       Minnesota Project.\n       Minnesotans for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\n       National Environmental Trust.\n       Natural Resources Defense Council.\n       North Dakota SEED.\n       Renewable Northwest Project.\n       Sierra Club.\n       Solar Energy Industry Association.\n       Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.\n       Union of Concerned Scientists.\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did we have a hearing on any proposal to have this \npenalty?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I don't believe there was a specific hearing on it, and \nthat is why I have suggested we request the Energy Information Agency \nto update their studies and recommend whether they think this is the \nappropriate level or not. We certainly would have time to do that \nbetween now and any conference with the House of Representatives on \nthis bill. If there is a need to make an adjustment to come in line \nwith what the Energy Information Agency recommends, I would be glad to \nwork with my colleagues to try to do that in the conference.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did we have a hearing on the renewable portfolio \nstandards as proposed by the Senator in this bill, period?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we have had a hearing on the subject of \nrenewable energy and renewable portfolio standards, not on the specific \nlanguage in the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. In the last 2 years, did we have a hearing on a mandate \nof 10 percent and a cost of 3 cents?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I don't know that we had a hearing on a \nspecific level of required mandate or specific level of cost of credit. \nI don't believe we did.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I know the House had a hearing in 1999. The Clinton \nadministration proposed a 1.5-cent credit penalty per kilowatt hour. \nWhy did the chairman come up with a 3-cent penalty, double what the \nClinton administration proposed a couple of years ago?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. What we did, in response to my friend's question, we \nmodeled our proposal on the successful program legislated into effect \nin Texas. That is the basis upon which we came up with our estimate. It \nwas very different from the Clinton administration recommendation, not \njust with the credits but in various other aspects. We did not follow \nthe Clinton administration proposal with regard to renewable portfolio \nstandards in fashioning ours.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong; Texas has a requirement that \nhas a goal of 2,000 megawatts of new renewable energy by the year 2009. \nThat represents 2.6 percent of their present generating capacity. Also \ncorrect me if I am wrong, but Texas has their whole basis on capacity, \nnot on electricity produced. So that Texas mandate is a whole lot less \nthan the 10 percent mandate as proposed by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that is inaccurate; \nthat, in fact, although the Texas language does talk about capacity, \nthe calculation as put in place by their utility commission was on the \nbasis of actual power produced. My information is that through the \nperiod that is covered by the Texas law, the percentage requirement for \nrenewable energy is higher than the one we require.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will require the Texas utility code \nsection 39.904, goals for renewable energy is 2,000 megawatts of \ngenerating capacity. I mention this because capacity is one thing, to \ngenerate electricity is another. For wind, you need three times the \nfacilities to actually generate because they don't operate 24 hours a \nday. The wind does not always blow. Capacity is less intrusive and less \nexpensive. And factually, the amount of megawatts produced equals right \nnow 2.6 percent of the Texas generating capacity and less than \n2 percent anticipated by the year 2009.\n\n  I heard my colleague say this is modeled after Texas. But it is not \nmodeled after Texas. It did not follow Texas in any way, shape, or \nform. That is an editorial comment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me once again try to put this in \nperspective for my colleagues. As I indicated, this is an effort, \nanother effort, to weaken the renewable portfolio standards we have in \nthe bill. We put the renewable portfolio standards in here because we \nbelieve strongly it is in our national interest that we diversify the \nsources from which we obtain energy and that we encourage the \ndevelopment and improvement of the new technologies which we know can \nbe sources of energy as we move into the future. That is why we have a \nrenewable portfolio standard in the bill.\n  The requirement we have is not that onerous. When we require 1 \npercent of the power sold by a utility by the year 2005 to be generated \nfrom renewable sources, that is not an unduly onerous requirement. All \nof the numbers we have been hearing about how it will cost such \nenormous amounts for the utilities to comply, assuming they are going \nto do nothing to meet excess demand in the future--the truth is, they \nare going to be adding generating capacity in the future to meet \nincreased consumer demand. That is as it should be.\n  All we are saying is, as they make those decisions about adding new \ngenerating capacity in the future, they should be encouraged, they \nshould be incentivized, to look at renewable energy as the source for \nsome of that power. That is, to my mind, a responsible course to \nfollow. We are way behind other industrial allies, the countries in \nEurope, in beginning to use renewable energy in our country. It is time \nwe began to use these new technologies, began to improve these \ntechnologies. They have proven themselves to be effective. It would be \nextremely unfortunate, in my view, if we further weakened the renewable \nportfolio standard at this time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Ohio desires to \nspeak, but I wish to make a couple of rebuttals to the comments made by \nthe Senator from New Mexico. Then I am delighted to have my friend from \nOhio speak.\n  We didn't reduce the renewable portfolio standard. It is still 10 \npercent. I don't think it should be there, but my decision was to \nminimize the damage under the Bingaman proposal, and we decided to cut \nthe penalty in half, the same amount the Clinton administration \nproposed--the only proposal that had a hearing before Congress, and \nthat happened to be a hearing not before this Congress but the last \nCongress in 1999. To think we would even have a proposal that has an \nindirect tax on utility users and consumers of billions of dollars, \nestimated by the Energy Information Agency of $88 billion, without even \nhaving a hearing, I find ridiculous.\n  I hear colleagues say it was based on Texas, and it was not; there is \na world of difference between capacity and generated electricity, \nespecially when you talk about renewables. Texas has a standard that \nwould equal 2 percent of their generation, and we are talking about a \n10 percent mandate. There is a lot of difference. There is a lot of \ndifference when the cost impact is in the millions and billions of \ndollars for utilities all across the country. And I will put in more \nestimates.\n  When I made this speech earlier, trying to strike the provision, I \nsaid something about a chart we got from the Department of Energy that \nsaid Kansas City Power and Light said it would cost $16 million--that \nis per year--when fully implemented. I mentioned that was pretty good \nfor the consumers of Kansas City Power and Light.\n  They said, in a letter: Unfortunately, EIA grossly understated the \ncost of 10 percent mandate to Kansas City Power and Light. The hit is \nmuch worse than that. We project total costs being more than $300 \nmillion over the 15-year period between 2005 and 2020 for the full 10 \npercent. For a company of our size, these costs are intolerable.\n  So for people to say we don't think it will be very much, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Voinovich, Senator Miller, and I are at least trying to \nreduce the cost and trying to keep the cost at somewhat more affordable \nlevels as proposed by the previous administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to support the Nickles-Breaux \namendment on renewable portfolio standards.\n  Last month, the Senate debated the renewable portfolio standard \nincluded in the legislation before us today. I want to make it clear \nthat I applaud the efforts of my colleagues to encourage the use of \nrenewable electricity generation.\n  I agree that renewable energy is an important part of the future and \nshould be developed. I also strongly believe renewable sources are \nvital as this country seeks to diversify energy supplies and decrease \nour dependence on foreign sources to meet our energy needs.\n  As my colleagues know, the Bingaman amendment that was accepted last \nmonth stipulates that we must develop a mandatory minimum standard for \nrenewable energy of 10 percent by the year 2019. At the time, I opposed \nthe requirement because I believed it mandated an unrealistic level of \nrenewable usage in a short period of time, at the virtual expense of \nother sources of electricity generation.\n  I think one point that seems to get lost over the use of renewables \nin America is that, right now, very little of our power in this Nation \nis generated by renewables. As a matter of fact, it is 1.6 of 1 \npercent. My colleagues should understand when we are talking renewables \nin this bill, we are\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\ntalking solar, we are talking wind, we are talking geothermal and we \nare talking biomass; that is it.\n  When I stood to oppose the original mandate, I pointed out that in my \nhome State of Ohio, our use of renewable energy is much lower than the \nnational average. Renewables, including hydropower, generate 1 percent \nof our electricity.\n  I also pointed out there are many other States which rely on \nrenewable sources for electricity generation. According to the 1998 \ndata from the Energy Information Administration--and this is really \nimportant because it gets at the regionalism and how unfair this \nmandate is, as it is written, to certain regions of the country--at \nleast 10 percent of the electricity generated in 16 States comes from \nrenewable power. Of these 16, 5 States receive more than 50 percent of \ntheir electricity from renewable sources, and the primary source is \nhydroelectric power. Four of the five States--Idaho, Oregon, South \nDakota, Washington--rely on hydroelectric power for more than 60 \npercent of their electricity. Maine is the only State east of the \nMississippi to rely on renewables for more than 50 percent of its \nelectricity, 30 percent coming from hydro and 30 percent from other \nrenewables.\n  Regions and even individual States that currently have a high \npercentage of renewable energy sources would be less impacted by the \nunderlying provisions. However, forcing a mandatory minimum would \nunduly burden States such as Ohio.\n  Let me tell you a little about my State and States in the Midwest. We \nrely heavily on coal. Mr. President, 86 percent of our energy comes \nfrom coal. As Members of this Senate know, there are bills that have \nbeen introduced that will increase and require us to reduce \nNOX, SOX, mercury, and some are even talking \nabout carbon. In our State, we are putting our money into clean coal \ntechnology, not into switching to renewables.\n\n  What this underlying bill requires is that, in a place such as \nCleveland, OH, my kilowatt--maybe some of my colleagues are not aware \nof this--my cost per kilowatt hour in Cleveland is 4.7 cents. This bill \nis talking about increasing that by 3 cents per kilowatt hour. That is \na tremendous increase we are going to have to bear in States such as \nOhio.\n  AEP, which has its home office in Ohio, American Electric Power, \nestimates that they would have to install an additional cumulative \ntotal of 2,100 megawatts of renewables by 2011, a total of 4,100 \nmegawatts by 2015, and a total of 7,000 megawatts by 2020 under this \nrequirement. This should be compared with their total generation, which \nis 38,000 megawatts. That is in 11 States. And this calculation does \nnot include a safety valve or cost cap. The cost impact on AEP alone \nwould range from $100 million to $400 million net present value.\n  One of the things that bothers me when we debate these things in the \nSenate is, we are talking about the utilities. The utilities are the \nratepayers.\n  In my State, our manufacturers are taking it in the back of the neck. \nWe are losing manufacturing jobs in the Midwest. One of the things that \ntriggered this was a year ago we had a spike in gas prices, which put \nmost of the small businesses in a negative position. Then, with the \nhigh cost of the dollar, they are in deep trouble, especially if they \nexport.\n  So we are talking about adding costs on a specific segment of our \neconomy, which happens to fall heavily in my State. We use a lot of \nelectricity. It also puts a negative burden on the people who live in \nmy inner cities.\n  People just talk about these things as if it didn't matter. But the \npeople who make less than $10,000 a year pay about 30 percent of \nwhatever they have for energy costs. This kind of legislation, as it is \nwritten, is going to drive those costs up. Let's talk about those \npeople who are going to pay the cost.\n  What I am saying today, to my colleagues, is give me a break. Give us \na break. Some of you are from regions that do not have the problems we \nhave. We have 23 percent of the manufacturing jobs in this country in \nthe Midwest. In my State alone, we have more manufacturing jobs than \nthey have in the entire northeastern part of the country.\n  What we are trying to do today is come up with a reasonable number in \nterms of this mandate. It may not mean a lot to some people who live in \nsome of the other States that do not have manufacturing, but it does \nmean a great deal in States like my State. I think of Paul's Letter to \nthe Romans, Chapter 12: We are all part of one body. We have different \nfunctions.\n  It would be really nice if on the floor of this Senate we would start \nto give a little more consideration to some of the specific problems \nsome of us have in our States so we could continue to survive and \nprosper and have reasonable energy costs, continue our manufacturing, \nand not drive up the cost for the least of our brethren.\n  I urge my colleagues to really give serious consideration to this. \nThis is a reasonable proposal we are making today. It does not \neliminate the mandate. It just says, if we have to comply with it, we \ncomply with it in a way that is less oppressive than what is contained \nin the underlying bill.\n\n  Mr. REID. Under the previous order, the Senate is going to stand in \nrecess so we can all listen to our Secretary of State in room 407. I \nask, however, that the recess be extended until the hour of 4:15. I \ncleared this with my colleague, Senator Nickles. I ask that that time \ncount against the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we hope \nto be able to have a vote on the Nickles amendment within the next half \nhour. We do not know for sure how long people will speak. We have had a \nnumber of Members indicate they wanted to speak on the Nickles \namendment. We have several of them in the Chamber right now. We will \nproceed on that. There should be a vote within the next half hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3256\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if none of my colleagues are prepared to take \nthe floor, let me spend a couple of minutes in support of the Nickles \namendment.\n  As you know, the Nickles amendment, which is the pending business, \nwould reduce the amount of penalty in effect that a public utility \nwould bear if it did not produce the required amount of electricity for \nretail sales with so-called renewable energy resources. This has to do, \nagain, with the portfolio that we call the renewable resources that \nwould be required to account for 10 percent of the retail sales of all \nthe investor-owned utilities in the country.\n  Bear in mind that the publicly owned utilities are exempted only \nbecause a point of order would have been effective against the \ninclusion of the public utilities in the amendment due to the unfunded \nmandate nature of the underlying provision. Ultimately, this probably \nwill apply both to investor-owned and public utilities, but for the \nmoment it applies only to the investor-owned utilities.\n  When I talk about a penalty on the utilities, of course, I am really \ntalking about a penalty on the utility customers because utilities are \nnot in the business of losing money--at least not very long. As a \nresult, their expenses are charged back to their customers.\n  What we are really talking about in the underlying bill is a \nrequirement that these utilities produce 10 percent of their retail \npower from so-called renewable resources, such as wind, solar, or \nbiomass energy. Then, if they don't do so, they have to buy that amount \nfrom other available resources or, if they can't do that, pay an amount \nequal to 3 cents per kilowatt hour to make up the difference.\n  Let us say that the requirement when the bill is fully effective is \n10 percent and they are able to generate 1\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\npercent from the renewable resources; let us say they are able to buy \nanother 1 percent from somewhere else. That means they would have 8 \npercent that would have to be accounted for by a penalty of 3 cents per \nkilowatt hour of that retail sale.\n  How much would that cost the utility customers around the country? \nThat is the question. The Nickles amendment would cut the cost in half. \nThe Nickles amendment would say, instead of 3 cents per kilowatt hour, \nit would be 1\\1/2\\ cents per kilowatt hour.\n  I am informed by Senator Nickles that is the amount the Clinton \nadministration had proposed when it had a similar proposal.\n  We would be talking about cutting in half the penalty that otherwise \nwould pertain.\n  I cited earlier in this debate the statistics by utility and by \nState. I have these statistics again. I will recite a few of them and \ninsert in the Record at the appropriate point and make available for \nall of my colleagues exactly how the customers in each State would be \nrequired to pay, again just for the penalties of the public utilities; \nthat is to say, the investor-owned utilities.\n  Let me cite some examples.\n  In the State of Alabama, the cost to the customers is $156-plus \nmillion or, under the Nickles amendment, these customers in Alabama \nwould save $78 million per year.\n  Since I see my colleague from Vermont in the Chamber, let me look at \nVermont. In Vermont, the utility customers of the investor-owned \nutilities would save over $7 million per year under the amendment of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Let me look at Florida, the State from which the Presiding Officer \ncomes. Florida is a big State with a lot of utility customers--a mix of \nboth public and private utilities--but the private utilities annually \nwould suffer an expense of over $451 million, so that the savings from \nthe Nickles amendment for the utility customers in Florida, the \ninvestor-owned utilities, would be more than $225 million.\n  In my own State of Arizona, the cost is almost $100 million. So the \nsavings per year would be just under $50 million.\n  Let me pick a couple of other States.\n  For the State of Nevada, the State of the distinguished majority \nwhip, the savings would be over $37 million because the expense there \nis over $75 million.\n  Let me pick another couple States at random.\n  For New York State, the savings would be almost $132 million.\n  Let me take my neighboring State of California, another large State. \nCalifornians, obviously, are going to get clobbered by this renewable \nportfolio requirement. The estimate is, therefore, that for the State \nof California, just cutting this penalty in half, reducing it to 1\\1/2\\ \ncents per kilowatt hour, would save the customers in California over \n$243 million per year.\n  These savings illustrate that there is a cost to what we are imposing \nin the Senate. We come up with a lot of good ideas. In fact, our ideas \nare so good we want to impose them on everybody else.\n  I offered amendments to make this voluntary, but my proposals were \nrejected. So this is a mandatory requirement. This is required of all \nof the electric customers in this country, so I thought it would be \nimportant to know how much it is going to cost--in other words, by our \naction, what costs are we imposing on the electric customers of our \ncountry?--so that we can then make a judgment of whether it is worth \nit.\n\n  What we are doing here has significant consequences to people. We \npass bills all the time to try to help people in need. People need help \nwith their housing, so we provide them assistance for housing. People \nneed help with their heating bills, so we provide them assistance under \na program called LIHEAP. And there are any number of other programs.\n  So why, then, would we be imposing this kind of a big cost on them? \nOf course, the bigger the family, the more your expenses are going to \nbe; therefore, the more this is going to cost you.\n  What sense does it make for us to impose this kind of cost on \nconsumers with this legislation and then turn right around under the \nLIHEAP bill and say: Well, we know you are having to pay a lot for your \nelectric bill, so we are going to help you make up for part of that. \nThis just does not make any sense. It is incoherent policy, and it \ndamages real people. That is why I am citing these statistics.\n  In a relatively small State--let me just take the State of the \nhonorable chairman of the Energy Committee--the State of New Mexico, by \npassing the Nickles amendment, the people of New Mexico would save over \n$19 million a year because they are going to have to pay almost $40 \nmillion as a penalty because New Mexico cannot generate the requisite \n10 percent that we are going to mandate under this bill.\n  These are not my figures. This comes from the Department of Energy, \nfrom the Energy Information Administration, which is a branch of the \nU.S. Department of Energy. These are up-to-date figures. I had figures \nin this Chamber before when we were debating this issue. These are even \nmore updated figures than that.\n  So it seems to me that we in this body have to think about the \nconsequences of our mandates. If we are going to make Americans pay \nmore, we better have a darn good excuse or a good reason for making \nthem do that.\n  Doesn't it make sense that we would say to people--let's just take \nthe State of California, for example--Look, Californians, you are going \nto have to pay $243 million under the Nickles amendment, but if the \nNickles amendment does not pass, you are going to have to pay $487 \nmillion a year in penalties. You may think it is worth it in order to \nencourage the development of wind energy or solar energy. If you do \nthink it is worth it, would you be willing to pay that cost on an \nindividual basis?\n  My guess is, you would have, out of, say, 100 people, probably 5 or \n10 who would say: We feel like we are in a contributing mood, and we \nwould like to pay for our share of what it will really cost us--the \nreal cost to generate more of this energy from these so-called \nrenewable resources--so we will pay a higher electric bill.\n  I have not broken this down per customer, but, obviously, each \ncustomer is going to pay a fairly significant amount. But if you say to \nthe people of California, Are you willing to pay almost $500 million a \nyear more--if you put that to a vote--most of them would say: No, we \ndon't think so. Why don't you figure out another way to make this \nhappen. This represents a substantial increase in our power bill, and \nwe don't want to do it.\n  What we are doing in this body--I am going to call it arrogant \nbecause I think it is a certain degree of arrogance that must affect \nour willingness to impose these kinds of financial burdens on the \nAmerican people for the sake of, what, to generate more energy with \nwind, to do what, save some oil or gas or coal maybe that we would \notherwise use to produce power.\n  Of course, we are not willing to expand our energy production, but we \nare going to require this use of renewable resources. And the incentive \nis going to be: If you don't do it, then you all are going to have to \npay a big penalty. I think that is arrogance on our part. The reason I \nuse that harsh word is because I think if you put that question to your \nconstituents--I know if I put that question to the constituents that I \nrepresent, I am very certain most of them would say: No, thank you. We \nwould just as soon you not impose that additional tax on us.\n  This is a tax on energy. It is a tax on energy use for individual \nretail customers. But most of our constituents will not know that is \nwhat we have done. That is why I am going to make it a point to let \nthem know. We are going to publicize this in every way that I know, in \nevery State that I know, to make sure that the constituents of all of \nmy colleagues understand what their Senator imposed upon them in the \nway of a new tax and what it is going to cost them.\n  These figures are going to be in every State in the country so that \nthere will be no question that it is understood what the costs are, on \nour constituents, that we are imposing upon them in the name of good, \nto produce more wind energy and more solar energy. I just want the \nfolks in California to know it is going to cost them almost $500 \nmillion a year--$487 million to be exact--and the same thing for every \nother State.\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\n  The figures are actually understated because, as I said, this only \nrepresents what the investor-owned utilities will have to pay in \npenalties. We know there will be additional penalties, assuming the \npublicly owned utilities are also added to this at a later time.\n  So I think it is important for the American people who buy energy to \nunderstand what we are imposing on them by way of cost. The best way to \ndo that is by bringing it out, with the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma, by demonstrating what we can save them by simply cutting this \npenalty in half, from 3 cents per kilowatt hour to 1\\1/2\\ cents per \nkilowatt hour.\n  It is still a lot of money. I have not added it all up, but it adds \nup to an awful lot of money. It is clearly in the multiples of billions \nof dollars.\n  But we have these statistics by State so we will at least be able to \nshow people what they will save by State as a result of the adoption of \nthe Nickles amendment. We will have a copy of this at the party desks \nat the time that the vote is called on the Nickles amendment.\n  Any Member wishing to see how much he or she is willing to save his \nor her constituents, if you would like to see how much you will save \nyour constituents by voting for the Nickles amendment, we will have \nthat here for you. Conversely, if you would like to see how much of a \ntax you will impose upon your constituents, we have that column as \nwell.\n  I hope my colleagues will take advantage of the information we have. \nThis is information from the Department of Energy on how much this \nelectric tax is going to cost the ratepayers all over this country. We \ncould at least do them a favor by cutting the penalty in half. And if \nyou want to know how much you will save your constituents by doing \nthat, by supporting the Nickles amendment, we have all the figures \nright here.\n  I see the Senator from Oklahoma is here. I have been referring to his \namendment. Let me see if the State of Oklahoma would save any money \nhere. It turns out we are going to tax the utility customers there over \n$112 million a year. So at least he is going to save his constituents \nover $56 million a year. That ain't peanuts. That is real savings. \nEquivalent numbers apply to all of the rest of the States.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Nickles amendment and do their \nconstituents a favor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague from Arizona for his \nstatement, for his homework, for his research and knowledge on the \nissue. I hope all Senators will pay attention because we are talking \nabout an amendment that will have a real impact on utility rates, on \nelectric rates all across the country. It will cost millions. Actually, \nI think my colleague from Arizona will agree, utility companies don't \nreally pay those rates. They may be assessed, but they will pass them \non to consumers. They will pass them on to ratepayers in Florida, in \nArizona, in Illinois, in Oklahoma, and in Nevada.\n  I appreciate my colleague's homework and also his very strong \nstatement.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord the table to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would give to the Senator from Nevada \nthe hour that was reserved under postcloture for Senator Akaka of \nHawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nThis is very complicated stuff, all these things trading around and all \nthat. It is very difficult for people to understand. It sounds good.\n  I think under the circumstances, even though it is the opposition, \nthe administration is somewhere we should look, in the form of the \nDepartment of Energy, as to what the facts are. If you do that, you \nwill find that the facts are quite different from those represented by \nthe Senator from Arizona and obviously the Senator from Oklahoma. It is \nalso clear that in different areas of the country, this works \ndifferently. It depends on what your production is, what is available \nto you in renewables and all that. I will rely upon the Department of \nEnergy and expect, with this administration being in control of that \nDepartment, that the facts they give us ought to be fairly accurate.\n  It seems to me we have brought forth these arguments several times \nnow. However, I will reiterate that the U.S. Department of Energy, in \nits most recent analysis, has found that a 10-percent renewable energy \nrequirement will, by the year 2020, save the American consumers up to \n$3 billion, save consumers up to $3 billion in electricity costs. \nImposing a Federal renewable energy mandate of 10 percent will cost $3 \nbillion less for consumers by the year 2020 as compared to business as \nusual. This result is an overall cost savings to consumers from 2002 to \n2020 of $13.2 billion. This is what the most recent studies of the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy, Energy Information Administration have found.\n  It escapes me why we are spending so much time arguing about cost. I \nhave heard some of my colleagues claim that the cost to consumers will \nbe off the charts. This is at odds with the repeated findings of the \nU.S. Department of Energy of this administration.\n\n  A number of my colleagues have referred to Energy Information \nAdministration statistics to the effect that renewable energy will cost \nAmericans $88 billion. However, these EIA numbers are referring to the \ngross cost of the price of renewable energy, not the increased cost to \nconsumers of using renewable energy versus using other forms of energy.\n  The relevant question is not whether, if you bought only renewable \nenergy, it would add up to a total cost of $88 billion. The question \nis, How much more is that amount than what you would be paying anyway \nfrom fossil fuel or other energy sources without a renewable energy \nmandate?\n  As I have stated, the studies completed in February of this year by \nthe U.S. Energy Information Administration, which are consistent with \nthe previous studies, say that under a 10-percent renewable energy \nmandate, consumer costs will actually go down by close to $3 billion \nper year by the year 2020, compared to energy costs if no renewable \nenergy mandate existed.\n  I will also point out that although the 1.5-cent cap Senator Nickles \nis now proposing was indeed the amount contained in the bill put \nforward by the Clinton administration, that bill also would have \nimposed a far more aggressive renewable mandate than the one currently \nin the Senate bill.\n  Under the Clinton administration's bill, renewable energy would have \nbeen required to reach 7.5 percent by the year 2010. This is compared \nto only a roughly 4-percent requirement by 2010 in the energy bill \ncurrently before us. The renewable energy provision currently in the \nbill does not even get to an actual 10-percent renewable energy \nstandard by the year 2020. By the time all of the various exceptions \nand deductions are added in, the amount of mandated renewable energy \nrequired in this bill by the year 2020 is actually closer to 5 percent. \nThis amount is disappointingly close to what American business is \nlikely to achieve anyway with no additional support from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I must say, I find the continued attempt to weaken this marginal \nrequirement baffling. I, along with my colleagues, have repeatedly made \nthe argument on the floor for the many benefits of renewable energy. \nThese include environmental and health benefits which have not been \ntaken into consideration. They include making our American businesses \ncompetitive in a booming European market in wind and other renewable \nenergy. This should be the example at which we are looking. As the EIA \nhas shown, they include benefits to the American consumer, ultimately \nmaking the costs to consumers actually decrease.\n  Few of my colleagues dispute these benefits. Even those supporting \nthis amendment have recognized the great national benefits to promoting \nrenewable energy. It seems painfully difficult for us to change our old \nways of looking at things and to take steps that will bring these \nmodern and beneficial energy sources to our door.\n  These arguments over the price of cost caps are just another attempt \nto dismantle the existing renewable energy position. The Senate has \nalready voted several times against attempts to destroy this position, \nand I hope we will recognize the amendment for what it is--another \nside-door attempt to do just that.\n  Different States have different problems. Oil-producing States \nnaturally want to sell all the oil they can. If we look at the program \nas it is, look at the advantages it has, and look at the end results as \nreported by the Department of Energy, that it will save money in the \nyears ahead, I say this bill should stay as it is.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in keeping this really modest \nprovision in the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague.\n  I heard you say this amendment was an attempt to destroy the \nrenewable section. Are you aware of the fact that we didn't change the \n10-percent requirement so the bill still requires that 10 percent of \nthe electricity generated would have to be in the form of renewables? \nAnd I remind you that the Clinton administration only proposed 7.5 \npercent. So we didn't change that. And I might say that the penalty, \nthe cap, is the same amount that was proposed by the Clinton \nadministration. It was a penny and a half per kilowatt hour. If you \nmissed the target of 10 percent, that target amount, the penalty \namount, would be the same as required by the Clinton administration. So \nI don't think this amendment guts the renewables. I wanted to make sure \nyou were aware of it. This isn't the same vote we had previously on \nrenewables.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think it is 7.5 percent by 2010. Other than that, I \nstand by the speech I made and the results I said will be there and our \nunderstanding of the bill, as the U.S. Department of Energy understands \nit.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Further, to clarify, the Senator is aware, then, that \nthe renewable standard is higher than that proposed by the Clinton \nadministration because it is 10 percent instead of 7.5 percent. Is the \nSenator aware that the penalty in the Bingaman-Daschle proposal is \ntwice as high as that proposed by the Clinton administration?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think the times that it went into effect were \ndifferent. It depends on how you compare it. I stand by my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the Chamber, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nexpress my appreciation for his work on this bill and other matters \nthat have come before this body, and that he has had the opportunity to \nmove forward to do something about a renewable portfolio.\n  On the appropriations bill that I have had the pleasure of working \nwith Senator Domenici for a number of years, the Senator has always \ncome there making sure our conscience was clear and that the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water did everything it could \nfor development of renewable energy resources. He has always been there \nasking us to do more. I appreciate that. I think one of the big\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\nproblems with this bill is that we haven't done more to increase the \nrenewables portfolio. The Senator and I tried to increase it to 20 \npercent. Ten percent is a bare minimum. What I say to my friend from \nOklahoma, through the Chair, is that, sure, the 10% requirement hasn't \nchanged, but with this amendment that 10% is not directed toward the \ndevelopment of renewables. The amendment will encourage the use of \ncredits. So with Senator Nickles amendment you wind up having a program \nin this country where you don't really develop renewables.\n  I say to my friend from Vermont, thank you very much for making us \nkeep our eye on this. We need to develop more renewables. This is the \nfourth attempt of what I believe is the oil companies of this country \ntrying to get us to back off of the renewables portfolio.\n  The oil companies love this amendment that is before us. But the \nAmerican people don't like it. Why? Because when it is explained to \nthem, energy has a price other than just the cost at the production \nlevel. What do I mean by that?\n  Mr. President, a few years ago in Nevada, a company came to Nevada. \nThey owned a plant near Barstow, CA--the largest solar energy \nproduction facility in America, with 200 megawatts of electricity. They \nwanted to build a production facility in the Eldorado Valley between \nLas Vegas and Boulder City, in a relatively remote place. They went \nbefore the Nevada Public Service Commission. The company was called the \nLuz Company. It was named from the Old Testament, where Jacob's Ladder \nwas; that is where it came down, Luz. The public service commission \ncould not allow them to build that facility because all they were \nallowed to consider at that time was the cost of production. It had \nnothing to do with the smog and junk that the coal-fired and oil-fired \ngenerating plants produced in the Las Vegas Valley. They could not take \nthat into consideration. That is one of the problems we have had all \nover America today.\n\n  The fact is, since then, the Nevada Legislature has changed that. It \nis tremendous that they have done that. They have now, in Nevada, a 15-\npercent renewable portfolio standard. That is excellent. I am proud of \nwhat the State of Nevada has done. That has only been at the time of \nthe last legislature.\n  Our Nation needs to diversify its energy policy. The Senate passed a \nrenewables portfolio standard--we call it the RPS--requiring that 10 \npercent of the electricity produced comes from clean, renewable energy \nresources. What is that? The Sun--the warmth of the Sun, the warmth of \nthe Earth, geothermal.\n  Wind used to bother me but I kind of like it now. Wind always got on \nmy nerves; it would never be there when I wanted it. I now like the \nwind. I have come to the realization that it cleans the air. I have \nalso come to the realization that we in Nevada can use that wind to \nproduce electricity. In fact, we are doing that at the Nevada Test \nSite, where almost a thousand bombs have been detonated.\n  We are building, with the permission of the DOE, a wind farm there. \nWithin 3 years, with the work done by the Finance Committee--and I \nappreciate the work by Senators Baucus, Grassley, and other members of \nthat committee on a tax credit for wind--that will allow that \ngenerating facility to go forward. Within 3 years, they will produce \nenough electricity to supply electricity to 250,000 homes in Las Vegas. \nThat is good.\n  So, Mr. President, the RPS in this bill is too weak. As I have \nalready said to my friend, the distinguished Senator Jeffords, it is \nnot as much as I had hoped for, not as much as I wanted. I voted for 20 \npercent, which Senator Jeffords and I propounded.\n  One provision in the renewable portfolio standard allows for a system \nof tradeable, renewable energy credits. For this system to effectively \nwork--and we have not talked about it that much today--the cost of \nrenewable energy credits must encourage the growth of renewable energy.\n  The Nickles amendment lowers the cost of these renewable energy tax \ncredits to the point where a utility will choose to buy credits rather \nthan produce renewable energy. In this country, I want more renewable \nenergy. We have spent trillions of dollars in the oil business--\nutilities are heavily invested in that. Let's change a little and spend \na little money on renewable energy so my friend, my children, and my \nchildren's children can breathe clean air. That is what this is all \nabout. Ask my children whether they are interested in using the worst-\ncase scenario. The EIA analysis reflected the worst-case scenario--that \nthe cost of electricity might increase 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. \nEvery one of my five children--let them vote on it. They will go for \nrenewable energy because they want clean air for their children, my 12 \ngrandchildren. I want them to have clean air. They are not going to \nhave it if we keep firing generators with coal, gas, and oil.\n  We need to do something different--Sun, geothermal, wind. That is \nwhat this amendment is about. This is the fourth time they have tried \nto whack this very small amount that we have in this bill, 10 percent \nfor renewable energy. I am glad, if for no other reason, cloture has \nbeen invoked. Maybe this will be the end of it. Maybe not.\n  What this amendment attempts to do makes no sense. This is not the \ngoal of the renewable portfolio standard. This amendment is basically, \nin my opinion, interested in damage control.\n  I am interested in expanding our energy resources through clean \nrenewable energy. The DOE's Energy Information Administration suggests \nthat the renewable portfolio standard may raise the price--worst-case \nscenario--of electricity consumers by 0.1 cents per kilowatt hour. That \nis the estimate. It doesn't include the stimulative effect of section \n45, the production tax credit that the Senate adopted yesterday.\n  This bill isn't perfect. It is far from perfect. But there are some \ngood things in the bill. One of the good things is what was done \nyesterday in adopting the Finance Committee's energy tax provisions.\n  The chairman of this committee, Senator Bingaman, is a member of that \nFinance Committee. That was good work they did, because they had \nprovisions in there to help production and they also had provisions in \nthere to help the renewable portfolio. With the production tax credit, \nthere is likely to be no increase in consumer prices resulting from the \nrenewable portfolio. After pouring billions of dollars--I say \ntrillions--into oil and gas, we need to invest in a clean energy \nfuture. Other nations in the world are developing renewable energy \nsources much faster than the United States is. America needs to \nreestablish leadership in renewable energy.\n  I oppose this amendment and, contrary to earlier statements, the \nrenewable portfolio standard provision in this bill, as modified, is as \nclose to the Texas RPS as possible, while accommodating regional \ndifferences. Why do I say that? Because under the Texas RPS statute, \nthe amount of new renewables is based on capacity. However, as \nimplemented by the Texas Public Utility Commission, the regulations \nconvert the capacity obligation to a generation standard.\n  I cite Chapter 25.173(h)(1) from the Texas RPS:\n\n       The total statewide renewable energy credit requirement for \n     each compliance period shall be calculated in terms of \n     megawatt hours and shall be equal to the renewable capacity \n     target multiplied by 8,760 hours per year, multiplied by the \n     appropriate capacity conversion factor. . . .\n\n  It says it all.\n  The section goes on to spell out exactly how the capacity standard is \nconverted to a generation standard. I ask unanimous consent that the \nregulations from the State of Texas be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Chapter 25. Substantive Rules Applicable to Electric Service Providers\n\n\n                   subchapter H. electrical planning\n\n     Division 1. Renewable energy resources and use of natural gas\n\n                 Sec. 25.173. Goal for Renewable Energy\n\n       (a) Purpose.

The \n     designated representative must have the authority to \n     represent and legally bind the owners and operators of the \n     renewable resource in all matters pertaining to the renewable \n     energy credits trading program.\n       (4) Early banking--Awarding renewable energy credits (RECs) \n     to generators for sale in the trading program prior to the \n     program's first compliance period.\n       (5) Existing facilities--Renewable energy generators placed \n     in service before September 1, 1999.\n       (6) Generation offset technology--Any renewable technology \n     that reduces the demand for electricity at a site where a \n     customer consumers electricity. An example of this technology \n     is solar water heating.\n       (7) New facilities--Renewable energy generators placed in \n     service on or after September 1, 1999. A new facility \n     includes the incremental capacity and associated energy from \n     an existing renewable facility achieved through repowering \n     activities undertaken on or after September 1, 1999.\n       (8) Off-grid generation--The generation of renewable energy \n     in an application that is not interconnected to a utility \n     transmission or distribution system.\n       (9) Program administrator--The entity approved by the \n     commission that is responsible for carrying out the \n     administrative responsibilities related to the renewable \n     energy credits trading program as set forth in subsection (g) \n     of this section.\n       (10) REC offset (offset)--An REC offset represents one MWh \n     of renewable energy from an existing facility that may be \n     used in place of an REC to meet a renewable energy \n     requirement imposed under this section. REC offsets may not \n     be traded, shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (i) \n     of this section, and shall be applied as set forth in \n     subsection (h) of this section.\n       (11) Renewable energy credit (REC or credit)--An REC \n     represents one megawatt hour (MWh) of renewable energy that \n     is physically metered and verified in Texas and meets the \n     requirements set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\n       (12) Renewable energy credit account (REC account)--An \n     account maintained by the renewable energy credits trading \n     program administrator for the purpose of tracking the \n     production, sale, transfer, and purchase, and retirement of \n     RECs by a program participant.\n       (13) Renewable energy credits trading program (trading \n     program)--The process of awarding, trading, tracking, and \n     submitting RECs as a means of meeting the renewable energy \n     requirements set out in subsection (d) of this section.\n       (14) Renewable energy resource (renewable resource)--A \n     resource that produces energy derived from renewable energy \n     technologies.\n       (15) Renewable energy technology--Any technology that \n     exclusively relies on an energy source that is naturally \n     regenerated over a short time and derived directly from the \n     sun, indirectly from the sun, or from moving water or other \n     natural movements and mechanisms of the environment. \n     Renewable energy technologies include those that rely on \n     energy derived directly from the sun, on wind, geothermal, \n     hydroelectric, wave, or tidal energy, or on biomass or \n     biomass-based waste products, including landfill gas. A \n     renewable energy technology does not rely on energy resources \n     derived from fossil fuels, waste products from fossil fuels, \n     or waste products from inorganic sources.\n       (16) Repowering--Modernizing or upgrading an existing \n     facility in order to increase its capacity or efficiency.\n       (17) Settlement period--The first calendar quarter \n     following a compliance period in which the settlement process \n     for that compliance year takes place.\n       (18) Small producer--A renewable resource that is less than \n     two megawatts (MW) in size.\n       (d) Renewable energy credits trading program (trading \n     program). Renewable energy credits may be generated, \n     transferred, and retired by renewable energy power \n     generation, competitive retailers, and other market \n     participants as set forth in this section.\n       (1) The program administrator shall apportion a renewable \n     resource requirement among all competitive retailers as a \n     percentage of the retail sales of each competitive retailer \n     as set forth in subsection (h) of this section. Each \n     competitive retailer shall be responsible for retiring \n     sufficient RECs as set forth in subsections (h) and (k) of \n     this section to comply with this section. The requirement to \n     purchase RECs pursuant to this section becomes effective on \n     the date each competitive retailer begins serving retail \n     electric customers in Texas.\n       (2) A power generating company may participate in the \n     program and may generate RECs and buy or sell RECs as set \n     forth in subsection (j) of this section.\n       (3) RECs shall be credited on an energy basis as set forth \n     in subsection (j) of this section.\n       (4) Municipally-owned utilities and distribution \n     cooperatives that do not offer customer choice are not \n     obligated to purchase RECs. However, regardless of whether \n     the municipally-owned utility or distribution cooperative \n     offers customer choice, a municipally-owned utility or \n     distribution cooperative possessing renewable resources that \n     meet the requirements of subsection (e) of this section may \n     sell RECs generated by such a resource to competitive \n     retailers as set forth in subsection (j) of this section.\n       Except where specifically stated, the provisions of this \n     section shall apply uniformly to all participants in the \n     trading program.\n       (e) Facilities eligible for producing RECs in the renewable \n     energy credits trading program. For a renewable facility to \n     be eligible to produce RECs in the trading program it must be \n     either a new facility or a small producer as defined in \n     subsection (c) of this section and must also meet the \n     requirements of this subsection:\n       (1) A renewable energy resource must not be ineligible \n     under subsection (f) of this section and must register \n     pursuant to subsection (n) of this section;\n       (2) The facility's above-market costs must not be included \n     in the rates of any utility, municipally-owned utility, or \n     distribution cooperative through base rates, a power cost \n     recovery factor (PCRF), stranded cost recovery mechanism, or \n     any other fixed or variable rate element charged to end \n     users;\n       (3) For a renewable energy technology that requires fossil \n     fuel, the facility's use of fossil fuel must not exceed 2.0% \n     of the total annual fuel input on a British thermal unit \n     (BTU) or equivalent basis;\n       (4) The output of the facility must be readily capable of \n     being physically metered and verified in Texas by the program \n     administrator. Energy from a renewable facility that is \n     delivered into a transmission system where it is commingled \n     with electricity from non-renewable resources can not be \n     verified as delivered to Texas customers. A facility is not \n     ineligible by virtue of the fact that the facility is a \n     generation-offset, off-grid, or on-site distributed renewable \n     facility if it otherwise meets the requirements of this \n     section; and\n       (5) For a municipally owned utility operating a gas \n     distribution system, any production or acquisition of \n     landfill gas that is directly supplied to the gas \n     distribution system is eligible to produce RECs based upon \n     the conversion of the thermal energy in BTUs to electric \n     energy in kWh using for the conversion factor the systemwide \n     average heat rate of the gas-fired units of the combined \n     utility's electric system as measured in BTUs per kWh.\n       (6) For industry-standard thermal technologies, the RECs \n     can be earned only on the renewable portion of energy \n     production. Furthermore, the contribution toward statewide \n     renewable capacity megawatt goals from such facilities would \n     be equal to the fraction of the facility's annual MWh energy \n     output from renewable fuel multiplied by the facility's \n     nameplate MV capacity.\n       (f) Facilities not eligible for producing RECs in the \n     renewable energy credits trading program. A renewable \n     facility is not eligible to produce RECs in the trading \n     program if it is:\n       (1) A renewable energy capacity addition associated with an \n     emissions reductions project described in Health and Safety \n     Code Sec. 382.5193, that is used to satisfy the permit \n     requirements in Health and Safety Code Sec. 382.0519;\n       (2) An existing facility that is not a small producer as \n     defined in subsection (c) of this section; or\n       (3) An existing fossil plant that is repowered to use a \n     renewable fuel.\n       (g) Responsibilities of program administrator. No later \n     than June 1, 2000, the commission shall approve an \n     independent entity or serve as the trading program \n     administrator. At a minimum, the program administrator shall \n     perform the following functions:\n       (1) Create accounts that track RECs for each participant in \n     the trading program;\n       (2) Award RECs to registered renewable energy facilities on \n     a quarterly basis based on verified meter reads;\n       (3) Assign offsets to competitive retailers on an annual \n     basis based on a nomination submitted by the competitive \n     retailer pursuant to subsection (n) of this section;\n       (4) Annually retire RECs that each competitive retailer \n     submits to meet its renewable energy requirement;\n       (5) Retire RECs at the end of each REC's three-year life;\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\n       (6) Maintain public information on its website that \n     provides trading program information to interested buyers and \n     sellers of RECs;\n       (7) Create an exchange procedure where persons may purchase \n     and sell RECs. The exchange shall ensure the anonymity of \n     persons purchasing or selling RECs. The program administrator \n     may delegate this function to an independent third party. The \n     commission shall approve any such delegation;\n       (8) Make public each month the total energy sales of \n     competititon retailers in Texas for the previous month;\n       (9) Perform audits of generators participating in the \n     trading program to verify accuracy of metered production \n     data;\n       (10) Allocate the renewable energy responsibility to each \n     competitive retailer in accordance with subsection (h) of \n     this section; and\n       (11) Submit an annual report to the commission. Beginning \n     with the program's first compliance period, the program \n     administrator shall submit a report to the commission on or \n     before April 15 of each calendar year. The report shall \n     contain information pertaining to renewable energy power \n     generators and competitive retailers. At a minimum, the \n     report shall contain:\n       (A) the amount of existing and new renewable energy \n     capacity in MW installed in the state by technology type, the \n     owner/operator of each facility, the date each facility began \n     to produce energy, the amount of energy generated in \n     megawatt-hours (MWh) each quarter for all capacity \n     participating in the trading program or that was retired from \n     service; and\n       (B) a listing of all competitive retailers participating in \n     the trading program, each competitive retailer's renewable \n     energy credit requirement, the number of offsets used by each \n     competitive retailer, the number of credits retired by each \n     competitive retailer, a listing of all competitive retailers \n     that were in compliance with the REC requirement, a listing \n     of all competitive retailers that failed to retire sufficient \n     REC requirement, and the deficiency of each competitive \n     retailer that failed to retire sufficient RECs to meet its \n     REC requirement.\n       (h) Allocation of REC purchase requirement to competitive \n     retailers. The program administrator shall allocate REC \n     requirements among competitive retailers. Any renewable \n     capacity that is retired before January 1, 2009 or any \n     capacity shortfalls that arise due to purchases of RECs from \n     out-of-state facilities shall be replaced and incorporated \n     into the allocation methodology set forth in this subsection. \n     Any changes to the allocation methodology to reflect \n     replacement capacity shall occur two compliance periods after \n     which the facility was retired or capacity shortfall \n     occurred. The program administrator shall use the following \n     methodology to determine the total annual REC requirement for \n     a given year and the final REC requirement for individual \n     competitive retailers:\n       (1) The total statewide REC requirement for each compliance \n     period shall be calculated in terms of MWh and shall be equal \n     to the renewable capacity target multiplied by 8,760 hours \n     per year, multiplied by the appropriate capacity conversion \n     factor set forth in subsection (j) of this section. The \n     renewable energy capacity targets for the compliance period \n     beginning January 1, of the year indicated shall be:\n       (A) 400 MW of new resources in 2002;\n       (B) 400 MW of new resources in 2003;\n       (C) 850 MW of new resources in 2004;\n       (D) 850 MW of new resources in 2005;\n       (E) 1,400 MW of new resources in 2006;\n       (F) 1,400 MW of new resources in 2007;\n       (G) 2,000 MW of new resources in 2008; and\n       (H) 2,000 MW of new resources in 2009 through 2019.\n       (2) The final REC requirement for an individual competitive \n     retailer for a compliance period shall be calculated as \n     follows:\n       (A) Each competitive retailer's preliminary REC requirement \n     is determined by dividing its total retail energy sales in \n     Texas by the total retail sales in Texas of all competitive \n     retailers, and multiplying that percentage by the total \n     statewide REC requirement for that compliance period.\n       (B) The adjusted REC requirement for each competitive \n     retailer that is entitled to an offset is determined by \n     reducing its preliminary REC requirement by the offsets to \n     which it qualifies, as determined under subsection (i) of \n     this section, with the maximum reduction equal to the \n     competitive retailer's preliminary REC requirement. The total \n     reductions for all competitive retailers is equal to the \n     total usable offsets for that compliance period.\n       (C) Each competitive retailer's final REC requirement for a \n     compliance period shall be increased to recapture the total \n     usable offsets calculated under subparagraph (B) of this \n     paragraph. The additional REC requirement shall be calculated \n     by dividing the competitive retailer's adjusted REC \n     requirement by the total adjusted REC requirement of all \n     competitive retailers. This fraction shall be multiplied by \n     the total usable offsets for that compliance period and this \n     amount shall be added to the competitive retailer's adjusted \n     REC requirement to produce the competitive retailer's final \n     REC requirement for the compliance period.\n       (i) Nomination and calculation of REC offsets.\n       (1) A REP, municipally-owned utility, G cooperative, \n     distribution cooperative, or an affiliate of a REP, \n     municipally-owned utility, or distribution cooperative, may \n     apply offsets to meet all or a portion of its renewable \n     energy purchase requirement, as calculated in subsection (h) \n     of this section, only if those offsets are nominated in a \n     filing with the commission by June 1, 2001. A G may \n     nominate the combined offsets for itself and its member \n     distribution cooperatives upon the presentation of a \n     resolution by its Board authorizing it to do so.\n       (2) The Commission shall verify any designations of REC \n     offsets and notify the program administrator of its \n     determination by December 31, 2001.\n       (3) REC offsets shall be equal to the average annual MWh \n     output of an existing resource for the years 1991-2000 or the \n     entire life of the existing resource, whichever is less.\n       (4) REC offsets qualify for use in a compliance period \n     under subsection (h) of this section only to the extent that:\n       (A) The resource producing the REC offset has continuously \n     since September 1, 1999 been owned by or its output has been \n     committed under contract to a utility, municipally-owned \n     utility, or cooperative nominating the resource under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection or, if the resource has been \n     committed under a contract that expired after September 1, \n     1999 and before January 1, 2002, it is owned by or its output \n     has been committed under contract to a utility, municipally-\n     owned utility, or cooperative on January 1, 2002; and\n       (B) The facility producing the REC offsets is operated and \n     producing energy during the compliance period in a manner \n     consistent with historic practice.\n       (5) If the production from a facility producing the REC \n     offset energy ceases for any reason, the competitive retailer \n     may no longer claim the REC offset against its REC \n     requirement.\n       (j) Calculation of capacity conversion factor. The capacity \n     conversion factor used by the program administrator to \n     allocate credits to competitive retailers shall be calculated \n     as follows:\n       (1) The capacity conversion factor (CCF) shall be \n     administratively set at 35% for 2002 and 2003, the first two \n     compliance periods of the program\n       (2) During the fourth quarter of the second compliance year \n     (2003), the CCF shall be readjusted to reflect actual \n     generator performance data associated with all renewable \n     resources in the trading program. The program administrator \n     shall adjust the CCF every two years thereafter and shall:\n       (A) be based on all renewable energy resources in the \n     trading program for which at least 12 months of performance \n     data is available;\n       (B) represent a weighted average of generator performance;\n       (C) use all valid performance data that is available for \n     each renewable resources; and\n       (D) ensure that the renewable capacity goals are attained.\n       (k) Production and transfer of REC's. The program \n     administrator shall administer a trading program for \n     renewable energy credits in accordance with the requirements \n     of this subsection.\n       (1) A REC will be awarded to the owner of a renewable \n     resource when a MWh is metered at that renewable resource. A \n     generator producing 0.5 MWh or greater as its last unit \n     generated should be awarded one REC on a quarterly basis. The \n     program administrator shall record the amount of metered MWh \n     and credit the REC account of the renewable resource that \n     generated the energy on a quarterly basis.\n       (2) The transfer of RECs between parties shall be effective \n     only when the transfer is recorded by the program \n     administrator.\n       (3) The program administrator shall require that RECs be \n     adequately identified prior to recording a transfer and shall \n     issue an acknowledgement of the transaction to parties upon \n     provision of adequate information. At a minimum, the \n     following information shall be provided:\n       (A) identification of the parties;\n       (B) REC serial number, REC issue date, and the renewable \n     resource that produced the REC;\n       (C) the number of RECs to be transferred; and\n       (D) the transaction date.\n       (4) A competitive retailer shall surrender RECs to the \n     program administrator for retirement from the market in order \n     to meet its REC allocation for a compliance period. The \n     program administrator will document all REC retirements \n     annually.\n       (5) On or after each April 1, the program administrator \n     will retire RECs that have not been retired by competitive \n     retailers and have reached the end of their three-year life.\n       (6) The program administrator may establish a procedure to \n     ensure that the award, transfer, and retirement of credits \n     are accurately recorded.\n       (l) Settlement process. Beginning in January 2003, the \n     first quarter following the compliance period shall be the \n     settlement period during which the following actions shall \n     occur:\n       (1) By January 31, the program administrator will notify \n     each competitive retailer of its total REC requirement for \n     the previous compliance period as determined pursuant to \n     subsection (h) of this section.\n       (2) By March 31, each competitive retailer must submit \n     credits to the program administrator from its account \n     equivalent to its REC requirement for the previous compliance \n     period. If the competitive retailer has insufficient credits \n     in its account to satisfy its obligation, and this shortfall \n     exceeds the applicable deficit allowance as set forth in\n\n[[Page S3280]]\n\n     subsection (m)(2) of this section, the competitive retailer \n     is subject to the penalty provisions in subsection (o) of \n     this section.\n       (m) Trading program compliance cycle.\n       (1) The first compliance period shall begin on January 1, \n     2002 and there will be 18 consecutive compliance periods. \n     Early banking of RECs is permissible and may commence no \n     earlier than July 1, 2001. The program's first settlement \n     period shall take place during the first quarter of 2003.\n       (2) A competitive retailer may incur a deficit allowance \n     equal to 5.0% of its REC requirement in 2002 and 2003 (the \n     first two compliance periods of the program). This 5.0% \n     deficit allowance shall not apply to entities that initiate \n     customer choice after 2003. During the first settlement \n     period, each competitive retailer will be subject to a \n     penalty for any REC shortfall that is greater than 5.0% of \n     its REC requirement under subsection (h) of this section. \n     During the second settlement period, each competitive \n     retailer will be subject to the penalty process for any REC \n     shortfall greater than 5.0% of the second year REC \n     allocation. All competitive retailers incurring a 5.0% \n     deficit pursuant to this subsection must make up the amount \n     of RECs associated with the deficit in the next compliance \n     period.\n       (3) The issue date of RECs created by a renewable energy \n     resource shall coincide with the beginning of the compliance \n     year in which the credits are generated. All RECs shall have \n     a life of three compliance periods, after which the program \n     administrator will retire them from the trading program.\n       (4) Each REC that is not used in the year of its creation \n     may be banked and is valid for the next two compliance years.\n       (5) A competitive retailer may meet its renewable energy \n     requirements for a compliance period with RECs issued in or \n     prior to that compliance period which have not been retired.\n       (n) Registration and certification of renewable energy \n     facilities. The commission shall register and certify all \n     renewable facilities that will produce either REC offsets or \n     RECs for sale in the trading program. To be awarded RECs or \n     REC offsets, a power generator must complete the registration \n     process described in this subsection. The program \n     administrator shall not award offsets or credits for energy \n     produced by a power generator before it has been certified by \n     the commission.\n       (1) The designated representative of the generating \n     facility shall file an application with the commission on a \n     form approved by the commission for each renewable energy \n     generation facility. At a minimum, the application shall \n     include the location, owner, technology, and rated capacity \n     of the facility and shall demonstrate that the facility meets \n     the resource eligibility criteria in subsection (e) of this \n     section.\n       (2) No later than 30 days after the designated \n     representative files the certification form with the \n     commission, the commission shall inform both the program \n     administrator and the designated representative whether the \n     renewable facility has met the certification requirements. At \n     that time, the commission shall either certify the renewable \n     facility as eligible to receive either RECs or offsets, or \n     describe an insufficiencies to be remedied. If the \n     application is contested, the time for acting is extended by \n     30 days.\n       (3) Upon receiving notice of certification of new \n     facilities, the program administrator shall create an REC \n     account for the designated representative of the renewable \n     resource.\n       (4) The commission may make on-site visits to any certified \n     unit of a renewable energy resource and may decertify any \n     unit if it is not in compliance with the provisions of this \n     subsection.\n       (5) A decertified renewable generator may not be awarded \n     RECs. However, any RECs awarded by the program administrator \n     and transferred to a competitive retailer prior to the \n     decertification remain valid.\n       (o) Penalties and enforcement. If by April 1 of the year \n     following a compliance year it is determined that a \n     competitive retailer with an allocated REC purchase \n     requirement has insufficient credits to satisfy its \n     allocation, the competitive retailer shall be subject to the \n     administrative penalty provisions of PURA Sec. 15.023 as \n     specified in this subsection.\n       (1) Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, \n     a penalty will be assessed for that portion of the deficient \n     credits.\n       (2) The penalty shall be the lesser of $50 per MWh or, upon \n     presentation of suitable evidence of market value by the \n     competitive retailer, 200% of the average market value of \n     credits for that compliance period.\n       (3) There will be no obligation on the competitive retailer \n     to purchase RECs for deficits, whether or not the deficit was \n     within or was not within the competitive retailer's \n     reasonable control, except as set forth in subsection (m)(2) \n     of this section.\n       (4) In the event that the commission determines that events \n     beyond the reasonable control of a competitive retailer \n     prevented it from meeting its REC requirement there will be \n     no penalty assessed.\n       (5) A party is responsible for conducting sufficient \n     advance planning to acquire its allotment of RECs. Failure of \n     the spot or short-term market to supply a party with the \n     allocated number of RECs shall not constitute an event \n     outside the competitive retailer's reasonable control. Events \n     or circumstances that are outside of a party's reasonable \n     control may include weather-related damage, mechanical \n     failure, lack of transmission capacity or availability, \n     strikes, lockouts, actions of a governmental authority that \n     adversely effect the generation, transmission, or \n     distribution of renewable energy from an eligible resource \n     under contract to a purchaser.\n       (p) Renewable resources eligible for sale in the Texas \n     wholesale and retail markets. Any energy produced by a \n     renewable resource may be bought and sold in the Texas \n     wholesale market or to retail customers in Texas and marketed \n     as renewable energy if it is generated from a resource that \n     meets the definition in subsection (c)(14) of this section.\n       (q) Periodic review. The commission shall periodically \n     assess the effectiveness of the energy-based credits trading \n     program in this section to maximize the energy output from \n     the new capacity additions and ensure that the goal for \n     renewable energy is achieved in the most economically-\n     efficient manner. If the energy-based trading program is not \n     effective, performance standards will be designed to ensure \n     that the cumulative installed renewable capacity in Texas \n     meets the requirements of PURA Sec. 39.904.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to finish. We have had these \nbattles since I came to Congress in 1975. We recognized at that time we \nwere so vulnerable with respect to our oil supplies that it was \nessential we put ourselves on a course that could make us much more \nindependent. We have made very little progress in that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend? The Chair inquires, \ndid the Senator from Nevada relinquish the floor?\n  Mr. REID. I had not finished.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Fine, let me finish quickly.\n  Mr. REID. I am not finished, though. If I can proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I will be very quick. I apologize.\n  Mr. President, the manager of this bill, Senator Bingaman, has noted \nthat this amendment is opposed by numerous organizations, some of which \nare energy coalitions, not just environmental groups, although they \njoin with us also in opposing this amendment:\n\n       The Nickles amendment is the latest in a sustained attempt \n     by power companies to undermine efforts to diversify \n     America's energy supply with clean renewable energy.\n\n  It is wrong.\n\n       The Nickles amendment would reduce diversity of \n     technologies and states that benefit from the RPS.\n       Under a lower price cap, only the very lowest-cost \n     renewable energy technologies can benefit from an RPS--\n     primarily wind power at the very best sites. Biomass, \n     geothermal and solar would be at a significant disadvantage \n     to meet the portfolio standard if these lower credits are \n     adopted.\n\n  And that affects Western States. Not only would it be geothermal and \nsolar, but, of course, wind. The wind blows a lot in the West. The \nNickles amendment would reduce benefits to Western States with good \nresources about which I have spoken. The Nickles amendment would reduce \nthe amount of renewable energy developed.\n  It is from all perspectives undermining what we are trying to \naccomplish in this legislation, which is develop renewable energy for \nthis country and having not only incentives, but there would be a \nrequirement to do it. Voluntarism simply has not worked.\n  Do not believe the industry's claim that this will cost too much \nmoney. The Bush administration's EIA found that a 10-percent RPS would \nsave consumers money.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment. I hope this is the \nlast weakening amendment to the RPS that is in this bill. The bill as \nit now stands is good, and I think we should vote like we have the \nprevious three times and not let this amendment weaken the standards in \nthis bill relating to renewables.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have a few more comments. Logic should \nmake this obvious. If you can provide energy that does not cost you any \nmoney--solar and wind, for example--is it not logical to put it in the \nmix? That is all we are saying. The Department of Energy agrees with us \nand says it will save money.\n  I understand those from the oil-producing States do not want this \nprovision, but common sense tells us it is the best thing we can do. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, we \nare going to vote on this amendment shortly. Staff should notify their \nSenators.\n  I wish to make a couple comments.\n  One, the Department of Energy supports this amendment. It does not \noppose it.\n  Two, as to colleagues saying this amendment does not cost anything, \nthey are not talking about the people who know something about the \namendment. The Energy Information Administration talks about the cost \nto States in the millions and millions of dollars. The State of Florida \nshows about a $450 million increase.\n  For my colleagues' information, I have a letter from the Public \nService Commission in the State of Florida. The letter says they \nsupport this amendment to lower the amount of the penalty from 3 cents \nto 1.5 cents, and that it would reduce the cost of the Federal mandate \non the Florida ratepayers. I happen to think those people know \nsomething about this issue.\n  I have letters from utility companies. Some people say these are oil \ncompanies. I am talking about utility companies. This is not oil \ncompanies versus other companies. This is about an assault on \nratepayers because we are getting ready to say you have to have 10 \npercent of your power from renewables. We did not change that. But if \nyou do not make it--and I will tell my colleagues, it is not easy to \nmake that.\n  There was an article in the Wall Street Journal about the city of \nJacksonville. The city of Jacksonville has a renewable standard of 7.5 \npercent. They have tried a lot of alternative sources of power. Guess \nwhat. They are not there yet. I hope they get there, but they have \nfound out that some of these alternative sources of power cost a lot of \nmoney, and the ratepayers are objecting.\n  Nantucket, a very pristine area a lot of us have enjoyed off the \ncoast, wants to have renewables. They talked about having a wind farm. \nWind farms are subsidized a lot through the Tax Code. There was an \neffort to build a wind farm off the coast, but there is a lot of \nobjection from environmentalists because of what it would do to bird, \nmigration and to the environment as well.\n  The point is, yes, there is a desire by many to go to renewables, but \nthere is also a penalty. This bill has a very high penalty. It has a \npenalty twice as high as that proposed by the Clinton administration.\n  What Senator Breaux, myself, Senator Miller, and Senator Voinovich \nhave offered is a compromise. It does not eliminate the renewable \nstandard. It says let's reduce the penalty to the same number the \nClinton administration proposed.\n  How much is the penalty? It is 1.5 cents a kilowatt hour. How much is \nthat? The wholesale cost of electricity is 3 cents around the country. \nIn some areas, it is as low as 2.2 cents, and in other areas it is \ncloser to 4 cents. The nationwide wholesale cost of electricity is \nright around 3 cents.\n  The penalty under the Bingaman proposal in the underlying bill for \nnot complying is 3 cents. That is a lot. That is 100 percent of the \ncost of electricity. We are telling people you have to pay that kind of \npenalty if you do not make the target. That is a heck of a gun at your \nhead. As a matter of fact, the penalty is so high on some utilities \nthat produce a lot of electricity--and, yes, maybe electricity is \nprimarily produced by coal, oil, and gas--it is a heavy hit. It is not \ninsignificant when the CEO of Southern Company estimates the cumulative \ncost of this mandate on Southern Company through the year 2000 will be \nfrom $3 billion to $6.5 billion. That is not insignificant.\n  For somebody to say they think it will not cost anything is absurd. \nDid the CEO of Southern Company put his name on this letter, and is he \nfactually wrong? I do not think that is the case. It is the reason this \namendment is supported by almost every utility in the country. It is \nthe reason this amendment is supported by the Chamber of Commerce, the \nNFIB, and the National Association of Manufacturers. Somebody is going \nto have to pay the bill. Guess what. It is not the utilities that pay \nthe bill. They are going to pass it on to their ratepayers.\n  If we do not adopt this amendment, there is going to be a significant \nhit on ratepayers. It is going to happen and people should know it. \nThey should know we are voting on whether we are going to have electric \nrates go up significantly. This amendment tries to mitigate it. They \nare still going to go up because there is a penalty of 1.5 cents. That \nis about 50 percent of the wholesale price of electricity. That is \nstill pretty significant. If we do 3 cents, it is 100 percent. That is \na big hit, not to mention the fact in addition to the 3 cents, there is \nalso already in the Tax Code--it has already been agreed upon--a 1.7-\ncent tax credit for renewables.\n  So we give a tax credit. That is great. But to have this heavy a \nmandate is a big hit on consumers. It is in the hundreds of millions of \ndollars in almost every State, including States in the Northeast.\n  I am going to correct my colleague on the Texas renewable standard. I \nhave the greatest respect for my colleague from Nevada. I love him like \na brother. The Texas renewable standard--and maybe we should have the \nSenator from Texas present because he argued this before in this \nChamber, and he said the underlying bill--to paraphrase Senator Gramm \nof Texas--is so far from being the Texas renewable standard it is \nremarkable. What we have in Texas is capacity, not energy-produced, and \nwhat we have in Texas is equal to a 2-percent standard, not a 10-\npercent standard. There is a big difference.\n  I believe I understood the Senator from Nevada to say there was a 15-\npercent renewable. My guess is that includes hydro. The underlying bill \ndoes not include hydro. Hydro is pretty clean power. We have Hoover \nDam. That is pretty clean power. It generates a lot of electricity. It \nis water. It is great power. It is cheap. It is very good power. It is \nnot included as renewable under the definition of the underlying bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I am going to insert in the Record several statements. I want to \ninsert a letter from the American Corn Growers Association, very big \nadvocates of renewable sources, but they are also supportive of this \namendment because they believe this is a proper mix. They also know \nthat their ratepayers, their users, the ones who grow corn, buy a lot \nof electricity, think this is the proper blend. They want renewable \nsources.\n  I will read a part of this letter.\n\n       ACGA also supports a fair and equitable renewable portfolio \n     standard requiring a portion of the Nation's energy to come \n     from renewable sources. However, while we want to do \n     everything we can to promote renewable production by farmers \n     we must oppose undue mandates that will impose additional \n     fuel costs on all rural consumers.\n       Senator Nickles' amendment will significantly reduce the \n     cost of complying with the standard, and in turn protect \n     rural America from excessive price increases for electricity, \n     by cutting the energy credits from 3 cents per kilowatt-hour \n     to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\n  I also wanted to mention a company called Mid-America Energy Company. \nThis is a company that is based in Omaha, NE. They have analyzed this \nproposal and developed estimates on increased costs that will result \nfrom its enactment of RPS.\n\n       According to our preliminary calculations, implementing RPS \n     in S. 517 will begin increasing electricity costs for Mid-\n     America's regulated and competitive customers in 2007 by \n     600,000, with costs rising to more than $40 million in the \n     year 2019.\n\n  This is in rural America. This is in Middle America. This is in the \ncorn-growing areas. This is one of the largest utilities in the area \nthat said this is going to be a big hit that they are going to pass on \nto their consumers.\n  I am surprised there is any opposition to this amendment because this \namendment does not eliminate the RPS standard, it does not eliminate \nthe 10-percent standard; all it does is say, let us reduce the penalty \nto 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour. It is the same proposal the Clinton \nadministration supported.\n\n  I do not say things lightly on this floor. I want to be as accurate \nas possible, and if I am ever inaccurate, I want to be corrected, and I \nwill stand corrected. This amendment will save billions of dollars. I \nhad one letter from one company, Southern Company, that said it was \nbillions of dollars of expense to them and their customers. That is a\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\nfew States. I cannot say that is one State. It is a few States. It is a \nbig utility. In my State, for one company, it is something like $60 \nmillion. They showed it each year: Here is the production. Here is \ntheir cost of compliance. And it increases substantially. By the last \nyear, it is something like $60 million.\n  Senator Kyl alluded to the fact that in my entire State it is over \n$100 million. The State of Vermont, I believe he said, was $7 million.\n  This also came from the Energy Information Agency. So maybe people \nare able to distort figures and say it does not cost anything. It does \ncost something. One cannot say that companies are going to have to pay \n3 cents per kilowatt hour if they do not meet a target and say it does \nnot cost anything. There are significant costs, and ratepayers will pay \nfor it. I do not think the utilities pay for it, I think the ratepayers \npay for it, and I think it is time we stand up for ratepayers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment I have offered with \nSenator Breaux, Senator Miller, and Senator Voinovich.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I will make a few more comments and \nthen move to table the amendment. I think we have had a lot of debate. \nEveryone knows the issues. I think it is clear this is the fourth \namendment we have dealt with on the Senate floor in an attempt to \nundermine the renewable portfolio standard we have in the bill. There \nare a lot of figures that have been cited, many of which have no basis \nin fact, as far as I can tell.\n  One of the statements we heard was that this was going to cost--if we \ngo ahead and keep the bill as it is currently--the ratepayers of \nCalifornia $243 million a year, or some such figure. The reality is, in \nour bill we are saying by the year 2005 each State will generate 1 \npercent of the power they sell--each utility will generate 1 percent of \nthe power they sell from renewable sources.\n  In California, 12.19 percent of the power sold today is from \nrenewable sources.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does that 12 percent include hydro?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, it includes the hydro that is given credit for in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I did not think hydro was included in this bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. No, hydro is included in this bill, to an extent, and \nthis includes the hydro that is given credit for.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, existing hydro is not \nincluded in the bill. Only incremental new hydro is included in the \nbill, and I do not know how the Senator can count that for existing \npercentages.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As I understand it, the existing hydro is deducted from \nthe base before the calculation is made. So to that extent, existing \nhydro is included in the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I know the Senator is going to move to table this \namendment, and I think that is fine. I think we are ready to vote. The \nSenator has mentioned this is the fourth amendment we have dealt with \nin regard to renewables. One of the reasons I think we have had a few \namendments dealing with this is that it costs so much money, and we \nhave never had a hearing, and we never had a markup.\n  I happen to be a member of the Energy Committee. I would have loved \nto have participated in a hearing and a markup on this section. I would \nlove to hear from experts on both sides of this aisle how much this \namendment would really cost, but we were denied that opportunity. So it \nis one of the reasons we have to legislate on the floor of the Senate, \nbecause we did not have the opportunity to do it in committee.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Reclaiming my time, my colleague has had ample \nopportunity to argue his side of the case today and several weeks ago. \nWe know his view on it. He is not in favor of the renewable portfolio \nstandard. This amendment would undermine the renewable portfolio \nstandard we have in the bill because what it would do is make it much \nless likely that renewables, other than wind, to be very specific, \nwould be used to any significant degree. So those States that depend \nupon biomass as a renewable, those States that depend upon biothermal \nas a renewable, those States that depend upon solar power as a \nrenewable might find it more difficult.\n  We do not think the amendment makes sense. We think it will undermine \nthe renewable portfolio standard. On that basis, I urge my colleagues--\n--\n  Mr. NICKLES. Before the Senator moves to table----\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. On that basis, I urge my colleagues to--if the Senator \nwants further debate, I am not trying to cut off debate, but he has \nconcluded his debate, as I understand it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will yield for one additional question, if it is a \nquestion.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to insert something into the Record.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. If he wants to insert something into the Record, I am \nglad to have him do that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague yielding for this request. I \nknow he wants to move to table.\n  Earlier, I was looking for a letter I could not find. This is a \nletter from the Northeast Utilities. I ask unanimous consent that this \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       I recognize that many of the Senators from New England \n     supported the federal RPS portfolio. While NU believes that \n     renewable programs should be developed on the state level, we \n     support the further development of renewable sources of \n     energy. We are concerned, however, that our consumers in New \n     England will be penalized by the program included in the \n     Senate bill. As you know, the RPS provision in the bill \n     applies only to shareholder-owned utilities that sell more \n     than 1 million megawatt-hours per year at the retail level. \n     Federal agencies, state and municipal utilities and electric \n     cooperatives are exempt from meeting the RPS requirements \n     currently included in the bill. It also appears that self-\n     generators are exempt.\n       Given these exemptions, PSNH will be the only utility in \n     New Hampshire that would be required to participate in the \n     program. It creates a very uneven field for us and will cost \n     our customers an estimated $22 million a year. This provision \n     goes directly against the intent of current NH law which \n     encourages PSNH and other energy companies to find ways to \n     mitigate the high cost of purchases from renewable sources.\n       Also, the federal penalty that is set forward in the bill \n     for not submitting the required number of credits will hit \n     consumers in Connecticut and Massachusetts with a ``double \n     whammy,'' as they already have to pay penalties if they do \n     not achieve the levels set forth in the state programs that \n     are already in existence. It would in essence, penalize \n     Connecticut and Massachusetts for having state programs.\n       Though it would be our preference to see these provisions \n     changed dramatically in conference, the Senate will likely \n     have the opportunity to vote for an amendment by Senator \n     Nickles that reduces the penalty in the bill from 3 cents to \n     a more reasonable 1.5 cents. Remember, the goal is not only \n     to increase the number of renewable sources, but to also to \n     lower costs to consumers. Please support the Nickles RPS \n     amendment.\n                                                       Mike Morris\n  Mr. NICKLES. The key point of this letter says:\n\n       PSNH will be the only utility in New Hampshire that would \n     be required to participate in the program. It creates a very \n     uneven field for us and will cost our consumers an estimated \n     $22 million a year.\n\n  It talks about the impact on the northeastern part of the country, \nincluding New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I move to table the amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, what is the request?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I say to the Senator, I was recognized to offer an \namendment. The amendment has been called up. We are on amendment No. \n3274, which we discussed and is in order. But Senator Durbin has asked \nto lay down an amendment that will take 1 minute, and then we will go \nback to this amendment, if that would be OK with you and the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I have no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object--and I may not object--\nmy concern is we have six pending amendments, I am told. I would like \nto try to work through the amendments. I am sure the manager of the \nbill feels the same way. I did not hear the request.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is 2 minutes to Senator Durbin, and then I will get \nright on with my amendment, and we will move through with others who \nare waiting.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I did not hear the unanimous consent \nrequest. I am standing here, and I have an amendment that I have been \nwanting to offer. I would like to know what the unanimous consent \nrequest is, if the Chair could so inform me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana sought consent that \nshe might yield for 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois in order to \nallow the Senator to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Iowa will yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield to get a clarification.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am asking for 2 minutes to call up an amendment and lay \nit aside--no speeches, no debate, no vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object, Senator Fitzgerald has \nbeen waiting quite a while. I am sure he would certainly be willing to \naccommodate the two Senators with 2 minutes each, but I would propose \nthat we go back and forth, if the Senator from Iowa has an amendment.\n  I remind all Members, we have a limited amount of time. So as we \nbegin to accept amendments, without disposing of them, we are going to \nrun into a time constraint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from \nAlaska, we now have pending, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana--and \nthis goes to prove that the Good Samaritan never goes unpunished--for \nyielding 2 minutes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3342 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending business be \nset aside so that I can call up amendment No. 3342.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3342.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the nonbusiness use limitation with respect to the \n   credit for the installation of certain small wind energy systems)\n\n       In Division H, on page 98, line 16, strike ``If'' and \n     insert ``Except in the case of qualified wind energy property \n     expenditures, if''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am grateful that I have had the chance \nto work with Senators Baucus and Grassley to provide a small tax \nincentive for installation of small wind systems in America's farms, \nranches, and other places in rural areas that have wind potential. \nSpecifically, my amendment would give wind power--a limitless and clean \nenergy source--a level playing field with solar, geothermal energy, \nwhich are in current law, and fuel cell energy, which is included in \nthe underlying tax title. All of these renewable energies are eligible \nfor a 10 percent business investment credit under section 48 of the tax \ncode. And I think we should give people who wish to tap into wind \nenergy the same credit. With my amendment, farmers, ranchers and other \nbusiness owners who wish to install a small wind energy system up to 75 \nkilowatts can do so, and get a credit on their tax return worth 10 \npercent of the cost of installing the wind system. I applaud the work \nof Senators Baucus and Grassley, as well as the rest of the Finance \nCommittee, which put together a package of energy tax incentives. I am \nhopeful that the small wind system amendment that I have filed will be \naccepted as part of the tax incentive package. I know Senators Baucus \nand Grassley are working diligently to make this happen in the near \nfuture.\n  However, in the event that the Finance Committee and bill managers do \nnot succeed in working something out on this provision, I am calling up \nthis amendment so that it may be considered by the Senate at the \nappropriate time. This amendment makes small changes to the underlying \ntax title, so that farmers, ranchers, and small business owners will be \neligible for a tax incentive when they choose to install a wind energy \nsystem on their property. This amendment would have an effect similar \nto adding wind to section 48 of the tax code, where solar, geothermal, \nand now fuel cell energy already receive a business investment credit.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Louisiana \nwith gratitude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3274\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am now prepared, after that slight \ndetour, to get back on amendment No. 3274, which is a very important \namendment. Many of us have worked on this amendment now for many weeks \nin an attempt to try to find and establish a fairer way to fund the new \ntransmission lines that are necessary to move electricity from one part \nof this country to another, to meet the growing demand of our \ntransmission grid system.\n  Let me begin by sharing a chart that I have used several times in \nthis Chamber to show what the problem is and to ask the Senate to \nconsider, very strongly, this proposed solution to our current dilemma.\n  We have a great dilemma on our hands. We have, some people might \ndescribe, a crisis on our hands. We have a system that we are moving \nto, a deregulated, more market-based system, which I believe \nultimately, with the right safeguards, will be very good for all of us, \nfor all of our States. Most importantly, our constituents and our \nbusinesses, both large and small--our consumers, our retailers--all of \nus will benefit from this new efficient system. Why? Because costs will \nbe lowered, efficiencies will be increased. And we can make sure that \nwhen people go to turn their light switch on, the light will actually \ncome on.\n  It is very important. Part of the problem is that we are not \nproducing enough energy or electricity in our own country. Part of the \nproblem is we are not doing our part at conserving what we should. So \nthere is a mismatch between what we need and what we are producing.\n  But also, even if we got that balance right, which I hope we are \ngoing to try to do through this bill, the problem is, because we are \nproducing electricity in some parts of the country and using it in \nothers, some parts of the country produce more than they use, and some \nparts of the country do not produce as much as they need, we have to \nmove it.\n  As you can see from this chart I have in the Chamber, the demand for \nelectricity, represented by this blue line, has been increasing \nsubstantially. But the investment in building these transmission lines \nhas been decreasing. So this gap right here is a real problem.\n\n  It has to be closed or even if we would drill the way the Senator \nfrom Alaska and I would hope we would drill, and produce more oil and \ngas and other fuels for electricity, and invest in more nuclear power, \nwe still need to have more transmission lines built. The reason we are \nnot is because there is a flaw in the system where the incentives are \nnot in the right place.\n  My amendment, in short, will create a participant funding mechanism \nso that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can issue rules \ngoverning the pricing of these transmission services. I am reminded of \na quote I have become familiar with and actually like that says: All \nsome folks want is their fair share, and yours.\n  The problem is, we have to create a system that is very fair and \nsmart so that we put the incentives in the right places, and when the \ncost allocations to build these transmission lines are set by FERC, \nthat they are set in a way that whomever is using them, pays for them. \nIf we don't do that, there will be no incentive to build them because \npeople who don't need them won't build them. The people who need them \nwon't get charged for them, and they won't get built. And blackouts and \nbrownouts will become more of the rule as opposed to the exception.\n  This amendment will provide a platform for true fairness in \nelectricity pricing, paving the way for much needed transmission \nexpansion at the national level. Over the past 10 years, as I have \nshown, peak demand growth for electricity has increased by 17 percent, \nwhile transmission investment has declined by 45 percent. What is even \nmore troubling is that current demand for electricity is projected to \nincrease by 25 percent over the next 10 years with only a modest \nincrease in transmission capacity. Again, if we don't do something, we \nare going to continue to have a situation where power does not reach \nthe people who need it.\n  The current transmission pricing mechanism at wholesale levels still \nemploys an old, what I would call, socialized rate method of pricing. \nIts effect is to continuously increase the rates for local customers, \neven though most of the beneficiaries may be outside of the region.\n  This antiquated pricing method has dampened the push to enhance \ncapacity in energy-producing States such as Louisiana and others--and \nthis is not just a Louisiana-specific amendment; it affects us all in \nmany States--as State regulators are reluctant, understandably so, to \npass excessive transmission costs off to local customers when the \nbeneficiaries will primarily be out-of-State or out-of-region \ncustomers.\n  Meanwhile, energy-dependent regions--and there are some regions that \nare more dependent than others--are denied cheap and reliable \nelectricity.\n  Electricity price spikes in the Midwest in the summer of 1998 were \ncaused in part by transmission constraints, limiting the ability of the \nregion to import electricity from other regions of the country. You may \nremember during the summer of 2000, our dilapidated transmission \ninfrastructure limited the ability to sell low-cost power from the \nMidwest to the South during a period of peak demand, resulting in \nhigher prices. I could go on and on with examples.\n  In California, path 15 is a notorious transmission bottleneck. The \neast coast has also suffered. So no region of the country has been \nspared.\n  Surely there must be a fairer and smarter way to allocate costs which \nwould stimulate growth instead of having this decline. It is not fair \nto expect customers in energy-generating States such as Louisiana to \npay for transmission expansion when it is primarily being developed for \nout-of-State use.\n\n[[Page S3285]]\n\n  In addition, the lack of transmission capacity under this archaic \npricing method continues to deny customers in energy-importing States \nthe benefit of cheaper electricity from other regions of the country. \nThe best policy for efficient, competitive wholesale pricing is \ntherefore participant-funded expansion. In this system, market \nparticipants fund expansions to the transmission network in return for \ntransmission rights created by that investment. This approach gives \nproper economic incentives for new generator location and transmission \nexpansion decisions.\n  The participant funding concept is not new. This is not something we \nhave dreamed up in the last few weeks. It is not something with which \nthe industry itself is not familiar. It has been a concept that has \nbeen successfully implemented in the natural gas industry through \nincremental pricing.\n  As a result of incremental pricing in the natural gas industry, \nproposed annual additions in 2002 to natural gas pipeline capacity have \nincreased by 100 percent relative to 1999. In other words, we are in \nthe process in this energy bill of building national systems to move \nfuel and energy and power from States that produce it to States that \nneed it. Just as we built an interstate highway system, we are building \nan interstate natural gas pipeline system. We also have to build an \ninterstate electric grid system. And we are moving from something that \nwas very regulated and very parochial and very State oriented to one \nthat regional and national.\n  We have to create that grid. If we do not put this in place, the \nincentives simply will not be there, and much of our work will be for \nnaught.\n  It is important to note this amendment provides FERC with the option. \nThere are many people who think this amendment is a mandate. It is an \noption to permit participant funding for certain new transmission \nfacilities upon request of RTOs or other FERC-approved transmission \norganizations. The amendment does not make participant funding \nmandatory. It is simply a pricing option for FERC.\n  Initially, I knew there were many different opinions about this \namendment. We tried to build a consensus. But unfortunately, there is a \nlot of self-interest and parochialism in this debate. We have struggled \nto overcome it.\n  Electricity policymaking should not be governed by what is popular, \nbut what is necessary. There is not unanimous consensus in Louisiana \nfor this amendment. It is not going to win me a popularity contest. But \nI know there has to be a better system of pricing for electric \ntransmission so that we can move power from one part of the country to \nthe other and get everybody what they need when they need it at a fair \nand reasonable price. The growth of our economy depends on it. Jobs \ndepend on it. Businesses depend on it. This is what we should do.\n  I realize this amendment has unfortunately been the subject of a \npretty strong campaign of disinformation. I hope what I have shared and \nshown, in as simple a way as I can, helps to clear up the fact that it \nis not a mandate. The current path has us going in the wrong direction. \nWe have to come up with something new, something that is flexible, \nsomething that is fair, something that will work. I hope most certainly \nthat we can get past the inertia.\n  Therefore, I have consulted with Senator Bingaman of New Mexico and \nthe Senator from Alaska. I have proposed, instead of calling for a vote \nat this particular time, that the Energy Committee take up further \nstudy of transmission pricing; that the committee would hold a hearing \nin a short period of time with the Commissioners of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, as well as industry leaders.\n  I believe this issue has significant merit, and it is the right \napproach to solving a real and serious problem for our Nation.\n  We need to build a stronger, more reliable transmission grid. So I \nwant to, at this time, ask Senator Bingaman for his comments and thank \nhim for his cooperation. We must push forward with a good system.\n  He has indicated that he would be amenable to a hearing, et cetera. \nAt this time, I ask him if that is his understanding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response, let me say, first, I \ncompliment the Senator from Louisiana for raising this very important \nissue. It is an important issue and also a very complicated issue. It \nis one that we have had the chance to talk about to some extent. But, \nclearly, we do need, in the Energy Committee, to look at this issue and \nallow witnesses to come in and explain it in more depth. Before we take \naction, that would be my preference.\n  So I would be glad to commit that we will schedule a hearing later \non, once we get back to some kind of opportunity to have hearings in \nthe Energy Committee on issues such as this. I would be anxious to have \na hearing and hear from the witnesses that the Senator from Louisiana \nbelieves are most informed on this issue.\n  I do think it is premature--at least for me, and perhaps for many \nSenators--to be making a judgment on what to do at this point. But it \nis an important issue.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Louisiana for raising it, and I \nhope, following a hearing in the committee, we will be in a much better \nposition to craft legislation to deal with it or determine what is the \nproper course.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for his willingness to work with me \nand with the coalition of Senators--both Democrats and Republicans--and \nbelieve this is the right step to take to create the kind of \ntransmission grid necessary. I look forward to working with him at that \nhearing to focus more attention on this important subject.\n  Madam President, at this time, after submitting more material for the \nRecord, I would like to ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3274 \nbe laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment, No. 3124.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment must be pending to make that \nrequest.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3124\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3124.\n  If I may have a couple of moments, then I will proceed to put the \nquestion to the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, my amendment removes subsidies and \nincentives currently in the pending bill for garbage incinerators.\n  Many of my colleagues may not realize it, but built into this energy \nbill is the promotion of more waste incineration around the country by \ndefining waste incinerators as a form of renewable energy.\n  Waste incineration is not a form of renewable energy. It is not \nreally renewable, and it certainly isn't clean and environmentally \nfriendly in the way of wind or solar power energy. The Daschle \nsubstitute, which is now pending, defines garbage incineration as \nrenewable energy. Garbage incineration is, therefore, eligible for all \nthe incentives--or what amounts to subsidies, I would say--as though it \nwere a clean and renewable source of energy.\n\n  My amendment removes the subsidies and incentives for garbage \nincineration by excluding solid waste incineration from the bill's \ndefinition of renewable energy. I tell my colleagues that it would be, \nin my judgment, a very serious mistake to allow the bill to leave this \nChamber with an incentive for waste incinerators all over the country.\n  Back in the 1980s, the Illinois Legislature passed an incentive for \nwaste incineration, and within a matter of a few years waste \nincinerators were planned for all parts of Illinois. A couple of them, \nin fact, were built. They were spewing harmful, toxic pollutants, and \npeople were up in arms and demanded that the legislature of Illinois \nrepeal the incentives and subsidies they had for waste incinerators.\n  We do not want to make the same mistake nationwide that my State made \nat one time. Let's learn from their mistake and let's also stick with \ncommon sense. We don't need subsidies and incentives for waste \nincinerators. We don't want to subsidize the pollution of the United \nStates of America.\n  With that, I see my good friend and colleague from New Jersey who \nshould be recognized.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\n  (Mr. Dayton assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, he has no right to do that. Mr. President, I \nhave no problem with the Senator from New Jersey speaking, but today we \nhave been doing too much yielding and that is not appropriate, unless \nyou have a question or something like that.\n  I have spoken to the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham. He wishes to \nspeak in opposition to my friend from Illinois for about 15 minutes. It \nis my understanding that the Senator from New Jersey is speaking in \nfavor of the amendment of the Senator from Illinois. I ask the Senator \nfrom New Jersey how long he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Roughly a minute.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey wishes to speak \nfor up to 5 minutes and the Senator from Florida for up to 15 minutes. \nSo I ask that we vote on this matter at 6:25. I ask that at that time \nSenator Bingaman be recognized to offer a motion to table, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support this amendment \nthat would recognize what I think is a very commonsense principle--that \nsolid waste is not considered a renewable in the way that we are \nintending with regard to this legislation.\n  It seems to me that when we are putting dioxins, mercury, lead, and \narsenic into the air, somehow or another we should not be using that as \na basis for alternative energy sources--at least in my commonsense \ninterpretation. We were trying to get solar and wind--things that are \nclean alternatives--to produce energy as substitutes for fossil fuels \nand other focuses on production of energy.\n  So it seems to me that we are taking a step backward in dealing with \nour environment at the same time we are defining biomass or alternative \nenergies as garbage. Certainly, in our State, where air quality issues \nare an extraordinary concern to the public, we have a number of these \nincinerators, about which the public has great protest.\n  I believe this amendment is conforming to what the intent, at least, \nof how I have felt about alternative energy sources, and I wholly \nsupport pulling back this incentive and subsidization for garbage as an \nalternative energy source.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment that has been offered by the Senator from Illinois. The fact \nthat the two proponents have used their own States and their experience \nas the reasons for their opposition makes my point. My point is this is \nnot an issue where one size fits all. It is not an issue where we can \nrequire uniformity of treatment across the entire mass of the United \nStates of America. I will try to explain, using illustrations from my \nown State, why I think that is inappropriate policy.\n  What this amendment would do is exclude the small amount of municipal \nsolid waste to energy which is part of the current renewable portfolio \nstandard. Over my objection, this bill does not allow new waste-to-\nenergy incineration to count as renewable. We are only talking about \nwhether you can include in the base amount for your State that which is \nalready in place.\n  A few weeks ago, in a statement I submitted for the Record, I pointed \nout how difficult it is going to be for many States to reach the 10-\npercent standard which this bill requires by the year 2020. I will add \nto that statement that I gave previously by saying Senator Fitzgerald's \namendment makes the current renewable standard even more inequitable \nand more unfair in its treatment of particular States.\n  The ability of the investor-owned electrical generators, which is the \nonly class covered by this renewable portfolio, within a particular \nState to be able to meet the 10-percent standard by the year 2020 is \nsubstantially affected by conditions over which those same investor-\nowned electrical generators have no control.\n  As an example, they have no control over the availability of \nrenewables within their State. They have no control over the \nenvironmental characteristics that are peculiar to their State. They \nhave no control over the growth patterns. If a State is stagnant or \ndeclining in its population, it is going to be a lot easier to meet \nthese standards than if a State is required to add substantially to its \ngeneration capacity in order to meet demographic or economic growth.\n  Let me use my own State of Florida as an example of some of those \npeculiarities.\n  Florida, as many other States, particularly in the southeastern \nregion, does not have conditions which are appropriate for hydropower. \nWe are a flat State. We do not have any high, elevated water sources \nthat can fall over and generate hydropower. Surprisingly, we are not a \nState which is very adaptable to wind power. We do not have winds that \nare reliable enough or sustainable enough to make wind power a \ncommercially adaptable renewable source. In fact, the largest investor-\nowned utility in America for wind power is Florida Power and Light \nCompany.\n  Florida Power and Light Company is the largest wind power electrical \nutility in the Nation. It produces zero wind power in the State that \nbears its name, not because they are not interested in wind power, not \nthat they have not had a lot of technical experience, it just does not \nwork in the environmental conditions of Florida.\n  Solar, which some think would be the silver bullet for renewables in \nFlorida--I had a solar panel in my house when I was a boy, and that was \na few years ago. Sixty years later, it still has not developed into a \nreliable source of energy at anywhere near economic cost.\n  These factors are going to make it difficult for my State and others \nto meet the 10-percent renewable standard as currently included in the \nbill.\n  In addition, 87 percent of what in the base is defined as renewable \nenergy in Florida comes from waste to energy. Florida is in the course \nof building its 14th waste-to-energy plant, making it second only to \nNew York State in the number of these plants.\n  In my judgment, waste to energy is undoubtedly a renewable source of \nenergy. Our cities and towns will continue to produce solid waste that \nmust be disposed of in some manner. Waste to energy is a viable means \nof dealing with the problem of disposal.\n  In my State, over 80 percent of our water supply is subsurface. It is \nin large aquifers that are just a few feet below the surface. That is \nthe nature of our geology. One of the reasons that incineration has \nbecome such a popular alternative is not that people love to have \nincinerators or are not cognizant of the fact there are some negative \nimplications, but the alternative of putting on top of our water supply \nmass amounts of solid waste is intolerable. So we have been moving away \nfrom that and towards incineration as a means of disposing of our \npollution.\n  I would describe myself as an environmentalist but an \nenvironmentalist who looks at what the reality is of the options before \nme. In my State, the options are we bury it or we burn it. I think the \ncase is unquestionable that it is environmentally less offensive to \nburn it than it is to bury it right over your water supply.\n  This method has the added benefit of being able to generate not a \ngreat part but approximately 1.6 percent of our electrical supply.\n  I thought one of the purposes of this was to displace fossil fuels, \nand that is 1.6 percent of energy which, but for incineration, would \nhave been produced through fossil fuel. It is 1.6 percent of energy \nthat, if it were not being produced through incineration, would be lost \nand would be in a large landfill posing a continuous threat to our \nwater supply.\n  I believe in the principle of some flexibility in this law. I had a \ncolloquy with the chairman of the committee a few days ago urging that \nwhen this got into conference committee, one of the areas that would be \nlooked at would be how to take the differences that exist from State to \nState, region to region within our country into greater control, \ngreater consideration in arriving at what is an appropriate renewable \nenergy inventory.\n  Also, our experience in terms of incineration has not been as dire as \nthat of Illinois and New Jersey apparently. Our facilities are \nrelatively new, as\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\nwitnessed by the fact we have our 14th currently under construction. \nThey use the maximum achievable control technology, including \nscrubbers, bag houses, selective noncatalytic reduction, and carbon \ninjection. All of these are designed to reduce the amount of emissions, \nincluding the reduction of greenhouse gases.\n  Emission data that has been circulated recently, in my judgment, is \ngrossly out of date in terms of what modern waste to energy and \nefficient sources of biomass have been doing in reducing pollution \nwhile contributing substantially to alternatives to fossil fuels for \nenergy.\n  This is not just a Florida-specific issue. In 1993, the Los Angeles \nDistrict Sanitation Department concluded that the waste-to-energy \nfacility in Commerce, CA, created less pollution than the trucks used \nto haul the trash to a nearby landfill without regard to the \nenvironmental damage once it gets in the ground in the landfill.\n  According to EPA calculations, if half of the trash produced annually \nin the United States were used to generate electricity, 1.4 billion \nfewer pounds of pollutants would be discharged into the atmosphere \ncompared to the energy generation through coal or oil burning.\n  Waste-to-energy has also been historically treated as a biomass, at \nleast as far back as the FERC rules of 1978.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the number of \nStates which today have defined for their own State law that waste-to-\nenergy is a renewable energy source.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  State Renewable Portfolio Standards\n\n       Currently many states have established renewable portfolio \n     standards, either through state statute, executive orders or \n     public utility commission regulations. Of those states eleven \n     define waste-to-energy as a renewable energy source. They \n     are: Maine, Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts, \n     Wisconsin, Iowa, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, and Maryland.\n       Many other sates define waste-to-energy as a renewable \n     energy source for inclusion in other state incentive \n     programs. They are California, Florida, Michigan, Montana, \n     New Hampshire, Ohio, Washington, Oregon, Oklahoma, Utah and \n     New York.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. For these reasons--primarily the fact that we need to be \npragmatic--we need to recognize that different States have different \nconditions; that the options for disposal of solid waste in many \ninstances, as in the case of Florida, are limited; and of those \noptions, incineration represents one that is relatively environmentally \nappropriate and is one of the best sources that is available to us to \nbegin to meet this 10-percent standard of a renewable portfolio.\n  I urge the defeat of the Fitzgerald amendment, or the adoption of the \nmotion that I anticipate is about to be made to table the Fitzgerald \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the Fitzgerald \namendment because the underlying language in the bill would allow even \nan incinerator that is out of compliance with federal emissions \nregulations to qualify as a ``renewable energy source.'' A facility \nwhich is not in compliance with the applicable state and federal \npollution prevention control and permit requirements for any period of \ntime should not be considered an eligible facility for purposes of the \nrenewable portfolio standard.\n  It is my understanding that this distinction was utilized when it \ncame to the tax incentives in this bill and it should be utilized in \nthis area as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute to \nreply to the distinguished Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I emphasize this amendment would in no way impair \nStates that incinerate their waste from continuing to do so. In fact, \nIllinois has waste incineration. What we are saying with this amendment \nis we should not be promoting, with Federal incentives or subsidies, \nwaste incineration. It is not a renewable form of energy. It is not a \nclean form of energy. In fact, it spews terrible, harmful pollutants \nsuch as dioxins and mercury into the air. The ash produced by waste \nincineration is very environmentally harmful.\n  This amendment simply says we will not have a Federal program to \npromote waste incineration, and no State would be prevented from \ncontinuing to burn garbage. We would not be promoting it with a Federal \npolicy.\n  I thank my colleagues for their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in reference to the amendment, the \nunderlying bill does not, as I read it, provide any subsidy or \nincentive for use of municipal solid waste. We do say utilities that \nnow generate waste from that source can deduct that from the base they \nbegin with, but we do not give them credit for that generation, and we \ndo not give them credit for any new generation from that source in the \nfuture. So there are no incentives. There are no subsidies, as I read \nthe bill.\n  For that reason, I oppose the amendment by the Senator from Illinois. \nI move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Is there objection to having the vote at this time?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n3124. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I say to my friend from Iowa, we have \nseveral amendments tonight that we are going to try to put in the \nqueue. But I should say to all my friends on this side of the aisle, \nmost all of the amendments that have been offered have been Democratic \namendments. I have been advised by the Republican leader and the \nmanager of the bill for the Republicans that they are going to allow \nthis to happen on a few more amendments, but that is about the end of \nit. So everyone should understand, this isn't going to go on for the \nnext few hours.\n  There are actually three amendments that I have gone over with the \nmanager of the bill for the Republicans.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Cochran, Mr. Grassley, and Mrs. Lincoln, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3195.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Energy to revise the seasonal \n   energy efficiency ratio standard for central air conditioners and \n          central air conditioning heat pumps within 60 days)\n\n       Beginning on page 293, strike line 5 and all that follows \n     through page 294 and insert the following:\n       Section 325(d)(3) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 6295(d)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(C) Revision of standards.--Not later than 60 days after \n     the date of enactment of this subparagraph, the Secretary \n     shall amend the standards established under paragraph (1).''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I offer this amendment on behalf of Senators Cochran, \nGrassley, Lincoln, and myself.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Mississippi for any comments he \nmay wish to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to join both of my friends \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley, along with the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, in sponsoring this \namendment to the energy bill.\n  This amendment would seek to change a provision that is in the bill, \nas reported by the committee, or as it is pending before the Senate, \nthat relates to seasonal energy efficiency ratios of air-conditioners.\n  The reason we are offering this amendment is to permit the Department \nof Energy to proceed with the rulemaking, which they have the power to \nundertake and they are now considering, to make air-conditioners more \nenergy efficient.\n  The difficulty with the bill, as reported by the committee, is that \nit preempts the rulemaking process and establishes, by law, a new \nseasonal energy efficiency ratio, and it establishes it at the level of \n13. That is one of the standards of measuring energy efficiency. The \ncurrent energy ratio that is established under the regulations is at \n10. Almost everybody agrees that this standard ought to be increased \nand that the efficiency ought to be improved. The issue is, how much?\n  This amendment that we are offering suggests the appropriate level is \n12 instead of the committee-mandated ratio of 13. Why is that? It is \nbecause, at this level, if it is not amended, you are going to increase \nthe cost of air-conditioners by about $700 each. In a State such as my \nState of Mississippi, that is a huge increase for consumers. We have a \nlot of people who do not make enough money to afford an air-conditioner \nif it costs that much more than the current air-conditioners will cost. \nThat is a big problem.\n  Another problem is, a lot of manufacturing plants that are \nmanufacturing air-conditioners or components will be put out of \nbusiness if the ratio is set at 13, as this committee bill does. There \nis one plant in my State, located in Grenada, MS, that will shut down \nif this amendment isn't approved, and 2,500 people who work there will \nbe out of a job. That will not occur if this amendment is adopted.\n  So this is a serious proposal, and it is undertaken with the notion \nthat we do need to improve the energy efficiency of these air-\nconditioning units. Our amendment will cause that to happen, and we \nwill save money generally over the life of this new ratio because we \nwill use less energy. Less electricity will be consumed by the Nation. \nAnd that is good. That is one of the aims of this bill.\n  So I am hopeful the Senate will look with favor on the amendment. I \nappreciate the distinguished Senator from Iowa inviting me to join him \nin offering this amendment. I am hopeful on tomorrow, when we get to \nthe process of voting and approving amendments, the Senate will vote \nfor this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3198 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Under the previous order, I call up amendment No. 3198.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper], for himself, Mr. \n     Specter, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3198.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To decrease the United States dependence on imported oil by \n                             the year 2015)\n\n       On page 177, before line 1, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 811. REQUIREMENT FOR REGULATIONS TO REDUCE OIL \n                   CONSUMPTION.\n\n       (a) Oil Savings.--\n       (1) In general.--The new regulations required by section \n     801 shall include regulations that apply to passenger and \n     non-passenger automobiles manufactured after model year 2006 \n     and are designed to result in a reduction in the amount of \n     oil (including oil refined into gasoline) used by automobiles \n     of at least 1,000,000 barrels per day by 2015.\n       (2) Calculation of reduction.--To determine the amount of \n     the reduction in oil used by passenger and non-passenger \n     automobiles, the Secretary of Transportation shall make \n     calculations based on the number of barrels of oil projected \n     by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of \n     Energy in table A7 of the report entitled ``Annual Energy \n     Outlook 2002'' (report no. DOE/EIA-0383(2002)) to be consumed \n     by light-duty vehicles in 2015 without the regulations \n     required by paragraph (1).\n       (3) Consideration of alternative fuel technologies.--The \n     Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary \n     of Energy to identify alternative fuel technologies that \n     could be utilized in the transportation sector to reduce \n     dependence on crude-oil-derived fuels. The Secretary of\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\n     Transportation shall take those technologies into \n     consideration in prescribing the regulations under this \n     section.\n       (4) Final regulations.--The Secretary of Transportation \n     shall issue the final regulations required by this subsection \n     after carrying out the consultation described in paragraph \n     (3), but not later than 15 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Reports to Congress.--\n       (1) Requirement.--Beginning in 2007, the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall, after consulting with the Administrator \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency, submit to Congress in \n     January of every odd-numbered year through 2015 a report on \n     the implementation of the requirements of this section.\n       (2) Content.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     explain and assess the progress in reducing oil consumption \n     by automobiles as required by this section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is set \naside.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3195\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, there was a little bit of confusion on \nthe floor. What is the pending matter now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi. He \nsaid very precisely what this really is all about. I am going to give a \nlengthier statement, but as long as he is still on the floor, I want to \nthank him. He hit it right on the head.\n  This is really about, No. 1, the loss of jobs in a number of States. \nWe will lose many jobs in Iowa, too, I say to the Senator from \nMississippi. Secondly, it is about whether or not a significant number \nof low-income people and the elderly will be able to afford to have \nair-conditioning.\n  In some parts of the country it gets hotter than up in my area, but \nstill, up in my area in the summer, it gets pretty darn hot. And the \nelderly need that air-conditioning. It is a health matter for them. \nThey have to have air-conditioning. It is probably for a shorter period \nof time in Iowa than in Mississippi or Florida or Georgia, or places \nlike that; nonetheless, there are periods of time in the summer when it \nis a health matter for the elderly to make sure they have air-\nconditioning. And some will not be able to afford the purchase price of \nan air-conditioner with this 13 seasonal energy efficiency ratio, SEER, \nthat is in the bill.\n  Basically, what this amendment does is strikes the language in the \nbill that mandates this. First of all, I don't think we ought to be \nmandating appliance standards. This is something that ought to be \nwithin the purview of the Department of Energy to let them review all \nthe data and then come up with a standard.\n  If we don't like it, maybe we might want to override it. But for us \nto just come in and mandate a standard which, quite frankly, has been \nproven not to be workable--I will get into that in a second--is the \nwrong way for the Senate to proceed.\n  Again, for the record, when we talk about the SEER numbers, it is the \nmeasure of energy efficiency. The higher the number, the more energy \nefficient the product.\n  On first blush, people say: We want the most efficient machine \npossible. Well, let's take a look at that. The Department of Energy is \nrequired by law to set standards that are ``economically justified and \ntechnologically feasible.'' The current standard is 10. The bill would \nraise that to 13. Our language simply requires the Department of Energy \nto issue a revised standard which must be higher than the current 10 \nstandard and issue it within 60 days. And basically on the basis of not \nonly the present administration's analysis but a lot of work done by \nstaff in the previous administration, they would set that at 12 within \n60 days.\n  Again, there has been some confusion about my amendment. Some have \nsaid this is a rollback. We are going to roll back the 13. That is not \ntrue. There is no 13 right now. It is at 10. So it is not a rollback.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa is here. He, too, is a strong supporter \nof this. I thank him for his strong support in trying to bring some \nreason to this. But in the past my colleague and I have worked together \non appliance standards with the DOE back in 1995 and 1996 to establish \na fair and balanced system, one that balances conservation, \ncompetition, and the needs of consumers in an interpretative rule, \nreally what the law requires. The rule under which we are operating \nrequires that consumers be looked at, not just as an average, uniform \ngroup, but as subgroups such as those within various income and age \nlevels. That is what the rule requires.\n\n  Again, if you just look at it as a uniform rate, a uniform average \ngroup, perhaps you would come to some different conclusion. The rule \ndoesn't say that. The rule says you have to look at it as subgroups of \nthe population.\n  Under the rule, DOE's responsibilities must look after the consumer \nand make sure that these subgroups would be looked at. We need to see \nhow a change in appliance standards will impact various kinds of \npeople, such as the elderly, low-income people, and renters. \nUnfortunately, the last administration, the Clinton administration, \neffectively did not properly look at this important requirement. They \nlumped everybody together. And so the different subgroups were not \nproperly considered under the Clinton administration.\n  When the professional staff recommended a 12 standard in 2000 under \nthe Clinton administration, that recommendation by the professional \nstaff in the Department of Energy was changed in the Office of the \nSecretary of Energy. The required analysis of the economic impacts on \nthese subgroups required by the process was not properly done to reach \nthat SEER 13 level. I also understand the Department of Justice in the \nClinton Administration had considerable concerns about the negative \nimpacts on competition of a 13 SEER requirement. That is a very \nimportant question, particularly for those who want to keep the price \nto the consumer low and who want competition.\n  The imposition of this 13 standard would have a serious impact on \nboth consumers and the industry. The Department of Justice is opposed \nto this, the Small Business Administration, the National Association of \nHome Builders, and the Manufactured Housing Institute. It is \neconomically damaging, especially to senior citizens, lower and fixed-\nincome families and, as we said earlier, employees in the industry.\n  As the SEER ratings rise, the cost of the machines rise. The Senator \nfrom Mississippi already pointed out that going from a 10 to a 13 will \ncost more than $700 per air-conditioner. By comparison, the cost of \ngoing to a 12 is only an estimated $407. So when you go up above that \n12, it becomes really expensive. Again, if you make it that expensive, \nwhat would a consumer do if they have an old energy-inefficient air-\nconditioner? Would they go out and buy this new one? Will they ever be \nable to recoup the cost, especially if they live in Michigan or in Iowa \nwhere we need our air-conditioners for short periods of time. They \nwould never recoup the money, if they could even afford it.\n  What many will do is, particularly a lot of modest homeowners, people \nwho live in manufactured housing who have higher costs still with a \nSEER 13 because that machine will not fit in the space provided for in \nmany manufactured homes? What many will do is they will say: It is \ncheaper for me to stay with the old one. That doesn't help the \nenvironment. It means more energy use in those homes. And so we have \naccomplished far less than many believe if we go to a 13?\n  There has to be some reason in this. We can't underestimate the \nimpact that going to this standard would have on lower income people \nand senior citizens. You will hear arguments tomorrow about the average \nconsumer out there, what this might cost the average consumer. I have \noften said to people, if you took me and Bill Gates and you averaged \nour income, I would be a billionaire on my salary here. Imagine that. \nYou can't just look at an average like that. What you have to look at--\nand the rule says you have to look at--is those subgroups such as the \nelderly and low income, which they haven't done and which this 13 \nrating doesn't properly take that into account.\n\n  Senior citizens rely on air-conditioning for their health as well as \nfor their comfort. Sometimes it is not a luxury in the summer months. \nThe elderly need that. Again, if they only use it in the summer, 2 or 3 \nmonths in Iowa or Michigan, they would never be able to recover the \nhigher cost of a 13.\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\n  Furthermore, renters will also be affected by this. It is expected \nthat the increased cost of a new air-conditioner would be passed on in \nthe form of higher rents to 34 million renter households where the \nmedian income is $24,400. So, again, if you add that 13 and the \nlandowners have to replace it, they will pass it on in higher rents to \nrenters or they simply will decide not to replace it. Then what have we \naccomplished?\n  Recently, the Energy Information Administration conducted an \nindependent review of the impact of imposing a nationwide standard of \n13 for air-conditioners compared to a 12. The EIA review stated that a \n12 standard would save the Nation $2.3 billion, while a 13 standard \nwould cost the Nation $600 million in additional costs. So a 12 \nstandard--this is the Energy Information Administration--would save the \nNation $2.3 billion; a 13 would cost us $600 million. Again, it is \nbecause the impacts of a 13's higher cost.\n  I haven't gotten into the size. It is quite a bit larger than 12. \nTherefore, people who live in manufactured housing, where the space for \nthe air conditioner is preset, would not be able to get a new air \nconditioner without retrofitting their home so those people lose if we \ngo to a 13. We lose jobs--the Department of Energy said 20,000 jobs by \nthe year 2006. I see my colleague from Iowa on the floor. I know he \nwants to speak on this. I know, at first blush, for people who say they \nare environmentalists, I think I have a pretty good environmental \nrecord; but this is not the direction in which to go. This will hurt \nthe elderly and low-income people because many won't be able to afford \nan air conditioner. Plus, it will cost a heck of a lot of jobs in my \nState and, I know, in a number of other States.\n\n  Madam President, I have more to say on this, but I want to respect my \ncolleague from Iowa who is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am glad to be able to work with my \ncolleague from Iowa on this amendment. He is being transparent, and I \nwould like to be transparent on it. There are jobs affected in our \nState. For the Senator from Michigan, the Presiding Officer, it is my \nunderstanding there is a company in her State called Heat Controller, \nInc., that would not be able to meet these SEER 13 standards, and that \nthere would be jobs in jeopardy at Heat Controller. You may want to \ncheck that out, but that is what my information tells me. If I am \nwrong, I would like to be corrected.\n  So I compliment the Energy Committee because, generally, in this \nlegislation they have had suggestions that push industry to do things \nthat are more energy efficient. In most cases, those initiatives by \nthis legislation and by the Energy Committee are not only good for \nsaving energy, but they are also very good for the consumer.\n  Now, Senator Harkin has touched on this, that if we go to what is \ncalled SEER 13, 75 percent of the country, according to a map I have \nhere, will not, through the life of the use of SEER 13 appliances, be \nable to get a payback. In other words, there is no benefit to the \nconsumer. So this is one of the rare instances in which the Senate \nEnergy Committee has a suggestion in their legislation that might save \nenergy, but is very costly to the consumer. We want to promote things \nthat are energy efficient, but we also want to promote things that are \ngood for the consumer.\n  Most of the time, you buy energy-efficient appliances. Recently--\nmaybe 3 years ago--I had an opportunity, and a necessity, to buy a new \nfurnace for my farmhouse in Iowa. In looking at what to buy, they could \nvery quickly say, well, if you buy our furnace, within 5 or 7--I am not \nsure how long, but it was a relatively short period of time--you will \nsave enough on LP gas to pay for it. Buy one of these thermostats that \nis automatically controlled to go up and down with the heat, and in a \ncertain period of time it is paid for.\n\n  In this particular instance, the Senate Energy Committee has offered \nus a proposal that will save energy, yes; but for people in 75 percent \nof the country, geographically--I don't know how that is population-\nwise--there is not a payback.\n  So that is why I ask this body to look at the wisdom of this \nparticular provision in this bill. Obviously, I am asking you to look \nat the wisdom that is behind the amendment offered by the Senator, my \ncolleague from Iowa.\n  The Department of Energy has authority, through the rulemaking \nprocess, to set these standards. The Department of Energy is required \nby statute, under the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, to \nset these standards and to do it in a way ``that is economically \njustified and technologically feasible.''\n  So I think the underlying legislation--which we can obviously change \nif we want to, and I think it is unwise to change--the underlying \nstatute calls for it to be economically justified. This is one that is \ntechnologically feasible; it saves energy, but it doesn't appear to be \neconomically justified by going from 12 to 13. What we are trying to do \nis overturn precisely what the bill does in the first place. The \nDepartment of Energy is considering a rule based on information and \nbased on analysis from several years' worth of submission during the \nrulemaking process. Unfortunately, this bill seeks to take action that \nwould raise the standard--a 30-percent increase in efficiency--and to \ndo it clearly, without consideration of information collected by the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  Had the authors of this bill considered the evidence regarding the \neconomic impact of a 30-percent increase, they would have soon realized \nit is contrary to the statutory criterion imposed on the Department of \nEnergy which requires that it be economically justified.\n  Economically, a 13 SEER standard just doesn't make sense. For \nexample, 75 percent of the consumers purchasing 13 SEER units will \nincur a net cost. At the end of the lifetime of the product, the \nsavings in operating costs won't be sufficient to offset the additional \nup-front costs of that particular product--besides the fact that some \ncompanies, as I have implied to the Senator from Michigan, are not able \nto make SEER 13 and maybe it would really harm those jobs as a result \nof that additional complication.\n  This is particularly true for consumers in the middle and northern \ntiers of the United States. Critics claim that the additional cost of \nthe 13 SEER product is insignificant. However, the Energy Information \nAdministration conducted an independent review of the economic impact \nof imposing either a 30-percent increase in SEER, which this bill \nproposes, and a 20-percent increase. The Energy Information \nAdministration concluded that a 20-percent increase would result in \nsavings of $2.3 billion in energy costs for consumers while a 30-\npercent increase would actually cost consumers $600 million.\n  So based on that evidence, it is contrary to the best interest of the \nconsumer. There is not a payback. The difference between the savings of \n$2.3 billion compared to a loss of $600 million is certainly \nsignificant and clearly does not justify a 30-percent increase.\n  The supporters of the 13 SEER standard also disregard the concerns \nexpressed by the Department of Justice. A number of equipment \nmanufacturers selling air-conditioners in the United States today don't \noffer products at 13 SEER. Which I mentioned to the Senator from \nMichigan. For that reason, the Department of Justice opposes a 13 SEER \nstandard based on anti-competitive implications for the industry.\n  It is also important for my colleagues to understand exactly what the \namendment offered by Senator Harkin and my colleague, Senator Cochran, \nwould do. This amendment won't impose a lower standard for air-\nconditioners and heat pumps. It simply eliminates the 13 SEER mandate \nof the bill and requires the Department of Energy to determine an \nappropriate standard and set that standard within 60 days.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to oppose the 13 SEER standard in \nthe bill that is not economically justified as the underlying, present \nlaw requires. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which \nwill allow the Department of Energy to complete the rulemaking process \nwithin a standard that is not only good for saving energy and \ntechnologically feasible, but also good for the consumer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank Senator Grassley for his strong \nsupport not only on this amendment but in previous years, and for \nbringing some reason to how we address this SEER standard. He is right \non target.\n  Again, we have to keep in mind the differences about which we are \ntalking. If we look the first 15 years after the rule is implemented, \nfrom 2006 to 2020, the difference between the 13 and 12 is four-\nhundredths of a percent of the cumulative U.S. generating capacity--\nfour-hundredths of a percent. I am all for saving energy--we all are--\nbut what is this going to do to our elderly and low-income people in \nbetween time and the loss of jobs?\n  I am not saying we should never go to a 13. I am not saying that. \nWhat I am saying that the appliance standards should be staged, looking \nat the economic effects and the technology over time. Again, look at \nthe impact going from a 10 to a 13 would have on jobs, on people of low \nincome, on our renters, and our elderly. A 13 standard would also have \nan impact on competition in small business. It would eliminate 84 \npercent of all new central air-conditioning models on the market today \nand 86 percent of all new heat pumps. Nearly half of the original \nequipment manufacturers selling air-conditioners in the United States \ntoday do not offer products at 13. A lot of those, mostly small \nmanufacturers may be forced out of business.\n  There is a large company, one of the biggest. They are for the 13? \nThey are for the 13. Interesting. I can see a scenario whereby a lot of \nthe smaller manufacturers--they are doing a good job. I can see a \nscenario where they simply would be forced out of the business, and I \ncan see this great big company coming in and buying them up. Then what \nhappens to the competition? It is a lot less.\n  It is interesting to note that one, the largest company in this \nbusiness, is for the 13 standard. Again, we ought to ask the question \nabout what we are trying to do? They are trying to acquire market share \nfrom the small companies who will have difficulty retrofitting their \nfactories to make 13 SEER machines.\n  To the extent we go to 13 and we force the change, I do not know what \nthe elderly are going to do and what low-income people are going to do. \nThey cannot recoup their investment, and it will be an additional $700 \nfor an air-conditioner.\n  On that issue, I just mentioned the competition. That may be why the \nDepartment of Justice in the last administration had serious concerns \nabout a SEER 13 standard. And why this administration opposed this on \nthe basis of competition. That is why the Small Business Administration \nopposes it. Again, they are concerned about smaller manufacturers being \nable to remain in this line of business.\n  One last thing I have not talked about--I should have my chart. I do \nnot this evening. Maybe I will bring it in the morning. The size of the \nair-conditioners with a 13 standard is substantially larger than a 12. \nNot one-twelfth bigger, but maybe a third again as big. They are huge.\n  That would create enormous retrofitting problems for many \nmanufactured homes, especially manufactured homes because these homes \nhave a precisely set space for central air-conditioners. They could not \nlikely be replaced without considerable retrofitting. That is why the \nAmerican Housing Institute supports a 12 standard where that would fit \nin the same place where a 10 fits right now. They expressed their \nconcern about what would happen to families on limited incomes.\n  The National Association of Homebuilders opposes the 13 standard, not \nbecause they are opposed to 13, but for each $1,000 added to the cost \nof a new home takes out 400,000 buyers. We do want to build more homes. \nWe do want more people to own their own homes, a key part of the \nAmerican dream.\n  I am all in favor of efficient appliances. Reducing our energy \nconsumption is important to reducing air pollution, global warming, \nreducing price spikes, but it has to be reasonable, and it has to be \nsomething where we do not end up worse than we are.\n  I suppose sometime down the pike if we go to a 13 standard--I \nmentioned over the first 15 years the standard will be in effect, the \ndifference is four-hundredths of a percent in cumulative energy use in \nthe United States--four-hundredths of a percent--but at what cost will \nthat come to the elderly, people of low income, working families, jobs, \nand competition in the industry?\n  I will have more to say about this tomorrow. I hope people who have \nnot thought much about this and say, gee, 13 is higher than 12, it must \nbe better, more energy efficient, will stop to think about whether or \nnot we are going to get the energy savings we want if we go to the 13 \nstandard and people cannot afford it so they stick with the older ones \nthat use more energy, that they will pollute more.\n  If we adopt the 12, it can be used, it is reasonable in cost, it fits \ninto the spaces, and we can move to it in a reasonable fashion. \nCertainly 12 is better than 10, and 10 is what the standard is right \nnow.\n  I hope when we get to this vote tomorrow people will take a look at \nthe end result and not just be swayed by the fact that 13 looks better, \nlooks more energy efficient than a 12. The rule says we have to look at \nits economic effect on subgroups. If this body is in the position of \nmandating--this amendment says we do not mandate it, we leave it up to \nthe regulatory body, but the rule under which they have to operate says \nthey have to look at the impact, not just on the general population but \non certain subgroups--low income, working families, the elderly.\n  Our amendment will allow the Department of Energy to implement a 12 \nstandard, which I believe is much more reasonable at this time than \ngoing to a 13 right away.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Hybrid vehicle tax credit\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, in the Finance Committee energy tax \namendment that has now been included in the energy bill, the consumer \ntax credit available for the purchase of a new qualified light duty \nhybrid motor vehicle generally ranges from $250 to $3,500 depending \nupon the weight of the vehicle and the ``maximum available power'' from \nthe vehicle's battery system. I note that in the proposed Sec. \n30B(c)(2)(D)(iii)(I) the term ``maximum available power'' for a \npassenger automobile or light truck hybrid is defined as follows:\n\n       For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the term ``maximum \n     available power'' means the maximum power available from the \n     rechargeable energy storage system, during a standard 10 \n     second pulse power or equivalent test, divided by such \n     maximum power and the SAE net power of the heat engine.\n\n  Because this language originated in his bill, S. 760, I would like to \nengage the senior senator from Utah in a brief colloquy to make sure we \nhave a common understanding of this definition.\n  I note that the definition allows the use of either a ``standard 10 \nsecond pulse power test'' or an equivalent test. Is it the \nunderstanding of the Senator from Utah that this language authorizes a \nmanufacturer to demonstrate the maximum available power of its \nrechargeable energy storage system by using either the standard 10 \nsecond pulse power test or some other test that will demonstrate the \nextent to which the rechargeable energy storage system is contributing \nto the overall power of the hybrid system?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, that is my understanding. Our purpose in authorizing \nan ``equivalent test'' is not to push manufacturers to one particular \nhybrid design by virtue of our prescribing the standard 10 second pulse \npower test. Rather, we want to provide flexibility in the methodology \nof measuring the hybrid performance of the vehicle and providing \nincreased incentives for those vehicles that utilize the optimum \ncombination of power from the two power sources.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is it the understanding of the Senator from Utah that \nthe equivalent test described in this definition could include a test \nprocedure, at the request of the manufacturer, that measures power from \nthe rechargeable energy storage system using real world driving \nconditions?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is it also the understanding of the Senator from Utah \nthat there are Federal Test Program (FTP) driving cycles already \nformulated by EPA that could provide comparable results to the 10 \nsecond pulse power test?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding that such test procedures do exist \nand could provide an alternative way to measure maximum available \npower.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. That conforms to my understanding \nas well.\n\n\n                                TITLE X\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, as I stated in a previous colloguy with my \ncolleagues, we have reached broad agreement on many of the provisions \nwithin Title X related to the development and coordination of a \nnational climate change policy.\n  There remain considerable uncertainties about the causes of climate \nchange, which has been noted by the National Academy of Sciences. Our \nfocus should be on addressing these uncertainties, not taking drastic \nunwarranted action that could cause severe economic disruption.\n  The revised provisions of Title X and other provisions will help \nreduce these uncertainties and take practical, market oriented steps to \nvastly improve our energy efficient technologies.\n  The agreement appropriately calls for the creation of a national \nstrategy to address the challenge of climate change. It also creates an \ninteragency task force to better coordinate climate change policies \nwith the Executive Branch. This is needed. Climate change policy cris-\ncrosses the jurisdiction of multiple government agencies. Far too often \nquestions posed to the previous administration were answered with the \nresponse, ``You'll have to ask someone else. We don't handle that \narea.'' There needs to be accountability for climate change within the \nExecutive Branch.\n  President Bush has already taken the initiative, and put forth a \nforward looking strategy to take action on climate change. His proposal \nincludes: a reasonable goal for greenhouse gas emission reductions; a \nflexible way to achieve this goal, without harming economic growth; a \nvoluntary emissions registry for industry and individuals to track \ntheir progress on greenhouse gas emissions; increased scientific \nresearch; increased investment in new energy efficient \ntechnologies; and efforts to work with other nations, particularly \ndeveloping nations, on mutual efforts to address climate change.\n\n  In crafting this strategy, President Bush created an interagency task \nforce very similar to that proposed in this legislation. The Cabinet \nSecretaries and others within the Executive Office of the President \ninvolved in this process spent countless hours reviewing the underlying \nclimate issues and ranges of policy options. The chairman of the \nCouncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ), James Connaughton, played the \nlead role in developing the strategy. This level of engagement and \npolicy development on climate change is unprecedented. It can, and \nshould, serve as a model for carrying out provisions of this \nlegislation as ultimately approved by the House and Senate.\n  As I stated in the colloquy included with the manager's amendment on \nTitle X, I have remaining concerns regarding the creation of a National \nOffice of Climate Change Policy with the Executive Office of the \nPresident (EOP). I do not disagree with the need for dedicated \nmanagement within the EOP with regard to the creation and \nimplementation of climate change policy. I understand the concerns for \ncongressional oversight and the desire for those focused on climate \nchange to be in positions subject to Senate confirmation and available \nfor congressional testimony. However, I fail to see the need to create \nnew bureaucracy within the EOP for this purpose.\n  Chairman Connaughton effectively performed this role in the current \nadministration's policy review and development. I see no reason the \nchairman of the Council on Environmental Policy could not continue to \nperform this function. Moreover, statutory authority already exists for \na Senate-confirmed deputy director for the Council on Environmental \nPolicy. This position has never been filled, and could be designated to \nfocus solely on the area of climate change. There are several options \nthat could be pursued in the conference committee to address the \nlegitimate functions called for within Title X without creating a new \noffice within the EOP.\n  Title X also includes a Sense of the Congress resolution regarding \nparticipation by the United States in international efforts on climate \nchange. This language is based on a resolution approved by the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee in August of 2001, but has been \nsubstantially revised. It now reflects the uncertainties recognized by \nthe scientific community that are inherent with any predictions of \nfuture\n\n[[Page S3294]]\n\nclimate change. It acknowledges the commitment by the international \ncommunity that actions taken should be appropriate to the economic \ndevelopment of each nation. The resolution also reflects the principals \nunanimously approved by the U.S. Senate through S. Res. 98 in July \n1997--that U.S. participation in any international climate change \ntreaty should be predicated on participation of all nations, including \ndeveloping counties, and that such action must not harm the U.S. \neconomy.\n  The resolution appropriately calls on the United States to continue \nto demonstrate international leadership on climate change within our \ncommitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. It does not call on the U.S. to re-engage in efforts to ratify \nthe flawed Kyoto Protocol. This resolution is forward looking. At the \nappropriate time the United States should provide the international \ncommunity with a proposal that would address the global challenge and \nglobal commitment of climate change. It is only responsible that we \nbalance the economic interests of America with our environmental and \nenergy interests. This resolution insists upon this balance.\n  I appreciate the work of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \nreaching the bipartisan agreement made in Title X. It is a significant \naccomplishment. I look forward to working with them to address the \nremaining issues in conference.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the Renewable Fuels \nStandards (RFS) contained in the Senate energy bill, S. 517. This \nhistoric agreement will be a milestone in the efforts to develop \nrenewable fuels.\n  This agreement will dramatically increase the Nation's production of \ndomestic, renewable fuels, including ethanol and biodiesel, from U.S. \nagricultural commodities and residues over the next decade. The \nrenewable fuels standard will create a steady market for American \nagriculture, and provide significant economic benefits throughout rural \nAmerica. Importantly, it will also increase U.S. fuel supplies, reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil, and protect the environment.\n  Some have questioned whether the renewable fuels standard as \ncontained in the bill is too aggressive, and whether there is enough \nethanol to meet the requirement. I am here to tell you there is more \nthan enough ethanol production capacity today to meet the needs of the \nprogram when it goes into effect in 2004!\n  In fact, the U.S. ethanol industry has undergone significant growth \nin recent years in anticipation of the phase out of MTBE, particularly \nin California. In the past 2 years alone, since California Governor \nDavis' original Executive Order phasing out MTBE use in the State by \nDecember 31, 2002, 16 new plants have opened and several expansions to \nexisting plans have been completed. As a result, the ethanol industry \nhas the capacity to produce 2.3 billion gallons of ethanol per year \nright now, the amount needed to satisfy the renewable fuels standard in \n2004. The 13 plants under construction will bring total capacity to 2.7 \nbillion gallons by the end of this year, more than the volume of \nethanol required under the agreement in 2005.\n  A survey by the California Energy Commission projects U.S. ethanol \nproduction capacity to double to more than 4 billion gallons by the end \nof 2003. Clearly, with the RFS beginning in 2004 at 2.3 billion gallons \nper year, there will be more than adequate supplies of ethanol to meet \nthe requirement while providing additional volume to fuel supplies.\n  Importantly, the driving force behind the growth in ethanol \nproduction over the past 5 years has been farmers seeking to capitalize \non the value-added benefits of ethanol production directly through \nownership in ethanol plants. Today, farmer-owned ethanol plants make up \nmore than a third of all U.S. ethanol production, with the capacity to \nproduce a billion gallons of ethanol. Fourteen of the 16 ethanol plants \nopened in the past two years are owned by farmers, and 10 of the 13 \nunder construction today are farmer-owned.\n  In Iowa today, we have nine operating ethanol plants. In addition, \nfive new plants are under construction, all of which are farmer-owned. \nBy the end of this year, half of all U.S. ethanol production facilities \nwill be farmer-owned.\n  Ethanol production facilities across America serve as local economic \nengines, providing high-paying jobs, capital investment opportunities, \nincreased local tax revenue and value-added markets for area farmers. \nWith commodity prices very low, investment in value-added ethanol \nprocessing by America's farmers provides a critical opportunity for \nincreased farm income and rural economic development. In these \ncommunities, largely untouched by the economic expansion of the last \ndecade, the increased prices for corn in the radius around a plant \nstimulates very real economic development, and the value-added benefits \nof ethanol mean a $2 bushel of corn is converted into $5 of fuel and \nfeed co-products.\n  Ethanol is the third largest use of corn. Last year, 700 million \nbushels of corn were used to produce ethanol and feed co-products, \nboosting corn prices and rural income. According to a study by AUS \nConsultants, the RFS will increase demand for grain by an average of \n1.4 million bushels annually, increasing net farm income by nearly $6 \nbillion per year. It will also create $5.3 billion in new investment, \nmuch of it in rural America.\n  The Renewable Fuels Standard will create demand for 5 billion gallons \nof ethanol and biodiesel by 2012. Importantly, these fuels can be \nproduced throughout the United States, from grain and agricultural \nbiomass residues. Iowa alone produces nearly 500 million gallons of \nethanol a year. The Nation will produce nearly 2.2 billion gallons of \nethanol in 2002.\n  Even as Iowa and other Midwest States stand ready to supply ethanol \nto California, the State can also produce much of the ethanol it will \nconsume. For example, the California Energy Commission recently \nconcluded the State of California has the potential to produce 100 \nmillion gallons of ethanol per year from cellulose such as rice straw \nand forestry wastes by 2005 and 400 million gallons per year by 2010. \nThis later number represents well over half of the estimated supply \nthat would be needed to satisfy the state's oxygenate requirement. \nOpportunities also exist for grain-based ethanol production in \nCalifornia.\n  A California based ethanol industry would provide significant \neconomic and environmental benefits to the State. Ethanol production \nwould provide rice growers with an alternative to burning or other \ncostly forms of rice straw disposal. It could also help reduce the \nfrequency and intensity of forest fires with the removal of forest \ndebris for ethanol production. It is estimated in-state ethanol \nproduction could provide the State with more than $1 billion in \neconomic benefits. These same benefits can be achieved in the \nsoutheast, northeast and northwest, establishing new biofuels \nindustries across the Nation.\n  As we look to a future of increased production and use of domestic, \nrenewable biofuels, we should also consider their role in future \ntransportation applications such as fuel cells.\n  Extracting hydrogen from renewable sources such as ethanol will \nbenefit the environment, rural America and energy security. \nDemonstrations with ethanol have shown that reforming ethanol into \nhydrogen provides higher efficiencies, fewer emissions, and better \nperformance than other fuel sources, including gasoline. And ethanol \nused to power a fuel cell vehicle would count toward the Renewable \nFuels Standard.\n  Clearly, the Renewable Fuels Standard represents a momentous \nopportunity to benefit rural America, improve the environment and \nenhance our Nation's energy security. The 5 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuels that would be required in 2012 would replace gasoline \nwe currently get from foreign oil. American farmers can be producers as \nwell as consumers of energy. They are willing and able to supply fuel \nas well as our food and fiber. Farmers are on the front lines in the \nbattle for energy independence, and their efforts will make a bold \nstatement about our Nation's commitment to reduce oil imports and build \ndomestic energy supplies that may one day make us truly energy \nindependent.\n  Farmers are ready, willing and able to lead the way toward energy \nindependence.

Madam President, I am proud to be a part of this body \nwhich wisely acted to improve border security last night. As we \napproach the end of April, I am here today to urge my House colleagues \nto act on the issue of port security, which the Senate passed \nunanimously last year. Our Nation's coastline is over 95,000 miles--by \nfar our most prolific border. Yet, despite the tremendous national \nmobilization to increase security since September 11, protecting our \nseaports has been a somewhat elusive goal. Although the Senate acted \nlast December to tighten security at our Nation's ports, the \nlegislation is still stalled in the House of Representatives.\n  In my home state of Georgia, ports play an important role in \ninternational commerce and military support. The Port of Brunswick, GA, \nwith three marine terminals, is growing rapidly. Brunswick is the home \nof a world-class auto and machinery import-export processing facility \nas well as an expanding forest products and agri-bulk operation. With \nthe completion of the new Sidney Lanier Bridge this year and the on-\ngoing deepening of the Brunswick Harbor channel, the future of this \noperation is even brighter.\n  At the Port of Savannah, which brings in the eighth largest cargo \nvolume in the Nation, ships carry iron, steel, lumber, machinery, and \npaper products.\n  It was the fastest growing container shipping operation in the Nation \nduring calendar year 2001, and the only port to experience double-digit \ngrowth for the year. The total volume of business at the port has grown \nsteadily over the last decade, reflecting its important contribution as \na powerful economic benefit for importers, exporters and consumers \nlocated throughout the entire southeast region of the United States. \nThe Port of Savannah is also an important strategic ally to our \nNation's military, serving as a first responder for deployment of \nmilitary equipment, supplies and personnel to hot spots around the \nworld.\n  To utilize this important port, ships must traverse the Savannah \nRiver and pass between historic River Street, with its shops and \nrestaurants, and the new Convention Center and hotel on Hutchinson \nIsland, which can accommodate over 10,000 guests and employees. On any \ngiven day, there are thousands of people walking the streets of this \nbeautiful, old town. If someone with sinister motives were able to gain \naccess to this channel, they could easily wreak havoc on a large number \nof people in a short period of time. Imagine this situation repeated at \nports throughout the country, many of which are located around large \npopulation centers. A New York Times article from November 2001 sums up \nthe problem with a description of a port in Portland, Maine:\n\n       The unscrutinized containers, the bridge, the oil tanks, \n     the dormant but still radioactive nuclear power plant 20 \n     miles north of the harbor--all form a volatile mix in a time \n     of terrorism.\n\n  One must not forget that 68 nuclear power plants are located along \nnavigable waters, and in my State, we also face maritime security risks \nas a result of the opening of a liquefied natural gas terminal LNG. One \nLNG carrier can carry enough gas to heat the homes of over 30,000 \nfamilies.\n\n  Our ports and waterways are vulnerable. The Interagency Commission on \nCrime and Security in U.S. Seaports reports:\n\n       The state of security in U.S. seaports generally ranges \n     from poor to fair, and in a few cases, good.\n\n  This same report surveyed 12 large ports and found that only 3 \ncontrolled port access from the land, and that 9 of these ports did not \ncontrol access via the water. To realize the ramifications, we only \nneed to remember the U.S.S. Cole.\n  While Congress did appropriate over $93 million in funds for port \nsecurity upgrades last year, we can and must do more. We have an \nopportunity, and a duty, to act to help prevent a terrorist attack on \nour ports before it happens. In December, the Senate unanimously passed \nS. 1214, the Port and Maritime Security Act of 2001. I am a cosponsor \nof this important legislation because I understand the crippling affect \na terrorist attack at our ports would have on the Nation's commerce as \nwell as our people.\n  Ninety-five percent of foreign trade travels on water. After \nSeptember 11, the Nation's air travel system was halted for days, \ncrippling commercial airlines, the postal service, and the \ntransportation of goods and people worldwide.\n  Millions of dollars were lost in unrealized revenue as a result of \nonly 4 days. The airports however, had a security system in place. They \nonly needed adjusting in order to reopen our skies.\n  However, what security system is in place at our ports? If something \nhappened at my home State's port of Savannah or Brunswick, how would \nthis Nation respond? I believe Americans would rightly expect seaborne \nshipments to stop. This means that the employment of over 1 million \npeople would be in jeopardy; over $74 billion in annual gross domestic \nproduct would halt; personal income contributions of over $52 billion \nwould disappear, and local and Federal revenue exceeding $20 billion \nwould dry up. The ripple effects throughout our Nation's economy and \nthe world's--because sea shipment is the ultimate example of \nglobalization--would be devastating. Unlike the airports, restoring \nnormal sea shipments would take longer than 4 days because there is no \nsystem in place to upgrade but rather a patchwork of security \ninitiatives that may not allow for any quick or uniform upgrades. In \nview of all of these disturbing facts, I urge my House colleagues to \ntake up and pass S. 1214, which contains important provisions to make \nour seaports more secure.\n  At a minimum, S. 1214 requires security assessments and authorizes \nfunding for these assessments at our ports, which some port authorities \nhave done already. The Georgia Ports Authority--GPA--for example, has \nalready conducted this assessment with its own funds.\n  This report recommends a major increase in the number of surveillance \ncameras, lighting, fencing and other perimeter security measures at \nSavannah and Brunswick. It also recommends the addition of some 40 new \nlaw enforcement and other security personnel to enhance the 60 person \npolice force now deployed at the Port of Savannah and to also provide \nadditional coverage in Brunswick. In addition, there is a \nrecommendation for a major expansion of the credentialing system for \npersonnel and vehicles that have access to the port facilities.\n\n  We do not yet have the price tag for all of these improvements, but \nwe know that it will be costly. I am certain that GPA will be applying \nfor Federal funding to assist in these costs, and I will strongly \nsupport their application as we work through the budget process. The \n$93 million grant program Congress established was only a first step \ntoward strengthening our seaports, and S. 1214 would help up get closer \nto that goal.\n  This legislation also requires background checks for personnel \nemployed in security Sensitive positions.\n  Additionally, S. 1214 authorizes funding for screening and detection \nequipment, and it requires crew and cargo manifests to be reported to \nthe U.S. Customs Service before the ship arrives at a domestic port, \nnot after.\n  In order to help coordinate the many agencies and law enforcement \npersonnel at our Nation's ports, the bill encourages, where possible, \nlocating these personnel at the same facility.\n  Additionally, after working with the bill's authors, I drafted a \nprovision included in the Senate passed bill which establishes a pilot \nprogram operated by the U.S. Customs Service to ensure the integrity \nand security of cargo entering the United States. Specifically, this \nprovision calls for Customs to explore the types of technology \navailable that can be used to ensure a ship's\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\ngoods have not been tampered with. Such technology could enable \n``preapproved'' cargo to enter the United States on an expedited basis.\n  This program would also require communication and coordination with \nforeign ports and foreign Customs officials and shippers, at the point \nthe goods are loaded onto ships bound for our land, and would likely \nresult in prescreening of American bound goods at these foreign ports.\n  This ``extension'' of our borders to enable screening of containers \nat foreign ports translates into a greater chance of eliminating \nthreats at home and ensuring that properly handled and safe cargoes can \nbe moved through the system so that we can focus on potentially more \ndangerous cargoes.\n  Commander Stephen Flynn of the U.S. Coast Guard and a Senior Fellow \nat the Council on Foreign Relations believes that homeland security can \nbe supported through ``establishing private-sector cooperation, \nfocusing on point-of-origin security measures, and embracing the use of \nnew technologies.''\n  I wholeheartedly agree with Commander Flynn, and I believe my \namendment accomplishes these goals.\n  I am pleased with the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, \nRobert Bonner. He is in support of my amendment. In a speech given on \nJanuary 17, 2002, Commissioner Bonner announced the Service's Container \nSecurity Initiative.\n  With over half of our Nation's containers originating at only 10 \ninternational ports, targeting these ports for an ``international \nsecurity standard [for] sea containers,'' as Commissioner Bonner put \nit, would result in pre-screening of most of the goods entering the \ncountry. The Commissioner continued by stating that pre-screening of \ncontainers and the use of technology are vital parts of this program:\n\n       A first step in the [container security initiative] begins \n     by examining and comparing our targeting methods with those \n     of our international partners. And we should consider \n     dispatching teams of targeting experts to each other's major \n     seaports to benchmark targeting and to make sure that all \n     high risk containers are inspected by the same technology \n     that can detect anomalies requiring physical examination \n     inside the container. . . . Having your containers checked \n     and pre-approved for security against the terrorist threat at \n     a mega-port participating in this program should and likely \n     will carry tangible benefits.\n\n  I look forward to working with Commissioner Bonner and the Customs \nService on this initiative, as well as implementation of the pilot \nprogram called for in my amendment, and I have written to the \nCommissioner conveying my strong interest in the CSI program and \npledging my full cooperation in implementing it. Additionally, I was \npleased to read in the April 16 Washington Post that several U.S. \nbusinesses have signed on to participate in such a program to better \nensure the integrity and safety of goods entering the United States.\n  I look forward to reviewing the successes and recommendations \nresulting from this important port security initiative.\n  One of the Customs Service's vital partners in the current port \nsecurity regime is the U.S. Coast Guard. They were among some of the \nfirst respondents to the homeland security call on and after September \n11.\n  I applaud the President for including the Coast Guard funding level \nincreases in his budget, which will better enable the Coast Guard to \ncarry out its multifaceted security initiatives--from monitoring our \nports to search and rescue to drug interdiction programs.\n  In a Washington Post column from Sunday, March 3, about the potential \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction by Al Quaeda, the author \nwrites:\n\n       In ``tabletop exercises'' conducted as high as Cabinet \n     level, President Bush's national security team has \n     highlighted difficult choices the chief executive would face \n     if the new sensors picked up a radiation signature on a boat \n     steaming up the Potomac River . . .\n\n  Congress must send the President a strong port security bill before \nit is too late. I urge the House to promptly pass S. 1214.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3296-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB KILLEEN\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

And even though his doctors say that he is in a tough battle, \nknowing Bob, and knowing his courage and his heart, I would not be \nsurprised to see him bouncing back tomorrow.\n  I do want to take this opportunity on the Senate floor to pay tribute \nto him for the leadership he has given to the United Auto Workers in \nMinnesota over the past decades, to thank him for his enlightened \nleadership on behalf of working men and women in Minnesota, and to \nrecognize him as a leader and a teacher for those who have followed in \nhis footsteps, such as myself. Senator Wellstone, I know, joins with me \nin these remarks.\n  Bob is courageous in his convictions. He is always true to those \nconvictions. But he has proceeded as a gentleman in the best sense of \nthat word. He is respected by his friends and his supporters, and even \nby those who may have sat on the other side of the bargaining table. \nBob has treated everybody with the same kind of respect and regard. \nThat is why so many people love him, as I do, and care for him as a \nhuman being, and respect his convictions and his principles.\n  I say to Bob and to the members of the Killeen family how indebted \nall of us in Minnesota are to all of you for lending your spouse, and \nyour father, to us during these years. I know it took many hours and \nnights away from his family for Bob to do the work that he was \ncommitted to doing. I know he would not have wanted it any other way, \nand I know his family would not have wanted it any other way as well.\n  To Bob, I wish you Godspeed. I thank you from the bottom of my heart \nfor the gifts of your wisdom and your principles that you have \nbequeathed to me. I say to you: You have done a remarkably wonderful \njob for Minnesota, Bob.

Madam President, yesterday I introduced the \nWomen's Autoimmune Diseases Research and Prevention Act. This \nlegislation would expand, intensify and better coordinate activities \nbetween the Office on Women's Health, the National Institutes of Health \nand other national research institutes with respect to autoimmune \ndiseases in women.\n  The term ``autoimmune disease'' refers to a varied group of more than \n80 serious, chronic illnesses that involve the human organ system; the \nnervous, gastrointestinal and endocrine systems; the skin and other \nconnective tissues; the eyes; and blood and blood vessels. These are \nillnesses where the body's protective mechanisms go haywire, and where \nthe body's immune system attacks the very organs it was designed to \nprotect.\n  Overall, some 50 million Americans are afflicted with some form of \nautoimmune disease. But for reasons we do not understand, the vast \nmajority of those affected, approximately 75 percent, are women, and \nmost are stricken during the working and childbearing years. Taken \ntogether, autoimmune diseases represent the fourth largest cause of \ndisability among women in the United States.\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\n  These diseases, which include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, \nscleroderma, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, fybromyalgia, \nHashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, Epstein-Barr virus and \nchronic active hepatitis, are heartbreaking and debilitating. In \nvirtually all of these diseases the female-to-male ratios are \ndramatically skewed toward women, in some cases by ratios as high as 50 \nto 1.\n  Autoimmune diseases remain among the most poorly understood and \npoorly recognized of any category of illnesses, and although science \nsuggests they may have a genetic component, they can cluster in \nfamilies as different illnesses. For example, a mother may have lupus; \nher daughter, diabetes; and her grandmother, rheumatoid arthritis.\n  To help women live longer, healthier lives, more research is needed \nto shed light on genetic as well as hormonal and environmental risk \nfactors that contribute to the causes of autoimmune diseases, as well \nas providing early diagnosis and treatment.\n  The legislation I have introduced addresses all of these issues. It \ndirects the Office on Women's Health to conduct or support research to \nexpand the understanding of the causes of, and develop methods for \npreventing, autoimmune diseases in women, including African American \nwomen and other women who are members of racial or ethnic minority \ngroups. It calls for more epidemiological studies to address the \nfrequency and natural history of these diseases and the differences \namong women and men.\n  The bill also promotes the development of safe, efficient and cost-\neffective diagnostic approaches to evaluating women with suspected \nautoimmune diseases, as well as clinical research on new treatments and \nrehabilitation for women. Finally, it provides for expanded information \nand education programs for patients and health care providers on \ngenetic, hormonal, and environmental risk factors associated with \nautoimmune diseases in women, as well as the prevention and control of \nsuch risk factors.\n  Autoimmune diseases run the gamut from mild to disabling to life \nthreatening. Nearly all affect women at far greater rates than men. The \nquestion before the scientific community is ``why?'' We have come a \nlong way in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune disease. But more \nwork is desperately needed, more information must be made available, \nand more resources must be devoted to this effort.\n  The Women's Autoimmune Diseases Research and Prevention Act can \ncontribute to the growing body of knowledge about these awful \nillnesses. But it is not enough to simply understand these diseases \nwell. We must ensure that the millions of American women stricken with \nautoimmune disease also live long, and well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3297-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO ROXANNE GRIDER\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, today I rise to honor Roxanne \nGrider of Bullitt Central High School in Shepherdsville, KY.\n  I am extremely proud to announce that Ms. Grider is one of only 10 \nspecial education teachers in the Nation to receive the 2002 Shaklee \nAward for outstanding teachers of students with disabilities. She also \nis the first Kentuckian to receive this distinction since the award's \ninception 5 years ago. This award is given by the Glenda B. and Forrest \nC. Shaklee Institute for Improving Special Education and includes a \n$1000 prize and a trip to Wichita, KS for a conference featuring \nprevious award winners and representatives of the Shaklee Institute.\n  After receiving a bachelor's degree in history and secondary \neducation from Centre College in Danville, KY, Roxanne looked for a job \nas a high school history teacher. Fortunately for the special education \ncommunity, she had no luck finding a teaching job in the field of \nhistory. Due to the rising demand for special education teachers, \nRoxanne was immediately offered a position in the Hopkins County School \nsystem. After going through an emergency certification process, Roxanne \nheaded back to the classroom to focus her studies on helping those less \nfortunate individuals. She eventually received her master's degree, \nspecial education certificate, and Rank 1, which means she took 30 \nhours beyond her master's degree, from the University of Louisville. \nTen years has now passed since she took that first job, and I believe \nRoxanne has taken full advantage of what appeared to be a professional \nmishap.\n  In her teaching career, Roxanne has set herself apart due to her \ninnovate mind and enduring spirit. In the classroom, she empowers her \nstudents with real-life responsibilities such as planning and cooking \nmeals, cleaning, and shopping. In the fall, her class has its own \nbusiness, the B.C. Cookie and Candle Co., which sells glass jars filled \nwith layers of cookie ingredients and topped with fabric covered lid. \nShe wants all of her students to believe in themselves and what they \ncan accomplish in life. It would be very easy and probably convenient \nfor her to treat these children as if they were helpless, but she \nrefuses to look at them in such a manner. For Roxanne, these children \nhave the opportunity to live a proactive life full of adventure and \naction. Ultimately, she wants all of her students to have a job when \nthey finish. Although it may not have been the field she wanted to \nenter, special education turned out to be the field Roxanne was \ndestined to enter. She has touched many lives and truly made a \ndifference.\n  I once again congratulate Roxanne for being honored with such a \nprestigious award. I am proud to have such an amazing and talented \nwomen looking after Kentucky's special children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3297-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THOMAS V. DOOLEY OF THE NEW JERSEY STATE AFL-CIO\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I rise today to recognize \nThomas V. Dooley for his years of devotion and commitment to the \nMiddlesex County, NJ AFL-CIO Labor Council. Mr. Dooley is retiring from \nhis position as president after many years of outstanding service.\n  A devoted father and husband, Mr. Dooley has played an important and \nprominent role in Middlesex County labor. Labor has a long history in \nthis country for speaking up for the concerns of workers who would \notherwise not be heard. But through the leadership and guidance of \npeople such as Thomas Dooley their voices are being heard and action is \nbeing taken. As the International Representative for the Paper, Allied \nIndustrial, Chemical and Energy Worker International Union of New \nJersey, Thomas has been an effective and powerful voice for his members \non a variety of critical issues.\n  Thomas Dooley has also been very involved in the community. He is \ncurrently vice president of the David B. Crabiel Scholarship \nFoundation, the Assistant Treasurer for the Middlesex County Board of \nSocial Services and is a member of the Board of Directors for New \nBrunswick Tomorrow. He has excelled in his career, in his community and \nhas dedicated his entire life towards helping others.\n  So I join with Thomas Dooley's brothers and sisters in the labor \nmovement in recognizing his service to the community, his countless \nacts of compassion, and his commitment to working men and women. May \nhis spirit of service and community be a model for all of us to admire \nand emulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3297-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3297-S3298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IDAHO TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, today President Bush is \nrecognizing the national Teacher of the Year, and I want to join him in \nrecognizing teachers across America for the vital work they do. I come \nfrom a family of educators, so I have seen firsthand the impact \nteachers have on children. They do this because they care about each \nand every child they teach. These public servants deserve our gratitude \nand thanks.\n  While I believe this can be said of all teachers, I would like to \nrecognize one particular teacher today who embodies this sentiment. She \nis Jennifer Williams, of Nampa, ID, and she was chosen by my State as \nTeacher of the Year.\n  One look at her career shows why she was chosen as the Teacher of the \nYear. She has dedicated 29 years of her life to teaching, and those 29 \nyears have been full of innovation and a real love for education. Not \nonly has she been busy in the classroom, she has also found time for \nactivities which enrich the community and help kids outside of school. \nFor example, she has co-chaired Boise's Art for Kids project and \ncreated\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\na youth art program through which she and her students go to rural \ncommunities to help children with art lessons.\n  While these activities are important, her classroom work is what \ntruly sets her apart. She has received many awards for this work in the \npast, including being named Mountain Home School District's teacher of \nthe year in 1991, as well as receiving the 1992 USWest Outstanding \nTeacher Award, the 2000 Governor's Award in the Arts, the 2001 Idaho \nArt Teacher of the Year, and the 2001 Unsung Heroes Award.\n  Her students adore her and her peers respect her. This what every \nteacher strives for, and Nancy has earned this regard. As Marilyn \nHoward, the Idaho State Superintendent of Education, said, ``Mrs. \nWilliams stands out as one of those individuals who is a teacher in \neverything she does, not just in the classroom working with students, \nbut also in her workplace and in her community. Her passion and \ndedication show in her accomplishments.''\n  As you can see, Jennifer Williams is truly a treasure for her school, \nfor Idaho, and indeed for the Nation in general.

Madam President, I rise today to recognize a group \nof Vermonters who have long served our state. It is with much pride and \nadmiration that I congratulate the United Way of Chittenden County for \n60 years of service in the greater Burlington area.\n  For the past 60 years, the United Way of Chittenden County has been \nproviding relief and assistance to its community. In October of 1942, \nfounders Henry Way, C.P. Hasbrook, and I. Munn Boardman started the \nBurlington Community Chest. The chest's first campaign raised over \n$100,000 to help organizations like the Burlington Boys Club, the YMCA \nand the Salvation Army. Over the years, the chest evolved into the \nUnited Way of Chittenden County, one of Chittenden County's foremost \nbenefactors, a community-based, problem-solving organization. This past \nyear, the United Way of Chittenden County raised a record $3.75 million \nto help its neighbors, both local and afar. This is a remarkable sum, \nand one that reflects the strong commitment of the United Way to \nsupport the welfare and growth of Vermont and her people.\n  The United Way of Chittenden County has become much more than a \nfundraising organization. They now train volunteers and coordinate a \nvast number of mentoring opportunities in Chittenden County, working \nwith both national programs, like America Reads and the Retired and \nSenior Volunteer Program, and local groups, including Vermont's many \nmuseums, schools, and conservation societies. The United Way works to \nmake Chittenden County a stronger community, tending to those in need. \nThe many people who work and volunteer for the United Way become \ncommunity supporters and community leaders. After graduating from law \nschool, I was recruited to do my part and volunteer for the United Way \nof Chittenden County. It was a meaningful experience and one that has \nremained in the front of my memory during my 27 years in the U.S. \nSenate. Just as impressive as the volunteers of the United Way are \nthose who benefit from the United Way's programs. They too become \nactive and contributing members and leaders of their communities.\n  The organization's actions following the unspeakable events of \nSeptember 11, 2001, demonstrated the strength and commitment of the \nUnited Way of Chittenden County. The United Ways of Vermont contributed \n$400,000 to the September 11th Fund, including over $200,000 from the \nUnited Way of Chittenden County. At the same time, the United Way of \nChittenden County still managed to raise more funds for Vermont's \nprograms than any previous year. This accomplishment is due in no small \npart to Campaign Chair Lisa Ventriss, whose devotion ensured that the \nUnited Way will continue helping Vermonters, even while it contributes \nto a national cause of such gravity and importance. This feat is a \ntestament to the generosity and dedication of the United Way of \nChittenden County, and of all Vermonters.\n  I would like to thank Gretchen Morse, the executive director of the \nUnited Way of Chittenden County, for her commitment to this \norganization's success and Vermont's well-being. Her leadership has \nhelped keep the United Way of Chittenden County one of the most cost-\neffective charities of its kind. Indeed, 85 cents of every dollar \ncollected by the United Way of Chittenden County goes directly back to \nthe community, a number well above the national average. Given this \norganization's unyielding support, it is no surprise that the United \nWay State of Caring Index now ranks Vermont as the fifth most caring \nState in the Union.\n  Sixty years after its founding, the United Way of Chittenden County \nremains a model for charitable organizations across the State and \nacross the country. I join the people of Chittenden County, VT, and the \nentire Nation in thanking the United Way for six decades of community \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3298-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN HONOR OF SUSAN S. BENJAMIN UPON BEING SELECTED AS THE 2002 NEW \n                       MEXICO TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to honor Susan S. \nBenjamin of Los Alamos, NM, who is in the Nation's Capitol today to be \nrecognized as the 2002 New Mexico Teacher of the Year. She was one of \n57 teachers from across the country who were honored by President Bush \nin a White House ceremony today for excellence in their profession. I \nam honored to have the opportunity to make a few remarks.\n  For the past 32 years, Susan has been making a difference in \nchildren's lives. As an elementary school teacher, she has touched the \nhearts and minds of her students, while generating interest and \nenthusiasm in learning. Parents, colleagues, and students all reap \npraises upon her for the excitement she brings to the classroom.\n  Previously, Susan has been selected as the Los Alamos Public Schools \nTeacher of the Year. She also received the New Mexico State Award for \nExcellence in Math Teaching on two separate occasions.\n  Through her dedicated service, Susan has earned a national reputation \nas an outstanding teacher. She has participated in nationwide \nActivities Integrating Math and Science, AIMS, workshops, working with \nother teachers to demonstrate techniques for math and science \neducation.\n  Her efforts to increase student awareness of the importance of \nscience and math education complements many of the ideas expressed in \nthe newly authorized No Child Left Behind Act. Our children need the \ntools necessary to compete in a marketplace dominated by computers and \ninformation technologies that demands a high level of proficiency in \nmath and science. Dedicated teachers like Susan will now have more \nfreedom to develop programs related to technology which will ultimately \nbenefit her students.\n  Susan has helped set the bar for excellence in teacher quality. I am \nencouraged to know that a teacher of her caliber will now have greater \nflexibility in providing her students the skills necessary to succeed \nin tomorrow's marketplace.\n  I am proud to honor Susan Benjamin, our 2002 New Mexico Teacher of \nthe Year. On behalf of the Senate and New Mexico, I thank this fellow \nNew Mexican for making a difference in our children's lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3298-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3298-S3299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GIRL SCOUTS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, for nearly a century, the Girl \nScouts have provided girls with enriching, educational, and above-all \nfun activities that have helped to mold more than 50 million women. \nThis tradition continues today.\n  This year the Girl Scouts are celebrating their 90th birthday. I \ncommend\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\ntheir work in shaping society. The Girl Scouts serves to teach our \nfuture leaders and creates a refuge where young women can find \nthemselves.\n  Their mission is to help all girls to grow strong. They stress the \ndevelopment of a woman's whole being, while fostering physical, mental, \nand spiritual growth. Girl Scouts enables women to reach their full \npotential. Not only do the Girl Scouts empower women to strive for \ntheir goals, but it teaches them responsibility, values, and decision \nmaking skills that are the basic foundations for success.\n  Since its founding, Girl Scouts across the Nation have been serving \nour communities. During World War I Girl Scouts learned about food \npreservation, sold war bonds, and collected peach pits to use in gas \nmask filters. In the 1950s Girl Scouts were working to break racial \ndiscrimination. And today Girl Scouts are on the cusp of technological \ninsight, working hard to end hunger, save the planet, and help support \nthose less fortunate then themselves.\n  The simplest things that Girl Scouts do impacts everyday people. In \nthe wake of September 11, Girl Scouts across the Nation sent thank-you \ncards to the rescuers, and contributed $1 a piece to send to the \norphans of Afghanistan. Throughout its long history, Girl Scouts has \nled efforts to tackle important societal issues and has remained \nproactive in its commitment to inclusiveness. Today we look to the \nfuture and our young people for reassurance. We look to the youth and \nsee promise. We know that girls growing up today will need to take on \nchallenges involving health, economics, politics, and social change. \nOur future leaders will have to be value conscious, globally aware, \ntechnologically skilled, and able to act with self-confidence. These \nare the very skills the Girl Scouts work to encourage in every girl.\n  Being a Girl Scout is important to the girls. Only a Girl Scout can \nexplain what it truly means to be part of the organization. A Girl \nScout from Illinois put it best:\n\n       Being a Girl Scout is really fun. You can learn about \n     growing up in a fun, roundabout kinda way. You can go on a \n     six-day canoe trip or go on a two-hour hike. You can help \n     with the Special Olympics or help someone with their \n     homework. You can make a quilt or make a get-well card. Being \n     a Girl Scout is being what you want to be.\n\n  Girl Scouts is about being well-rounded and being yourself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3299-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              2002 PENNSYLVANIA BOYS BASKETBALL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. SPECTER.

Madam President, I rise today to congratulate Ben \nLeber of the Kansas State University Wildcats. Ben, a Vermillion, South \nDakota native, was chosen in the third round of the National Football \nLeague's 2002 Draft by the San Diego Chargers, and was the 71st overall \ndraft pick.\n  At Vermillion High School, Ben excelled both in the classroom and on \nthe football field. Ben played offense, as a running back, and defense, \nas a linebacker. He was a two-time All-State and All-Conference \nselection and played in the North-South Dakota All-Star game. He was \nalso named to the Academic All-State team and was an honor roll student \nevery year in high school. In 1997, his senior year, he was a Parade \nAll-American, the only player from South Dakota to receive the honor \nthat year, and received an honorable mention to the All-USA team by USA \nToday. At VHS, Ben also participated in Track and Basketball.\n  At KSU, where Ben is a Business-General Management major, he started \n35 of his last 37 games as an outside linebacker, continuing the \nschool's excellent linebacker tradition. His junior year, Ben was an \nAll-Big Twelve Conference second-team pick. His senior year, he was an \nAll-American third-team selection by the Associated Press and a \nConsensus All-Big Twelve Conference first-team choice. Ben was also \nnamed to the Butkus and Lombardi Award watch lists and was invited to \nparticipate in the prestigious Senior Bowl. Ben was a team \nrepresentative and defensive captain both his junior and senior years. \nOver the course of his career at KSU, Ben had 216 tackles, 13.5 sacks, \n11 passes broken, three forced fumbles and one fumble recovery.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Leber \nfamily, who have played no small role in Ben's success: his parents Al \nand Han, his brothers Jason and Aaron, and his sister Gina. I also want \nto congratulate VHS head football coach Gary Culver, who guided Ben and \nthe Tanagers to the South Dakota 11A State Championship in 1995.\n  Ben reflects the best of South Dakota, and I know I speak for the \nentire state when I congratulate him on being drafted.

His wisdom, compassion, and \nspiritual leadership have guided hundreds of families in Jewish \ntradition. He has taken his congregation through the arc of life \nexperiences; from birth to bar and bat mitzvah to marriage and through \nmemorial, his kindness and strength have been a constant source of \nsupport for all.\n  Rabbi Goldberg has also been a fine educator.

Madam President, on this the 87th anniversary of \nthe Armenian Genocide, I would like to take a few moments to pay \ntribute to the men, women and children who lost their lives in the 20th \ncenturies' first systematic attempt to extinguish an entire people.\n  The past century was marred by many acts of unthinkable brutality and \ngenocide. Among these events was the Armenian Genocide. April 24 marked \nthe inception of a brutal campaign to eliminate Armenians from the \nTurkish Ottoman Empire. It was on this day in 1915 that 300 of the \nleaders in Istanbul's Armenian community were rounded up, deported and \nmurdered along with 5,000 of the poorest Armenians who were executed in \nthe streets and in their homes. During the period from 1915-1923, \napproximately 1.5 million Armenians perished under the rule of the \nTurkish Ottoman Empire. Countless other Armenians fell victim to \ndeportation, expropriation, torture, starvation and massacre. It is out \nof necessity that all freedom loving people must remain vigilant in \ntheir efforts to rebut and refute those who would deny the events of \nthe Armenian genocide ever occurred.\n  The Armenian genocide was the result of a consciously orchestrated \ngovernment plan. Henry Morgenthau Sr., the American Ambassador to the \nOttoman Empire, sent a cable to the U.S.\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\nState Department in 1915 saying that the, ``deportation of and excesses \nagainst peaceful Armenians is increasing and from harrowing reports of \neye witnesses it appears that a campaign of race extermination is in \nprogress under a pretext of reprisal against rebellion.''\n  During my tenure in the Senate, I have spoken out about the Armenian \nGenocide because we must acknowledge the horrors perpetrated against \nthe Armenian people and reaffirm our commitment to ensure that the \nworld cannot and will not forget these crimes against humanity. We must \nspeak out against such a tragedy and dedicate ourselves to ensuring \nthat evils such as the Armenian Genocide are not revisited on our \nplanet. This is the highest tribute we can pay to the victims of any \ngenocide. It is important that we take time to remember and honor the \nvictims, and pay respect to the survivors that are still with us.\n  In the Rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building there is an \nimportant exhibit displayed by the Genocide Project. The Genocide \nProject is an organization that seeks to preserve the memory of the \nArmenian Genocide by creating powerful displays that combine photos and \nthe narrative from survivors of the Genocide. I would urge all my \ncolleagues to view this powerful and moving account of the tragic \nevents which we remember today.\n  The Armenian people have preserved their culture, faith and identity \nfor over 1,000 years. In the last century alone, the Armenian people \nwithstood the horrors of two World Wars and several decades of Soviet \ndominance in order to establish modern Armenia. I hope all my Senate \ncolleagues will join me in honoring and remembering the victims of the \nArmenian Genocide.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to acknowledge \nand commemorate the 87th anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian \nGenocide. I do so every year because the lessons of the past must not \nbe forgotten and the crimes of the past must not be repeated.\n  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire launched a brutal and \nunconscionable policy of mass murder. Over an 8-year period, 1.5 \nmillion Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from \ntheir homes, their property and land confiscated.\n  As Americans, as sons and daughters of liberty, justice and freedom, \nwe must raise our voices and acknowledge this terrible crime to ensure \nthat it does not happen again.\n  Those who would single out men, women, and children to be killed \nsolely on the basis of their race, ethnicity, and religion must know \nthat the United States and the international community will not allow \ntheir crimes to go unpunished.\n  We have seen the crimes of the Armenian Genocide repeated far too \noften in this century: in Germany, in Cambodia, in Rwanda, and in \nBosnia. We have stood by and remained silent. Let us commemorate this \noccasion and state loud and clear: Never again.\n  Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the \nliving. Half a million Armenian Americans reside in my home State of \nCalifornia and I am proud to be their representative in the U.S. \nSenate. They have overcome the horrors of the past to build a better \nfuture for themselves and their families in the United States. They are \na testament to hard work, dedication, and perseverence and they have \ngreatly enriched the culture and civic life of our State.\n  Let us remember the Armenian Genocide. Let us ensure that those who \nsuffered did not die in vain. Let us rededicate ourselves to cause of \nhuman rights for all. Let us work together with Armenia and the \nArmenian American community to create a future filled with hope and \npossibility.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, today marks the 87th \nanniversary of when the Ottoman Empire began a policy to isolate, exile \nand even eliminate the Armenian population. Today, we pause to remember \nand honor the victims of the Armenian genocide. Between 1915 and 1923 \none-and-a-half-million Armenians were systematically murdered at the \nhands of the Ottoman Empire and hundreds of thousands more were forced \nto leave their homes.\n  It has been nearly a century since this period of violence and \nannihilation began, and this anniversary serves as a reminder that this \ntragedy will not be forgotten. It must not be forgotten. Each year I \ncommemorate this date on the Senate floor both to honor those who lost \ntheir lives and to remind the American people that the capacity for \nviolence and hate is still prevalent in our world today. Recent history \nin Bosnia, Kosovo, and Rwanda tells us that systematic brutality and \nthe attempts to extinguish a population because of their ethnicity are \nstill all too real. And recent news reports detailing the re-emergence \nof anti-Semitism worldwide are an admonishment to us all that even \nlessons as searing and tragic as those taught by the Holocaust can be \nforgotten if we do not remain vigilant in our efforts to remember them.\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa, I had the unique \nopportunity to visit the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, \nICTR, in Arusha, Tanzania, earlier this year. There I saw firsthand the \ntremendous progress being made and groundbreaking legal precedents \nbeing set with regards to genocide being seen by the international \ncommunity as a crime against humanity. The court for Rwanda and the \ncourt for the former Yugoslavia send a clear message to the world that \nsuch horrific acts cannot and will not go unpunished. Since I became a \nmember of the U.S. Senate, I have strived to make the protection of \nbasic human rights and accountability for such atrocities worldwide a \ncornerstone in American foreign policy.\n  Today, we remember the Armenian men, women and children who lost \ntheir lives during that tragic time period in world history, as well as \nthe other countless number of past and present victims of \nviolence.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to join my colleagues, my \nfellow Rhode Islanders and our Armenian American community in observing \nthe 87th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\n  Although some in the world still want to convince themselves, as well \nas others, that the deaths of so many Armenians was simply a product of \na civil war, the facts are undeniable: from 1915 to 1923 1,500,000 \nArmenians died, and 500,000 refugees were forced to flee. These facts \nmust continue to be affirmed. To ignore the Armenian Genocide would be \nto ignore history and therefore allow the preconditions to exist for \nanother radical leader to rise and legitimize the future genocide of \nanother of the world's people. Let anyone ask: ``who remembers the \nArmenians?'' and the answer would be: Millions in the United States and \naround the world. Today, Rhode Island is among 31 States which have, by \neither resolution or proclamation, recognized the Armenian Genocide.\n  At the time of the Armenian Genocide, Europe and the United States \nwere too embroiled in the First World War to understand the magnitude \nand consequences of the atrocities being committed and therefore did \nlittle more than protest by correspondence. Understanding and \nremembrance today ensures that the world will respond appropriately to \navert these tragedies tomorrow. As proof, we need only look to NATO's \nquick and decisive action to quell the Kosovo crisis.\n  We must also recognize that, in addition to the tragedies of the \npast, Armenians continue to suffer from the economic effects of natural \ndisaster and the dispute over Nagorno Karabagh. Yet amidst this \nsuffering the Armenian people continue to strive to build an \nindependent democratic nation of peace in the Caucasus region. So, \ndespite crisis elsewhere in the world, we must remain attentive to \nArmenia and the people of Nagorno Karabagh and recognize that \nsignificant economic assistance now will prove to be an investment with \nlong term reward in a region of strategic significance to the United \nStates.\n  Today while we solemnly commemorate the tragedy of the past, let us \nrededicate ourselves to building a strong and vibrant Armenia for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3300-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3300-S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNPUNISHED RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as a member of the \nCommission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I have followed \nclosely human rights developments in the participating States, \nespecially as they have an impact on freedom of thought, conscience, \nreligion or belief. In many former communist countries, local religious \nestablishments have reacted with concern\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nand annoyance about perceived encroachment of religions considered \n``non-traditional.'' But in the Republic of Georgia organized mob \nviolence against those of nontraditional faiths has escalated, largely \ndirected against Jehovah's Witnesses. For over 2 years, a wave of mob \nattacks has been unleashed on members of this and other minority \nreligious communities, and it is very disturbing that the police have \nconsistently either refused to restrain the attackers or actually \nparticipated in the violence.\n  Since October 1999, nearly 80 attacks against Jehovah's Witnesses \nhave taken place, most led by a defrocked Georgian Orthodox priest, \nVasili Mkalavishvili. These violent acts have gone unpunished, despite \nthe filing of over 600 criminal complaints. Reports cite people being \ndragged by their hair and then summarily punched, kicked and clubbed, \nas well as buses being stopped and attacked. The priest leading these \nbarbaric actions has been quoted as saying Jehovah's Witnesses ``should \nbe shot, we must annihilate them.'' Considering the well-documented \nfrenzy of these depredations, it is only a matter of time before the \nassaults end in someone's death.\n  Other minority religious communities have not escaped unscathed, but \nhave also been targeted. Mkalavishvili coordinated an attack against a \nPentecostal church last year during choir practice. His truncheon-\nwielding mob seriously injured 12 church members. Two days before \nChristmas 2001, over 100 of his militants raided an Evangelical church \nservice, clubbing members and stealing property. In February of this \nyear, Mkalavishvili brought three buses of people, approximately 150 \nfollowers, to burn Bibles and religious materials owned by the Baptist \nUnion.\n  Mkalavishvili brazenly holds impromptu press conferences with media \noutlets, often as the violence transpires in the background. With his \nhooligans perpetrating violent acts under the guise of religious piety, \ncamera crews set up and document everything for the local news. The \nabsence of a conviction and subsequent imprisonment of Mkalavishvili is \nnot for lack of evidence.\n  After considerable delay, the Georgian Government did commence on \nJanuary 25 legal proceedings for two mob attacks. However, considering \nthe minor charges being brought and the poor handling of the case, I \nfear Mkalavishvili and other extremists will only be encouraged to \ncontinue their attacks, confident of impunity from prosecution.\n  Since the initial hearing in January of this year, postponement of \nthe case has occurred four times due to Mkalavishvili's mob, sometimes \nnumbering in the hundreds, overrunning the Didube-Chugureti District \nCourt. Mkalavishvili's marauding followers brought wooden and iron \ncrosses, as well as banners with offensive slogans. Mkalavishvili \nhimself even threatened the lawyers and victims while they were in the \ncourtroom. With police refusing to provide adequate security, lawyers \nfiled a motion asking for court assistance, but the judge ruled the \nmaximum security allowed would be 10 policemen, while no limit was \nplaced on the number of Mkalavishvili's followers permitted in the \ncourtroom. In contrast, the Ministry of Interior has reportedly \nprovided more than 200 police and a SWAT team to protect officials of \nits office when Mkalavishvili was brought to trial under different \ncharges.\n  Certainly, the Georgian Government could provide adequate security so \nthat its judicial system is not overruled by vigilante justice. \nUnfortunately for all Georgians, the anemic government response is \nindicative of its inability or worse yet, its unwillingness to enforce \nthe law to protect minority religious groups.\n  As is clearly evident, Georgian authorities are not taking effective \nsteps to deter individuals and groups from employing violence against \nJehovah's Witnesses and other minority faiths. With the ineptitude of \nthe justice system now well known, Mkalavishvili has brazenly and \npublicly warned that the attacks will not cease.\n  Religious intolerance is one of the most pernicious human rights \nproblems in Georgia today. Therefore, I call upon President Eduard \nShevardnadze to take action to end the violence against religious \nbelievers, and prevent attacks on minority religious communities. \nDespite the meetings he held with the various faith communities \nintended to demonstrate tolerance, Georgian Government inaction is \nsending a very different message. Tbilisi's pledge to uphold the rights \nof all believers and prosecute those who persecute the faithful must be \nfollowed by action.\n  As a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nI urge President Shevardnadze to do whatever is necessary to stop these \nattacks, and to honor Georgia's OSCE commitments to promote and ensure \nreligious freedom without distinction. The Georgian Government should \ntake concrete steps to punish the perpetrators through vigorous \nprosecution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3301-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JACK CHURCH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, for 15 years, Jack Church has \nworked tirelessly on behalf of the citizens of Butte County as \nEmergency Management and Veterans' Service Officer. Over the years, \nJack has completed and filed applications for disability, education, \npension, and other benefits for the nearly 900 veterans living in Butte \nCounty. He has also provided assistance to the families of veterans and \nworked to obtain needed military and medical records, as well as medals \nand other decorations for veterans.\n  I have appreciated Jack's work on behalf of veterans over the years. \nHe has been a great advocate for veterans in South Dakota, not only on \nissues that impact the individual veteran and his or her family, but \nalso on issues that impact all veterans, such as maintaining access to \nhealth care services in the Department of Veterans Affairs. He has \nalways recognized the particular issues affecting veterans who live in \nrural areas, whose access to VA health care and other services can be \nlimited by distance or income. He has been active on issues such as \nprescription drug costs for veterans and senior citizens, has advocated \nconcurrent receipt of disability and retiree compensation for military \nretirees, and worked hard to speed up the processing of claims filed by \nveterans. He has truly been a friend to the veterans of South Dakota \nover the years.\n  In 2000, Butte County veterans received $1.8 million in Federal \nbenefits, compared to $900,000 in 1990. This represents Jack's work to \nensure the veterans in Butte County get the benefits they deserve. When \nclaims or requests for records or medals were delayed, Jack was not \nafraid to ``rattle the cages'' to get the necessary action on behalf of \nthe veteran. At last resort, he would contact my office for assistance \nin some of these cases. Thanks to his efforts, countless veterans in \nButte County and the surrounding region have benefitted from services \nprovided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. His comments and \ninsight on veterans issues have helped me over the years in my fight to \nbring more attention and action on health care, education, and other \nissues affecting veterans. I commend Jack for his dedication and \ncommitment to forging relationships that have the best interests of the \nindividual veteran in mind.\n  In addition to his great work with South Dakota veterans, I have \nappreciated Jack's involvement in other areas in his community. As \nemergency management officer for Butte County, Jack has helped develop \nand administer disaster plans for the citizens of Butte County. In \ntimes of crisis, Jack was always in the middle of the action, helping \nto coordinate relief efforts and provide assistance to individuals in \ntime of need. Whether it was finding shelter during an evening storm, \nor providing food stuffs or even porta-potties, Jack has always been \ndedicated to getting assistance and emergency help to victims. But Jack \nhas also been very proactive, helping to educate the public on the \nimportance of awareness in times of emergencies. Together with other \nemergency management officials in South Dakota, I was pleased with \nJack's efforts to help me promote the need for, and importance of, \nweather radios to the citizens of South Dakota.\n  Jack Church richly deserves the thanks of his community. It is an \nhonor for me to share his accomplishments with my colleagues and to \npublicly commend him for serving South Dakota and our country.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3302-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n                       HONORING STEPHEN H.T. LIN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to honor and \ncongratulate Mr. Stephen H.T. Lin, a choral music teacher at Atherton \nHigh School in Louisville, KY, for being named the 2002 Teacher of the \nYear for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Stephen Lin conducted his first rehearsal and performance at the age \nof 10. From that moment on, he knew the joyous sounds of music would \ndetermine the direction his life would take. During his junior and \nsenior years of high school, Stephen was named the director of the \nschool choir and discovered that he had a special gift when it came to \nteaching music to others. Not only did he find that his fellow students \nresponded to his methods, but he also realized how good it felt to \nshare in the learning process with others. Although his father, a music \nprofessor at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary-School of Church \nMusic, tried to discourage him from pursuing a career teaching music \nbecause of the lack of financial reward, Stephen could not rightly deny \nhis calling in life. For 26 years now, Stephen Lin has helped students \nof all ages appreciate the joys of music. He has excelled in his innate \nability to make the learning process an enjoyable and exciting \nexperience for all involved. His choirs, through active involvement \nwith parents, students, fundraising and grants, have traveled and \nperformed in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, \nGreece, Germany, Great Britain, Holland, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, \nRussia and Switzerland. They have sung pieces in several African \ndialects, Chinese, Czech, French, Icelandic, German, Hebrew, Latin, \nJapanese, Krao, Maori, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Somoan, Spanish \nand Swedish. Under Lin's direction, Atherton's music department was \ndesignated a Grammy Signature School, one of only a hundred high school \nchoral programs in the Nation chosen for this distinction. Throughout \nhis teaching career, Lin has introduced his students not only to music \nbut also to the world and all that it has to offer.\n  Winning this year's Teacher of the Year Award for the Commonwealth of \nKentucky was not the first time Stephen Lin has been recognized for his \ndiligent work in and outside of the classroom. He has been included in \n``Who's Who Among American Teachers'' three times and has been listed \nin ``Who's Who in the South and Southwest.'' He has also been \ndesignated ``Music Teacher of the Year'' by Kentucky District 12 and an \n``Outstanding Young Man of America.'' Lin is a recipient of the Ashland \nInc. Golden Apple Achiever Award; the Governor's Scholars Program's \nOutstanding Educator Award; Atherton High School's Excellence in \nTeaching Award; the Jefferson County Sisterhood/Brotherhood Martin \nLuther King Award; and the WHAS-TV Golden Apple Award. To say the \nleast, Stephen Lin has taken full advantage of his opportunities in \nteaching. He has been a teacher, mentor, and friend to all of his \nstudents throughout his career.\n  I would like to once more congratulate Stephen Lin on winning such a \nprestigious and important award. His work shapes the future leaders of \nKentucky. I applaud his commitment to the educational community and \nthank him for not listening to his father so many years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3302-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF SISTER ADRIAN BARRETT\n\n Mr. SPECTER.

She later \nearned a bachelor of arts degree from Marywood College and a master's \ndegree in Afro-Asian history from St. John's University. In 1986, she \nwas conferred an honorary Doctor of Social Science degree by the \nUniversity of Scranton.\n  Through her work, Sister Adrian demonstrated her dedication to the \nservice of the less fortunate. She is a co-founder of Project Hope at \nCamp St. Andrew. In 1985, she established Sisters of the IHM-Friends of \nthe Poor to bring together, as she says, ``those who can give with \nthose who have a need to receive.'' Sister Adrian facilitates one of \nthe largest Thanksgiving dinners in the country, aimed not just at the \nimpoverished and the homeless, but also senior citizens and residents \nof nursing and personal care homes. She also makes sure that during the \nDecember holiday season, children's gifts, Christmas trees and food \nbaskets are available to parents who are unable to afford them.\n  Sister Adrian's extraordinary work was the subject of an award-\nwinning PBS documentary depicting her various activities with youth, \nthe elderly, and the underprivileged in Scranton. She was also honored \nwith the Christopher Spirit Award, the Martha Brinton Wollerton Award, \nand the United Neighborhood Centers of America Award. Scholarships at \nKeystone College and the University of Scranton are named in her honor.\n  For her leadership and service on behalf of the less fortunate, I \nwould like to extend the gratitude and recognition of the U.S. Senate \nto Sister Adrian Barrett.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3302-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 10:26 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 861.

A bill to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act \nto provide coverage for domestic violence screening and treatment, to \nauthorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to \nimprove the response of health care systems to domestic violence, and \ntrain health care providers and federally qualified health centers \nregarding screening, identification, and treatment for families \nexperiencing domestic violence; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the \nDomestic Violence Screening and Services Act of 2002, an act to improve \nthe response of health care systems to domestic violence, and to train \nhealth care providers and federally qualified health centers regarding \nscreening, identification, and treatment for families experiencing \ndomestic violence.\n  Nearly one third of American women, 31 percent, report being \nphysically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point \nin their lives, and about 1200 women are murdered every year by their \nintimate partner, nearly 3 each day. 37 percent of all women who sought \ncare in hospital emergency rooms for violence related injuries were \ninjured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend. In \naddition to injuries sustained during violent episodes, physical and \npsychological abuse are linked to numerous adverse health effects \nincluding arthritis, chronic neck or back pain, migraine and other \nfrequent headaches, problems with vision, and sexually transmitted \ninfections, including HIV/AIDS.\n  Each year, at least 6 percent of all pregnant women, about 240,000 \npregnant women in this country, are battered by the men in their lives. \nThis battering leads to complications in pregnancy, including low \nweight gain, anemia, infections, and first and second trimester \nbleeding. Pregnant women are more likely to die of homicide than to die \nof any other cause.\n  Currently, about 10 percent of primary care physicians routinely \nscreen for intimate partner abuse during new patient visits and 9 \npercent routinely screen during periodic checkups. Recent clinical \nstudies have shown the effectiveness of a 2-minute screening for early \ndetection of abuse of pregnant women. Additional longitudinal studies \nhave tested a 10-minute intervention that was highly effective in \nincreasing the safety of pregnant abused women. 70 to 81 percent of \npatients studied reported that they would like their health care \nproviders to ask them privately about intimate partner violence.\n  Medical services for abused women cost an estimated $857,300,000 \nevery year. It is time for us to also authorize resources to promote \nthe effort to make screening for domestic violence routine in health \ncare settings. This bill would establish domestic violence prevention \ngrants in the amount of $5 million dollars per year to improve \nscreening and treatment for domestic violence in federally qualified \nhealth centers. Grants could be used for the implementation, \ndissemination, and evaluation of policies and procedures to guide \nhealth care professionals and staff to respond to domestic violence. \nGrants could also be used to provide training and follow-up technical \nassistance to health professionals and staff to screen for domestic \nviolence, and then to appropriately assess, treat, and refer patients \nwho are victims of domestic violence to domestic violence service \nproviders. In addition, grants could be used for the development of \nonsite access to services to address, the safety, medical, and mental \nhealth needs of patients either by increasing the capacity of existing \nhealth professionals and staff to address these issues or by \ncontracting with or hiring domestic violence advocates to provide the \nservices.\n  This bill would also authorize the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to award grants in the amount of $5 million per year to \nstrengthen the response of State and local health care systems to \ndomestic violence by building the capacity of health personnel to \nidentify, address, and prevent domestic violence. Up to 10 grants would \nbe utilized to design and implement comprehensive statewide strategies \nin clinical and public healthcare settings and to promote education and \nawareness about domestic violence at a statewide\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nlevel. Up to 10 additional grants would be used to design and implement \ncomprehensive local strategies to improve the response of the health \ncare system in hospitals, clinics, managed care settings, emergency \nmedical services, and other health care settings.\n  Finally, this bill would also ensure that health care professionals \nworking in the National Health Service Corps receiving training on how \nto screen, assess, treat and refer patients who are victims of domestic \nviolence. Our health care system represents a potentially life saving \npoint of intervention for those experiencing domestic violence. We need \nto support these efforts to improve the ability of our health care \nsystem to be a safe place for women to turn to when most in need.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Summary--The Domestic Violence Screening and Services Act of 2002\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       The Domestic Violence Screening and Services Act of 2002 \n     would create domestic violence prevention grants to improve \n     screening and treatment for patients at Federally Qualified \n     Health Centers. The bill would also provide grants to \n     strengthen the response of State and local health care \n     systems to domestic violence and would ensure that health \n     care professionals working in the National Health Service \n     Corps receive training on how to screen, assess, treat, and \n     render patients who are victims of domestic violence.\n\n\n                   federally qualified health centers\n\n       In an effort to increase screening and access to services \n     for these patients who are or may be experiencing domestic \n     violence the bill amends Part P of title III of the Public \n     Health Service Act by adding a new Sec. 3990 creating \n     Domestic Violence Prevention Grants in the amount of 5 \n     million dollars per year for four years.\n       Funds would be used to design and implement comprehensive \n     local strategies to improve the health care response to \n     domestic violence in federally qualified health centers. \n     These strategies would include: the development, \n     implementation, dissemination, and evaluation of policies and \n     procedures to guide health care professionals and staff \n     responding to domestic violence; the provision of training \n     and follow-up technical assistance to health care \n     professionals and staff to screen for domestic violence, and \n     then to appropriately assess, record in medical records, \n     treat, and refer patients who are victims of domestic \n     violence to domestic violence services; the development of \n     on-site access to services to address the safety, medical, \n     mental health, and economic needs of patients either by \n     increasing the capacity of existing health care \n     professionals and staff to address these issues or by \n     contracting with or hiring domestic violence advocates to \n     provide the services.\n\n\nGrants for Domestic Violence Screening and Treatment in State and Local \n                           healthcare Systems\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services acting through \n     the Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children \n     and Families shall award grants to fund 10 demonstration \n     projects at the state level and 10 demonstration grants on \n     the local level to develop comprehensive strategies to \n     improve the response of the healtcare system to domestic \n     violence.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance \ncompensation for veterans with hearing loss, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, today I introduce legislation on \nbehalf of American veterans whose hearing loss may have resulted from \ntheir military service. The Veterans Hearing Loss Compensation Act of \n2002 would accomplish two goals: first, it would correct a long-\nstanding inequity in compensating veterans for service-related hearing \nloss. Second, it would direct VA, with input from outside experts, to \ndetermine whether service in certain military occupations can be \npresumed to be associated with hearing loss.\n  Currently, section 1160 of title 38, United States Code, directs VA \nto extend special consideration when evaluating veterans' service-\nconnected disabilities in ``paired organs or extremities,'' such as \neyes, kidneys, or hands. If there is damage to both organs, even if \nonly one resulted from military service, the disability of the non-\nservice-connected organ may be considered.\n  For all listed disabilities except hearing loss, the law requires \nonly ``loss'' or ``loss of use,'' whereas ``total deafness'' is \nrequired in rating hearing loss. If hearing loss in either ear is \nanything less than total, VA cannot even consider the loss in the non-\nservice-connected ear. Section 2 of this bill would remove this \nrequirement for total hearing loss in either ear, allowing VA to \nconsider the effect of any non-service-connected disability when rating \nhearing loss.\n  Section 3 of this bill would require VA to contract with an \nindependent scientific organization, such as the National Academy of \nSciences, to review scientific evidence on occupational hearing loss, \nparticularly acoustic trauma experienced during military service. This \nlegislation would also require VA to review its own claims and record \nof medical treatment for hearing loss or tinnitus in veterans. Through \nthese two avenues, VA should be better able to determine objectively \nwhether service in certain military specialties might be associated \nwith an increased risk of hearing loss later in life.\n  Once the outside scientific authority reports to VA, the Secretary \nwould be required to determine whether the evidence warrants presuming \nan association between certain military occupations and hearing loss or \ntinnitus. If VA finds sufficient evidence linking noise exposure in \nthese occupations to veterans' later hearing loss, the Secretary would \nbe required to develop regulations for providing disability benefits to \nthese veterans; if VA determines that no presumptive service-connection \nis appropriate, the Secretary would be required to publish this \ndetermination and report to Congress on the basis of that decision.\n  With the aging of the veterans population, the number of claims for \nhearing loss or tinnitus continues to climb. VA faces difficulties in \ndetermining whether certain veterans can attribute their hearing loss \nto damage suffered decades ago during military service, especially as \nmany veterans received no appropriate hearing evaluation at discharge.\n  I realize that the proposed process is not an immediate fix, but it \nshould provide VA, Congress, and veterans with a solid basis for \ntackling this difficult problem. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important piece of legislation.\n  I request that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit reviews of criminal records of applicants \nfor private security officer employment; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am introducing along with Senators \nThompson, Lieberman and McConnell the Private Security Officer \nEmployment Standards Act of 2002, a bill that would provide private \nsecurity firms an opportunity to gain access to national criminal \nhistory information to determine whether or not employees or applicants \nfor employment pose a threat to the facilities and persons they are \nsupposed to protect.\n  Large numbers of critical non-governmental facilities, from power \nplants to schools to hospitals, are protected by private security firms \nand their civilian security officers. Keeping these facilities secure \nfrom terrorism or other forms of violent attack is critical to our \nnational security. Yet currently most private security employers cannot \nobtain timely national criminal background check information on the \nvery people they need to hire to protect these key facilities. This \nlegislation seeks to correct that. This bill would authorize private \nsecurity firms to request Federal background check information on \ncurrent and prospective employees through the appropriate State \nagencies, thereby permitting firms to obtain relevant criminal history \ninformation they might not otherwise receive.\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\n  The Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the FBI \nmaintains complete criminal history records for both Federal crimes and \nState crimes on individuals with criminal records in the United States. \nSearches are most efficiently conducted by using fingerprints to ensure \nefficiency and accuracy. We have already passed legislation \nspecifically permitting other industries, the banking, nursing home, \nand child care industries, to name a few, to test their prospective \nemployees against the FBI's comprehensive records. Many of the reasons \nthat justified passage of those laws, especially the desire to ensure \nthat those who provide certain important services have a background \ncommensurate with their responsibilities, argues for passage of this \nbill as well.\n  This legislation will enhance our Nation's security. As an adjunct to \nour Nation's law enforcement officers, private security guards are \nresponsible for the protection of numerous critical components of our \nNation's infrastructure, including power generation facilities, \nhazardous materials manufacturing facilities, water supply and delivery \nfacilities, oil and gas refineries, and food processing plants. The \napproximately 13,000 private security companies in the United States \nemploy about 1.5 million persons nationwide. Given the critical nature \nof the facilities private security officers are hired to protect, it is \nimperative that we provide access to information that might disclose \nwho is unsuitable for protecting these resources.\n  We understand that in about 40 States, private security companies are \nrequired to receive a State license in order to conduct business. \nRelying upon a Federal bill passed in the early 1970's, 37 States and \nthe District of Columbia have passed legislation authorizing State \nagencies to request both State and Federal record searches. Despite \nthis authorization, security firms report that searches of both State \nand Federal databases is the exception rather than the rule. That is \nbecause only one State, California, makes such reviews mandatory. In \nthe other jurisdictions with authorizing statutes, reviews of the \nFederal database are conducted at the discretion of the States. I am \ntold that in approximately half of the 36 States with authorizing \nstatutes, typically only State databases are searched. An additional 13 \nStates have not even authorized any form of Federal criminal background \ncheck. What that means is that in approximately 31 States, a private \nsecurity employer typically has no access to any Federal criminal \ndatabase information. In these 31 States, an employment applicant in 1 \nState could have a serious criminal conviction in another State and \nstill be permitted to perform sensitive security work. The State \nconducting the search would have no idea such a conviction in another \nState existed without access to the Federal database.\n\n  Further, even in those few States that actually conduct Federal \nrecords searches, I am told that searches of the backgrounds of new \nemployees in the Federal database often take 90 to 120 days. While \nchecks are pending, security guards are often provided a temporary \nlicense. This 90 to 120 day period is more than enough time for a guard \nwith a temporary license to perpetrate dangerous acts. In light of our \nurgent need to strengthen our homeland security, this lack of access to \ncriminal checks and the time it takes to complete such checks is \nunacceptable. We need to act in order to make it easier for States and \nemployers to gain timely access to this information.\n  The bill strikes the appropriate balance between the interests of all \nparties involved.\n  First, the bill permits private security employers to request that \nthe FBI criminal history database be searched for prospective or \nexisting employees. Requests must be made by the employers through \ntheir States' identification bureau or similar State agency designated \nby the Attorney General. Employers will not be granted direct access to \nthe FBI records. Instead, States will serve as intermediaries between \nemployers and the FBI to: one, ensure that employment suitability \ndeterminations are made pursuant to applicable State law; two, prevent \ndisclosure of the raw FBI criminal history information to the employers \nand the public; and three, minimize the FBI's administrative burden of \nhaving to respond to background check requests from countless different \nsources. The program will not cost the Federal Government anything. The \nlegislation allows the FBI, and States if they so choose, to charge \nreasonable fees to security firms to recover their costs of carrying \nout this act.\n  Second, the bill protects employee and prospective employee's \nprivacy. Before an FBI background check can be conducted, the employee \nor applicant for employment must grant an employer written consent to \nrequest the FBI database search. In addition, the criminal history \nreports received by the States will not be disseminated to employers. \nInstead, in States that have laws regulating private security guard \nemployment, designated State agencies will simply be required to use \nthe information provided by the FBI in applying their State standards. \nFor those States that have no standards, the States will be instructed \nto inform requesting employers whether or not employees or applicants \nhave been convicted of either: one, a felony; two, a violent \nmisdemeanor within the past 10 years; or, three, crime of dishonesty \nwithin the past 10 years. Thus, only the fact that a conviction exists \nor not will be provided by States to employers, and the privacy of the \nrecords themselves will be maintained. All information provided to \nemployers pursuant to this act must be provided to the employees or \nprospective employees. Furthermore, the bill establishes strong \ncriminal penalties for those who might falsely certify they are \nauthorized security firms or otherwise use information obtained \npursuant to this act beyond the act's intended purposes.\n  Third, the bill protects States' rights. The bill does not impose an \nunfunded mandate on the States. It reserves the right of States to \ncharge reasonable fees to employers for their costs in administering \nthis act. Moreover, if a State wishes to opt out of this statutory \nregime, it may do so at any time.\n  I believe that the time is right for us to enact this legislation. It \nstrikes the right balance between the need for employers to gain access \nto this critical information and the privacy rights of current and \nprospective security guards. We have worked with the FBI to ease the \nadministrative process, and it will cost the Federal Government \nnothing. There is no undue burden being placed on our States.\n  Passage of this act will plug a hole in our homeland security. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Housing Act to simplify the \ndownpayment requirements for FHA mortgage insurance for single family \nhomebuyers; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, today I am introducing the ``FHA \nDownpayment Simplification Act of 2002'' with a number of my \ncolleagues. As the list of original cosponsors indicates, this piece of \nlegislation has broad, bipartisan support. This is because the Federal \nHousing Administration, FHA, has long been a tool to increase \nhomeownership in America.\n  Since its inception in 1934, the FHA has helped millions of American \nfamilies achieve the dream of homeownership. Currently, FHA accounts \nfor about 20 percent of the mortgage market. However, FHA is even more \nimportant to first time homebuyers, buyers with lower incomes, and \nminority homebuyers, many of whom have not been well served by the \ntraditional marketplace. For these borrowers, FHA is the ticket to the \nAmerican dream.\n  Indeed, the very strong economy helped raise overall homeownership \nrates through the 1990s to historically high levels, both for the \npopulation as a whole and among underserved buyers. By 1999, \nhomeownership increased to 66.8 percent. But it was the FHA that helped \nensure those benefits were widely available.\n  For example, according to data provided by the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, HUD, first time homebuyers accounted for 82 \npercent of all FHA loans in the year 2000; almost half of FHA-insured \nloans went to low-income borrowers in metropolitan areas; and over one-\nthird of FHA loans went to African-American and Hispanic borrowers. In \neach case, FHA played a more significant role than the conventional \nmarket.\n  The role played by FHA in spreading the benefits of homeownership to \na broader range of Americans is the central reason my colleagues and I \nbelieve it is important to renew and make permanent the law authorizing \nthe streamlined downpayment calculation for all FHA single family \ninsured loans. The streamlined downpayment, which is current law, was \ninitially tried as a pilot in Hawaii and Alaska in 1996 before being \nextended nationwide in 1998. It was subsequently reauthorized again \nuntil the end of this year. Without Congressional action, the law will \nexpire, resulting in higher costs for millions of Americans seeking the \nbenefits of homeownership.\n  The streamlined downpayment process, as its name implies, is \nrelatively simple and straightforward. The buyer puts down at least 3 \npercent of the acquisition cost of the home. The acquisition cost \nincludes both the sales price and the closing costs. The old system \nrequired different downpayment rates for each portion of a mortgage. \nThis approach is complex, multi-step calculation that often confused \nconsumers, realtors, and lenders alike, and resulted in higher overall \nclosing costs for the consumer.\n  For example, for a property with a sales price of $150,000 and $3,000 \nin closing costs, the streamlined approach that would be continued by \nthis legislation would save the borrower almost\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\n$2,200 in closing costs. For a more modest home costing $100,000 with \n$2,000 in closing costs, the savings would be about $350 over the old \nsystem.\n  The streamlined FHA downpayment process has been working extremely \nwell. That is why both the National Association of Realtors and the \nMortgage Bankers Association of America support this legislation. \nPromoting homeownership is an important value that all of us have \nsupported through the years. Passing this legislation is one way to \nhelp more and more Americans achieve this important goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2239\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I rise today, along with the senior \nSenator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, to introduce a bill that will help \nthousands of Americans achieve the dream of homeownership.\n  Homeownership is the primary source of a household's net worth and \nthe fundamental first step toward accumulating personal wealth. It is \nalso one of the greatest driving forces to a healthy economy for our \nNation. Congress must work hard to produce public policies that promote \nhomeownership to further America's growth and prosperity. This \nlegislation does just that.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will make permanent an \nexisting down payment simplification program that created a simplified \nformula to determine the proper down payment for FHA loans. This \nprogram has become an invaluable tool for helping thousands of families \nachieve the American dream of buying their first home. This bill will \npermanently eliminate the burdensome and unnecessary formulas \npreviously used to determine the proper down payment for FHA loans, and \nwill also lower the size of necessary down payments.\n  The simplified calculation was begun as a pilot program in 1996 in \nHawaii and Alaska. It proved so easy and successful that it was \ntemporarily extended nationwide in 1998. In 2000, the calculation was \nre-extended 27 months, to December 31, 2002. Unless Congress extends \nthe program, home buyers will be required to use the old, complicated \nand confusing method of calculating the appropriate down payment \namounts for all loans after December 31.\n  To help my colleagues understand the importance of making this \nprogram permanent, I should explain the basic difference between the \ntwo formulas.\n  Under the down payment simplification program, FHA borrowers must \nmake cash contributions of at least 3 percent of the acquisition cost, \nincluding closing costs of the loan. It is that simple.\n  Under the old formula, different down payment rates were required for \neach portion of a mortgage. For example, if the acquisition cost of the \nhome is $150,000, the borrower would have to pay 3 percent on the first \n$25,000, 5 percent on the next $100,000 and 10 percent on the final \n$25,000. And that's not all. There is also another set of calculations \ndone based on the appraised value of the home to determine the maximum \nallowable mortgage in any transaction.\n  Clearly, the streamlined formula is a far more simple process. In the \nend, the down payment simplification process results in lowering the \namount of the down payment necessary to purchase a FHA single-family \nhome and simplifies the formula for the homebuyer in the process.\n  It is estimated that one-third of all FHA borrowers will have to make \nhigher down payments if the simplification process is not made \npermanent. This could mean that without passage of this legislation, \nthousands of families that otherwise could afford to buy their homes \nwill be denied the chance to do so because an unnecessarily complicated \nformula will create large, unaffordable down payments.\n  The effects would be particularly acute in states where over 40 \npercent of the buyers would be affected, such as California, Colorado, \nMaryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, Washington, Utah, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Connecticut, Alaska, Hawaii \nand New Hampshire.\n  In 2001, in my home State of Nevada alone, over 16,600 families \npurchased a home with a FHA insured loan. Of those, all benefitted by \nhaving a more simple process to follow, while 6,761 homebuyers \nbenefitted from the streamlined formula process with a lower down \npayment. That is an amazing amount of homes that may not have been \npurchased had this program not been in place.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support of this important legislation. \nIf passed, this legislation will help thousands of Americans throughout \nour country realize their dream of homeownership.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nSarbanes, for all his hard work on this very important legislation. I \nappreciate his determination to make home ownership a reality for so \nmany Americans.\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Johnson):\n  S. 2240. A bill to combat nursing home fraud and abuse, increase \nprotections for victims of telemarketing fraud, enhance safeguards for \npension plans and health care benefit programs, and enhance penalties \nfor crimes against seniors, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today I am introducing the Seniors Safety \nAct of 2002, a bill to protect older Americans from crime. I am pleased \nto have Senators Daschle, Kennedy, Torricelli, Harkin, Bingaman, \nFeingold, and Johnson as cosponsors for this anti-crime bill.\n  The Seniors Safety Act contains a comprehensive package of proposals \nto address the most prevalent crimes perpetrated against seniors, \nincluding proposals to reduce health care fraud and abuse, combat \nnursing home fraud and abuse, prevent telemarketing fraud, and \nsafeguard pension and employee benefit plans from fraud, bribery, and \ngraft. In addition, this legislation would help seniors obtain \nrestitution if their pension plans are defrauded.\n  Older Americans are the most rapidly growing population group in our \nsociety, making them an even more attractive target for criminals. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has predicted that the number \nof older Americans will grow from 13 percent of the U.S. population in \n2000 to 20 percent by 2030. In Vermont, seniors comprise about 12 \npercent of the population, and it is expected that that number will \nincrease to 20 percent by 2025.\n  As the Nation's crime rates dropped dramatically during the 1990s, \ncrime against seniors remained stubbornly resistant. This may be \nbecause elders are susceptible to more fraud crimes and fewer violent \ncrimes than younger Americans. According to a 2000 Justice Department \nstudy, more than 9 out of 10 crimes committed against older Americans \nwere property crimes, most especially theft. As our Nation addressed \nour violent crime problem, we did not take a comprehensive approach to \ndeterring the crimes that so affect the elderly, like telemarketing \nfraud, health care fraud, and pension fraud. The Seniors Safety Act \nprovides such a comprehensive approach, and I urge the Senate to do its \npart to make it law.\n  The Seniors Safety Act instructs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to \nreview current sentencing guidelines and, if appropriate, amend the \nguidelines to include the age of a crime victim as a criterion for \ndetermining whether a sentencing enhancement is proper. The bill also \nrequires the Commission to review sentencing guidelines for health care \nbenefit fraud, increases statutory penalties both for fraud resulting \nin serious injury or death and for bribery and graft in connection with \nemployee benefit plans, and increases criminal and civil penalties for \ndefrauding pension plans.\n  One particular form of criminal activity, telemarketing fraud, \ndisproportionately impacts Americans over the age of 50, who account \nfor over a third of the estimated $40 billion lost to telemarketing \nfraud each year. The Seniors Safety Act continues the progress we made \nin the 105th Congress with passage of the Telemarketing Fraud \nPrevention Act and in the 106th Congress with the Protecting Seniors \nfrom Fraud Act, which included provisions from the Seniors Safety Act \nthat I introduced in the last Congress. The legislation I introduce \ntoday addresses the problem of telemarketing fraud schemes that too \noften succeed in swindling seniors of their life savings. Some of these \nschemes are directed from outside the United States, making criminal \nprosecution more difficult.\n  The act would provide the Attorney General with a new, significant \ncrime-fighting tool to prevent telemarketing fraud. Specifically, the \nact would authorize the Attorney General to block or terminate \ntelephone service to telephone facilities that are being used to \nconduct such fraudulent activities. The Justice Department could use \nthis authority to disrupt telemarketing fraud schemes directed from \nforeign sources by cutting off the swindlers' telephone service. Even \nif the criminals manage to acquire a new telephone number, temporary \ninterruptions will prevent some seniors from being victimized.\n  The bill also establishes a ``Better Business Bureau''-style \nclearinghouse at the Federal Trade Commission to provide seniors, their \nfamilies, and others who may be concerned about a telemarketer with \ninformation about prior fraud convictions and/or complaints against the \nparticular company. In addition, the FTC would refer seniors and other \nconsumers who believe they have been swindled to the appropriate law \nenforcement authorities.\n  Criminal activity that undermines the safety and integrity of pension \nplans and health benefit programs threatens all Americans, but most \nespecially those seniors who have relied on promised benefits in \nplanning their retirements. Seniors who have worked faithfully and \nhonestly for years should not reach their retirement years only to find \nthat the funds they relied upon were stolen. This is a significant \nproblem. According to the Attorney General's 1997 Annual Report, an \ninteragency working group on pension abuse brought 70 criminal cases \nrepresenting more than $90 million in losses to pension plans in 29 \ndistricts around the country in 1997 alone.\n  The Seniors Safety Act would add to the arsenal that Federal \nprosecutors have to prevent and punish fraud against retirement plans. \nSpecifically, the Act would create new criminal and civil penalties for \ndefrauding pension plans or obtaining money or property from such plans \nby means of false or fraudulent pretenses. In addition, the act would \nenhance penalties for bribery and graft in connection with employee \nbenefit plans. The only people enjoying the benefits of pension plans \nshould be the people who have worked hard to fund those plans, not \ncrooks who get the money by fraud.\n  Health care spending consists of about 15 percent of the gross \nnational product, or more than $1 trillion each year. Estimated losses \ndue to fraud and abuse are astronomical. A December 1998 report by the \nNational Institute of Justice, NIJ, states that these losses ``may \nexceed 10 percent of annual health care spending, or $100 billion per \nyear.''\n  As more health care claims are processed electronically, without \nhuman involvement, more sophisticated computer-generated fraud schemes \nare surfacing. Some of these schemes generate thousands of false claims \ndesigned to pass through automated claims processing to payment, \nand result in the theft of millions of dollars from Federal and private \nhealth care programs. Defrauding Medicare, Medicaid and private health \nplans increases the financial burden on taxpayers and beneficiaries \nalike. In addition, some forms of fraud may result in inadequate \nmedical care, harming patients' health as well. Unfortunately, the NIJ \nreports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately target \nvulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, \nwho are less willing or able to complain or alert law enforcement.''\n\n  We saw a dramatic increase in criminal convictions for health care \nfraud cases during the 1990s. These cases included convictions for \nsubmitting false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance \nplans; fake billings by foreign doctors; and needless prescriptions for \ndurable medical equipment by doctors in exchange for kickbacks from \nmanufacturers. In 1997 alone, $1.2 billion was awarded or negotiated as \na result of criminal fines, civil settlements and judgments in health \ncare fraud matters.\n  We can and must do more. The Seniors Safety Act would allow the \nAttorney General to bring injunctive actions to stop false claims and \nillegal kickback schemes involving Federal health care programs. The \nbill would also provide law enforcement authorities with additional \ninvestigatory tools to uncover, investigate, and prosecute health care \noffenses in both criminal and civil proceedings.\n  In addition, whistle-blowers who tip off law enforcement about health \ncare fraud would be authorized under the Seniors Safety Act to seek \ncourt permission to review information obtained by the Government to \nenhance their assistance in False Claims Act lawsuits. Such qui tam, or \nwhistle-blower, suits have dramatically enhanced the Government's \nability to uncover health\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\ncare fraud. The act would allow whistle-blowers and their qui tam suits \nto become even more effective.\n  Finally, the act would extend anti-fraud and anti-kickback safeguards \nto the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. These are all \nimportant steps that will help cut down on the enormous health care \nfraud losses.\n  As life expectancies continue to increase, long-term care planning \nspecialists estimate that over 40 percent of those turning 65 \neventually will need nursing home care, and that 20 percent of those \nseniors will spend 5 years or more in homes. Indeed, many of us already \nhave experienced having our parents, family members or other loved ones \nspend time in a nursing home. We owe it to them and to ourselves to \ngive the residents of nursing homes the best care they can get.\n  The Justice Department has cited egregious examples of nursing homes \nthat pocketed Medicare funds instead of providing residents with \nadequate care. In one case, five patients died as result of the \ninadequate provision of nutrition, wound care and diabetes management \nby three Pennsylvania nursing homes. Yet another death occurred when a \npatient, who was unable to speak, was placed in a scalding tub of 138-\ndegree water.\n  This act provides additional peace of mind to residents of nursing \nhomes and those of us who may have loved ones there by giving Federal \nlaw enforcement the authority to investigate and prosecute operators of \nnursing homes for willfully engaging in patterns of health and safety \nviolations in the care of nursing home residents. The act also protects \nwhistle-blowers from retaliation for reporting such violations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2240\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of older Americans is rapidly growing in the \n     United States.

Madam President, I am pleased to join Senators Leahy \nand Daschle today as an original cosponsor of the Seniors Safety Act, \nlegislation that has been referred to as ``a new safety net for \nseniors.'' It is that, but it is also much more. Indeed, this bill is a \npotent weapon designed to track down and punish those criminals who \nwould prey on the trust and good will of America's seniors. This bill \nputs crooks on notice that crimes against seniors, from violent \nassaults in the streets, to abuses in nursing homes, to frauds \nperpetrated over the telephone lines, will not be tolerated.\n  Seniors represent the most rapidly growing sector of our population. \nIn the next 50 years, the number of Americans over the age of 65 will \nmore than double. Unless we take action now, the frequency and \nsophistication of crimes against seniors will likewise skyrocket. The \nSeniors Safety Act was developed to address, head-on, the crimes which \nmost directly affect the senior community, including telemarketing \nfraud, and abuse and fraud in the health care and nursing home \nindustries. It increases penalties and provides enhancements to the \nsentencing guidelines for criminals who target seniors. It protects \nseniors against the\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\nillegal depletion of precious pension and employee benefit plan funds \nthrough fraud, graft, and bribery, and helps victimized seniors obtain \nrestitution. And finally, this bill authorizes the Attorney General to \nstudy the problem of crime against seniors, and design new techniques \nto fight it.\n  Criminal enterprises that engage in telemarketing fraud are some of \nthe most insidious predators out there. Americans are fleeced out of \nover $40 billion dollars every year, and the effect on seniors is \ngrossly disproportionate. According to the American Association of \nRetired Persons, ``The repeated victimization of the elderly is the \ncornerstone of illegal telemarketing.'' A study has found that 56 \npercent of the names on the target lists of fraudulent telemarketers \nare those of Americans aged 50 or older. Of added concern is the fact \nthat many of the perpetrators have migrated out of the United States \nfor fear of prosecution, and continue to conduct their illegal \nactivities from abroad.\n  In one heartbreaking story, a recently-widowed New Jersey woman was \nbilked out of $200,000 by a deceitful telemarketing firm from Canada, \nwho claimed that the woman had won a $150,000 sweepstakes, the prize \ncould be hers, for a fee. A series of these calls followed, convincing \nthis poor woman, already in a fragile mind-state after her husband's \ndeath, to send more and more money for what they claimed was an \nincreasingly large prize, which, of course, never materialized.\n  Our bill authorizes the Attorney General to effectively put these \nvultures, even the international criminals, out of business by blocking \nor terminating their U.S. telephone service. In addition, it authorizes \nthe FTC to create a consumer clearinghouse which would provide seniors, \nand others who might have questions about the legitimacy of a telephone \nsales pitch, with information regarding prior complaints about a \nparticular telemarketing company or prior fraud convictions. \nFurthermore, this clearinghouse would give seniors who may have been \ncheated an open channel to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.\n  In 1997, older Americans were victimized by violent crime over \n680,000 times. The crimes against them range from simple assault, to \narmed robbery, to rape. While national crime rates in general are \nfalling, seniors have not shared in the benefits of that drop.\n  This Act singles out criminals who prey on the senior population and \npenalizes them for the physical and economic harm they cause. In \naddition, we intend to place this growing problem in the spotlight, and \nurge Congress and Federal and State law enforcement agencies to \ncontinue to develop solutions. To this end, we have authorized a \ncomprehensive examination of crimes against seniors, and the inclusion \nof data on seniors in the National Crime Victims Survey.\n  Seniors across the country have worked their entire lives, secure in \nthe belief that their pensions and health benefits would be there to \nprovide for them in their retirement years. Unfortunately, far too \noften, seniors wake up one morning to find that their hard-earned \nbenefits have been stolen. In 1997 alone, $90 million in losses to \npension funds were uncovered. Older Americans who depend on that money \nto live are left out in the cold, while criminals enjoy the fruits of a \nlifetime of our seniors' labor. The Seniors Safety Act gives Federal \nprosecutors another powerful weapon to punish pension fund thieves. The \nAct creates new civil and criminal penalties for defrauding pension of \nbenefit plans, or obtaining money from them under false or fraudulent \npretenses.\n  The defrauding of Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurers has \nbecome big business for criminals who prey on the elderly. According to \na National Institutes of Health study, losses from fraud and abuse may \nexceed $100 billion per year. Overbilling and false claims filing have \nbecome rampant as automated claims processing is more prevalent. \nSimilarly, the Department of Justice has noted numerous cases where \nunscrupulous nursing home operators have simply pocketed Medicare \nfunds, rather than providing adequate care for their residents. In one \nhorrendous case, five diabetic patient died from malnutrition and lack \nof medical care. In another, a patient was burned to death when a mute \npatient was placed by untrained staff in a tub of scalding water. These \nterrible abuses would never have occurred had the facilities spent the \nFederal funds they received to implement proper health and safety \nprocedures. This bill goes after fraud and abuse by providing resources \nand tools for authorities to investigate and prosecute offenses in \ncivil and criminal courts, and enhances the ability of the Justice \nDepartment to use evidence brought in by qui tam, whistleblower, \nplaintiffs.\n  Together these provisions bring much-needed protections to our \nseniors. It sends a message to the cowardly perpetrators of fraud and \nother crimes against older Americans, that their actions will be \nfiercely prosecuted, whether they be here or abroad. And it clearly \nstates that we refuse to allow seniors to be victimized by this most \nheinous form of predation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Collins, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 2244. A bill to permit commercial importation of prescription \ndrugs from Canada, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today I am introducing the Prescription \nDrug Price Parity for Americans Act, along with my colleagues Senators \nJeffords, Collins, Stabenow, Snowe, Wellstone, Levin, and Dayton. I \nintend to come to the floor later in the week to speak about this \nlegislation at greater length, but I wanted to go ahead and introduce \nthe bill today.\n  This bill addresses a growing problem with prescription drug spending \nin our country. Spending on prescription drugs rose 17 percent in 2001, \nfollowing on the heels of a nearly 19 percent increase in 2000 and a 16 \npercent increase in 1999. Unfortunately, many Americans, especially \nsenior citizens and the uninsured, cannot afford the substantially \nhigher prices that they are being charged for their medicines. A \nprescription drug that costs $1 in the United States costs only 62 \ncents in Canada, and that is just not fair.\n  The bill I am introducing today would address this unfair pricing by \ninjecting some price competition into the prescription drug \nmarketplace. This legislation builds on the Medicine Equity and Drug \nSafety, MEDS, Act, which the Senate passed overwhelmingly in 2000 and \nwas enacted into law. Like the MEDS Act, this bill would allow U.S.-\nlicensed pharmacists and drug wholesalers to import FDA-approved \nmedicines, but unlike the 2000 law, this year's bill will be limited to \napproved drugs coming only from Canada. Canada has a drug approval and \ndistribution system similarly strong to the U.S. system. I am very \nconfident that this bill can be implemented immediately while ensuring \nthe safety of our Nation's drug supply and significant cost savings for \nAmerican consumers.\n  Again, I look forward to coming back to the floor to describe this \nlegislation at length at some later opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I am glad we have the opportunity \ntoday to introduce legislation that corrects a sad injustice. This \ninjustice makes American consumers the least likely of any in the \nindustrialized world to be able to afford drugs manufactured by the \nAmerican pharmaceutical industry. That's because of the unconscionable \nprices the industry charges only here in the United States.\n  When I return to Minnesota which I do frequently, I meet with many \nconstituents, but none with more compelling stories than senior \ncitizens struggling to make ends meet because of the high cost of \nprescription drugs, life-saving drugs that are not covered under the \nMedicare program. Ten or twenty years ago these same senior citizens \nwere going to work everyday, in the stores, and factories, and mines in \nMinnesota, earning an honest paycheck, and paying their taxes without \nprotest. Now they wonder, how can this government, their government, \nstand by, when the medicines they need are out of reach.\n  And it is not just that Medicare won't pay for these drugs. The \nunfairness which Minnesotans feel is exacerbated of course by the high \ncost of prescription drugs here in the United States, the same drugs \nthat can be purchased for frequently half the price in Canada. These \nare the exact same drugs, manufactured in the exact same facilities \nwith the exact same safety precautions.\n  All the legislators speaking today have heard the first-hand stores \nfrom our constituents back home. Our constituents are justifiably \nfrustrated and discouraged when they can't afford to buy prescription \ndrugs that are made in the United States, unless they go across the \nborder to Canada where those same drugs, manufactured in the same \nfacilities are available for about half the price.\n  Senior citizens have lost their patience in waiting for answers, and \nso have I. Driving to Canada every few months to buy prescription drugs \nat affordable prices isn't the solution; it's a symptom of how broken \nparts of our health care system are. Americans regardless of political \nparty have a fundamental belief in fairness, and we know a rip-off when \nwe see one. It is time to end that rip-off.\n  While we can be proud of both American scientific research that \nproduces new miracle cures and the high standards of safety and \nefficacy that we expect to be followed at the FDA, it is shameful that \nAmerica's most vulnerable citizens, the chronically ill and the \nelderly, are being asked to pay the highest prices in the world here in \nthe U.S. for the exact same medicines that are manufactured here but \nsold more cheaply in other countries.\n  That is why I am introducing with my colleagues today the Medicine \nEquity and Drug Safety Act of 2002. This bill will amend the Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act to allow American pharmacists and wholesalers to \nimport prescription drugs from Canada into the United States, as long \nas the drugs meet FDA's strict safety standards. Pharmacists \nand wholesalers will be able to purchase these drugs, often \nmanufactured right here in the U.S., at much lower prices and then pass \nthose savings on to consumers. In addition, the bill would give \nindividuals a waiver to import prescription drugs from Canada as long \nas the medicine is for their own personal use and the amount of \nmedicine imported is a 90-day supply or less. This provision will give \nconsumers confidence that, if they follow the rules for personal \nimportation, they won't have to worry about their medicines being \nstopped at the border.\n\n  Our bill addresses the absurd situation by which American consumers \nare paying substantially higher prices for their prescription drugs \nthan are the citizens of Canada. The bill does not create any new \nFederal programs. Instead, it uses principles frequently cited in both \nhouses of the Congress, principles of free trade and competition, the \nhelp make it possible for American consumers to purchase the \nprescription drugs they need.\n  And the need is clear. A recent informal survey by the Minnesota \nSenior Federation on the price of six commonly used prescription \nmedications showed that Minnesota consumers pay, on average, nearly \ndouble, 196 percent, what their Canadian counterparts pay. These \nexcessive prices apply to drugs manufactured by U.S. pharmaceutical \nfirms, the same drugs that are sold in Canada for a fraction of the \nU.S. price.\n  Pharmacists could sell prescription drugs for less here in the United \nStates, if they could buy and import these same drugs from Canada at \nlower prices than the pharmaceutical companies charge here.\n  Now, however, Federal law allows only the manufacturer of a drug to \nimport it into the U.S. Thus American pharmacists and wholesalers must \npay the exorbitant prices charged by the pharmaceutical industry in the \nU.S. market and pass along those high prices to consumers. It is time \nto stop protecting the pharmaceutical industry's outrageous profits, \nand they are outrageous.\n  Let's take a look at the numbers, so there can be no mistake:\n  Where the average Fortune 500 industry in the United States returned \n2.2 percent profits as a percentage of revenue, the pharmaceutical \nindustry returned 18.5 percent.\n  Where the average Fortune 500 industry returned 2.5 percent profits \nas a percentage of their assets, the pharmaceutical industry returned \n16.5 percent.\n  Where the average Fortune 500 industry returned less than 10 percent \nprofits as a percentage of shareholders equity, the pharmaceutical \nindustry returned 33.2 percent.\n  Those huge profits are no surprise to America's senior citizens \nbecause they know where those profits come from, they come from their \nown pocketbooks. It is time to end the price gouging.\n  We need legislation that can assure our senior citizens and all \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nthat safe and affordable prescription medications at last will be as \navailable in the United States of America as they are in Canada. The \nbill we are introducing today accomplishes that end.\n  I also want to point out that our bill includes important safety \nprecautions to make sure we are not sacrificing safety for price. The \nsafety measures provide strong protection for the American public. \nThese protections include: Strict FDA oversight; importation from \nCanada only; strict handling requirements for importers, like those \nalready in place for manufacturers; registration of Canadian \npharmacists and wholesalers with the HHS Secretary; lab testing to \nscreen out counterfeits; lab testing to ensure purity, potency, and \nsafety of medications and; authority for the HHS Secretary to \nimmediately suspend importation of prescription drugs that appear \ncounterfeit or otherwise violate the law.\n  The only thing that is not protected in this bill is the excessive \nprofits of the pharmaceutical industry. My job as a United States \nSenator is not to protect profits but to protect the people. \nColleagues, please join us and support this thoughtful and important \nbill that will help make prescription drugs affordable to the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/24/senate-section/article/S3319-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3319-S3320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3332.
