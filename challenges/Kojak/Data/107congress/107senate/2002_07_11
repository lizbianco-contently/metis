David Jefferson from the Metropolitan Baptist Church \nin Newark with us today. I assure my colleagues, from my own life \nexperience, this is a remarkable man of tremendous energy, leadership, \nand moral character. He leads the largest Baptist church, a very \ndynamic community of believers, in Newark, NJ. Not only are they active \nin their religious life, but they make an enormous contribution to \nredevelopment and the support of the community, reaching out to all who \nare part of the community who sometimes have been left behind. Through \ntheir example, they are demonstrating that access to the American \npromise is true for everyone.\n  In his spare time, he is a senior executive at AT where he brings \nboth great skills as a business person and moral character and \nleadership to his efforts in the business world. We need examples of \npeople who are able to both recognize that our free enterprise system \nneeds to be strong and powerful and have brilliant people who care \nabout producing good services, good products at the right price but on \nan honorable basis. Reverend Jefferson is one who I think demonstrates \nwe can do that, and he does it with great grace.\n  Most importantly, he is a moral leader for a broader community by \ndemonstrating with all aspects of his life how important it is to \nrecognize that we all live under a greater power than what I think we \nsometimes think we live under in our own lives. Sometimes we are too \nfocused on what we are about, and he is a great teacher about the \nimportance that we are one nation under God.\n  I am honored and privileged he has joined us today. I am honored and \nprivileged that he is my friend. I thank the Presiding Officer for the \nopportunity to welcome Rev. David Jefferson to the Senate Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6598-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as every Member of this Chamber knows \nand, more importantly, as every American investor knows, we have \nrecently witnessed lapses in corporate responsibility unlike anything \nthat has occurred during the past 70 years. It is our role to determine \nwhy this has happened and what can be done to prevent it from \ncontinuing to happen. I rise to offer some thoughts, as well as to lend \nmy support, to the accounting reform legislation now on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Several years ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \ncharacterized the latter stages of the great bull market of the 1990s \nas irrational exuberance. Although stock prices rose for a few years \nafter that statement, they ultimately collided with economic reality \nand embarked upon an extended decline. It now appears that that \nirrational exuberance was being sustained in some instances by improper \naccounting. Put differently, one way of satisfying the insatiable \nappetite of some for ever-increasing corporate profits, as well as for \nrich compensation packages, was to cook the books. Many, although not \nall, of the recent alleged abuses have occurred in what has been the \nhot sectors of our economy.\n  Electric deregulation, the development of the Internet, new medical \ntreatments, and the spread of broadband are all thought to hold \nenormous prospect for future growth. Unfortunately, for some of the \ncompanies in those areas the growth in accounting creativity \noutstripped the growth in business fundamentals. I make this point \nbecause I think it contains a lesson for those of us in Congress, as \nwell as for Federal and State regulators.\n  During my years as a financial regulator in my home State of Maine, \nthe advice we gave to investors, to the point where it began to sound \nlike a broken record, was that if it seems too good to be true, it \nalmost certainly is. The comparable message for those of us with \noversight responsibility is that if one is not vigilant during the \nboom, when things seem too good to be true, cleaning up after the bust \nwill be far more difficult.\n  During my first 4 years in the Senate, I was privileged to serve as \nthe chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \nDuring that time, I held more investigations into fraud and abuse in \nour securities markets than on any other subject, despite the fact we \nwere in the midst of a roaring bull market. Indeed, the roaring bull \nmarket made those investigations seem all the more necessary.\n  More recently, Senator Levin and I teamed up in an investigation of \nEnron Corporation, an investigation that is ongoing. In fact, we just \nreleased our first report on the failures of the Enron board of \ndirectors to exercise its fiduciary responsibilities. We found that too \nmany of the Enron directors acted as rubber stamps rather than as \nwatchdogs.\n  In short, the principal lesson of recent events for those of us in \nCongress may be the need to remember the importance of vigorous \noversight and tough enforcement during the good times as well as the \nbad.\n  Let me now turn my attention to the conflicts of interest faced by \nsome accountants, brokers, and corporate directors. American capitalism \nrelies heavily on the fiduciary duty concept to protect those who \nentrust their money to large and often distant corporations. \nAccountants have a duty to investors to ensure the accuracy of \nfinancial statements. Directors have a duty to make certain that \nmanagers act in the best interest of the corporation, and stockholders \nhave a duty to give advice that will best serve their client's needs. I \nbelieve that this structure is fundamentally sound, but I also believe \nwe have allowed these trust relationships to be seriously eroded by \nconflicts of interest.\n\n  Confidence in our capital markets depends upon accurate and fair \nfinancial statements. To achieve that objective, we follow a maxim that \nPresident Reagan put forth in another context; namely, ``trust but \nverify.'' We trust corporate managers to give us honest financial \nstatements but, just in case, we look to accountants to verify the \nnumbers. Too often in the recent past accountants have let us down, \nprincipally because, in my view, conflicts of interest have undermined \ntheir fundamental fiduciary duty to investors. The source of this \nproblem is that some accountants can depend on those whose books they \nexamine not only for their auditing jobs but much more worrisome for \nlucrative consulting contracts.\n  In some ways, the situation for brokers can be even worse, because \nthey frequently have a personal, as well as an institutional, \nrelationship with those to whom they owe a duty. As the recent Merrill \nLynch settlement demonstrated, when the same individuals are involved \nin giving advice to retail customers and securing underwriting business \nfrom the corporations they are supposed to be objectively rating, it is \nthe investor who losses. Again, the fiduciary duty concept is not \ninherently flawed. Rather, it has been eroded by conflicting interests \nthat cannot comfortably coexist.\n  The third component of what might be called the fiduciary duty triad \nis the corporate board. Frequently owing their positions to those whose \nactivities they are to monitor, some board members suffer from the \nappearance, and in some cases the reality, of conflicts of interest. In \nmy view, given\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\ntheir part-time status and their dependence on management for \ninformation, the role of the independent directors, perhaps even more \nthan the role of accountants or those of brokers, needs more scrutiny.\n  In our recent report on the role of the Enron board of directors in \nthe corporation's failure, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nfound that the board ignored countless warning signs of wrongdoing. In \nsome cases, the board actually approved highly irregular, off-the-books \npartnerships that masked the company's true liabilities. The board's \naudit committee failed miserably to ensure the independence of the \ncompany's auditor, allowing Andersen to provide internal audit and \nconsulting services while at the same time serving as Enron's outside \nauditor. In other words, in some ways, Andersen was auditing itself.\n  Finally, directors blessed financial deals that created conflicts of \ninterest for the top executives of Enron Corporation. Such conflicts of \ninterest are rotting the pillars supporting an essential element of \ncapitalism, and that is the ability of investors to rely on those to \nwhom they entrust their money.\n  Excising that rot requires two steps. First, we must redefine the \nroles of the accountant, the broker, and the board member. We must make \nit absolutely clear that their undiluted responsibility is to the \ninvestor.\n  Second, we must enforce those obligations with tough sanctions, such \nas those we approved yesterday, that will deter those who would breach \nthese fiduciary duties. This leads logically to the role of the \nGovernment regulator. I do not see regulation replacing the fiduciary \nroles I have described for the simple reason that having Government \nverify every number in every financial statement would create a nation \nof regulators. The more effective role for the regulator is to make \ncertain that others honor their obligations and to take swift and \nmeaningful action when they do not.\n  I know from personal experience as a regulator in Maine that this is \nno easy task, and it is our responsibility to ensure that the \nregulators who carry it out have the necessary authority and the \nfinancial resources to do the job.\n  I am pleased the bill before us today incorporates provisions from \nlegislation that I have introduced that will allow the Securities and \nExchange Commission to discipline those brokers and investment advisers \nwho have been barred by State regulators from operating within that \nState. As a result, the SEC will have the option of giving nationwide \neffect to the bans imposed by individual States, thus protecting \ncitizens nationwide from dishonest or unethical brokers without having \nto undertake separate investigations. This is especially important \nbecause as we learned in my subcommittee's hearings on fraud in the \nmicrocap stock market, it is very easy for small-time crooks to move \nout of one State and into another, setting up shop and defrauding \ninvestors all over again.\n  The reforms needed to restore trust in our capital markets will \nrequire tough, effective action by government and self-regulatory \norganizations. I call on our Nation's business schools to examine the \nethical and professional training they provide to corporate managers, \naccountants, brokers, and board members. The concept of a free market \nis one that is free from government direction but not free from the \nduty to act ethically, honestly, and competently. If our corporate \nleaders lack integrity, no amount of regulation will preserve our \neconomy. How effectively we are conveying this message strikes me as \nwell within the unique expertise of those running our business schools \nand training our future corporate leaders.\n  Congress, the SEC, State regulators, the exchanges, and perhaps even \nour educational institutions can help solve our current problem. \nNowhere is the obligation to act greater than on Wall Street and in our \ncorporate boardrooms. The American people are justifiably outraged by \nthe breakdown in corporate ethics. This is not thievery by those \nlacking the resources to buy food and medicine, this is thievery by \nthose with the resources to buy Picassos and Porsches. As a people, we \ndo not begrudge others who earn their success, but we will not tolerate \nthose whose success rests on breaching ethical and legal obligations.\n  We must also recognize that although not often mentioned, this \nproblem has ramifications for our standing in the world community at a \ntime when others are waging war on the American system. Our most \nsuccessful exports since the end of World War II have been our \npolitical democracy and our free markets. Indeed, as China \ndemonstrates, our economic views have prevailed even when our political \nideals have yet to take root. Having persuaded the rest of the world of \nthe vitality and the creativity of free markets, it would be tragic if \nwe lost our way just when our economic values are gaining widespread \nacceptance.\n  A particularly ironic aspect of the current situation and one that \nwould have Marx and Lenin spinning in their graves: Russia is taking \nsteps to strengthen its system of corporate governance at a time when \nours appears to be crumbling. While we need not worry that Moscow will \nreplace New York as the world's financial center, it is not \nunreasonable to be concerned about how other nations judge our response \nto our current problems. Indeed, the rise in the euro and the drop of \nthe dollar are disconcerting indications of their view to date. This is \njust one more reason we must act swiftly to put our house in order.\n  Recent corporate misdeeds have caused great harm, costing our economy \nand our shareholders billions of dollars and many people their \nretirement savings as well as their jobs. The impact on investor-\nemployees who have lost both their jobs and their retirement savings \nhas been especially cruel, and those responsible have forgotten that, \nbecause capitalism can survive only if people believe they can trust \nstrangers with their money. Honesty and fair dealing are the lifeblood \nof our economic system.\n  It would also be unfair to paint with too broad a brush. We should \ntake care not to condemn the many executives who do honor their \nobligations to their employees and their shareholders. Indeed, it is \npartly for their benefit as well as for the benefit of all Americans \nthat we must restore confidence in our corporate sector.\n  In 1997, in my first statement on the floor of the Senate, I quoted \nthe following observation from Winston Churchill: ``Some see private \nenterprise as a predatory target to be shot, others as a cow to be \nmilked, but few see it as a sturdy horse pulling the wagon.''\n\n  I added that I do see private enterprise as that sturdy horse, and in \nthe wagon it is pulling are the jobs of our constituents. I continue to \nhold that view. But we must recognize that the wagon has some loose \nwheels. It is our responsibility to the American people to make sure \nthey are tightened and to institute the reforms that are needed to \nrestore faith in corporate America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this week I introduced the Afghanistan \nFreedom Support Act of 2002, S. 2712. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by the senior Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, the former \nchairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Senate. I ask \nunanimous consent his name be added to this bill as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. This legislation is similar to H.R. 3994, sponsored by the \nchairman of the House International Relations Committee, Congressman \nHyde. This bill was passed in the House of Representatives on May 16 by \na vote of 390 to 22.\n  The Afghan Freedom Support Act commits the United States to the \ndemocratic and economic development of Afghanistan. In addition to the \neconomic and political assistance found in title I of this legislation, \ntitle II seeks to enhance the stability and security of Afghanistan in \nthe region by authorizing military assistance to the Afghan Government \nand to certain other countries in the region, including assistance for \ncounternarcotics, crime control, and police training.\n  The United States must stay closely and actively engaged in helping \nAfghanistan through a very dangerous\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\nand difficult transition to stability, security, and, ultimately, to a \ndemocratic government. We are at the beginning of a long process. We \ncannot be distracted or deterred from this objective. Our credibility, \nour word, and our security, are directly linked to success in \nAfghanistan. And there cannot be political stability and economic \ndevelopment in Afghanistan without security.\n  My legislation, and the companion legislation passed by the House, \nwould authorize $1.15 billion over 4 years for economic and democratic \ndevelopment assistance for Afghanistan, as well as up to $300 million \nin drawdown authority for military and other security assistance. The \nmain elements of my legislation are as follows:\n  It authorizes continued efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in \nAfghanistan and among Afghan refugees in neighboring countries; it \nauthorizes resources to help the Afghan government fight the production \nand flow of illicit narcotics; it assists efforts to achieve a broad-\nbased, multi-ethnic, gender-sensitive, and fully representative \ngovernment in Afghanistan; it supports strengthening the capabilities \nof the Afghan government to develop projects and programs that meet the \nneeds of the Afghan people; it supports the reconstruction of \nAfghanistan through creating jobs, clearing landmines, and rebuilding \nthe agriculture sector, the health care system, and the educational \nsystem of Afghanistan; and it provides specific resources to the \nMinistry for Women's Affairs of Afghanistan to carry out its \nresponsibilities for legal advocacy, education, vocational training, \nand women's health programs.\n  This legislation also strongly urges the President to designate \nwithin the State Department an ambassadorial-level coordinator to \noversee and implement these programs and to advance United States \ninterests in Afghanistan, including coordination with other countries \nand international organizations with respect to assistance to \nAfghanistan. In general, the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act provides a \nconstructive, strategic framework for our Afghan policy, and flexible \nauthority for the President to implement it. We must not allow this \nfragile interim Afghan government to unwind. We must put forward the \nappropriate investment of men, effort, and resources to complete the \nobjective of a democratic government in Afghanistan.\n  If Afghanistan goes backward, this will be a defeat for our war on \nterrorism, for the people desiring freedom in Afghanistan and in \ncentral Asia, for America, symbolically, in this region, and for the \nworld. It would be disastrous for our country because it would crack \nthe confidence that people all over the world have in the United \nStates. Afghanistan is the first battle in our war on terrorism.

Mr. President, next week we begin one of the most \nimportant debates that we will have, I believe, as a Senate, throughout \nthis session and possibly for years to come. That is a debate about \nwhether or not we are going to meet two goals that the American people \nhave been asking us to address. The first is a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit for our seniors, for those who have disabilities--a \ncomprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit. Second, we want to \nlower prices--lower prices for everyone.\n  We know in fact not only do seniors, who use the majority of \nprescriptions, have high prices, but everyone who has prescription \ndrugs does. If you are paying through insurance, you are paying higher \ninsurance rates. If you are a businessperson, you are seeing your \nhealth care premiums rising. Small businesses--many in Michigan come to \nme and talk about 30-percent, 35-percent, 40-percent increases. The big \nthree automakers are juggling between being able to afford new \nmaterials for their automobiles and research and all the other costs \nthat they have, versus health care, most of which is prescription drug \nincreases. So everyone is paying.\n  We have two goals. We as Democrats are working very hard, and we \ninvite our colleague to join with us, to provide real coverage for \nprescription drugs and lower prices for everyone.\n  It is incredibly important that we do that. I am concerned, as we \nmove into this debate, given what was done in the House of \nRepresentatives and the efforts now on the airwaves by the organization \nfunded by the pharmaceutical companies that are talking about how what \nwas passed in the House was good enough, I am concerned that we really \ndo what is necessary and not just what is in the interests of the \ndrug companies.\n\n  The drug companies are here in force every single day. We know next \nweek and the week after, as long as we debate issues of lower prices \nand real Medicare coverage, they will be here fighting everything--\nunfortunately. They do wonderful work in research and development. I am \nso pleased that we have so many that are out there doing good work. But \nwe see, as an industry now, their efforts to fight everything.\n  We are talking about corporate responsibility this week on the floor \nof the Senate, the need for corporate accountability. We need corporate \naccountability and ethics in the drug industry as well. I am deeply \nconcerned that we do not see efforts to work with us for something that \nprovides reasonable profit. We want them to succeed, but we do not want \nto continue to see exorbitant price increases and profits on the backs \nof our seniors, those with disabilities, our families, our small \nbusinesses.\n  I am deeply concerned about what we were reading in the paper during \nthe House debate. Our Republican colleagues, in fact a senior House GOP \nleadership aid said yesterday:\n\n       Republicans are working hard behind the scenes on behalf of \n     PhRMA [which is the drug industry lobby] to make sure that \n     the party's prescription drug plan for the elderly suits drug \n     companies.\n\n  This was in the Washington Post, June 19 of this year. They are:\n\n       . . . working hard behind the scenes to make sure that \n     their . . . plan . . . suits the drug companies.\n\n  I hope next week we will work just as hard in this body for a \nprescription drug plan that suits the American people.\n  I am so pleased to see my distinguished colleagues from Georgia here, \none in the chair and the junior Senator who came into the Senate with \nme, who is one of the lead sponsors of the bill that we have in front \nof us along with the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham.\n  We have a plan. We have a plan that works, that pays the majority of \nthe bills, that does the job, that brings together the collective \nbuying power of 39 million seniors, and which will require that prices \nbe lowered. We have the plan. Our plan is not the plan of the drug \ncompanies. It is not the plan which drug companies are advertising \nabout--the pretty ads from Seniors United that are on the air from the \ndrug company, the front senior group that thanks the Republican \ncolleagues in the House for voting for their plan, the plan that \nsupports the drug companies.\n\n  We have a plan for the American people.\n  I would like to share for a moment two stories from the Web site \nwhich I set up. I set up the Prescription Drug People's Lobby. There \nare six drug company lobbyists for every one Member of the Senate. I \ninvited the people of Michigan to join with me to be part\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\nof our people's lobby to make sure the real story gets heard. I would \nlike to share a story from Rochelle Dodgson of Oak Park, MI. I thank \nher for being a part of our Prescription Drug People's Lobby.\n  She writes:\n\n       My mother is currently insured under COBRA after losing her \n     job in August 2001. While she has her basic Medicare \n     coverage, she will lose her supplemental medical coverage in \n     January 2003. She has recently been diagnosed with Multiple \n     Myeloma and will require treatment for this blood disorder \n     the rest of her life. The medications she was taking before \n     this new illness cost over $500 retail monthly. I have not \n     checked the prices of the `chemo' she takes monthly nor the \n     cost of the Procrit she takes weekly. I expect her monthly \n     out-of-pocket expenses to be around $700 a month. Her social \n     security is just over $800 monthly. I can't imagine having to \n     budget food and housing expenses along with medication on \n     that kind of income. My husband and I will try to find a way \n     to budget some of her medical costs into our own expenses but \n     we also care for my husband's mother.\n       My mother is still a viable part of society. She doesn't \n     deserve to be struggling just because she has chronic \n     illness.\n\n  Rochelle, thank you for your story. Your mother does not deserve to \nstruggle with $700 medical bills with a $700-a-month income.\n  I shared that one story today from Michigan. For those who want to \nget involved, please go to my Senate Web site around the country at \nFairdrugprices.org. You can be involved and make your voice heard, and \nthe right thing will happen here in the Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dorgan). Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I echo the eloquent words of the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, who has done yeoman service for \nthis body, for seniors and the disabled of America in helping put \ntogether and advocate for a meaningful drug benefit under Medicare. And \nspecial kudos go to my colleague from Georgia, Senator Miller, and to \nmy distinguished friend from Florida, Senator Graham, for really taking \nthe lead in articulating a Medicare supplement that we can embrace in \nthis body and that the American people can embrace.\n  When I talk to my fellow Georgians about the issues that are most on \ntheir minds, that most affect their lives, the one that I hear about \nmore often than any other is the high cost of prescription drugs. \nEverywhere I go, people ask me, ``When are Congress and the President \ngoing to make good on their promise to help us with prescription \ndrugs?'' And all I can tell them is, That's a fair question; I'd like \nto know, too. Over the past couple of years, their comments have become \nincreasingly urgent. The cost of prescription medications rose a \nstaggering 19 percent in 2000, and another 17 percent in 2001. I can \nassure you most people's incomes didn't rise by 17 percent in 2001. It \nis an iron-clad law of economics that if you live on a fixed income, \nand one portion of your monthly expenses rises dramatically, other \nportions must be reduced. For many of those seniors whose budgets are \nalready stretched as thin as they can go, an increase in prescription \ndrug costs means that expenditures on the other necessities of life--\nbasics like groceries or rent--must be cut. The choice between \nmedically necessary, life-sustaining prescription drugs and the other \nbasics of life is an impossible one--and one that no American should be \nforced to make.\n  The Medicare program has provided for many critical aspects of health \ncare for seniors over the course of its 36-year history, and by and \nlarge it has been a great success. But it has been said that while \nMedicare is a Cadillac program, its model year is 1965. Indeed, if we \nare to claim that Medicare provides health care security for seniors, \nwe must update it to cover the component of health care that for many \nhas become more burdensome than any other--prescription medications. \nPeople are desperate for any help they can get. Congress and the \nPresident promised to deliver that help. If we can't, or won't, the \npeople ought to send this Congress home and elect one that will.\n  There are a number of options on the table right now. Some are \nserious efforts to provide meaningful relief to seniors. Some are not. \nNo one in Congress wants to admit that they are against providing a \nprescription drug benefit for seniors. And I don't blame them. That's \nan indefensible position. So some, especially in the House, write weak \nlegislation that they call a Medicare prescription drug benefit but \nwhich allows drug companies to charge whatever premiums they want, \nleaves huge gaps in coverage, charges a high deductible, relies on \nprivate insurers who have already told us they will not participate, \nand will cover just 19 percent of seniors drug costs over the next \ndecade, according to the CBO. Such a proposal amounts to little more \nthan a ``legislative placebo,'' which its authors know has no chance of \nreally helping seniors, and no chance of passing this Senate. But they \ndraft such legislation not because they think it will help seniors but \nso they can go back home and say that they supported a prescription \ndrug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. They cynically believe that \npeople won't pay enough attention to the substantive differences \nbetween a real proposal and theirs, enabling them to shirk the \nresponsibility that they rightly must bear if this Congress once again \nfails to pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Where I come from, \nwhen you promise people one thing and then try to give them another, \nthat's called a ``bait-and-switch'' scheme. And where I come from, we \nhave a saying: ``That dog won't hunt.''\n  President Bush has made it clear that, in the war against terror, \nthere are no shades of gray. Either you are for us, or you are for the \nterrorists. The same clarity that exists in the Bush doctrine ought to \napply to the present debate on prescription drugs. Either you are for a \nreal prescription drug benefit for seniors, or you aren't. If you are \nfor a weak measure that purports to be a prescription drug benefit but \nhas no chance of ever benefitting anyone, you are not for a real \nprescription drug benefit for seniors, and it is time to come clean and \nsay it. It is long past time to dispense with artful dodging and \nequivocation. Just as no country that deals only halfway with \nterrorists can be considered on our side in the war against terror, so \nno one who proposes a halfway approach to prescription drugs under \nMedicare can be considered to be for real help for seniors. If you \ndon't know whether or not the legislation you are for will provide a \nreal benefit for seniors, let me make it real clear for you: if it was \nwritten by the insurance lobby and endorsed by the drug companies, you \ncan bet it is not a real benefit for seniors.\n  People are hurting. If you need proof, go back to your state or your \ndistrict and spend a day talking with seniors about their daily \nstruggles. You will find genuine hardships, and you will see that it is \nthe most vulnerable among us who are struggling the most. This is a \nserious problem, and we need serious people who will work in good faith \ntoward a solution. In the Senate, I am pleased to have teamed up with \nSenators Zell Miller and Bob Graham as an original cosponsor of the \nMedicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act of 2002, which will provide a \nvoluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit that will deliver real, \nmeaningful help to seniors. Under this proposal, which has received \nhigh marks from the AARP, any Medicare beneficiary who chooses to \nparticipate would, for a monthly premium of $25, receive drug coverage \nfrom the very first prescription filled of the year. There is no \ndeductible, and there are no gaps in coverage. The lowest-income \nseniors would receive full subsidies for premiums and co-payments, and \nthose who earn a little more would receive partial assistance. Our \nproposal, if adopted, will dramatically reduce seniors' out-of-pocket \ncosts for prescription drugs, allowing them to use their food money for \nfood and their rent money for rent. It is with full confidence that I \nsay that this measure is the best proposal on prescription drugs I have \nseen to date, and I commend Senators Graham and Miller in particular \nfor their leadership on it. I urge my colleagues in this body and in \nthe House to act favorably on it without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in saying that the \npiece of legislation we are considering, authored by Senator Graham, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\nMiller, and others, is a good piece of legislation. I am proud to \nsupport it. But let me talk just for a few minutes about this issue \nthat brings us to the floor of the Senate, the issue of prescription \ndrugs, and prescription drug pricing especially.\n  Last year, the cost of prescription drugs in the United States rose \n18 percent; the year before that, 16 percent; the year before that, 17 \npercent. So 16, 17, 18 percent: relentless increases in the price of \nthe cost of prescription drugs.\n  What does that mean to the American people? It is devastating to all \nAmericans who must access these lifesaving, miracle prescription drugs \nbut cannot afford them. It is especially devastating to senior \ncitizens. They make up 12 percent of our population in this country, \nand they consume one-third of all the prescription drugs. They have \nreached those declining income years and discover that miracle and \nlifesaving drugs they need to take are beyond their reach.\n  A woman in North Dakota, at a meeting 1 day, came up to me and said: \nMay I speak with you a moment? She was a thin, frail-looking lady close \nto 80 years of age. She grabbed me by the arm and said: Could you help \nme? I said: I'll sure try.\n  She said: I have problems--diabetes, heart disease--and need to take \nmedicine that the doctor has prescribed, but I can't afford that \nmedicine. Could you help me?\n  And then her eyes filled with tears and her chin began to quiver and \nshe began to cry.\n  All over this country there are men and women--particularly senior \ncitizens, but others as well--who need access to these prescription \ndrugs and cannot afford them.\n  We are going to pass a prescription drug benefit, and we are going to \nput it in the Medicare Program. I support that. Senator Graham, Senator \nMiller, and others have done wonderful work in that area.\n  We are going to do two other things as well. We are going to pass a \npiece of legislation, I hope, that deals with the issue of generic \ndrugs, which is another way to bring down costs; for if we do not do \nsomething about driving down costs, or at least putting downward \npressure on drug costs, then we will simply break the bank. We will \nattach a drug benefit to the Medicare Program but if we don't lower \ndrug costs we will suck that tank dry, and break the back of the \nAmerican taxpayer. We have to put downward price pressure on \nprescription drugs.\n  One other piece of legislation that we are going to consider next \nweek is the issue of reimportation. Senator Stabenow and I, and others, \nhave worked on the issue of reimportation, not because we want \nAmericans to buy their prescription drugs from Canada--and that is what \nour bill will allow to happen; pharmacists and distributors will be \nable to access from Canada the FDA-approved drugs and bring them to \nthis country and pass the savings along to the consumer--it is because \nwe want to use this mechanism to put downward pressure on drug prices \nin this country and force the pharmaceutical manufacturers to reprice \ntheir prescription drugs in the United States. That is exactly what \nwill happen.\n  With unanimous consent, I would like to show two pill bottles on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cleland). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is Celebrex, widely advertised, used for pain, \nparticularly arthritis. It is widely advertised all across this \ncountry. The company that makes this markets it successfully, and good \nfor them for helping produce this medicine. But let me describe the \npricing strategy.\n  If you buy this medicine, Celebrex, in Canada, you get it in this \nbottle, and it costs you 79 cents per tablet. Buy it in the United \nStates, and you get it in this bottle which is essentially the same.\n  So 79 cents for this prescription drug per tablet in Canada, but if \nyou are a U.S. citizen, you pay $2.22. It is the same pill, made by the \nsame company, put in the same bottle, FDA approved. The difference? The \nprice.\n  The U.S. consumer is told: You should pay nearly triple what a \nCanadian consumer is charged by the same company.\n  Question: Why should we allow that to happen? Why should the U.S. \nconsumer pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs \nthat are sold at a fraction of the cost in virtually every other \ncountry of the world?\n  The answer is: It should not continue to happen. We need to put \ndownward pressure on prices in this country on prescription drugs. This \nis not about, as the pharmaceutical industry would allege, shutting off \nresearch and development if you put downward pressure on prices. That \nis nonsense.\n  The fact is, the Europeans pay lower prices--much lower prices--for \nthe same prescription drugs than we do, and yet there is more research \nand development done in Europe than in the United States by the \npharmaceutical manufacturers.\n  My only point is this: The pharmaceutical manufacturers are good \ncompanies. They are the most profitable companies in the world. Good \nfor them. I appreciate, and all Americans appreciate the research and \ndevelopment they do. We, of course, do a substantial amount of it here \nin the Federal Government that is federally paid for as well.\n  I am not suggesting there are bad actors here. I am suggesting the \npricing policy is wrong. The pricing policy is bad. It is not fair to \nsay to the American consumer: You pay the highest prices in the world \nby far for the same drug. No American should have to go to Canada to \nget a fair price on a prescription drug made in the United States. That \nought not happen. We aim to change it, even as we debate this issue of \na prescription drug benefit in the Medicare plan.\n  Why do we want to do that? Because I believe there should be a \nbenefit in Medicare for prescription drugs. But I believe if we do not \ndo something to put downward pressure on prices, we simply break the \nback of the taxpayers and break the bank of the Federal Government. \nThat is why reimportation goes hand in hand with the underlying \nlegislation I am pleased to support, and I commend Senator Graham and \nSenator Miller and Senator Stabenow and others for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, first, I congratulate my colleague from \nNorth Dakota on that very timely and very compelling message he has \njust given.\n  I rise today, also, to speak, once again, about prescription drugs \nand the struggle our seniors are facing each and every day.\n  We are on record as saying we will have a vote in this Senate before \nthe August recess on a prescription bill. I have always hoped that \nmeant adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. We must stick to \nthat schedule. We must honor that commitment.\n  We have kept our seniors waiting in line for too many years, and we \nhave bumped them too many times in the past. We have disappointed them \ntime and time again. We cannot make them wait through another election \ncycle for who knows how many years. If that happens--and a lot of \npolitical pundits are predicting it will--then we should be ashamed of \nourselves.\n  I am telling you, our seniors are not going to accept just a shrug of \nthe shoulders and a ``well, I tried'' explanation. I don't think that \nis going to get it this time around.\n  There is a lot we can do to help seniors with the cost, as the \nSenator from North Dakota has discussed, and also about the coverage of \ntheir prescription drugs. I will work hard to make sure the bill we \npass in the Senate offers real help for our seniors, especially our \nneediest seniors.\n  I recently saw the results of a new study that were shocking to me. \nIt said nearly 1 in 5 American women ages 50 to 64 did not fill a \nprescription for needed medication because they could not afford it. \nThat is ages 50 to 64. Think what the number must be for those over 65.\n  Those are our mothers and our grandmothers. They are those women who \ngave us life and tended to our needs who are now foregoing their needs \nbecause they cannot afford medication. They are putting their health in \njeopardy. Their very lives are being endangered. Their years on this \nEarth are being cut short. Make no mistake about it, if we allow that \nto continue,\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\nthis Congress is an accessory to that crime.\n  I believe the bill I am a cosponsor of, along with Senator Graham and \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Daschle and the senior Senator from Georgia \nwho is presiding, and about 30 other Senators, fulfills our promise to \nall seniors and offers the most for our neediest seniors.\n  Our bill gives our neediest seniors their medicine for free. For \nthose who earn less than $11,900 a year--and that is about 12 million \nseniors out there--there is no premium, there is no copayment. They \nreceive 100-percent coverage from the first prescription filled.\n  To that widow with trembling hands who is trying to cut that pill in \nhalf so her medicine will last a little longer, I hope the Senate will \nsend a message to her that help is on the way. To that old man, proud \nand self-sufficient all his life, who has to whisper to his pharmacist \nthat he doesn't have quite enough in his checking account and he will \nhave to come back later, I hope the Senate will send the message to him \nthat help is on the way.\n  I look forward to debating this provision of our bill and many others \nwhen we take up the prescription drug legislation next week. I urge my \ncolleagues in both Houses and in both parties to keep this in mind: Our \nduty to seniors is not to just debate an issue. They have heard all \nthat before. Our duty is to pass a bill, a meaningful bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today \nin the discussion of pending legislation, as of next week, which will \nrelate to the long-held desire of senior Americans to have within the \nMedicare Program a prescription drug benefit.\n  One of the key issues in the debate we will begin next week will be, \nHow will this benefit be administered? As we answer that question, we \nneed to ask some questions about what do older Americans want. Older \nAmericans want a plan that is straightforward, simple, a plan with \nwhich they are familiar. Even more important, they want a plan that \nactually works, that they can take to the local pharmacy or, if they \nuse a mail order pharmacy, that they can take to the post office box \nand get their drugs.\n  That is why the Senate Democratic bill, which I am sponsoring with \nSenator Miller, Senator Kennedy, and others, including the Presiding \nOfficer, uses the exact same system that America's private insurance \ncompanies use. As an example, this happens to be the Blue Cross Blue \nShield service benefit plan, a plan which many of us as Federal \nemployees utilize. If you turn to page 119, you will see the outline of \nwhat Blue Cross Blue Shield provides and how they provide it. It is \nexactly the same structure we are proposing in our plan. It is a \nstructure with which older Americans, most Americans, are extremely \nfamiliar. It is the same system that predominates in not only Blue \nCross Blue Shield but virtually every other major private insurance \nplan.\n  These plans are based on the concept of using a pharmacy benefit \nmanager, or PBM, as the intermediary between the beneficiary and the \npharmaceutical companies.\n  What do these PBMs do? They negotiate directly with \nthe pharmaceutical companies in order to achieve the lowest prices. \nThey are held accountable for containing costs and providing quality \ncare and service. If they fail to do so, their payments are reduced or \ncan be eliminated.\n\n  To America's seniors, this plan would be like a pair of comfortable \nold shoes, shoes they have been wearing for most of their lives. Would \nit be fair to ask Medicare beneficiaries at the time of retirement to \nsuddenly change shoes? Even more significant, would it be appropriate \nto ask them to put on shoes that don't fit very well? But even more \nthan that, is it fair to ask them to put on shoes of a design which has \nnever been worn by another American anywhere, any time?\n  That is what the House Republican plan runs on: An untried, untested \ndelivery system that would force our seniors to be the guinea pigs for \na social experiment.\n  Their plan would give to a different set of insurance companies \ntaxpayers' dollars as a subsidy to lure them into the market since \ninsurers have already said they don't intend to offer this benefit. \nThey do not believe it is an appropriate use of the insurance system.\n  Our plan would be easy and familiar. Let me briefly mention some of \nthe features of our plan. It would ask seniors who voluntarily elect to \nparticipate--no senior would be required to participate unless they \nchose to do so--to pay a $25 monthly premium. There is no deductible. \nThere will be coverage from the first pill purchased after you sign up. \nThere would be a copayment of $10 for generics, $40 for formulary \nnecessary drugs, and $60 for other drugs. There would be a maximum \npayment out of pocket of $4,000 per year. Beyond that, there would be \nno more copayments.\n  The plan says what it means and it means what it says for all seniors \nall over America. Seniors with incomes below 135 percent of the poverty \nlevel would not pay premiums or copayments. Beneficiaries with incomes \nbetween 135 and 150 percent of poverty would pay reduced premiums. That \nis the plan.\n  We would allow all seniors a choice of which PBM to use. It would be \nrequired that there be multiple PBMs within every section of the \ncountry. Those of you who live in Georgia would have a choice. Those of \nus in Florida would have a choice. Those in North Dakota and Vermont \nwould have a choice.\n  The PBMs would be accountable to the Medicare Program, would be \nrequired to prove their ability to contain costs, or else they wouldn't \nbe awarded a contract to participate. In fact, they would not even get \npaid if they were unable to contain costs and provide the high-quality \nservice which our older Americans deserve. That is in the language of \nthe Graham-Miller-Kennedy-Cleland, and others, legislation.\n  The House Republican plan would leave all these choices in the hands \nof an insurance company. The companies would be allowed to choose the \nbenefit for seniors. Why is that? The House plan only requires that the \nindividual plan meet a vague standard of actuarial equivalence. It does \nnot provide the certainty which American seniors deserve and which they \nwill receive in the Graham-Miller-Kennedy-Cleland, and others, plan.\n  I look forward to a full discussion of this beginning next week.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2673, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2673) to improve quality and transparency in \n     financial reporting and independent audits and accounting \n     services for public companies, to create a Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board, to enhance the standard setting \n     process for accounting practices, to strengthen the \n     independence of firms that audit public companies, to \n     increase corporate responsibility and the usefulness of \n     corporate financial disclosure, to protect the objectivity \n     and independence of securities analysts, to improve \n     Securities and Exchange Commission resources and oversight, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n       Edwards modified amendment No. 4187, to address rules of \n     professional responsibility for attorneys.\n       Gramm (for McConnell) amendment No. 4200 (to amendment No. \n     4187), to modify attorney practices relating to clients.\n\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been cleared by both managers of \nthe bill. We have had a number of inquiries about the need for more \ntime to talk on various issues. As the Chair knows, from 12:30 until 2 \no'clock, we have our policy luncheon, and normally we don't have votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the previously scheduled order, which \nprovided that Senator Enzi be recognized at 12 noon today to make a \nmotion to table the McConnell amendment No. 4200, be modified to \nprovide that the recognition of Senator Enzi occur at 12:45 today, with \nthe additional 45 minutes, from 12 to 12:45, equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Sarbanes and Gramm, or their designees, and \nthat all other provisions of the previous order remain in effect.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to engage in a brief discussion with my colleague from Nevada \nunder my reservation of an objection, if I might. I shall not object to \nthe specific request of the Senator, but I have just visited with the \nchairman of the committee and you know there exists a list of \namendments that Members of the Senate wish to offer to this \nlegislation.\n  As I have watched this process over the last couple of days, it \nappears to me that we have set up a gatekeeper of sorts for determining \nwho will offer amendments and whether there will be votes on the \namendments, and it appears to me we are not making very much progress. \nI would like to get some sense of whether we have a clear process \nbeginning this afternoon, so that this afternoon and this evening we \nmight be able to move through 6, 8, 10 amendments and get time \nagreements so Members of the Senate have the opportunity under the \nrules to offer and have considered amendments that they consider \nimportant in this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee has worked for hours and hours trying to get movement so \npeople could offer relevant amendments. We have been not very \nsuccessful, to be very candid with the Senator from North Dakota. I \nhave stood by the Senator from Maryland and coerced, urged, and we \nhaven't gotten to the debating point yet. We have done everything we \ncan.\n  There are a number of Senators, not the least of whom is the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, who have amendments. There is the Senator from \nMichigan, the Senator from New York, and others who have spent a lot of \ntime wanting to offer amendments. We are doing everything we can. We \nhope the Enzi motion to table will break some of this loose.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota that we understand how he feels. \nThe only thing I will say is there is no gatekeeper. On one bill the \ntwo managers said they would oppose any amendment that was not \nrelevant, but that is not the case now. The Senator from Maryland has \nexpressed to me that there are some relevant amendments which should be \noffered. He has done everything he can to----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, who controls time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia controls the next 45 minutes. There is a unanimous \nconsent request pending.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. If I can ask my friend to let me finish. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time in the colloquy between the Senator from North \nDakota and the Senator from Nevada not take away from the time of the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, continuing on my reservation--and it is \nnot my intention to delay the Senator from West Virginia--I want to try \nto understand what is happening.\n  First, my comments should not in any way suggest that the chairman of \nthe committee hasn't done an extraordinary job. I have great respect \nfor him. But it has been difficult to get amendments up and get votes \non them in the last day or two. There are a good number of very \nimportant amendments.\n  Under the reservation, I say that we know what has happened to the \nstock market in the last few days. We know this is a critically \nimportant issue--this legislation and the amendments to it. We ought \nnot to treat this lightly. This piece of legislation ought to be on the \nfloor and open for amendment, having a robust discussion on the very \nimportant issues dealing with corporate responsibility.\n  Instead, what is happening is we have a couple people on the floor \nwho seem to want to stall this process and prevent amendments from \nbeing considered in order. I hope--and I will come back after lunch \ntoday--to offer at least two amendments. I want to debate them and get \nthem voted on. At least as a Senator I have a right to do that.\n  It is very important to me that I be able to add these amendments. If \nthe Senate doesn't like them, fine, we will vote. But it is important \nto me to have that opportunity. I shall not object to the unanimous \nconsent request with respect to the tabling motion.\n  I wanted to say to the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from \nMaryland, who have done everything humanly possible to try to make this \nprocess work, that there are others in the Chamber who are trying to \ndrag this process out and prevent others from offering amendments. I am \ngoing to assert my rights, to the extent I can, to say that before this \nbill is completed we need to have the best ideas everyone in the Senate \nhas to offer about how to do this job.\n  The economy in this country is in significant trouble. We know it. \nThe confidence the American people have in this economy and corporate \ngovernance has been shattered in many ways. It rests upon the shoulders \nof this institution to pass this legislation and do everything we can \nto make it the best piece of legislation possible to restore that \nconfidence and give some lift to this economy. I wanted to make that \npoint.\n  I appreciate the indulgence and the patience of the Senator from \nNevada. If the Senator from Maryland will give me a chance to say this \nonce again: In no way am I saying the chairman hasn't done everything \nhumanly possible to move this along. He wants to move quickly. I shall \nnot object.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I express my great admiration for what \nSenator Sarbanes has done in presenting to America such a meaningful \npiece of legislation to deal with one of the great scandals that has \noccurred in the history of our free enterprise system, and taking a \nstep toward restoring the confidence of the public in the investment \ncommunity.\n  But as Senator Dorgan, I have an idea which, in fact, in one \ninstance, is parallel to Senator Dorgan's; that is, I believe we need \nto be very clear that we are applying the same standards to \ncorporations that have their corporate headquarters inside the United \nStates as we do to corporations that take advantage of our capital \nmarkets and have chosen to locate or relocate their headquarters \noutside of the United States.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am reclaiming my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object, there are enough \nincentives to do that already in the Tax Code and otherwise. We should \nnot be creating additional incentives for companies to run from their \nresponsibilities within the United States. My specific----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the floor back.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am raising this today----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am reserving my right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will conclude my comments in short order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can either object or not. \nReserving the right to object occurs at the indulgence of those who \nhave the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have built in time for people to speak. \nIt is not fair to Senator Byrd and others who have been waiting to \nspeak. I have no problem with Senator Graham coming. I agree with his \nposition. There is\n\n[[Page S6605]]\n\ntime to be allowed under this unanimous consent agreement. Otherwise, \nthe time will be all gone, and there are two Senators who have an hour \nand a half, by virtue of a unanimous consent agreement entered into \nlast night.\n  It is not fair to use the extra half hour with these speeches that \nare taking away from Senator Byrd and Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object, just for the purpose of \nconcluding my remarks.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the Senator when \nI get the floor. We cannot make long speeches on reservations to \nobject. We either object or we don't. I object and then I will be happy \nto yield to the Senator. I want to be fair. Am I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Just 1 minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida for 1 minute, reserving my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator. I want to bring \nto your attention an article from the Washington Post today. I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       SEC Chairman Pitt a Potential Liability to Administration\n\n                           (By Dana Milbank)\n\n       While President Bush was delivering his long-awaited speech \n     on corporate governance Tuesday, Securities and Exchange \n     Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt was exactly where many \n     Bush aides wanted him to be: on a week-long beach vacation.\n       ``We were not surprised that the chairman was not included \n     in administration plans for public appearances,'' SEC \n     spokeswoman Christi Harlan said. ``The commission is an \n     independent agency.''\n       White House officials, though calling it a coincidence, \n     acknowledged they had no desire for Pitt's presence.\n       The arms-length treatment of Pitt underscores a dilemma for \n     Bush and his radioactive SEC chairman. Many Democrats and \n     even a few Republicans have called for Pitt's resignation \n     because of his alleged conflicts of interest and ties to the \n     accounting industry. There is no sign that Bush is even \n     thinking of dropping Pitt. But whether Pitt stays or goes, he \n     is a potential liability.\n       Dismissing Pitt would violate the Bush code of loyalty and \n     would be viewed as validating Bush's critics, from Senate \n     Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) to Bush's \n     Republican nemesis, Sen. John McCain (Ariz). ``Dropping \n     Harvey Pitt right now would be an acknowledgment of \n     wrongdoing where there's been no wrongdoing,'' said GOP \n     lobbyist Ed Gillespie, a former Bush campaign aide.\n       Forcing Pitt out would also open the White House to charges \n     of interfering in the SEC's investigation of Halliburton \n     Co.'s activities when Vice President Cheney was its chief \n     executive Underscoring that danger, Halliburton shareholders \n     yesterday filed a fraud lawsuit in Dallas against the company \n     and Cheney. White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said \n     the suit is ``without merit.'' That prompted Larry Klayman, \n     whose group, Judicial Watch, represents the shareholders, to \n     accuse the White House of seeking to influence the SEC's \n     investigation.\n       Yet Pitt's presence as the government's top securities \n     watchdog carries dangers for Bush, too. Even some Pitt \n     defenders say his close ties to the accounting industry limit \n     his credibility as a reformer. In his first speech as SEC \n     chairman last year, Pitt told an audience of auditors that \n     the SEC would be ``a kinder and gentler place for \n     accountants.''\n       ``Pitt has been in hot water since day one and WorldCom \n     turned it into a full boil,'' said GOP operative Scott Reed. \n     Because Bush will not drop Pitt, Reed said, ``McCain and the \n     Democrats have turned him into a political pinata, and that \n     will continue ad infinitium.''\n       Democrat Chris Lehane, who defended Bill Clinton and Al \n     Gore during that administration's scandals, said Bush is \n     making the wiser political choice in keeping Pitt, even \n     though Pitt could undermine faith in Bush's reforms. ``Pitt \n     could do everything right and nobody's going to give him \n     credit for it,'' he said.\n       Pitt's foes point to his past legal work for executives of \n     now-sullied corporations, including MCI, Merril Lynch & Co., \n     Arthur Andersen LLP and other accounting firms. He has also \n     been criticized for meeting in April with a former client, \n     KPMG Consulting Inc., while KPMG's audits of Xerox Corp. were \n     being investigated by the SEC. Critics also say that as a \n     lawyer, Pitt favored restricting federal oversight of \n     auditing firms. Over the years, Pitt has represented figures \n     such as Ivan Boesky and Michael Saylor in SEC actions.\n       Bush, in his Monday news conference, generously defended \n     Pitt. ``I support Harvey Pitt--Harvey Pitt has been fast to \n     act,'' Bush said. Later, Bush added: ``I'm going to give him \n     a chance to continue to perform.''\n       Privately, Bush has expressed amazement at the conflict-of-\n     interest charges. ``It's only in this town that people want \n     someone who doesn't know what they're talking about to lead \n     an agency,'' he told congressional Republicans visiting the \n     White House yesterday.\n       Pitt has an unlikely defender in Lanny J. Davis, one of \n     President Clinton's scandal handlers. ``The attack being made \n     by Democrats could be made on most anyone for having \n     conflicts from prior positions,'' he said. But Davis said the \n     administration has been making matters worse. ``The more you \n     bottle up Harvey Pitt, the more you allow Democrats to make \n     him an issue,'' Davis said.\n       Observers on both sides expect Pitt to make a public effort \n     to build his credibility by demonstrating that he can be hard \n     on his old friends. Indeed, some in the administration joke \n     that Pitt will come to resemble a model Democratic SEC \n     chairman, one heavy on regulations.\n       The White House has distributed evidence of Pitt's activity \n     on the job: requiring chief executive and chief financial \n     officers of the 947 largest companies to personally recertify \n     the accuracy of their disclosures; seeking to bar 54 officers \n     and directors; and issuing a long list of new reporting rules \n     and regulations.\n       Pitt was not Bush's first choice for the SEC job, and \n     officials say he continues to be far from Bush's inner \n     circle. The reforms Bush announced Tuesday were developed \n     largely by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and White House \n     deputy staff chief Joshua Bolten, with help from Bush \n     economic advisers Lawrence B. Lindsey and R. Glenn Hubbard.\n       But Bush is stubborn about demonstrating loyalty to his \n     aides, which enables him to claim reciprocal loyalty. \n     Officials say he continues to defend Army Secretary Thomas E. \n     White, embattled because of his Enron Corp. ties and personal \n     travel, because White has been faithful to Bush.\n       But when underlings act disloyal, Bush can quickly cut them \n     loose. Linda Chavez was dropped as Bush's nominee to be labor \n     secretary when it appeared she had misled those vetting her \n     background. Michael Parker, the civilian chief of the Army \n     Corps of Engineers, was ousted for complaining about \n     administration budget cutting.\n       Pitt so far has demonstrated fealty to Bush, and Bush aides \n     remain loyal to him. ``The best thing to do is vigorously \n     enforce the law, and that's what he's doing,'' Lindsey said.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In this article, the President of the United States has \ngiven as one of his reasons to continue his support for the Chairman of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, the \nfact that Mr. Pitt has required chief executives and chief financial \nofficers of the 947 largest companies to personally recertify the \naccuracy of their disclosures.\n  What was left out were all the American companies which have their \ncorporate headquarters outside the United States of America. \nApparently, the Chairman of the SEC believes he can discriminate and \napply a principle only against those corporations which are sited in \nthe United States and exclude corporations outside the United States.\n  That is an irrational and unfair distinction and one that we should \ncorrect as promptly as possible in this legislation.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Gladly.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, since the revelation last month of yet \nanother corporate accounting scandal--this time involving the second \nlargest telecommunications provider, WorldCom--the Bush administration \nseems to have lost its patience with corporate America. In fact, from \nthe rhetoric we have heard from the administration in recent weeks, I \nexpected to hear the President tell corporate America this week that \nhis top advisors had been in the White House basement planning, not \njust a corporate fraud task force, but a new Department of Corporate \nSecurity.\n  The President said last month at the G8 summit in Canada, ``The \nrevelations\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\nthat WorldCom has misaccounted [$3.8] billion is outrageous.''\n  In his June 29 weekly radio address, the President warned corporate \nAmerica that ``no violation of the public's trust will be tolerated. \nThe Federal Government will be vigilant in prosecuting wrongdoers to \nensure that investors and workers maintain the highest confidence in \nAmerican business.''\n  The President apparently is so miffed with these corporate \n``wrongdoers'' that he has elevated them in his rhetoric to a bad-guy \nlevel that is almost, but not quite as bad, as al-Qaeda's \n``evildoers.'' Almost the same level; perhaps not quite.\n  WorldCom president and CEO John Sidgmore, in a June 28 letter to \nPresident Bush, joined the President in expressing his outrage. ``I \nwant you to know that we, the current management team, are equally \nsurprised and outraged . . . about past accounting irregularities at \nWorldCom,'' he said.\n  So the Bush administration and the CEO of WorldCom now both agree \nthat American corporations teaming up with unscrupulous (or \nincompetent) accountants to mislead shareholders about how much money \nthe company is making is an ``outrageous'' practice.\n  Madam President, how comforting it is. As Jackie Gleason used to say: \n``How sweet it is.'' How sweet it is. How comforting it is to know that \nwe have finally reached a consensus on that issue.\n  Despite the excuses and the explanations, I find little credibility \nin the argument that certain corporate executives lacked sufficient \nknowledge to ask the right questions about their companies' accounting \npractices.\n  If CEOs are worth their generous pay, one would think they could take \nthe time to make sure that the company's chief financial officer is not \npadding earnings by omitting costs from the balance sheet.\n  In fact, one finds disconcerting the acute lack of shame--the acute \nlack of shame--S-H-A-M-E--on the part of some of these corporate \nexecutives. Former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling told the House Energy and \nCommerce Oversight Subcommittee that Enron had tight control on \nfinancial risk, but that he could not be expected to oversee everything \nand ``close out the cash drawers . . . every night.''\n  Can you imagine that kind of statement? I think it was Wordsworth who \nsaid: No matter how high you are in your department, you are \nresponsible for what the lowliest clerk is doing.\n  Let me repeat that. Wordsworth said: No matter how high you may be in \nyour department, you are responsible for what the lowliest clerk is \ndoing. That was William Wordsworth. Let's take that statement and put \nit beside the statement of former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling when he \ntold the House Energy and Commerce Oversight Subcommittee that Enron \nhad tight controls on financial risk but that he could not be expected \nto oversee everything and ``close out the cash drawers . . . every \nnight.'' Oh, that poor man. What a heavy burden he carried. That poor \nman. We can all shed crocodile tears for someone who is put into that \nvery difficult position and then consider the kinds of salaries these \npeople draw down.\n  Shakespeare said: ``The quality of mercy is not strain'd, it droppeth \nas the gentle rain . . . upon the place beneath.'' I will tell you, it \ndoes strain gentle mercy when we read about these scandals that have \nswept over this country and how these people plead the fifth amendment \nwhen they are called up before Senate committees and House committees--\nplead the fifth amendment. That is a stunningly irresponsible attitude \nfor a chief executive.\n  It is something that you might hear from the teenage manager of a \nfast food restaurant who cannot account for a handful of change missing \nfrom the cash drawer at the end of the night. You might hear that from \nthe teenage manager of a fast food restaurant who cannot account for a \nhandful of change missing from the cash drawer at the end of the night. \nBut we are not talking about a handful of change. We are talking about \nthe American public. Those eyes that are peering--they are peering at \nthis Senate floor at this very minute through the lenses of those \ncameras. They are the taxpayers out there. I see them looking through \nthose cameras. I see them in West Virginia. I see them in Texas. I see \nthem in Wyoming. I see them in New York looking through those cameras.\n  We are talking about them, the American public having lost by some \nestimates tens of billions--not millions--tens of billions of dollars \nof invested savings in companies that issued false--the Ten \nCommandments, I keep them on my walls; some of these CEOs should keep \nthem on their walls--financial reports and tens of thousands of workers \nwho have lost their jobs, and many have lost their meager earnings that \nthey, too, invested, that is what we are talking about.\n\n  So here is an individual who tells a House committee he cannot be \nexpected to oversee everything and close out the cash drawers every \nnight--such a stunning, irresponsible, arrogant attitude on the part of \na chief executive. I say again it is something that you might expect to \nhear--you might--from the teenage manager of a fast food restaurant who \ncould not account for a handful of change missing from the cash drawer \nat the end of the night.\n  We are not talking, let me say again, about a handful of change. We \nare talking about the American public, those people out there, \nRepublicans and Democrats and Independents, in the Alleghenies, along \nthe eastern coast, on the storm-beaten coast of Maine, the fishermen on \nthe mighty deep, the people in the Plains and the Rockies and beyond. \nThese are the people, north and south, the public. We are talking about \nthe American public having lost, by some estimates, tens of billions of \ndollars of invested savings in companies that issued false--and they \nknew they were issuing false--financial reports. Tens of thousands of \nworkers who have to wash the grime from their hands and their faces, \nworkers in the fields, in the mines, in the shipyards, those are the \npeople we are talking about, the public, tens of thousands of workers \nwho have lost their jobs.\n  Even after these corporations' fraudulent accounting, somebody ought \nto go to jail, and the doors should be locked and the keys thrown away. \nThrow away the keys. It really would not be too severe a punishment for \nsome of these four-flushers.\n  Even after these corporations' fraudulent accounting methods are \nexposed, the accounting games seem to continue. After telling the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission that it hid nearly $4 billion in \nexpenses last year, WorldCom submitted revised financial reports to the \nSEC which the SEC Chairman, Harvey Pitt, immediately called wholly \ninadequate and incomplete. Apparently, WorldCom's revised financial \nstatements included additional accounting errors dating back to 1999 \nand 2000. That, Chairman Pitt said, could add at least $1 billion to \nthe company's financial revision.\n  No wonder the trust of those people is broken. No wonder the public's \ntrust in corporate America has eroded. What kind of trust can the \npublic have in companies that hide information in an effort to pull the \nwool over the eyes of American investors?\n  After WorldCom's announcement, the Bush administration sharpened its \nrhetoric and is now working to assure the American public that it \nrecognizes the importance of transparency and disclosure. The Chairman \nof the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Glenn Hubbard, said in \nan interview last month that the President wants to reassure investors \nabout the economy while also delivering a shot across the bow to \nleaders of corporations that abuses of the public trust will not be \ntolerated.\n  In the midst of congressional hearings last March, after the collapse \nof Enron, the President lectured corporate America about how to regain \nthe public's trust. He said corporations must disclose relevant facts \nto the investing public and they must focus on the interests of \nshareholders, who are the real owners of any publicly held enterprise, \nto properly inform shareholders and the investing public that we must \nadopt better standards of disclosure.\n\n  That is nice rhetoric, but this administration hardly sets the model \nfor openness and transparency. In fact, this is an administration that \nprides itself on operating in secrecy and governing by surprise. \nRemember the secret government that was being set up? In fact, this is \nan administration, let\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\nme say again, that prides itself in operating in secrecy and governing \nby surprise.\n  I find it difficult to watch this administration lecture corporate \nAmerica about virtues of disclosing information to the public while at \nthe same time it is restricting the public's access to information \nabout its own executive actions.\n  Last October, Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a memo \nencouraging Federal agencies to withhold unclassified records under the \nFreedom of Information Act, the law that gives the American public the \nlegal right to certain Government information. The Attorney General \neven told the Federal agencies that the Justice Department would defend \nagency decisions to deny FOIA, Freedom of Information Act, requests.\n  Last November, the President issued an Executive order to limit \naccess to Presidential papers that, under the Presidential Records Act \nof 1978, would normally be made available to the American public. The \nExecutive order allows a former or a sitting President to block the \nrelease of records requested under the law by invoking \n``constitutionally based privileges.'' The words ``constitutionally \nbased privileges'' are in quotation marks.\n  The American people would have to go to court to challenge the \nprivilege claim. The order could even permit a former or incumbent \nPresident to impede requests for old records simply by withholding \napproval for their release, effectively negating the need for the Chief \nExecutive to even make the claim of executive privilege.\n  We have had our own little taste of this side of the coin from the \nexecutive branch as we on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens \nand I, tried to have the administration let Tom Ridge come up before \nthe committee and testify.\n  Then we see this creation of this mammoth reorganization of \nGovernment that sprang like Minerva, fully clothed and armed, from the \nforehead of Jupiter.\n  When this administration's chief executive talks about adopting \nbetter standards of disclosure, I hope that these executive actions are \nnot what he has in mind. These are just examples of the administration \ndirectly restricting the public's access to government information. The \nadministration has also moved to limit access by Members of Congress, \nwho are elected by the people and responsible for the oversight of \nexecutive actions in the public's behalf.\n  Last December, the President gave notice that he was unilaterally \nwithdrawing the United States from the Antibalistic Missile Treaty, \nallowing the administration to begin development of a new antibalistic \nmissile defense system. Soon after, the Pentagon began to exempt \nmissile defense projects from traditional reporting requirements and \nCongressional oversight, an overt attempt to keep the Congress and the \nAmerican people in the dark about the progress of that system. As the \nadministration requests additional defense funds, the Pentagon is \ntaking further steps to shield cost estimates and time tables from the \nCongress, making it harder to keep the administration accountable for \ntechnical and budgetary assessments.\n  The Dark Ages were supposed to have ended in about 1000 A.D. They \nlasted 1,000 years, the Dark Ages. Reminiscent of the Dark Ages, an \nadministration that believes in keeping a Congress in the dark, the \nAmerican people in the dark, and we are hearing a lot of sword rattling \nabout it. An attack on Iraq--the administration should level with the \nCongress. It is an equal branch. It is not a subordinate branch to the \nGovernment. It never has been, and I hope never will be. Let's hear \nmore about this plan to invade Iraq. Watch out for August when Congress \nis out of town, or before the election. Who knows?\n  This reorganization of Government sprang like Aphrodite from the \nocean foam, and she was carried on a leaf to the island of Crete. She \nlater appeared in full dress before the gods on Mount Olympus. They \nwere stunned with her beauty.\n  This is what we see. These ideas sprang from where? This idea to \nreorganize the Government--and I am concerned it will also reorganize \nthe checks and balances of the Constitution unless we are watchful--\nsprang from the bowels of the White House, the creation of four \nindividuals who are named in the public press. Not exactly the equal, \nperhaps, of that committee that wrote the Declaration of Independence--\nThomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, John Adams, and \nLivingston, those five. Not exactly.\n  But look at all the commotion that ideas has created. Look out, the \nCongress is being stampeded into putting its imprimatur on that idea. \nWell, some parts of the idea may be OK, but we should not be in too big \na hurry.\n  And that is to say nothing of the fact that these executive actions \ntoward secrecy have occurred during a period in which the President has \nrefused to allow Tom Ridge, in his capacity as the Director of Homeland \nSecurity, to testify before the Congress, and in which the Comptroller \nof the General Accounting Office was forced to sue the Vice President \nof the United States to obtain information about the White House energy \ntask force and its connections to Enron.\n  These are not the actions of an administration that believes in the \nvirtues of disclosing information to the public. This is an \nadministration that not only embraces the idea of operating in secrecy, \nbut flaunts its abilities to hide information from the Congress and the \nAmerican public.\n  Upon announcing its proposal for a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the administration bragged to the media about how the plan \nhad been pieced together by just four men and a few trusted aides in \nthe basement of the White House. As the work became more detailed and \nthe working groups expanded, the code of silence was gravely explained \nto each new arrival. At the end of each meeting, all papers were \ncollected: nothing left that room, we've been told. The work was \ncompleted before any member of the Congress was briefed on the plan. \nWhite House Chief of Staff Andrew Card even arrogantly proclaimed, ``We \nconsulted with agencies and with Congress, but they might not have \nknown we were consulting.''\n  Now, get that. I can hardly believe my eyes, except my eyes have seen \nthis prior to my having stated it on the floor. White House chief of \nstaff Andrew Card even proclaimed--I used the adverb ``arrogantly,'' I \nwill put it back in--White House chief of staff Andrew Card arrogantly \nproclaimed, ``We consulted with agencies and with Congress but they \nmight not have known we were consulting.''\n  What a reflection on Congress. What is he saying about Congress? That \nis hardly a model of transparency that I want corporate America to \nfollow.\n  We don't want to hear corporate CEOs saying we shared information \nwith the American public, but they might not have known we were sharing \nit with them. The administration's euphoria for secrecy seems motivated \nin large part by its desire to implement a political agenda. That is \nwhat it is. A political agenda, regardless of whether it has the \nsupport of the American people.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been listening to the Senator from \nWest Virginia give his speech, and I am of the opinion maybe the reason \nall that secrecy takes place is they are running the White House like \npeople run corporations. Rather than having a public institution as the \nadministration and White House should be, maybe they are running the \nWhite House like a corporation.\n  I say to my friend that the White House, this administration is \ncovered with corporate America. Maybe they think the White House is to \nbe run like a corporation.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator from Nevada introduces an \ninteresting idea. Maybe they do. Maybe anything goes. All is fair in \nlove and in war they say. Now we can add, big business. Big business.\n  That is not a fair thing to say about many big businesses really \nbecause many of the people in big business are honest and try to do the \nright thing. They are open, they are transparent. It is too bad a few \nbad apples reflect on the whole barrel. I used to sell produce. I was a \nproduce boy, married, with children coming on, and I found that a few \nbad peaches would quickly ruin the whole bushel. The same thing with \napples and other fruits and so on.\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\n  When the administration's polls suggest opposition to certain \npolicies from the American public, it limits access to information \nabout that policy. I fear that the American public, and their elected \nrepresentatives in Congress, at times are viewed by this administration \nas some sort of obstacle or hurdle that is to be avoided. There is a \ncontempt, there is an arrogancy in this administration, there is a \ncontempt for Congress. They hold Congress in contempt.\n  This kind of executive mentality can only emanate from the arrogance \nof an administration that believes the White House is the fountain of \nwisdom in Washington. Wisdom is the principal thing. Such a mentality \nis dangerous, it is absolutely dangerous. I was here in the Nixon \nadministration. I remember what happened to that administration. Such a \nmentality is dangerous. We need only look to the corporate accounting \nscandals which this administration has so harshly criticized in recent \nweeks to see why.\n  Most economic pundits seem convinced that the hyperactive stock \nmarket of the late 1990s was the catalyst for a slow, steady \ndeterioration in professional and ethical standards in corporate \nAmerica. The pressure on CEOs and companies to produce earnings, \nquarter after quarter, resulted in a kind of competitive behavior that \nencouraged companies to push the accounting envelope. Rising profits \nand stock prices provided cover for underlying ethical lapses. The \nlonger the boom lasted, the more brazen these corporations became in \ncutting corners and taking a little more off the top.\n  By the end of the boom, many companies appear to have been engaged in \nthe kind of fudging, gamesmanship and ethical corner-cutting that, \nwhile legal in some cases, was certainly less than ethical. \nUnfortunately, it was only after the stock market began its inevitable \ndecline and great piles of money were lost that people began to ask the \ncritical, penetrating questions that should have been asked earlier to \nprevent this kind of behavior in the first place. Those harder \nquestions are now leading to accounting revisions, executive \nresignations, lawsuits, and criminal investigations.\n  So far, the reflexive instinct of the business community and the Bush \nadministration largely has been to blame a ``few bad apples,'' but that \nassertion is hardly consistent with the fact that the SEC opened 64 \nfinancial-reporting cases between January and March of this year, and \nthat almost a thousand companies, not just a handful, have been asked \nto recertify to the SEC their financial statements through the last \nfiscal year.\n  It is somewhat ironic that the actions of chief executives were \nprotected by soaring stock prices, since the administration finds \nitself in a similar position. Just like soaring stock, as long as the \nPresident's approval ratings remain high, presumably propped up by the \nAmerican public's understandable desire to support the war on \nterrorism, the more latitude the administration will be granted in \nrestricting information about its executive actions under the guise of \nnational security. This kind of culture can be extremely dangerous. It \nwas allowed to flourish in corporate America during the late 1990s, and \nnow threatens the public trust.\n  The administration would do well to take some of its own medicine and \nmake itself more transparent to the American public. For all of its \nexpressed concerns about the public's loss of confidence in corporate \nAmerica, this administration seems to have given little, if any, \nconsideration to the loss of the public's trust in government. That is \nthe most basic of commodities in republican government. I do not refer \nto it, as many politicians who ought to know better glibly refer to \nthis, our system, as a democracy. They ought to go back and read \nMadison's 10th and 14th essays in the Federalist Papers. They will \nfinally learn the difference--or be reminded of the difference. They \nprobably have forgotten the difference between a democracy and a \nrepublic.\n\n  The public's trust in government--when the public loses its trust, \nwhen the public's trust is eroded, all is lost: The public trust. And \nsooner or later, high poll numbers will tumble, as they always do. We \nhave seen them do it before.\n  Don't read the polls, I say to my colleagues, so assiduously, read \nthe Constitution--which I hold in my hand. Read the Constitution. I say \nto the administration, I say to the executive branch, read the \nConstitution. Don't be so enamored with the polls. They are fleeting. \nRead the Constitution.\n  This administration's Chief Executive came into office touting \nhimself as the first President to earn a master's degree in business \nadministration. That is certainly more than I have. He announced that \nhe would run the White House like a modern-day corporation. Ha-ha-ha; \nwatch out.\n  To be fair, the President probably didn't realize at the time that he \nwould be faced with the exposure of a corporate culture--not all his. \nThe President probably didn't realize at the time that he would be \nfaced with the exposure of a corporate culture which encouraged shoddy \nauditing, negligent or criminal management, and impudent and secretive \ncorporate CEOs.\n  In hiding its own actions from the public view, this administration \nis fostering the same kind of arrogant, arrogant culture in which these \ncorporate accounting scandals were allowed to flourish. This \nadministration would do well to take preventive measures to keep the \nnasty, nasty little seeds of arrogance and secrecy that have affected \ncorporate America from taking root in the executive branch and \nthreatening the public's trust.\n  I close with a Biblical parable: Pride goeth before destruction, and \nthe haughty spirit before a fall.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \ntoday's Washington Post titled ``Bush Took Oil Firm's Loans as \nDirector''; and an article from today's Washington Times titled \n``Cheney named in fraud suit.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 11, 2002]\n\n                 Bush Took Oil Firm's Loans as Director\n\n                            (By Mike Allen)\n\n       As a Texas businessman, President Bush took two low-\n     interest loans from an oil company where he was a member of \n     the board of directors, engaging in a practice he condemned \n     this week in his plan to stem corporate abuse and accounting \n     fraud.\n       Bush accepted loans totaling $180,375 from Harken Energy \n     Corp. in 1986 and 1988, according to Securities and Exchange \n     Commission filings. Bush was a director of Harken from 1986 \n     to 1993, after he sold his failed oil and gas exploration \n     concern to the company. He used the loans to buy Harken \n     stock.\n       Corporate loans to officers came under scrutiny after \n     WorldCom Inc., the long-distance carrier that last month \n     reported huge accounting irregularities, revealed it had lent \n     nearly $400 million to Bernard J. Ebbers to buy the company's \n     stock when he was chief executive. He resigned in April as \n     the stock price tumbled.\n       Bush attacked corporate loans during his speech on Wall \n     Street on Tuesday, when he offered proposals to tighten the \n     accountability of corporate executives while stopping short \n     of the tougher measures headed toward passage in the Senate. \n     ``I challenge compensation committees to put an end to all \n     company loans to corporate officers,'' he said.\n       A senior administration official, briefing reporters on \n     Bush's plan, said Tuesday that Bush wants public companies to \n     ban loans to their officers, including directors. ``Corporate \n     officers should not be able to treat a public company like \n     their own personal bank,'' the official said.\n       The contrast between Bush's record as a business executive \n     and his rhetoric in the face of corporate scandals \n     underscores the challenge his administration faces in trying \n     to credibly foster what he calls ``a new era of integrity in \n     corporate America.''\n       Bush was investigated by the SEC in 1991 for possible \n     illegal insider trading, although the SEC did not take action \n     against him, and he has admitted making several late \n     disclosures to the agency, which regulates public companies.\n       Harken's loans to Bush--at 5 percent interest, below the \n     prime rate--were reported several times in filings to the SEC \n     in the years before the debt was retired in 1993 and were \n     noted in news accounts at the time. The loans were for the \n     purchase of Harken stock, which was then held as collateral.\n       Rajesh K. Aggarwal, a Dartmouth College professor who \n     specializes in executive compensation and incentives, said \n     such loans ``are not unique, but are by no means \n     widespread.''\n       White House communications director Dan Bartlett said \n     Harken offered the loans to directors to buy shares in the \n     company as part of an incentive for board members ``to have a \n     long-term commitment with the company.'' Bartlett said the \n     loans to Bush were ``totally appropriate--there was no \n     wrongdoing there.''\n\n[[Page S6609]]\n\n       ``This is a common practice in small, medium and large \n     companies,'' Bartlett said. ``These recent abuses of certain \n     types of loans led the president to believe that the \n     government should draw a bright line concerning loans going \n     forward. This is one of the main things that undermined the \n     confidence of investors and shareholders.''\n       Bartlett said the loans were for $96,000 in 1986, for \n     80,000 shares, and $84,375 in 1988, for 25,000 shares. He \n     said that in 1993, Harken changed its compensation policies \n     and discontinued the loan program. He said Harken converted \n     to a program giving directors stock options, allowing them to \n     buy stock later at a fixed price.\n       Bartlett, asserting that Bush did not profit on the loans, \n     said Bush traded the 105,000 shares being held as collateral \n     for the loans, retiring his debt. Bush then received 42,503 \n     options under the new compensation plan, Bartlett said, The \n     options were never exercised and expired after Bush left the \n     board, Bartlett said.\n       With adminsitration officials privately expressing concern \n     about the impact of so much fresh attention to old questions \n     about Bush's career, the White House yesterday distributed \n     talking points headlined ``If you get asked about Harken'' to \n     Bush loyalists who might be contacted by reporters. Bartlett \n     said the fact sheets were sent to members of Congress after \n     they asked for them.\n       White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said aides to \n     Bush have ``talked to the private accountants and private \n     counsels who are involved in the president's private \n     transactions'' while preparing answers to reporters' question \n     during the growing debate over corporate responsibility.\n       Vice President Cheney also is receiving unwanted attention \n     to his corporate past. The SEC is investigating an accounting \n     practice begun by Halliburton Co., the Dallas-based energy \n     services company, when Cheney was chief executive before \n     joining Bush's campaign ticket.\n       Also yesterday, the White House refused to release records \n     of Bush's service on Harken's board. Bush had pointed to \n     those records during a news conference on Monday when asked \n     about his role in the sale of a subsidiary. The transaction \n     later was used by Harken to mask losses.\n       ``You need to look back on the director's minutes,'' Bush \n     said.\n       Bartlett said the administration does not have the minutes \n     and does not plan to ask Harken for them. ``He personally \n     would not have access to them,'' Bartlett said. ``These are \n     company documents. I can't release something I don't have.''\n       Harken has declined to release board records ever since \n     questions about Bush's record on the board were raised during \n     his first campaign for Texas governor, in 1994.\n       Bartlett also said the White House would not accept a \n     challenge by Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-\n     S.D.) on Sunday to ask the SEC to make public the records of \n     its investigation into whether Bush had engaged in illegal \n     insider trading of Harken stock.\n       Daschle said on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' that Bush would \n     do well to ask the SEC to release the file. ``We've had \n     different explanations as to what actually occurred,'' \n     Daschle said. ``I think that would clarify the matter a good \n     deal.''\n       Bartlett said Bush will not do that. ``Those are documents \n     in the possession of an independent regulatory agency,'' \n     Bartlett said. ``I'm not in a position to call on them to do \n     that. We've made available every relevant document we have in \n     our possession.''\n       Administration officials said they would take the same \n     position about an SEC investigation that resulted in Harken's \n     restating its earnings to show a $12.6 million loss for a \n     quarter instead of an earlier reported loss of $3.3 million. \n     Bush was a member of the board's audit committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 11, 2002]\n\n                       Cheney Named in Fraud Suit\n\n                           (By Patrice Hill)\n\n       Vice President Richard B. Cheney was named yesterday with \n     the energy company he headed in a lawsuit by investors that \n     cited bookkeeping practices under investigation by the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission.\n       The lawsuit arranged by Judicial Watch, a government \n     watchdog group, charges that Halliburton Inc. overstated its \n     revenue by $534 million between 1998 and the end of last year \n     by illegally booking revenue from oil construction projects \n     that were in dispute and had not been collected from its \n     clients. The suit says the accounting fraud resulted in \n     overvaluation of Halliburton's stock, deciving investors.\n       Mr. Cheney was Halliburton's chief executive from 1995 \n     until August 2000, after he joined the Bush presidential \n     campaign. The White House and Halliburton yesterday said the \n     suit was without merit but both acknowledged that the SEC \n     investigation is continuing.\n       ``We are working dilgently with the SEC to resolve its \n     questions regarding the company's accounting practices,'' \n     said Doug Foshee, Halliburton's chief financial officer. The \n     claims in this lawsuit are untrue, unsupported and \n     unfounded.''\n       SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt has vowed to pursue the \n     investigation. ``We don't give anyone a pass,'' he told ABC's \n     ``This Week'' on June 30. ``If anybody violates the law, \n     we go after them.''\n       President Bush on Tuesday called for stronger SEC \n     enforcement and longer prison terms for corporate executives \n     found guilty of the kind of accounting fraud charged in the \n     lawsuit. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court in \n     Dallas, where Halliburton is based.\n       A unified Senate approved harsh new penalties yesterday for \n     corporate fraud and document shredding, adding enforcement \n     teeth to Mr. Bush's plan to curb accounting scandals. In a \n     series of unanimous votes, senators added the penalties to an \n     accounting oversight bill moving toward passage.\n       Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit is the Arthur \n     Andersen firm, Halliburton's former auditor, which was fired \n     in April after the accounting firm was charged with \n     obstructing an SEC investigation of Enron Corp. Andersen was \n     convicted of the obstruction charge last month and is no \n     longer permitted to audit public companies.\n       The suit says Andersen was a champion of ``aggressive'' \n     accounting tactics and masterminded the bookkeeping maneuvers \n     that defrauded Halliburton investors.\n       As evidence of Mr. Cheney's knowledge and approval of these \n     maneuvers, the suit refers to his appearance in a promotional \n     video for Andersen in which he said he got ``good advice'' \n     from the firm, advice that went ``over and above just the \n     normal by-the-books auditing arrangements.''\n       The lawsuit cites a critical accounting change made by \n     Halliburton and Andersen in late 1998. Halliburton was facing \n     losses because of a recession in the oil industry and cost \n     overruns on construction contracts in which the company had \n     negotiated fixed, or lump-sum, payment plans.\n       Before the accounting change, which was never formally \n     disclosed to investors, Halliburton had booked the cost \n     overruns as losses on such projects as long as they were in \n     dispute and customers had not agreed to pay them.\n       But starting in 1998, the company booked payment for the \n     cost overruns as revenue if it believed the disputes would be \n     resolved and the customers would pay the bills.\n       As a result of this change, Halliburton showed a profit for \n     several quarters in 1998 and 1999 when it otherwise would \n     have posted losses, the suit charges. In some years, the \n     disputed revenue appears to account for as much as half of \n     the company's reported profits.\n       ``Halliburton overstated profits that many American \n     citizens relied upon,'' said Larry Klayman, chairman of \n     Judicial Watch. ``That's fraudulent security practices, and \n     it resulted in those Americans suffering huge losses.''\n       The suit says Halliburton and Andersen violated securities \n     laws when they did not disclose and justify the accounting \n     change in a letter to investors. Halliburton's financial \n     statements starting in 1998 do note, however, that it was \n     booking uncollected revenue from cost overruns.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator was allocated 45 minutes. Of course, we have \nother time. We have an extra 15 minutes. It is my understanding there \nare 4 or 5 minutes left. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator so desires, we could also allocate 15 \nminutes to the Senator from West Virginia if he has more to say.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished majority whip \nfor his courtesies and generosity, and for his characteristic ways of \nhelping his colleagues. I think I will let my remarks remain today as \nthey are. I thank him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while there are a couple of minutes \nremaining of the Senator's time, I am sure the chairman of the \ncommittee joins with me in expressing our pleasure at being able to \nlisten to such a profound statement which the Senator made. I think it \nagain is what this is all about. By ``this,'' I am talking about the \nlegislation.\n  I talked with a friend of mine. We played football together as young \nmen. He runs a company in Las Vegas. He said: Harry, I took all of my \nmoney out of the stock market. I will never invest in the stock market \nuntil something is done. He said: I am afraid. I said: We all feel that \nway.\n  I think the Senator really condensed what is going on in corporate \nAmerica. It needs to be changed, and hopefully this legislation will \nhelp that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, let me express my gratitude to the \ndistinguished Senator for his comments.\n  And with respect to the manager of this legislation, let me state \nwithout any equivocation that this is one of the finest minds I have \nseen in the Senate. I have been here 44 years. I have seen the \nequivalent of the entire Senate come and go, and I have never seen a \nsharper intellect. I have seen some\n\n[[Page S6610]]\n\nsharp ones--John Pastore, Herman Talmadge, and there are others. I have \nnever seen any sharper than that of Paul Sarbanes, in my judgment. I \ndon't know a great deal about the intelligence quotients. I don't know \nwhat the high range is. I assume it could be 150, or 155, or 160--\nwhatever it is. Paul Sarbanes is the brightest.\n  Also, he has a way about him of not flaunting his intellect in front \nof others. Most of us--not because of that kind of intellect--have been \ninclined to speak more often--maybe too much, and perhaps I do already, \nbut not because of that kind of intellect. But I salute the manager and \ncommend that kind of intellect. He applies it. I watch him in the \ncommittees, and I watch him on the floor as he manages a bill. He is \nnever a man to act in haste, or to be too rhetoric in haste. I admire \nhis patience. He is plotting; he is studying; he is working; and he is \nextremely effective.\n  When I was majority leader, there were certain Senators I would call \ninto my office from time to time. I would try to pick their brains as \nto what we should do on this or that. Scoop Jackson was one. Paul \nSarbanes is always there.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. What the Senator is saying is that the Rhodes Scholar \nCommittee a number of years ago made a good choice in selecting Paul \nSarbanes to be a Rhodes scholar. Is that what the Senator is saying?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I am saying exactly that. I am happy the distinguished \nSenator put it that way.\n  This bill before the Senate is the product of that kind of mind, that \nkind of attention, and that kind of dedication.\n  I hope we can pass this bill with an overwhelming vote, and, also in \nconference so that when put on the President's desk he can sign it. I \nam eager to support it in any way I can.\n  Before I yield the floor, let me say that when we talk about \nintellect and sharp intellects, this man from Texas, Phil Gramm, is \nanother. He is sharp. I have talked to my staff many times about that \nkind of intellect. He can talk about anything. He doesn't need a \nscript. I have prided myself on working with him on several challenges, \nand I have found him to be fair and straightforward.\n  I admire people--like these two--having that kind of sharp intellect.\n  I was told by an old Baptist pastor, former chief chaplain in the \nArmy during the war--I don't remember which war it was. But he always \nsaid: The mark of brilliance is to surround yourself with brilliant \npeople.\n  I am really proud to look around this Chamber and see people such as \nPaul Sarbanes and Phil Gramm. Sometimes I say that North Dakota has the \nhighest overall quotient, perhaps of all, with its two Senators--\nSenators Conrad and Dorgan. I don't know whether they are Rhodes \nscholars or not. I am not a Rhodes scholar. I was not fortunate enough. \nI just barely made it by working at night for 10 years just to get a \nlaw degree. But these people make me proud to serve in this body.\n  Let me yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nhis extraordinarily generous remarks. I am very appreciative of them.\n  I want to echo what the very able Senator from Nevada said about the \nSenator's eloquent address just a few minutes ago, which is reflective \nof the pattern that he has established--which is to go on the floor of \nthe Senate and go to the very fundamentals of what our system is all \nabout. His constant reference to the Constitution draws us back to \nthose fundamentals. The Senator has always put before the Senate this \nbroader and deeper vision of why we are here, what we ought to be \ndoing, and calling us back to our basic principles as a nation--right \nback to the Founding Fathers--as the Senator pointed out in his talk \ntoday. Important aspects of that are being challenged today in a very \nserious way.\n  I echo what my colleague said and express my appreciation to the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I am \ngoing to yield the floor.\n  Before I yield it, I apologize to the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. McConnell. He is a Republican and I am a Democrat.\n  I have been known to go down into Kentucky at his invitation and \nspeak, and I value his friendship. I apologize to him for imposing on \nhis time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Before the Senator yields, if he would yield very briefly \nto me, I thank him for his very sweet comments. I am very happy to be \nnamed along with Paul Sarbanes. And someday when I am talking to my \ngrandchildren about the fact that their grandpa actually was a pretty \nimportant guy in his day--though his mind, I am sure, at that point \nwill have seemed to have largely slipped away--I will say: I got to \nserve with the great Robert C. Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4200\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky will now be \nrecognized for up to 45 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise to speak on behalf of the McConnell amendment which will be \nvoted on sometime in the not too distant future. It is my understanding \nthat my own colleague, Senator Enzi, may make a motion to table at the \nend of the debate. So let me, at the outset, say I support the Edwards-\nEnzi amendment.\n  The second-degree amendment that is pending at the desk, which I will \nshortly discuss, does not, in any way, change or diminish the Edwards-\nEnzi amendment. I think it is a good idea. However, I think it simply \ndoes not go far enough.\n  I also supported the Leahy amendment yesterday after my amendment to \ncombat union fraud was defeated. I will continue to support responsible \ncorporate accountability measures in this bill.\n  My only point is, corporations do not have a monopoly on misconduct, \ndeception, and fraud. As long as we are addressing professional \nmisconduct, deception, and fraud, we ought to recognize this is a \nproblem in our entire professional culture, not just in corporate \nculture. Let me repeat that. This is a problem in our entire \nprofessional culture, not just in corporate culture.\n  I understand the mood at the moment is to beat up on corporations. \nAnd they deserve it. That is what the underlying bill is about. On the \nother hand, to ignore other areas of abuse, it seems to me, is to miss \nan opportunity to address the problem in a broader way.\n  The Senator from North Carolina raises real problems with the ethics \nand conduct of corporate lawyers. I commend him for that. And I commend \nthe Senator from Wyoming for that. But I have long sought to curb \nsimilar and well-documented abuses in the general practice of law, \nspecifically in the case of personal injury law.\n  Let me say at this point that the McConnell amendment applies only to \nFederal claims and Federal courts. We are talking here about Federal \nclaims and Federal courts. My point in offering this amendment is not \nto obstruct but to extend and enhance our debate on professional \nconduct.\n  We ought to set standards for corporate attorneys. I favor that. And \nwe ought to set standards for personal injury lawyers as well. \nCorporations and corporate attorneys do not have a monopoly on \nmisconduct. We are doing a real disservice to the American public if, \nduring this important debate on professional misconduct, we turn a \nblind eye to abuses in our society that have been piling up way \nbefore--long before--Enron, WorldCom, and Global Crossing.\n  All too often we hear stories about lawyers who take advantage of \ntheir clients by not informing them of the legal fees and costs those \nclients will incur. This sad practice results in consumers of legal \nservices receiving next to nothing in personal injury and other claims.\n  Let me recount the story of Diana Saxon. Ms. Saxon was a victim of, \namong other things, attempted forcible rape. The defendant was \nconvicted, and Ms. Saxon brought a personal injury action against that \ndefendant. The attorney she hired said the fee he was going to charge \nwas 40 percent, plus costs.\n  Ms. Saxon received an award of $25,000. Of that, per her agreement,\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\n$8,300 went to her lawyer in attorney's fees. But an additional $20,716 \nwent to her lawyer for expenses. However, none of those costs was made \nknown to Ms. Saxon during the course of the litigation. She was only \ninformed of them after her case was concluded.\n\n  Now, it gets even better--or, for Ms. Saxon's unfortunate situation, \nit gets worse. After her lawyer charged her his costs, she ended up \nowing her attorney $4,000--$4,000. That is right. For poor Ms. Saxon, \nshe was actually left over $4,000 in the hole, in debt.\n  Now, to be fair, Ms. Saxon's lawyer was actually magnanimous in that \nhe waived a few costs and a small portion of his fee so that she was \nactually able to walk away with the princely sum of $833--$833.\n  In his letter to her, where he agreed to offer her these few hundred \ndollars from her award of $25,000, he wrote:\n\n       I'm agreeable to pay the sum of $833. This is the only \n     money you will receive from your $25,000 settlement.\n\n  So, in sum, even though Ms. Saxon's lawyer told her that the lawyer \nwould get 40 percent of her award, plus costs, in reality, after \nincluding these costs, he got 96 percent--96 percent--of her award. \nThat is right, 96 cents on every dollar that Ms. Saxon received.\n  We need to make sure that consumers of legal services are not duped \nby this type of inaccurate and incomplete information.\n  Let me quote Ms. Saxon. She has put the problem better than I could. \nHere is what she had to say:\n\n       This is not how our civil justice system is supposed to \n     work. What happened to me should never happen to anyone \n     again. You have a chance today to make a difference by \n     passing a law to protect people from the kind of thing my \n     attorney did to me. Had I known in advance or at some point \n     along the way how little of my lawsuit was going to benefit \n     anyone but my lawyer, I might have thought different about \n     enduring 2 years of emotional trauma during the litigation.\n\n  Summing up what she had to say: Had she had any idea how little of \nthe money she might get, she might not have wanted to endure the trauma \nof this litigation for 2 long years.\n  Now, Ms. Saxon, in a sense, was lucky in that at least her lawyer \ntold her she would be liable for costs, although he obviously did not \ntell her the magnitude of the costs she was looking at and, thereby, \ncompletely misled her.\n  But as these excerpts from the Yellow Pages here in the District of \nColumbia area phonebook indicate, some lawyers are not even that \ncandid.\n  So let's take a look at the first chart out of the DC phonebook. On \nthis first chart, we have an ad with the big banner entitled \n``AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS.'' There is a line almost as big--the fourth \nline down--proclaiming: ``No Recovery, No Legal Fees''--``No Recovery, \nNo Legal Fees.'' It does not say anything about the cost the plaintiff \nis going to have to bear and, therefore, does not paint an accurate \npicture.\n  Let's take a look at the second chart, again out of the DC phonebook. \nIt has a big banner down the right side entitled ``PERSONAL INJURY.'' \nAt the top is says: ``Personal Injury Lawyers Who Put You First.'' \n``The Firm Boasts an All-Star Roster of Top Personal Injury \n[Lawyers].'' And it makes the point: ``No fee if no recovery.'' But, \nagain, like the last ad, it does not mention at all anywhere in the \nad--nowhere in all of this ad--that the client will be liable for \ncosts.\n  Let's take a look at chart No. 3. This ad is marginally--marginally--\nbetter. At the top of the ad there is a headline, in bold, saying: \n``Legal Problems Require a Lawyer.'' Obviously, legal problems require \na lawyer. About midway down is a line item saying: ``Call Me. I can \nhelp.'' ``Call me. I can help.'' And right below this line, another \nline says: ``No Legal Fee If No Recovery.'' In a little bit smaller \nprint you will notice, ``No Legal Fee If No Recovery.'' But this \nlawyer, at least, to his credit, has an asterisk by this line. If you \nlook very carefully, you see an asterisk; and way down here at the \nbottom of the ad, in minuscule print--which might require you getting \nyour glasses adjusted or to get a magnifying glass--it says: ``Cost May \nBe Additional.''\n  This lawyer at least gets credit in his ad for mentioning that there \nmight be some cost, although you better have your glasses adjusted in \norder to find it.\n  Chart No. 4 is a familiar pitch, that there be ``no legal fees unless \nrecovery.'' This lawyer, to his credit, at least has it in print large \nenough to where you might actually see that line. But there is, of \ncourse, an asterisk; down here at the bottom, again, in tiny, minuscule \nprint, ``Clients may be responsible for reasonable fees.''\n  This lawyer, at least, gets some credit--be the print ever so small--\nfor pointing out that there could be a cost involved, and maybe a \ncareful client would see that in the ad.\n  Chart No. 5, really my favorite one, it has a big banner at the top, \n``accidents,'' all the way across the top. You wouldn't have any \ntrouble missing that. Underneath, ``No legal fee if no recovery.'' Very \nenticing observation to an injured client, potential client, and there \nis an asterisk after it.\n  Going to the bottom of the page, below the Visa and MasterCard logos, \nit says, ``excluding costs.'' That is about the smallest print on the \nad. But a careful potential client might be able to find that there \ncould conceivably be a cost attached to this.\n  Frankly, I am not sure if this phrase means that costs are excluded \nand, therefore, you don't have to pay for these either, or if it means \nthat costs are excluded from the exclusion, which means you do have to \npay for them. A consumer of legal services should not be enticed by the \nprospect of free legal services, including what appears to be an \nexclusion of cost from the charges for which he is responsible.\n  As I will shortly describe, the amendment I am offering would help \nprevent people from being duped by incomplete and misleading \nrepresentations such as these. Let me repeat that the scope of my \namendment is not every court in America but only applies to Federal \nclaims and Federal courts.\n  Shifting gears for a moment, we also hear stories of ambulance \nchasers who take advantage of grieving families when they are most \nvulnerable. For example, at the scene of a 1993 collision between two \ncommuter trains in Gary, IN, witnesses reported seeing lawyers' \nbusiness cards being passed around at the scene of the accident. And \nthe injured were being videotaped as they were removed on stretchers.\n  After an August 1987 crash of a commercial airline flight in Detroit, \na man posing as a Roman Catholic priest, Father John Irish, appeared at \nthe scene to console families of the victims. He hugged crying mothers \nand talked with grieving fathers of God's rewards in the hereafter. \nThen he would hand them the business card of a Florida attorney, urging \nthem to call the lawyer, and then the father would disappear.\n  We should make sure that misleading ads and shameless ambulance \nchasing do not occur. I propose a clients' bill of rights for consumers \nof legal services. We have talked a lot in recent years about a \nPatients' Bill of Rights to make sure patients are treated properly by \nhealth maintenance organizations. We need a clients' bill of rights to \nmake sure consumers of legal services are treated fairly.\n  This clients' bill of rights would do two things. The first thing it \nwould do is require consumers of legal services to receive basic \ninformation at the beginning, during the course, and at the end of the \ncase so that all along the way the client, the consumer of legal \nservices, has a clear understanding of what the financial relationship \nis between the lawyer and the client.\n  As the old saying goes: Knowledge is power. My amendment empowers \nconsumers by giving them the knowledge they need to make informed \ndecisions about their legal representation. As I pointed out earlier in \none of my examples, there was a lady who had no earthly idea, because \nof not receiving proper information about the extent of the cost that \ncould be involved in her case, that after getting a $25,000 settlement \nshe would essentially get nothing. The lawyer then benevolently gave \nher $833.\n  So clients need information all along the way to make informed \ndecisions about legal representation.\n  At the initial meeting before they are retained, under the McConnell \namendment, attorneys would have to provide would-be clients with the \nfollowing things--and this is not unreasonable; it's elementary \njustice--No. 1, the estimated number of hours that will be spent on the \ncase; No. 2, the hourly fee or the contingent fee that will be charged; \nNo. 3, very importantly, the probability of a successful\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\noutcome; next, the estimated recovery reasonably expected; next, the \nestimated cost or expenses the plaintiffs will bear; and whether a \nclient will be subject to fee arrangements with other lawyers.\n  This is elementary consumer protection. Let me say to my friends in \nthe Senate who are close to and allied with the plaintiffs' lawyers in \nAmerica: We are not talking about capping anybody's fees. This is not \nabout capping fees. The fee arrangement could still be whatever \nastronomical amount the lawyer believes he can charge. But we are \ntalking about providing basic information to the client so the client \ncan understand what the fee arrangement is going to be. There are no \nfee caps in this amendment.\n  Monthly statements: My amendment would also require lawyers to \nprovide their clients with monthly statements so that consumers of \nlegal services will be informed on a regular basis of the basic \nprogress of their case. Specifically, the lawyers would have to tell \nclients how much time they are expending on their case, what they are \nspending their time doing, and what expenses they are incurring in the \ncase. Again, this is basic information clients should receive so they \nknow how their case is progressing and how in essence their money is \nbeing spent.\n  Then an accounting at the end of the case: Clients should receive \nbasic information at the end of the case so they know exactly what they \npaid for during their representation. To this end, my amendment \nprovides that within 30 days after the end of the case, attorneys shall \nprovide clients with the number of hours expended; the amount of \nexpenses to be charged; the total hourly fee or the total contingency \nfee in a contingency fee case; the effective hourly fee charged, which \nwould be determined by dividing the total contingency fee by the total \nnumber of hours expended.\n  Again, this is elementary, reasonable information, no fee caps, just \nproviding reasonable information to the client at the end of the case \nso they can understand just what the legal services have provided.\n  Madam President, in the age of disclosure, I cannot believe that my \ncolleagues would not support some basic disclosures that the first part \nof my amendment would provide. It does not limit--I say again--\nattorney's fees in any regard. There are no fee caps of any sort in \nthis amendment. Frankly, I would like to see that. We have had fee caps \nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act for years, and I am told there is no \ndearth of lawyers prepared to bring tort claims against the United \nStates. But there are not any fee caps in this legislation. That is \nsomething a large number of Members of the Senate do not support. The \nfirst part of my amendment simply enables consumers of legal services \nto make informed choices.\n  The second thing my amendment does is establish a bereavement rule. A \nbereavement rule means the provision for a period of mourning, or a \nperiod of bereavement, during which lawyers would have to be respectful \nof injured victims or their families. As I mentioned, this provision is \nimportant because there are disturbing stories of ambulance-chasing \nlawyers who prey upon victims and their families when these people are \nthe most vulnerable.\n  To address this problem, my amendment simply provides that there will \nbe no unsolicited communication by lawyers to victims, or to their \nfamilies, regarding an action for personal injury, or wrongful death, \nfor 45 days from the date of death or personal injury--just 45 days to \ngive the victims, or their families, an opportunity to begin to get \ntheir feet back under them before they start considering which lawyer, \nif any, they want to retain to pursue the legal action to which they \nmay be entitled.\n  Let me repeat. This amendment applies only to unsolicited \ncommunications. If the victims or their families are feeling like it 2 \ndays after the event, they are certainly free to call whomever they \nchoose. This only applies to unsolicited communications to victims or \ntheir families. Injured parties and their families are free to contact \nwhomever they want whenever they want.\n  Madam President, there is precedent for this respectful, considerate \nprinciple in existing Federal law. In 1996, we passed legislation that \nprohibited lawyers from engaging in unsolicited communications for 30 \ndays following an airline disaster. Let me say it again. There is \nprecedent for a bereavement rule already in Federal law. In 1996, we \npassed legislation that prohibited lawyers from engaging in unsolicited \ncommunications for 30 days following an airline disaster. Just 2 years \nago, in 2000, we extended this prohibition to 45 days from the date of \nan airline crash. That prohibition is codified at 49 U.S.C. section \n1136(g)(2).\n  The point I am making here is that there is precedent in Federal law \nalready for a bereavement rule, and this simply expands upon that \npreference and provides this protection for additional victims during a \nperiod of mourning.\n  Madam President, someone who has been killed or injured in a train \ncrash or a shipping accident is just as dead, or just as injured, as \nsomeone who is killed or injured in an airline crash. These victims and \ntheir families deserve the same type of respect and consideration. All \nthese types of victims and their families are in a vulnerable state \nwhere it is easy for them to be pressured or taken advantage of.\n  The second part of my amendment would afford victims of other \ntragedies the same protection that we afford victims of airline \ndisasters. The language in my amendment that we used to do so is \nvirtually identical to current Federal law. It would guarantee these \npeople a reasonable period of time to grieve, collect their thoughts, \nand to think clearly about what action they want to take and who they \nwant to take such action on their behalf.\n\n  As I said, there is current precedent for it in Federal law, and I \nhope my colleagues will support it, along with the disclosure \nprovisions in my amendment.\n  Madam President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me sum up what the McConnell \namendment is. There are essentially two parts to it. First, it would \nrequire that lawyers provide to their clients all along the way, from \ninitially being retained until the conclusion of the case, adequate \nconsumer protection information so the clients will have a sense at \nevery stage of the case how the case is moving along, what the \nlikelihood of success is and, very importantly, what kind of costs the \nclient may be incurring in the course of the litigation.\n  Secondly, we provide for a bereavement rule of 45 days to give the \nvictims and their families an opportunity to get back on their feet \nduring an atmosphere in which unsolicited efforts to retain these \nvictims are put off. If, however, the family at any point during that \n45-day period decides it is ready to move on and wants to look at its \nlegal options, there is nothing in the amendment that would prevent the \nvictim or victim's families from retaining a lawyer at any time. All \nthis does is protect them from unwanted solicitations for a brief \nperiod of 45 days following the occurrence of the event.\n  As I pointed out, there is already precedent in Federal law for such \na bereavement period of 45 days. That applies in the wake of airline \ndisasters.\n  Finally, let me repeat this because I know this is something that is \noffensive to many Members of the Senate, particularly on the other side \nof the aisle. As much as I would like to see fee caps established, this \namendment has no fee caps in it. Even though, under the Federal Tort \nClaims Act, since the late 1940s, we have had a fee cap of 25 percent \nin tort actions against the Federal Government, no such fee cap is in \nthis amendment.\n  So I think this is a modest proposal to provide consumer protection \nto victims of accidents as they contemplate their futures and \ndetermine, first, which lawyer to hire, and after hiring the lawyer, \nhave adequate information along the way to make sure they understand \nwhat the fee arrangement is.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time and now urge--\nand I will also do so later--the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, can I inquire as to what the \nallocation of time is? Let me make a parliamentary inquiry. I \nunderstand the vote on a motion to table that will be offered by \nSenator Enzi is scheduled to take place at 12:45.\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Can the Chair inform us as to the allocation of time \nfrom now until quarter to 1?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement provided that \nthe time between the conclusion of Senator McConnell's remarks and the \n12:45 p.m. vote will be evenly divided between Senators Gramm and \nSarbanes, and Senator McConnell has a remaining amount of time of 16 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Sixteen minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, is it the Senator's thought we move \nup the vote?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Staff has made an announcement, and people have planned \naccordingly. I understand that is the situation on both sides of the \naisle for that matter. It was announced earlier on. People, therefore, \nmade plans accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If Senator McConnell used all of his remaining \ntime, each side would have approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Maryland, I will be happy to \nhear from the other side on the amendment. I am reluctant to yield back \nmy time until I know the extent of the debate in which we are going to \nengage. In any event, the vote, Madam President, occurs at quarter to \n1?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I retain the remainder of my time until such time we \ndecide otherwise. I have not heard from the other side.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand the agreement, I do not think others \ncan use time until the Senator from Kentucky uses his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest we divide the remainder of the time between \nnow and the vote. Will that be acceptable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time between \nnow and quarter of 1 be divided equally to the manager of the bill, to \nSenator Enzi, and to Senator McConnell. That will give us about 10 \nminutes each, I think.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I will speak briefly to the McConnell \namendment which has been added as a second-degree amendment to the \nEdwards-Enzi amendment. Before I address that amendment itself, let me \nagain indicate my very strong support for the underlying first-degree \namendment, the Edwards-Enzi amendment, which was very carefully worked \nout and I believe represents a constructive suggestion. I am hopeful we \ncan get to that amendment and have a vote on it sometime in the near \nfuture.\n  Obviously, the way things are now structured, we have to dispose of \nthe McConnell second-degree amendment in order to get to the Edwards-\nEnzi amendment, but I think the Edwards-Enzi amendment warrants both \nthe attention and the support of this body. I hope at some point we \nwill be able to do that.\n  I am not going to address the substance of the McConnell amendment, \nor perhaps I will discuss it only in passing. I simply wish to observe \nthat it is not relevant to this bill. It is talking about a client's \nbill of rights which may or may not be a worthy subject to examine.\n  How we regulate the lawyers is a complicated problem, obviously. It \nhas mostly been done at the State level. The Senator from Kentucky has \nsome sweeping proposals on a national basis, and they may warrant \nexamination, but I certainly do not think they warrant coming into this \ndebate on a very different issue. I do not know that there has been any \nstudy of it. I do not think this represents the recommendation or the \nreport of any committee that is putting this forward, having undertaken \nan appropriate series of hearings in order to examine the subject. I \nhave not had the benefit of testimony from the proponents and \nopponents. In fact, if the Senator from Kentucky will yield for a \nquestion, has a committee of the Senate recommended anything like this?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Maryland, no committee of the \nSenate recommended the energy bill on which we spent 6 weeks in the \nSenate, and the majority leader has bypassed committees consistently \nthroughout the last year. So I do not know that the Senate was \nconstrained in any way--\n  Mr. SARBANES. It may be a response to say to me it was done somewhere \nelse. I have a very specific question: Has a committee of the Senate \nrecommended this proposal?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would like to provide my own answer. If the Senator \nis asking for an answer from the Senator from Kentucky, I would like to \nbe able to express myself, if that is OK with the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from Kentucky is very skilled. I watched \nhim on these television programs. I know he is very good when the \nquestion is put to him to give the answer he wants to give, even though \nit is not directed to the question. Obviously, I will have to go \nthrough that same experience on the floor of the Senate now.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Maryland for his compliment and \nrespond, as with many other bills over the last year that we dealt with \non the floor of the Senate, it has not been reported by a committee. \nBut many worthwhile ideas have been adopted and made a part of law that \nhave been recommended by both Democratic and Republican Senators that, \nin the years my friend and I have been here, were not officially \nreported out of a committee.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Have any hearings been held on these proposals--the \nbereavement period and the fees proposal? Have hearings been held on \nthose issues?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am unaware of any hearings to that effect, but I ask \nmy friend from Maryland why he thinks something as elementary as this, \nsomething as obviously as fair as this, and in the case of the \nbereavement rule, which we adopted in Federal law for families and \nvictims of airline crashes, would not be an appropriate thing to do \nwith or without hearings?\n  Mr. SARBANES. It seems to me there are complicated issues that are \nraised by Senator McConnell's proposal, and they certainly should have \nbeen preceded by hearings in which the pros and cons could have been \ncarefully examined.\n  Madam President, I reiterate my point, this amendment is not relevant \nto the issue before us. It does not come to us on the basis of any \nhearings that back up or buttress the proposal. It has not worked \nthrough any committee. It certainly has not been recommended by any \ncommittee, and there have not even been any hearings, as I understand \nit, by any committee.\n  At the appropriate time, I will be very strongly supportive of the \nmotion to table that will be offered by the able Senator from Wyoming. \nThis is, of course, the second McConnell second-degree amendment we \nhave had to deal with on this legislation.\n  I hope the Senator from Kentucky does not view this as a kind of fair \nhunting game to bring forth at each step along the way, whenever there \nis an opening for a second-degree amendment, whatever sort of pet \nproject he has been harboring in his office for whatever period of \ntime.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield myself some of my time to respond to my friend \nfrom Maryland.\n  As I listened carefully to my friend from Maryland, he is straining \nto think of a good argument against this worthwhile amendment. It has \nbeen my experience over the years in the Senate that when we start \nsaying there has been no committee action, there have been no hearings, \nwe are having a hard time thinking of a good argument against the \nproposal on the merits.\n  So let me repeat again what the merits are. It seems to me we do not \nneed committee hearings or committee action to convince us that a 45-\nday bereavement rule for victims and their families, which we have \nalready adopted in Federal law for victims and families of plane \ncrashes--we do not need committee action to tell us this is a \nfundamentally appropriate thing to do.\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\n  Do we need hearings and committee action to tell us that in Federal \nclaims and in Federal cases it is appropriate and only right that \nlawyers provide information to their clients at the beginning, during, \nand at the end of their handling of the case as to the possible costs \ninvolved? That is what is before us, not the issue of whether or not we \nshould have hearings on this or whether or not the committee should \nact. My goodness, we spent 6 weeks on an energy bill that the committee \ndid not pass out of the Energy Committee. We do that frequently. The \nSenate is not known to be constrained by tight rules of germaneness, \nnor by official committee action.\n  So I urge my colleagues to look at the amendment itself, not these \nrather extraneous arguments seeking to divert our attention away from \nwhat the amendment itself provides, which is protections for consumers \nof legal services.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, on the energy analysis, I simply point \nout that the Energy Committee held extended hearings over a long period \nof time on the energy issue. Then, they did not actually evolve a bill, \nbut they had a very full set of hearings and a lot of recommendations \navailable to be included in an energy package.\n  On the other, I say to my colleague, I forbore from discussing the \nsubstance because I did not want to prejudice the Senator on some \nfuture occasion by having to go substantively into the weaknesses and \ndeficiencies of the proposal that is before us. Since the time is \nlimited and that would take quite a while to do, I intend to continue \nto do that out of a sense of consideration to my colleague because \npresumably, if this amendment is tabled, he will be back visiting with \nus on another day, perhaps on an appropriate vehicle. I do not know. \nOne would have to wait and see whether that would be realized.\n  Out of some deference of respect for my friend from Kentucky, I \nsimply thought I would not undertake to go into this point by point on \nthe substance because it is really not appropriate. We ought to \nrecognize that and go ahead and table the amendment, and maybe when it \nfinally comes up in an appropriate context, we can then address its \nsubstantive weaknesses or strengths. Perhaps at that time it would have \nevolved into a different animal.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nAt 12:45, I will be making a motion to table the McConnell second-\ndegree amendment to amendment No. 4200. We are working on a bill that I \nhave spent hundreds of hours on, part of them in hearings, much of the \ntime in drafting my own legislation, then working with Senator Gramm to \ncome up with an even better bill, and then working with Senator \nSarbanes to come up with the bill we have before us.\n  There is a crisis in the stock market. Two days ago, it dropped by \n185 points. Yesterday, it dropped by 285 points. Some suggest that is \nbecause Congress is working on this issue and it is scaring the heck \nout of the people of the United States. I hope that is not the case. I \nhope it is a sign that they do want to have a solution, and they want \nto have a solution quickly. We do have the solution that, combined with \nthe House bill, can serve the purpose of restoring the confidence of \nAmerican investors.\n  The McConnell amendment is a clients' bill of rights to reform the \nway attorneys treat their clients. It is not about securities and \nexchange. It is all about attorneys. Senator Edwards and I modified our \namendment so it applies only to action before the Securities and \nExchange Commission. That was so that if this debate draws out with \nmultiple second-degree amendments well beyond the time we have the \ncloture vote, our amendment will still be germane.\n  A standard that the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, has put on \namendments is that they be germane. He did an extensive speech last \nnight about the need to do germane amendments and get this finished.\n  This amendment is good and well intended. It requires attorneys to do \na number of things in representing those who put their trust in \nattorneys' hands, and this includes requiring attorneys to provide \nwritten disclosure to their clients on the number of hours that will be \nspent on their case, the attorney's hourly or contingent fee, the \nprobability of successful outcome, estimated recovery of costs, and \nbereavement.\n  Under normal circumstances, I probably would be very excited about \nthis bill. The reason I am opposing it is simply because it does not \nhave anyplace in the accounting reform bill that we are debating today. \nI realize it does not change anything in my amendment. It is not a \nsubstitute amendment, but it is an addition that will cause problems \nfurther down the road. It will delay actually getting accounting reform \ninto place. The accounting reform bill is being used as a vehicle to \nprovide a free ride for a nongermane, unrelated amendment. I will \nprobably use that same line again on a number of other amendments that \ncome up later--it is nongermane.\n  The McConnell amendment needs to hitchhike on a different road with a \ndifferent vehicle at a different time.\n  Over several months, I and my esteemed colleagues on both sides of \nthis aisle have worked hard on the accounting reform bill. We have \nworked hard to keep out surplus, nonrelevant issues so we can get \nthrough the process of getting accounting legislation through in a \ntimely fashion and in a bipartisan manner. We have been very successful \nat keeping out exact amendments even that deal with how to do \naccounting and have set up a process where people who are knowledgeable \non that can figure out the right way to do it and the right way to do \nit faster than before.\n  I strongly believe this bill cannot afford to be held up any longer \njust for Members on both sides of the aisle to score political points \non hot button issues. A lot of us have pet projects and issues we would \nhave liked to add on, but we resisted and we encouraged our colleagues \non the Banking Committee to do the same thing.\n  We are now in the amendment process, but amendments should be germane \nto the contents of the underlying bill and amendment. That is not a \nrequirement until after cloture, but we need to get the bill done. \nThere is no reason we even need to go to cloture if we would get the \ngermane amendments done and get this into a conference committee so we \ncan get the work done.\n  The McConnell second-degree amendment, while well intended, is not \ngermane. It does not deal solely with securities laws or those \nattorneys appearing and practicing before the SEC. It does not deal \nsolely with attorneys working for publicly traded companies but to any \nattorney and any client practicing any form of Federal law. It does not \ndeal with an attorney's professional responsibilities of reporting \nFederal securities law violations to its corporate client. It is much \nbroader than the underlying amendment which does deal strictly with \nFederal securities laws, attorneys appearing and practicing before the \nSEC, and internal reporting by an attorney within a publicly traded \ncompany.\n  In addition, the McConnell amendment is going to require study and \ndebate, meaning more time spent diverting passage of the much needed \naccounting reform bill. We are running out of time before the next \nrecess and have several important bills yet to consider, including \nHomeland Security Department legislation.\n  While the McConnell amendment is well intended, the timing is simply \nwrong. I respect my colleague from Kentucky and his constant support \nand earnest effort to make attorneys play it straight with their \nclients. But I must respectfully oppose this amendment at this time. I \nhope we will be able to debate and vote on it on another day. When the \ntime is appropriate under the agreement, I will make a motion to table \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me say first with regard to \nwhether this is appropriate to be added to this bill, the ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee, the manager of the bill\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\non this side, supports my amendment. Obviously, it is not his view that \nthis is in any way inappropriate for this legislation.\n  I also say to my good friend from Wyoming, this will not slow down \nthe bill. This amendment will be voted on at 12:45. There is a time \nagreement on it. We certainly are not in any way trying to slow down \nthe passage of the underlying bill which I fully expect to support.\n  The issue is whether we are only interested in corporate defense \ncounsel misbehavior. Why are we only interested in corporate defense \ncounsel misbehavior? My amendment applies to the other side, the \nplaintiff's side. It would apply to cases, for example, brought under \nthe Federal Employers Liability Act, which governs injury and wrongful \ndeath actions against railroads in interstate commerce by railroad \nworkers and their families. It would apply to cases brought under the \nLongshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, which establishes no-\nfault compensation for employees injured on navigable rivers. And it \nwould apply to plaintiffs bringing action under the Price Anderson Act \namendments of 1998, which creates a Federal cause of action for nuclear \naccidents. It would also apply to the Federal Tort Claims Act, which \ncreates Federal causes of action for tort claims against the U.S. \nGovernment. It would apply to lawyers representing clients bringing \ncases under the Public Health Service Act, which are suits against \ncertain federally supported health centers and their employees brought \nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act. And finally, it would apply to \nlawyers representing clients bringing actions under part of Federal \nlaw, very important in my State, the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, \nwhich establishes a compensation scheme for coal miners allegedly \nsuffering from blank lung disease and survivors of miners who died from \nor were totally disabled by the disease.\n  Let me sum it up again: it is not my intent to slow the bill down. \nThis amendment will be voted on at 12:45, so it clearly is not slowing \nanything down. It seems to me entirely consistent with the underlying \namendment dealing with corporate defense counsel misbehavior to also \naddress the question of a plaintiff's lawyer's misbehavior.\n  Beyond that, we are talking simply about providing consumers of legal \nservices with basic information, at the beginning, during, and at the \nend of a lawsuit, and a modest 45-day bereavement rule giving the \nvictims and their families a chance to get back on their feet before \nthey are contacted by lawyers seeking to represent them in court. It \nwould not in any way prevent families from contacting a lawyer during \nthat time but would protect them from unwarranted solicitation of legal \nservices for a mere 45 days.\n  This is a very modest proposal. I would love to go a lot further. I \nlike the fee caps in the Federal Tort Claims Act. That is not what we \nhave offered. That is not what I offered. There is no impact on fees, \nno caps on damages. This is strictly consumer protection in the area of \nlegal services. It is a very modest proposal which I hope the Senate \nwill adopt when we vote on it at 12:45.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I will give a little explanation for the \npoint raised that this particular bill--because a time has been set for \nthe vote--will not hold things up. There are about 60 amendments out \nthere; there are probably 10 that actually deal with what is in the \nbill. There has to be some point where we have to ask, Can we not \nconcentrate on what is in the bill instead of bringing up the other \nthings? I am sorry that yours is the bill on which we are starting \nthat.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. Sure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It was my understanding that cloture was filed last \nnight. Would my friend from Wyoming not agree, that cloture vote brings \nthe bill to a conclusion? I am not in any way trying to delay the \npassage of the bill. I support the underlying bill. I believe my \namendment is appropriate to be considered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Actually, I will use my own time, and the Senator may \nreserve his time.\n  We must table this amendment. Otherwise, it becomes an invitation for \nothers to come in and offer second-degree amendments that are not \nrelevant to the bill. This amendment is not relevant to the bill--\nnowhere close. If we start this process now, opening up the bill to \nthese nonrelevant amendments, what will happen to the relevant \namendments, some of which are germane under cloture and others of which \nmight miss the tight test of germaneness but are relevant material, \nwhich are pending, which other colleagues have offered, if they want to \nget to those amendments?\n  We could have done the Edwards amendment yesterday and moved on to \nsomething else, but we came in with a second-degree amendment, not \nrelevant--not only not relevant to the Edwards amendment, not relevant \nto the bill.\n  Frankly, we are well beyond the point where we at least ought to set \naside amendments that have no relevance to the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly, I yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Maryland, if he believes my \namendment may have some merit, whether he would support taking it up as \na freestanding measure with a time agreement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, I would not support that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why would I support a request like that? Surely the \nSenator from Kentucky is just making a joke on the floor of the Senate \nby making that inquiry. That must be apparent to all. I appreciate the \nSenator's sense of humor in that regard. I also appreciate his \nindication, just a moment or two ago, he intends to support the \nunderlying bill. Of course, we are gratified to hear that.\n  I yield the floor and reserve whatever time I may have left.\n  What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 33 seconds, Senator McConnell \nhas 4 minutes 38 seconds, and the Senator from Wyoming has 3 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It was my understanding that Senator Santorum was on \nthe way. But if he has not arrived yet, I suppose the best thing to do \nwould be to enter a quorum call knowing full well my time is running.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will alert Members we are going to have \na vote later. The two members of the Appropriations Committee have \nfinally gotten a meeting with the House appropriators on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. I think it would be in everyone's \nbest interest that they are allowed to go forward with that most \nimportant meeting.\n  We received a request from the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder that is now in effect be modified and that Senator Enzi would be \nrecognized at 2 p.m. to move to table the amendment, and that 8 minutes \nprior to that would be devoted to debate between the two managers of \nthe bill, Senator Sarbanes and Senator Gramm, and that Senator Enzi \nwould be recognized for 2 minutes, and Senator McConnell for 2 \nminutes--a total of 8 minutes. All other provisions of the unanimous \nconsent agreement now in effect would remain the way they are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the vote will occur at 2 o'clock today. In \nthe meantime, I ask there be a period from now until then for morning \nbusiness, with the time equally divided between Senator Daschle or his \ndesignee or Senator Lott or his designee.\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask the time be \ncharged equally between Senator Daschle and Senator Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6616-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6616-S6617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE EXTENSION\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in this period of morning \nbusiness to raise a continuing and serious problem that we believe most \nacutely in New York but which I know is shared in other parts of our \nNation.\n  Last month, the Nation joined New Yorkers in our reflection and \nsorrow as the workers at ground zero removed the final debris from the \n16-acre World Trade Center site.\n  While this event, which was accomplished ahead of schedule and below \nbudget by the most dedicated workforce that I think you could find \nanywhere in the world--unionized building trades and construction \nworkers who worked on that pile for 12- to 15-hour days, 7 case days a \nweek, for months, and, therefore, because of their heroic efforts we \nmoved one step closer to the beginning of the rebuilding process--there \nare many workers who have not been able to begin rebuilding their lives \nsimply because there are not enough jobs right now.\n  Many of us will remember a photograph shortly after September 11 that \nthe press ran showing hundreds of people standing in lines at a job \nfair that was held in the city, people who had lost their jobs, both \ndirectly because of the attack on the World Trade Center and indirectly \nbecause of the ripple effect through the economy.\n  There were workers--and I have met with scores and scores of them--\nwhose jobs were literally destroyed when the Twin Towers collapsed. \nThey were the janitors. They were the doormen. They were the waiters \nand waitresses. They were the secretaries and the messengers. They went \nto work every day in that huge complex of offices. There were those who \nserved the small businesses that took care of the workers in those \nbuildings. And, of course, then there were those throughout the city \nwho may not have worked at ground zero but who lost their jobs because \nof the aftermath on the entire economy because of the terrorist \nattacks.\n  We all know that thousands of hard-working Americans have been thrown \nout of work because of the combination of the jobless recovery and the \nterrorist attacks.\n  Prior to September 11, our economy was beginning to slow down. Our \nnational unemployment rate rose from 4.5 percent a year ago to 4.9 \npercent in September and to 5.9 percent today. But I think that somehow \ndoes not even tell the whole story because what we have seen occurring \nsince September 11 is this so-called jobless recovery.\n  The Wall Street Journal just ran an article about it stating that \nemployment has now shown 13 consecutive months of decline through \nApril. That exceeds the 11 straight months of loss in the 1990-91 \nrecession, the only recent comparable period, about a decade ago.\n  I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n     Unemployment Hit 5.9% in June; Revisions Show Grim Job Picture\n\n                              (By Greg Ip)\n\n       Washington--With weak stock prices and corporate scandals \n     damping companies' hiring plans, the recovery is starting for \n     workers to look as bad as, if not worse than, the ``jobless \n     recovery'' of 1991-92.\n       The number of nonagricultural jobs rose just 36,000 in June \n     from May, and the unemployment rate edged up to 5.9% from \n     5.8%, the Labor Department said Friday. Government \n     statisticians once again revised down prior months' levels of \n     employment, revealing a job market far weaker than previously \n     thought.\n       ``The economy is on the road to recovery [though] the \n     recovery is a bit anemic,'' said Labor Secretary Elaine Chao. \n     ``The labor market lags behind changes in real economic \n     activity.''\n       While the Labor Department regularly revises its payroll \n     estimates, those revisions have been strikingly negative this \n     year, with every month's report being revised downward--often \n     sharply. The agency originally said payrolls rose 66,000 in \n     February, but now it says they fell 165,000. An originally \n     reported gain of 58,000 jobs in March is now a loss of 5,000, \n     and a gain of 43,000 in April is a loss of 21,000. May's \n     gains were revised down to 24,000 from 41,000.\n       A ``benchmark'' revision a month ago also reduced \n     employment throughout last year. Employment in November 2001 \n     was 340,000 below original estimates.\n       As a result, employment now shows 13 consecutive monthly \n     declines through April. That exceeds the 11 straight losses \n     in 1990-1991, though those declines were steeper. Back then, \n     job losses continued intermittently through 1991 and into \n     early 1992. A similarly tough spell could be in store for \n     workers now, with the recovery so far subpar and employers \n     more determined than usual to boost output per employee \n     rather than the number of employees.\n       Lois Orr, acting commissioner of the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics, said recent revisions haven't been statistically \n     significant, but she couldn't explain why they have been \n     overwhelmingly negative. Data compiled by the Federal Reserve \n     Bank of Philadelphia show that in 1991, as the economy \n     emerged from recession, early payroll revisions were \n     alternately positive and negative, though benchmark revisions \n     years later sharply lowered employment levels.\n       While job creation was stagnant last month, there were \n     still signs in the jobs report that the economy is continuing \n     to grow. The average work week rose to 34.3 hours from 34.2 \n     hours, and in manufacturing it jumped to 41.1 from 40.9 \n     hours. When firms see an increase in business but aren't sure \n     if it will last, they often boost the hours of current \n     employees before hiring new ones, because it is easier to cut \n     back hours later than to sack workers.\n       Temporary employment, another way for firms to raise output \n     without adding to permanent payrolls, edged up by 9,000. \n     Manufacturing payrolls fell 23,000, though that was one of \n     the smallest declines in two years. In services, losses in \n     retail trade were offset by gains in health care and \n     government.\n       ``Businesses are hesitant to expand, due to concerns about \n     the stock market and heightened uncertainty over the \n     geopolitical outlook,'' Bank Credit Analyst, a financial-\n     markets research firm, said in a report Friday. ``The attack \n     on accounting standards and concerns about re-regulation are \n     additional factors keeping corporate executives from \n     expanding.''\n       Long-distance phone company WorldCom Inc. announced 17,000 \n     layoffs two weeks ago when it disclosed it had understated \n     operating expenses by $3.8 billion. Electronic Data Systems \n     Corp., a major supplier to WorldCom whose accounting has also \n     come under scrutiny by investors, said last week it would lay \n     off about 2,000 employees in response to sluggish demand for \n     its computer services.\n       The weak job market doesn't mean a shrinking economy \n     because firms are squeezing increased production out of their \n     current employees.\n       Merrill Lynch estimates that productivity, or output per \n     hour worked, expanded at more than a 3% annual rate in the \n     second quarter, down from the first quarter's remarkable \n     8.4%, but still robust.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. So here we are with a national unemployment rate of 5.9 \npercent, and the situation in New York is even worse. In our State, it \nis 6.1 percent unemployment, and in New York City, 8 percent \nunemployment.\n  We did the right thing a few months ago when we passed unemployment \ninsurance and disaster unemployment assistance for 13 weeks. Those are \nboth very important programs.\n  The disaster unemployment assistance, which comes through FEMA, goes \ndirectly to those workers who actually lost their jobs because of the \nphysical destruction of September 11. Unemployment insurance, as we \nknow, is triggered when there is a lack of jobs for whatever reason. \nAnd, of course, more people are out of work in New York and throughout \nour Nation because of the impact of September 11.\n  Unfortunately, these extensions, which provided a very needed safety \nnet for thousands of workers, are about to expire for many of those \nworkers. Nationally, 686,000 individuals will have exhausted their \nbenefits with no job to enter.\n  On Monday, I participated in an announcement of a study that was \ncommissioned by a group called the 9/11 United Services, which is a \ncoordinating group that tried to bring all the charities together. A \nvery accomplished corporate executive was asked to come in and serve as \nthe temporary chairman. He immediately said: We don't have any data. We \ndon't know what the facts are.\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\n  He commissioned a study by McKenzie and Company to try to figure out \nwhat the economic challenges are that we are confronting. Their survey, \nwhich was announced on Monday, showed that approximately 45,000 workers \nin New York City whose jobs were affected continue to suffer an income \nloss of more than 25 percent. Approximately 28,000 are still \nunemployed. In other words, we got down to about 45,000, and of those \n45,000, about 17,000 did get a job, although it cut their income \nconsiderably, and 28,000 are still unemployed.\n  It is clear, despite the very best efforts of private charities and \nvery extraordinarily generous people, we just cannot make up the losses \nof income and joblessness that we are still confronting.\n  The New York State Department of Labor confirmed these figures from \nthe McKenzie study, but, in fact, theirs are even more dire, and they \nare the official figures. They show that 105,000 people were on \nunemployment insurance as a direct result of the World Trade Center \nattacks. We have an increasing number who are running out of time. \nNearly 7,000 of the 24,000 are still unemployed, looking for jobs, and \nhave exhausted all their benefits. There is no job in sight.\n  The disaster unemployment assistance expired, dropping 1,100 people \nwho still have not found a job, who have not been placed anywhere else \nbecause their companies, if they are still in New York--as many, \nthankfully, are--have downsized, have moved, and have not been able to \nprovide all the jobs that were once there.\n  I have provided these statistics just to give you some insight. But, \nof course, the personal stories are what are most wrenching and what I \nencounter every time I am in the city, or my caseworkers and staff, as \nthey field phone calls, e-mails, and letters from people who worked at \njobs for 18 years, 25 years, who put two children through college, and \nnow have nothing to fall back on, who are on the brink of being evicted \nfrom the apartment they have lived in for decades, or are about to be \nforeclosed on in the homes they have struggled to buy.\n\n  I know that it is sometimes difficult to think about these faceless \npeople out there, but we have tried very hard to do the right thing in \nthe wake of the World Trade Center. We certainly tried to provide the \nresources that businesses needed to get back on their feet.\n  This body and the President and the House were extremely generous to \nprovide the public funds that we needed to begin the rebuilding \nprocess, to clean up the debris, to do what we needed to get back on \nthe right track in Lower Manhattan. But I just do not want to see our \nworkers--people who were gainfully employed, doing the right thing--\nforgotten.\n  Certainly, I have a great deal of sympathy for people in other parts \nof the country who are really caught up in this so-called jobless \nrecovery as well.\n  I am introducing two pieces of legislation, along with Senators \nSchumer and Kennedy, to extend both unemployment insurance and disaster \nunemployment assistance for an additional 13 weeks. It is our hope that \nthe jobs will start coming back into the economy.\n  In fact, experts certainly agree that extending unemployment \ninsurance is more likely than anything else we can do to get money into \nthe economy that people will have to start spending because they do not \nhave any choice.\n  Over the last five recessions, every $1 spent on unemployment \nbenefits generated a $2.15 increase in the gross domestic product. I \nwent back and looked. What did we do the last time we were in any kind \nof comparable period?\n  Mr. President, the period of 1990-91 was the most recent time in \nwhich to compare this. In the early 1990s, benefits were extended four \ntimes, for it became clear, in the absence of that safety net, that \nlifeline, we would have even greater problems with which to deal.\n  What are we going to do with people who get foreclosed on and \nevicted? Not everybody has a family to go to and crowd on to a sofa bed \nor into a spare room. We are going to have increases in homelessness. \nWe are going to have all kinds of problems that at least we can try to \nforestall and, hopefully, eliminate.\n  These benefits would be extended for just an additional 13 weeks--\nhalf the time they were extended back in the early 1990s.\n  Clearly, I think we need systemic changes to the unemployment \ninsurance system. I think it is kind of an odd position for us all to \nbe in: Coming back, asking to extend it whenever it is needed, that we \nhave to have new congressional action. There ought to be some ways \nwhere we can also be more sensitive to different parts of the country.\n  I know there are parts of the country--there are parts of my State--\nthat are below the national average in unemployment. But there are \nconcentrated pockets that we don't, frankly, want to spread and have \nmore expensive problems to deal with, which is one of the additional \nreasons I hope the Senate will support this action.\n  I am very appreciative of all of the support that New York and New \nYorkers have received over the last many months. This has been \nobviously a traumatic and terrible time for many families. Certainly \nnothing we can say or do will bring back a loved one or even bring back \na job that was there for 20, 25 years. But we do have to continue to \ntry to send out this lifeline, the help that is needed, so people can \ntry to get themselves back on their feet and that we don't claim more \nvictims because of the horrific attack on September 11.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Sarbanes \nlegislation.\n  We have been buffeted over the last several months on a daily basis \nwith news of companies with accounting practices that have led them to \nbankruptcy, have left them without the means to carry on their \nbusiness, have left their workers without jobs, and have devastated \ntheir pension funds. Day after day after day, a litany of accounting \nirregularities surface on the front pages of America. It has translated \ninto a growing lack of confidence in our markets.\n  We are here today with the critical role of reassuring the American \npublic that we will pass legislation quickly that will restore their \nconfidence in our financial system.\n  This crisis is deepening with each day. Therefore, we must move \nforward deliberately, carefully but very quickly, to ensure that we can \ncommunicate with the American people and let them know we are aware of \nthese problems and we are correcting them.\n  I just came from a press conference to which we invited \nrepresentatives who manage public pension funds. It is a staggering \nsense that we are seeing out there, not just problems on Wall Street \nbut problems on Main Street. Essentially what has happened is that the \nAmerican public has become invested heavily in our capital markets, in \nour equities, not just individually but particularly through pension \nfunds. Sixty percent of the assets of defined contribution plans are \ninvested in equities or mutual funds. About 70 percent of all of these \nfunds together is creating a situation in which, when Wall Street has a \nproblem, it translates to every corner of the country.\n\n  We have to step forward. We are stepping forward. The Sarbanes bill \nis a strong bill. It has been made even stronger with the adoption \nyesterday, in a bipartisan vote, of the Leahy amendment. We are going \nto create an oversight board for accountants that will truly be \nindependent and will have the force and the teeth to get the job done.\n  The Sarbanes bill also proposes the serious separation of the \nauditing function and other consulting functions that accountants can \nperform. If you\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nare going to be an auditor, you have to be an auditor, not an auditor \nand consultant. This is an important step forward.\n  Also importantly, the Sarbanes bill will require that the SEC receive \nthe necessary resources to get the job done. There have been for \ndecades extensive security laws on our books. Unless these laws are \nenforced, they are not effective. Frankly, some of what we are \ndiscovering is a lack of enforcement. You have the SEC that is \noverwhelmed with filings and not capable of reviewing all those \nfilings, not capable of taking the kind of proactive action which is \nnecessary to avert the crisis we have seen.\n  We are indeed at a critical moment in our history. We have seen the \nmarket over the last few days take huge losses. That suggests that not \njust the American public but the world is growing more and more \nconcerned with our accounting practices, our transparency, whether or \nnot a financial statement by an American publicly traded company can be \nrelied upon.\n  One of the ironies of this is a year or 2 ago, 3 or 4 years ago \ncertainly, we were out offering our market to an emerging economy in \nRussia as the model; in a way, sort of looking at them, saying: Boy, if \nonly they would adopt our accounting practices, the kind of tough rules \nwe have, it would be a huge step forward in their development as a \nmarket economy.\n  Well, ironically, today we have discovered that what we thought was a \nvery thorough, comprehensive system is not as thorough and \ncomprehensive as we thought and did not have the kind of integrity we \nneed to ensure investors that when they read a report from an American \ncompany, that report is accurate. That used to be the standard.\n  I mentioned previously that I had the occasion to attend a press \nconference with representatives of public pension funds. One of the \nindividuals was the first comptroller of New York City.\n  Let me give you an idea of the dimension of a problem we are talking \nabout. On an annual basis, the city of New York has been contributing \nabout $600 million a year to their pension funds in order to make sure \nthose pension funds are actuarially sound, that they can pay the \nbenefits for all of their retirees. They still can do that today, but \nthe pricetag has gone up to over $1 billion in a year. They estimate, \nif the market continues, that they will be paying on the order of $3 \nbillion in a few years. That money comes from taxes paid by the people \nof New York, and it comes from cutting other programs. It is a huge \nproblem.\n  At the core of the problem is this lack of confidence, the daily \nspate of news reports saying essentially that the accounting practices \nof major publicly held companies are absolutely erroneous. We have to \nreverse that tidal wave, and we have to do it quickly. We can begin to \ndo that by strong support of the Sarbanes bill.\n  Many people have called this an investors' bill of rights. I think \nthey are correct. I commend and compliment the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Sarbanes.\n  This is an example of how legislation should be done. This is an \nexample of a careful, thoughtful process through the committee. I know \nthe Presiding Officer, as a member of that committee, contributed \nsubstantially to that process. It was a delight and pleasure to work \nwith Senator Sarbanes on the Banking Committee, to see that careful, \nthoughtful approach--with 10 hearings, witnesses from every sector of \nour economy, including perspectives from those who manage pensions, \nthose who are security experts, and those who are business leaders. All \nof those perspectives were brought together in this legislation, which \nis thorough, comprehensive, and, in my view, outstanding.\n  Then, also, to be able to fashion a bipartisan group of support was \ncritical here and throughout our country. This is a textbook example by \na master of how to move legislation through this body, but, more \nimportantly, how to respond to the compelling needs of the American \npublic. I commend and thank Senator Sarbanes and his staff for their \ngreat effort.\n  We are at a point we can begin to see--if we move forward in the next \nfew days--a new regime of securities laws that will feature an \nindependent, full-time professional oversight board to monitor the \nbehavior of accountants. We will also see guidelines on which nonaudit \nservices are prohibited, so there will be a separation between the \naudit and nonaudit services. That should prevail. This is very \nimportant.\n  I was an attorney in private practice and did corporate work. \nFrankly, I assumed that what I saw in that report, signed by a \ndistinguished auditing firm, was gospel and not to be contradicted; \nthat it was the final judge about disputes on costs and facts about \nwhat the company was doing and what they were disclosing and what they \ndidn't have to disclose. I always assumed that it was the accountants \nwho were answering those tough questions. They were literally the bad \nguys. There were a lot of creative CEOs, CFOs, and lawyers. In fact, \nthey were often satirized, and the most uncreative part of the \nmanagement was that auditor who was telling you, no, you cannot do \nthis. That, obviously, over the last few years, has eroded \ntremendously.\n  With the Sarbanes bill, we will clearly delineate those activities \nthat can and should be performed by an auditor. It will also shore up \ntremendously corporate responsibility and require CEOs and CFOs to \ncertify the accuracy of the company's financial statements. It will \nalso increase the amount of the financial disclosure that a company \nmust conduct in the course of their business.\n  Many of the exotic arrangements that brought down Enron were never \ndisclosed to shareholders and the investing public. As a result, those \nentities, when discovered--such as CHEWCO--were the instruments of the \ndemise of that company. Those kinds of off-balance-sheet transactions \nwill have to be disclosed if the bill passes, and I think it is \nnecessary to do that.\n  We are also dealing with the very real need for increasing funding \nfor the SEC. That is a critical component of the legislation.\n  The President was in New York City making a speech, calling for $100 \nmillion--or probably closer to $300 million, or more--that we need to \nensure that the SEC has to conduct their activities. So we are moving \nforward and ensuring that, I hope, we do this.\n  Our record over the last several years has not been as aggressive as \nI would have liked it to be. I supported a measure a few years ago--in \nfact, I think last year--in which we passed legislation that lowered \nvarious fees that are involved in securities transactions, with the \nidea that we would, at the same time, increase the pay within the SEC \nto attract better workers and more sophisticated individuals there, to \ncomplement what is going on in the private market where legal salaries \nare very high. The transaction reduction fee went down, but the pay \nparity never went into effect. So I think we have to follow through not \nonly with this authorization but also with appropriations to make sure \nthat can occur.\n  So we have a situation where we are moving forward and in which the \nSarbanes legislation, I hope, will be complemented by legislation \nproposed by Senator Kennedy to directly affect pension operations in \nthe United States. These two pieces of legislation--hopefully brought \ntogether quickly, passed through this body and by the other body, and \nsigned by the President--will send a signal to the American public, the \ninvesting public in the U.S. and around the world that our markets are \nthe best in the world, that they can rely upon every word in a \nfinancial report, and to have fully disclosed the financial conditions \nof publicly held companies in the United States. If we do that, it will \nbe a huge benefit not just to Wall Street but to Main Street.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I support the McConnell amendment. I think \nit is a good government amendment. I think it is a full disclosure \namendment. I don't even see why we are voting on it. I am convinced it \nwill be defeated because any good government amendment that has \nanything to do with plaintiffs' attorneys is routinely defeated in the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\n  Having said that, I make note of the fact that the Dow is down again \ntoday. I do not believe the primary problem in the markets today is the \ndisease we are fighting. The primary problem we have now is fear about \nthe absurd prescription of the doctor. I believe there is concern that \nin this frenzy, things are going to be done that will have a long-term \nnegative impact on the capital market.\n  If you take the bill the House has already passed and the Senate bill \nas it is now, and you take the President's position reiterated \nyesterday by the Secretary of the Treasury, we have the makings of a \ngood bill that can be broadly supported.\n  I reiterate my hope and desire that we bring this debate to a close. \nWe could, by unanimous consent, have a vote on cloture today. We could \ndeal very quickly with germane amendments. We could pass this bill \ntonight, and next week we could be going to conference. That would be \nprudent policy.\n  We are going to have a lot of amendments offered, if my list is \nindicative, that if anyone really believed they would be adopted, would \nbe terribly frightening to investors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If anybody took this list of amendments seriously, they \nwould not be willing to risk thousands, millions, or billions of \ndollars. But they should not take this list seriously because these \namendments are not going to become law.\n  The sooner we bring this debate to an end, the sooner we pass this \nbill in the Senate, the sooner we go to conference, the sooner we put \ntogether a bill that will represent a compromise, the more certainty \nthere will be on Wall Street and the quicker we will rebuild equity \nvalues in America and rebuild confidence in our market.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's move ahead. Nothing good is going to \nhappen today to this bill. Nothing bad is going to happen either, I \nmake that clear, but it will not be clear to people watching this \ndebate. The sooner the debate ends, the better off we will be. The \nsooner we get to conference, the sooner we will have a bill. That \ncannot come soon enough to suit me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I expect shortly my amendment will be \ntabled. That will be further evidence that there is not a majority of \nthe Senate willing to confront the issue of either union corruption as \nwe discovered yesterday or, in the case of the amendment about to be \nvoted on, plaintiff's lawyer misconduct.\n  The underlying amendment, the Edwards-Enzi amendment, addresses the \nissue of corporate counsel, defense counsel misconduct, and it seemed \nonly appropriate to me that we deal with the other side of the \nequation; that is, the lawyers who represent plaintiffs in Federal \nclaims and in Federal courts.\n  This is a long overdue matter to be dealt with. If not now, when? My \ngood friend from Maryland said this is an inappropriate bill to deal \nwith it, so I suggested maybe he would support me in bringing up my \nmatter freestanding with a time agreement; he smiled, but clearly the \nanswer was no.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  The answer was no. I didn't smile. I said no and smiled along with \nit.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I respectfully correct the observation, \nin case the Senator from Maryland misunderstood. I didn't doubt that \nhis answer was no. He doesn't want to deal with this at any point, \never--not now, not tomorrow, not ever.\n  The issue before the Senate is whether it is appropriate to deal with \nclient misbehavior when they are representing plaintiffs, as well as \nwhen they might be representing defendants.\n  My amendment is very simple. I would love to have gone further. My \namendment does not cap fees, does not cap damages. It simply deals with \nthe following: Providing, for the client, information about the \narrangements under which the client is retaining the lawyer at the \nbeginning, in the middle, and at the end of the case so the client \nfully understands the terms of the arrangement; second, that there be a \n45-day bereavement rule established 45 days after the occurrence of the \naccident where the victims and their families would not be harassed by \nthose seeking to represent them. It is just a 45-day bereavement rule \nwhich we already did under Federal law for airplane accidents.\n\n  I hope this amendment will be adopted. It is very reasonable and very \nappropriate to this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation? I have 2 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 2 minutes and \nthe Senator from Wyoming has 2 minutes. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to table this \namendment. I do not know what amendment the Senator from Kentucky will \ncome with next out of his grab bag, but he has obviously got a whole \nset of pet projects that he has been husbanding there in his committee \nand that he will seek to offer. They are not relevant to this \nlegislation.\n  Here we are again trying to deal with an issue that is relevant. I \nsuggest to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky that he allow the \nsecond-degree amendment staffer to take the weekend off so we do not \nhave to continue to go through this exercise of being confronted with \nthese second-degree amendments not relevant to the legislation. We have \nimportant legislation to deal with here. We have some good amendments \npending out there. This repeated effort to just gum up the works is \ndifficult to understand.\n  In any event, I urge my colleagues on the vote that is shortly to \ncome to vote to table the McConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have, I think, before us, about 60 \namendments. I join my ranking member, the Senator from Texas, in his \ncomments about how we need to get this bill done as quickly as \npossible. The stock market is dropping. It may be because of what we \nare doing. It may be because of the need to have this bill done. Either \nway, getting this bill done will give some assurance to the stock \nmarket both that we are not dabbling in it anymore, and that we have \ncompleted our work and have provided a solution.\n  As a result--and I regret that it is on this amendment with my friend \nfrom Kentucky--I will begin making tabling motions on amendments that \ndo not have a direct aspect to the bill. I also would be doing that to \namendments that put specific accounting language into the bill, even if \nit is relevant. This bill is not designed to put in specific accounting \nlanguage; it is designed to set up a process for getting to specific \naccounting language. That is a very fine distinction and a very \nimportant one if we want to have the kind of stock market and the \ncompanies that we envision.\n  With those comments, at this time I move to table the McConnell \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent we be permitted 1 minute to make \nan introduction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6619-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6619-S6620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCING THE HONORABLE PAT COX, PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

This is an exciting time \nof growth and change in the European Union, and as President of the \nEuropean Parliament, Pat Cox has been instrumental in fostering greater \nEuropean unity and advocating for EU expansion.\n  As Europe becomes ever more unified, the extension of EU membership \nto free and democratic nations will be crucial to ensuring that \ndiversity and pluralism accompany unification. In the face of \npersistent disputes among EU nations and political factions, President \nCox has not wavered in his support for expansion, or in his \ndenouncement of far right politicians who do not express the views of \nmost Europeans. For that, we are all grateful.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Cox will be available to meet our Senate \ncolleagues here on the floor during this vote.\n  Let me, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, welcome President Cox.\n  (Applause.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6620-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6620-S6633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING REFORM AND INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT OF 2002--\n                               Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4200\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment is offered--and I thank the \nmajority leader--on behalf of myself, Senator Bill Nelson, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Corzine, and Senator Biden.\n  Our amendment would grant the SEC administrative authority to impose \ncivil fines on persons who violate securities laws, regulations, and \nrules. Now the SEC has to go to court, which is difficult and \nburdensome.\n  We, just the other day, decided we wanted to give the SEC the power \nto remove directors and officers from public companies who violate \nrules and regulations and laws without having to go to court.\n  Of course, those decisions administratively by the SEC are subject to \nan appeal. That is always true and always must be true. The same \napproach is essential relative to the imposition of civil fines. If the \nSEC is going to have power, without a lot of cumbersome, costly, and \nexpensive procedures, to really take on those directors and those \nauditors who violate the law, who violate rules and regulations, the \nSEC must have the same authority which other regulatory bodies have to \nimpose civil fines.\n  A few examples: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has \nauthority to impose civil fines up to three times the monetary gain \nfrom a violation plus restitution of customer damages. The Department \nof Transportation can impose civil fines. The Consumer Product Safety \nCommission can impose civil fines. The Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, OSHA, can impose civil fines. The Federal \nCommunications Commission can impose civil fines.\n  As a matter of fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission can \nimpose civil fines on some of the people it regulates--brokers. But \nunless we act today, there will be a great gap in the enforcement power \nof the SEC, a continuing gap. That gap is, it does not have the power, \nwithout legislation, to impose an administrative civil fine on auditors \nand members of boards of directors who violate rules and regulations in \nthe law of the land.\n  Our amendment would give the SEC that authority to impose \nadministratively civil fines on those people who violate our securities \nlaws and regulations and rules. That includes officers, directors, and \nauditors of publicly traded companies.\n  I emphasize, these fines would be, and must be, subject to judicial \nreview, as are the other SEC administrative determinations which they \nhave authority to answer at this point. That is the first objective of \nthe amendment.\n  Secondly, our amendment would significantly increase the civil fines \nthe SEC can impose on law violators. I particularly thank Senator \nNelson of Florida for highlighting the problem and supporting the \ninclusion of these provisions in the amendment.\n  The civil fines that currently can be imposed on broker-dealers \nadministratively have maximum amounts that start at $6,500 per \nviolation. That is the maximum amount under the so-called tier 1 civil \nfine. If a broker-dealer now violates the securities laws under so-\ncalled tier 1 where there is a violation found, not yet proven to be \nfraudulent but a violation nonetheless, $6,500 is the maximum fine \nunder current law. Tier 2 for individuals is a $60,000 fine. That is \nwhere you find fraud, deceit, manipulation, and deliberate or reckless \ndisregard--$60,000 for an individual for that violation.\n  It is laughable. The current structure of fines which can be imposed \non those people who administratively can be subject to a civil action \nor civil fine by the SEC is so low, these fines are a joke. We are \ntalking about people who frequently are walking away, lining their \npockets, violating rules and regulations for millions of dollars, \nsometimes tens of millions of dollars. To have a system where the \nmaximum fine under tier 1 is $6,500 for an individual and under tier 2 \nis $60,000 is just simply inadequate.\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\n  Here is what the SEC staff said in June of this year: The current \nmaximum penalty amounts may not have the desired deterrent effect on an \nindividual or a corporate violator. For example, an individual who \ncommits a negligent act is subject to a maximum penalty of $6,500 per \nviolation.\n\n  This is the conclusion of the SEC staff: The amount is so trivial \nthat it cannot possibly have a deterrent effect on the violator.\n  I would say that is an understatement: $6,500, given the current \namount of money flowing through these violations of rules and \nregulations, is pitifully trivial. In fact, it is no deterrent at all. \nIt might as well not be there. If we are going to have a deterrent \nsystem, we have to have fines which have some bite, which are real, \nwhich have an impact on people.\n  We would, under our amendment, increase the maximum fines from a \nrange of $6,500 to $600,000, which is the current range for tiers 1 \nthrough 3, to a range which goes from $100,000 to $5 million in fines \nper violation.\n  We are seeing these corporate restatements and misconduct involving \n$2 billion, $4 billion, and even $12 billion. These new fine amounts \nare critical if they are to have the desired deterrent and punitive \neffects on wrongdoers in the corporate world.\n  Our bill also has language which is similar to the language in the \nLeahy and Lott amendments that were adopted relative to the removal \nfrom office. We do this for the sake of completeness, so that we can \nlay out the entire structure being proposed in our bill for \nadministratively imposed civil fines. That part of the amendment is the \nsame as the removal from office provisions adopted by the Senate \nyesterday in the Leahy and Lott amendments.\n  Finally, our amendment would grant the SEC new administrative \nauthority, when the SEC has opened an official investigation, to \nsubpoena financial records from a financial institution without having \nto notify the subject that such a records request has been made. This \nauthority would allow the SEC to evaluate financial transactions, to \ntrace funds, to analyze relationships, without having to alert the \nsubject of the investigation to the SEC's action.\n  Under current law, the SEC either has to give the subject advance \nnotice of the subpoena or to obtain a court order that can delay \nnotification for no longer than 90 days. That is a huge impediment to \nenforcement by the SEC. We ought to change that.\n  The staff of the SEC wrote the following relative to this amendment:\n\n       This amendment would enhance the Commission's ability to \n     trace money and relationships quickly and effectively. The \n     Commission typically requests bank records when it has reason \n     to suspect possible relationships between persons or entities \n     and that passage of money between those persons or entities \n     may be relevant to violations of the securities laws. \n     Identifying those relationships and quickly identifying \n     assets obtained or transferred in connection with possible \n     unlawful activity is critical to the Commission's ability to \n     obtain orders freezing assets and other appropriate relief.\n       In many situations, the Commission could proceed much more \n     effectively if it could obtain relevant bank records without \n     providing notice to the persons whose account records are \n     sought.\n       Under current law, however--\n\n  The SEC staff wrote--\n     the right to the Financial Privacy Act generally requires the \n     commission to provide those persons with notice and a \n     substantial period--10 to 14 days--in which to file a contest \n     to the commission's authority to obtain the records.\n\n  Let me continue with the SEC staff analysis of this language that is \nin our bill:\n\n       Because Congress recognized that the notice requirement \n     can, in some cases, compromise important and legitimate \n     commission investigative objectives, Congress provided in \n     section 21(h) of the Exchange Act that the commission may \n     seek court authorization to obtain relevant bank records \n     without notifying the customer for at least 90 days. \n     Unfortunately--\n\n  The SEC staff wrote--\n     those important investigative objectives are also compromised \n     by the inherent delay in obtaining the necessary court order.\n       The proposed amendment to section 21(h)--\n\n  Our language in this amendment--\n\n     addresses both the notice and delay problem by allowing the \n     commission the discretion only in those cases in which it has \n     already authorized a formal investigation to proceed without \n     notice to the customer. The proposed amendment also \n     reiterates and strengthens the commission's authority to \n     require that financial institutions not compromise \n     investigations by notifying any persons or entities that \n     their bank records have been subpoenaed.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield for a question, but I do have an \nadditional thought.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am proud to be here today with my colleague \nfrom Michigan to offer these reforms aimed at preventing and punishing \nperpetrators of corporate fraud. The questions I wanted to ask the very \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, who has the foresight of why we \nneed this at this particular time, are these: Would it not intrigue the \nSenator from Michigan and other Senators here that all of this is \nhappening in an environment when 17,000 workers at WorldCom have \nreceived pink slips and have realized losses of over a billion dollars \nin their retirement plans; and at the same time they were receiving \npink slips, the corporate executives were attending a retreat in \nHawaii? That would not surprise the Senator, would it?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would not surprise me at all.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I doubt that it would surprise the Senator \nthat one of those executives, by the way, was putting the finishing \ntouches on a $15 million mansion, derived from that money from \nWorldCom. Would it surprise the Senator that late last year Global \nCrossing laid off 1,200 people, giving them no severance package, while \nthe CEO of that company walked away with hundreds of millions of \ndollars?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am afraid very little would surprise me about some of \nthese violations and deceptions these days.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I know it would not surprise the Senator, but \nI will ask him this anyway. After what went on with Enron last summer, \nwhile Enron executives were selling their shares for hundreds of \nmillions of dollars and protecting their portfolios, their retirees and \nemployees lost more than a billion dollars in retirement savings. Does \nthat surprise the Senator?\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Tragically, it is not a surprise.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is unconscionable. One of those we had \ntestify in our Commerce Committee was Janice Farmer, an Enron retiree \nwho lost her entire life savings that she had built up in a retirement \nplan from Enron. In her case, it was $700,000. She has nothing now.\n  And then, I suppose it also would not surprise the distinguished \nSenator that, while we are talking about these excesses of corporate \nirresponsibility and corporate greed, the Florida pension fund for the \nFlorida retirement system had a loss of $335 million--more losses than \nany other State--from Enron stock purchases, and that the money \nmanagers of that Florida pension fund, which covers all of the public \nsector retirees in Florida--the money managers kept buying Enron stock, \nbased on the assertions from the company's management that everything \nwas OK, that doesn't surprise us either, does it?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No surprise. I am afraid that the public, having lost so \nmuch of its pension money, is disgusted but no longer surprised.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The management said everything was OK, but it \nwas not OK. While the stock was dropping like a rock, but not before \nthe company's management had unloaded their shares, the money managers \nwere buying that stock as it dropped like a rock, and it caused to a \ndozen or so pension funds, retirement systems, public pension funds in \nthis country over a billion dollars in losses. My State had the most \nlosses of $335 million.\n  So we have seen in the last year and a half corporate abuses of \nmonumental proportions, and it is time for us to stop it. I am grateful \nto the Senator from Michigan for his leadership in bringing forth the \namendment that he has described, which is basically going to give some \nadditional teeth to the Securities and Exchange Commission to cause \ndisclosure and to cause some hurt when these corporate managers, \nmotivated and operated by greed, cross the line.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I very much thank the Senator from Florida for his \ncomments\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\nand his questions, and also for the active role he has taken in shaping \nthis language. He has identified the feeble nature of the fine \nstructure that we have in the current law. We have some ruthless people \nout there who have lined their own pockets in violation not only of law \nand regulation, but of any code of morality and fiduciary duty. We have \nsome ruthless people.\n  We also have some toothless laws. The SEC, when it has to go to court \nto impose a civil fine, is put through hoops that other regulatory \nagencies are not put through. They can impose civil fines \nadministratively--always subject to an appeal by the respondent or the \ndefendant. But they have the capability to seek civil fines \nadministratively--these other agencies. I have given examples of some \nof them. But when it comes to the SEC--outside of the brokers, where \nthe SEC has that power--they have to go through the cumbersome \nproceedings of going to court.\n  Now, we have cured some of this already in the bill. When it comes to \nthe removal from office, yesterday we took action to give the SEC the \nability to act administratively and to order the removal of directors \nor executives from office. What we didn't do yet, and what this \namendment does, is add a critical component to regulatory \neffectiveness, which is the ability to impose civil fines \nadministratively.\n  This is what the administration said in supporting the grant to the \nSEC of the power to remove directors from office, which we have now \nalready done. It says that if we didn't do that--and now I am quoting \nthe Statement of Administration Policy:\n\n       It would continue to require the SEC to expand significant \n     time and resources in order to attempt to gain similar relief \n     in the Federal courts.\n\n  That is what we are talking about now with civil fines.\n  If we do not adopt this amendment, if we do not give the SEC these \nenforcement tools that other agencies have relative to directors and \nauditors, we will be requiring the SEC to be wasting time and wasting \nresources that they otherwise should be using to chase these corrupt \nand immoral people.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The distinguished Senator from Michigan has \nlaid out how this amendment will give stronger enforcement measures to \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. We have a saying in the South: \nIt is beyond me. It is beyond me why there are other people in this \nChamber, when confronted with such corporate and auditor misconduct, \nwould not want to strengthen the law to prevent and punish such \ncorporate abuse.\n  Does the senior Senator from Michigan have any idea why people would \noppose us trying to strengthen existing law and, indeed, strengthen the \nunderlying bill?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am hopeful there will be broad support for this \namendment, just for the reason the Senator from Florida gives. There \nshould be. This is not novel. This capability of imposing civil fines \nadministratively belongs to other regulatory agencies. The protection \nis always an appeal to the court, but without this tool, the SEC has a \nweaker capability. They are not in a position then to do what other \nenforcement agencies can do in the face of some of the worst deception \nthis country has ever seen--the deception which is now unfolding in too \nmuch of corporate America.\n  This is of the worst attack on our system we have seen. It is \nunfolding in front of our eyes, and the SEC should be given the powers \nto deter it or punish it--all the power.\n  We want the court to be able to review administrative actions. I \nthink most Members of this body do not want any administrative agency \nto be able to act without court review if they are excessive or if they \nare wrong. I think most of us believe in that. I believe in that. But I \nalso believe an administrative agency has to have enforcement tools.\n  We have given the SEC some additional tools in the last few days. \nSenator Leahy and Senator Lott, for instance, in the criminal law area, \ntoughened the criminal penalties, and the SEC now has the capability to \nimpose fines against the stockbroker, although they are pitifully \nsmall.\n  Our amendment would include directors, corporate executives, and \nauditors in the purview of the SEC power to act administratively and \nwould toughen the fines so they would be far more realistic and could \nhave some deterrent effect. The current fine structure against a \nlimited class of people is useless; it is toothless.\n  This is a huge gap in the bill before us. This is a terrific bill, by \nthe way, and I do not want anything I say to suggest otherwise. The \nBanking Committee has given the Senate, and hopefully the country--if \nwe can get some support for it from the administration and if it can \nget through conference--the Banking Committee has come up with a very \nstrong law. We have strengthened it so far on the floor.\n  This amendment will strengthen it further by filling a gap that \nexists in the toolbox. It is the missing tool in the toolbox of \nenforcement capabilities that the SEC should have.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator's timing is just uncanny. We need \nlook back no further than to yesterday when the stock market dropped \nalmost 300 points, all the way down close to 8,800, the stock market \nbeing a reflection of the confidence of the American people in their \ninvestments in public corporations. Lo and behold, that confidence is \nsinking, and the American people need some greater sense of confidence \nthat, indeed, they will not be hoodwinked, that they will not be fooled \nby greedy corporate executives or greedy auditors who blur the lines on \nwhat their auditing duties ought to be and instead get in bed with \nthose who would mismanage the finances of a corporation. The people of \nAmerica who invest their hard-earned dollars ought to have the \nconfidence that when they see the financial reports, those financial \nreports are accurate. That confidence is not there, and we saw it \nyesterday in the reaction of the people in their purchases and sales in \nthe stock market.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for his timeliness in trying to put \nsome teeth in the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nto give greater confidence to the Joe and Jane Citizen of America who \ninvest their money because they want to invest in the future of their \ncountry and they need to do it and know they are getting accurate \nfigures. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. President, I wish to expand for one moment on the question of the \nnotice provision in our amendment.\n  As I indicated before, where there are allegations that officers, \ndirectors of companies are misusing the accounting rules and abusing \ntheir powers, the SEC has to be able to look at financial records \nwithout giving the account holder an opportunity to move funds or to \nchange accounts or to further muddy the investigative waters. Other \nagencies have that power, and this agency must have that power.\n  We have carefully circumscribed that power in a number of ways. We \nhave not just simply said you can subpoena any documents you want. We \nhave criteria for doing that or else they have to give notice.\n  One of the criteria is that it has to be an official investigation \nthat has been ordered by the Commission. That is an important \nsafeguard. This is not just the beginning of an investigation. This is \nnot during a discovery process. This is where the Securities and \nExchange Commission has initiated an official investigation, which is a \nvery formal act on the part of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  At that point, they should be able to subpoena documents under \ncertain circumstances. These are the circumstances that we set forth in \nthe amendment:\n  If the Commission so directs in its subpoena, no financial \ninstitution or officer, director, partner, employee, shareholder, \nrepresentative or agent can directly or indirectly disclose that \nrecords have been requested or provided in accordance with subparagraph \n(A).\n  In other words, you cannot disclose to the subject of the \ninvestigation that you, as a financial institution, have been \nsubpoenaed for those records if the Commission finds reason to believe \nthat such disclosure may--and then we set forth the rules, and the \nrules are intended to make sure that the Commission can act after it \nhas announced or\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\ndetermined there should be an official investigation but does not want \nto risk that the subject of the investigation is going to remove \ndocuments or remove money or hide assets.\n  So we set forth the protections, and they are: If the Commission \nfinds reason to believe that disclosing the fact of the official \ninvestigation to the subject of that investigation by a financial \ninstitution would, one, result in the transfer of assets or records \noutside of the territorial limits of the United States. So if the \nCommission says, hey, we have reason to believe if that person is \nnotified in advance of those records being obtained by us or if there \nis a delay in our obtaining records that person may transfer assets or \nrecords outside of the United States, there could be nondisclosure.\n  The second criteria which, if it exists, would permit this to happen \nis if the disclosure would result in improper conversion of investor \nassets.\n  The third cause for the requirement that there be nondisclosure is \nthat if such disclosure would impede the ability of the Commission to \nidentify, trace, or freeze funds involved in any securities \ntransaction. That speaks for itself.\n  The fourth way in which nondisclosure would be permitted is that if \nit endangers the life or physical safety of an individual. If the \nCommission has reason to believe the life or physical safety of an \nindividual would be compromised by disclosure, surely we ought to not \nrequire disclosure.\n  Fifth, if it results in flight from prosecution, if they have reason \nto believe that could happen, or if the Commission has reason to \nbelieve that the disclosure may result in destruction of or tampering \nwith evidence, or if such disclosure may result in intimidation of \npotential witnesses or otherwise seriously jeopardize an investigation \nor unduly delay a trial.\n  Those are carefully set forth reasons for why disclosure should not \nbe required. These are similar to what other agencies have in terms of \npowers, and it seems to me with this careful delineation of this \nsubpoena power that we should surely give the Securities and Exchange \nCommission that power.\n  Again, staff has given the reasons for the importance of that \namendment, and I hope that reasoning of the SEC staff would be \npersuasive on this body. We have to give the SEC some administrative \nauthority to impose civil fines. It would provide a tool that is now \nmissing from the toolbox. It would add this tool, this weapon, to their \narsenal. Without this weapon in their arsenal, they still have one hand \ntied behind their back. Without this amendment, they do not have the \nsame administrative authority that other agencies have.\n  Given the environment we are in, that we must use all legitimate \nmeans to put an end to the abuses and the deceptions of too many of our \ncorporate leaders, corporate executives, corporate directors, and \nauditors, we must surely bring our laws up to date in terms of the \npowers we give to the SEC, and in terms of the civil fines we authorize \nthem to impose, always subject to an appeal to the courts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, some of my colleagues change positions on \nissues like privacy so quickly that it gives me whiplash, and I will \nget to that point. I do not know how many people have seen the movie \n``Minority Report.'' If you have not, I want to tell you the story. I \nnever thought I would see a real-life example of what happens in this \nmovie, but I have found one right here on the floor of the Senate.\n  In the movie ``Minority Report,'' you have a cop who has almost \nsupernatural powers, and his job is to arrest people before they commit \na crime. It starts with three people, two guys who naturally do not \nhave very much ESP, and then you have this lady, who naturally is quite \nattractive, who has these massive powers of ESP. They visualize crimes \nthat are going to happen, their brain waves activate a computer, and \nthen it prints out what they are seeing. They see crimes happening that \nhave not yet occurred.\n  The action in the movie begins with a guy finding his wife in bed \nwith another man. The husband is obviously a nice guy--probably an \naccountant--and he is leaving his house. His wife seems so eager for \nhim to leave, he figures out something is going on. He is sort of an \nold, balding fellow and as he is leaving, he misses his bus. While he \nis waiting for the next bus, a young guy comes in and walks in his \nfront door. Needless to say, the husband is upset about it. (Who \nwouldn't be upset about it? No one would want that to happen to them or \nanybody they knew.) So the husband goes in and he is sort of in shock. \nHe finds himself in the bedroom, sitting by the bed. He goes crazy, and \npicks up a pair of scissors.\n  At this point, the computer system (hooked up to the people with ESP) \nalerts this superwarrior for law enforcement that there is about to be \na murder. He jumps in this sort of minijet that flies fast and stops on \na dime. The officer zooms in--have you seen this movie, Senator \nMcCain?--and just as the guy is getting ready to stab his wife, the \nofficer grabs the knife, puts the handcuffs on the husband, takes him \noff and they put him in prison for murder.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield? That is a better description than \nthe movie was.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Now, I thought, the whole thing is sort of a moral \nquestion: Were these people really going to commit these crimes? They \nput them in prison for life. They put them in these metal cylinders and \nwired them up to control their brain waves. It is not very pleasant. So \nthe question is, Do you have a right to do this to people who have not \nyet committed a crime simply because some person with extrasensory \nperception said it was going to happen?\n  That is what the movie is about. It is a big hit movie. It made over \n$100 million the first week. It sounds silly when I tell it, but they \ngot $100 million and I am giving this speech.\n  In any case, I thought, what an absurd plot. Who in the world could \never believe--this is the U.S. of A, by the way. This movie is off in \nthe future.\n  Why would we ever have a law under which people can be punished for \nwhat they might do? Is that absurd? Can anybody believe that would \nhappen? If you think not, you are wrong.\n  Let me read from this amendment. This is in general. It is talking \nabout authority of the Commission to assess monetary penalties. This is \nfrom the amendment that is pending.\n\n       In general, in any cease and desist proceedings under \n     subsection A, the commission may impose a civil monetary \n     penalty if it finds on the record, after notice and \n     opportunity of hearing, that a person is violating, has \n     violated, or is about to violate or has been or will be the \n     cause of violation.\n\n  Senator Levin is going to fine people because we are concluding that \nthey are about to do something before they have done it. Or that they \n``will be'' the cause of a violation.\n\n  I submit, first of all, this is not from the SEC. The SEC has not \nasked for this provision. This is from staff at the SEC--maybe ``a'' \nstaff person, for all I know.\n  The point is, do we really want to say we are going to penalize \npeople because they are about to violate the law or we believe they are \ngoing to? How can you tell? How are you going to tell that they will be \nthe cause of a violation? I submit that is a standard I am unaware has \never existed. If so, I didn't know about it or I would have tried to \nchange it.\n  Let me mention a second problem. The second problem has to do with \nfinancial records. Correct me, my colleague on the Banking Committee, \nif somehow I have fallen into a time warp and am in a different world \nthan last year. Was it not last year we were going to shut down the \nInternet, we were going to put people in prison for putting out your \nmailing address or for mailing you a letter where someone could read \nyour address off of it and go murder you? Were we not just in this time \nwarp where privacy was the be-all and end-all of society?\n  I get whiplash, we change positions so often.\n  Let me state what the current law is and then read what Senator Levin \nis proposing. The current law is the following: The SEC and other \nFederal agencies have the power to get your financial records, and they \ncan do it through administrative subpoena or judicial subpoena.\n  Now, normally there is one little inconvenience. Normally, they have \nto tell you they have taken your financial\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\nrecords. Not an unreasonable thing, it would seem to me, if this is \nstill America. But we are talking about business people here, and there \nis a different standard. Two consenting adults can engage in any \nactivity other than commerce, with full constitutional protection, but \nif they engage in job creation or wealth creation, they stand naked \nbefore the world in terms of any rights whatever.\n  Under current law, the Government can come in and take your financial \nrecords, but they have to tell you they have done it--``except.'' And \nthere are three reasons they can do it without telling you. I think we \nall would say they make reasonably good sense. They can not tell you if \nthey have reason to believe that there is going to be a flight from \nprosecution; or if they believe there is going to be destruction of or \ntampering with evidence; or if telling you would otherwise seriously \njeopardize an investigation of official proceedings, or unduly delay a \ntrial of an ongoing official process.\n  That is the current law. What is unreasonable about that? If the \nGovernment believes someone is doing something wrong, they can come in \nand take their records. Unless they believe there is going to be a \nflight from prosecution or there will be tampering with evidence or it \nwill jeopardize the investigation, they have to tell you they took the \nrecords. That is not unreasonable. But if they believe any of these \nthings to be the case, they can go in and take your records and not \ntell you.\n  Now, what does the amendment of the Senator from Michigan do? It says \nnotwithstanding--that is always dangerous--notwithstanding sections \n1105 or 1107 of the Right To Financial Privacy Act of 1978--that law \nhas been around here a long time. But notwithstanding it, which means \nthrow it out, the Commission may obtain access to and copies of or \ninformation contained in financial records of any person held by a \nfinancial institution, including financial records of a customer, \nwithout notice to that person.\n  If you think someone is going to flee prosecution or destroy evidence \nor that will jeopardize an ongoing investigation, maybe we would accept \nthe limits of our individual liberty. But under the Levin amendment, \nyou don't have to find any of those things. The government doesn't have \nto find that any of those circumstances is the case to be able to go in \nand take financial records.\n\n  Since this bill is a bill that amends our securities laws and our \nfinancial laws, this bill falls under this jurisdiction. So what this \nliterally means is that a government agency, without ever going to the \ncourthouse, could come and take all of your financial records--your \nbanking records, your investment records, any financial records you \nhave or have ever had--and without finding that there is any risk that \nyou are going to flee from justice or destroy evidence or jeopardize an \ninvestigation, they can take them and not tell you about it.\n  There is a limit, it seems to me, to the logic in this case. If the \nSenator had an amendment that simply raised these fines for people who \nare criminals, that would be an amendment I could support. It shows how \nfar we have flown from reality when we are talking about penalizing \npeople because they are ``about'' to violate the law; or that ``will \nbe'' the cause of a violation.\n  It is very hard to know when someone is going to violate the law. I \nhave not yet gotten any kickback, I am not a stockholder even, I don't \nthink I have received a contribution from the PAC of the people who \nmade the movie I've described--though if they had any decency, they \nwould have contributed to my campaign over the years. But if you watch \nthis movie, you are going to see what the problem with the Levin \namendment is.\n  The problem with the Levin amendment, as it turns out, is these \npsychics are not always right, and they don't always agree. Sometimes \nthere is a ``Minority Report.'' The superwarrior cop discovers this. It \nturns out they try to frame him for a murder. A good movie. I recommend \nseeing it.\n  In any case, I am opposed to this amendment. It is a thick amendment. \nThere are a lot of things in it. There are some things in it that I \nsupport. But I do not support penalizing people for what you think they \nare going to do. I do not support taking people's financial records \nwithout telling them about it. It sounds to me as if somebody at the \nSEC has got the idea that maybe they are living in a different era in a \ndifferent country and they are saying: Look, if we didn't have to fool \nwith civil liberties, if we could get rid of the Bill of Rights, we \ncould be a more effective law enforcement agency. If we could arrest \npeople we think are going to violate the law, we could be more \nefficient. We don't live in that country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me assure my good friend from \nTexas that I have seen ``Minority Report.''\n  Mr. GRAMM. You have?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Then you got the idea from it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As a matter of fact, I got the idea for the protections we \nwrite in here from ``Minority Report'' just because, as a tribute to \nthe protections and civil liberties that are defended and protected in \n``Minority Report,'' I had to be absolutely certain we would put these \nprotections in our bill, to make sure that only if there were reason to \nbelieve a transfer of assets was going to go outside of the United \nStates, or there would be conversion of assets, or it would endanger \nthe life or physical safety of an individual, or result in flight from \nprosecution--those very criteria, carefully delineated, that are a \ntribute to the civil liberties and protections and privacy rights in \nthis country to which my good friend from Texas just referred.\n  I can assure my good friend from Texas, the lesson of ``Minority \nReport'' is carefully reflected in this amendment. I saw that because I \nknew the Senator from Texas was going to raise that movie. With that \nkind of foresight, I decided, knowing just how he does this so \nbeautifully on the floor of the Senate, I had better see ``Minority \nReport.'' That is why I want to assure the Senator from Texas that \nthese very protections which he is so careful to delineate are in fact \nset forth in this amendment. We have these criteria laid out in this \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I don't want to take away from the seriousness of the \ndebate, but I haven't seen ``Minority Report.'' I have seen ``Big Fat \nGreek Wedding,'' and I would recommend that.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. It sounds as if I have not been doing too much else, but I \nhave also seen that--since we are giving testimonials to movies here.\n  The language to which the Senator from Texas objects, about \npenalizing people for what they are going to do--that is language which \nthe good Senator from Texas, as chairman and ranking member of the \nBanking Committee, has overseen for years. That is the same language \nthat currently exists in the SEC law. We are not adding anything new \nhere. This is the SEC law, section 77(h)(1): Cease and desist \nproceeding, authority of the Commission.\n  If the Commission finds after notice and opportunity for a hearing \nthat any person is violating, has violated or is about to violate any \nprovision--\n  That is existing law. The Senator from Texas has overseen that for \nall these years. He has done a brilliant job as chairman and ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee, and we are just simply following the \nlanguage that exists already in the SEC law and applying it to folks \nwho are not now covered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. For a question, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. What the Senator saying is they can issue cease and desist \norders under these circumstances, but they can't fine somebody. You are \nnot only ceasing and desisting them--I have no problem. In the movie--\nand that is where you got this idea from. I thought it was.\n  In the movie, I don't object to them grabbing the guy who is about to \nstab his poor wife. It is putting him in prison, not for attempted \nmurder--he did that--but for killing her when she is not dead.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Texas raises an issue which, I am afraid, \nis also addressed in current law. It is not just cease and desist \norders, it is the implementation of civil fines. We are\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\nfollowing the same language. But what we are saying is, if the SEC has \npower to impose a fine on a broker, based on the standards which exist \nin this law, there is no reason the SEC should not have the same power \nto impose a fine on an auditor or on a director who violates the \nregulations and laws of this land. This is the same language. We \nhaven't added anything new.\n  What is new here is that for the first time there will be the \npotential, the power in the SEC, subject to an appeal to the court--\nwhich is another protection of our civil liberties--subject to an \nappeal to the court, to impose a civil fine, administratively, on \npeople who are now let off the hook. There is no reason for this gap in \nthe law.\n  If, in fact, there is a problem that the Senator has raised, with \nlanguage, that language is in the existing law for SEC. It is in the \nexisting law for FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation:\n\n       If, in the opinion of the appropriate Federal banking \n     agency, any insured depository institution, depository \n     institution which has insured deposits, or any institution \n     affiliated party is engaged or has engaged, or the agency has \n     reasonable cause to believe that the depository institution \n     or any institution affiliated party is about to engage--\n\n  The words which the Senator from Texas mocks are in existing law, in \nthe FDIC law, in the SEC law.\n  There may be reasons the Senator wants to maintain this gap in \nenforcement, but that cannot be used as the reason. That cannot be \nused.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n               Motion To Recommit With Amendment No. 4270\n\n  (Purpose: To require publicly traded companies to record and treat \n  stock options as expenses when granted for purposes of their income \n                              statements)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to recommit the bill to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs with instructions to \nreport the bill back forthwith, with the following amendment that I \nsend to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) moves to recommit the \n     bill (S. 2673) to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n     Affairs, with instructions to report back forthwith with the \n     following amendment, numbered 4270:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . STOCK OPTIONS MUST BE BOOKED AS EXPENSE WHEN GRANTED.\n\n       Any corporation that grants a stock option to an officer or \n     employee to purchase a publicly traded security in the United \n     States shall record the granting of the option as an expense \n     in that corporation's income statement for the year in which \n     the option is granted.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4271\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. REID], for Mr. Edwards, for \n     himself, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4271 to the instructions of the motion to recommit \n     S. 2673 to the Committee on Banking.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object. I would like to hear what the amendment says.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to \nread the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I will be happy to have it read, but it \nis the exact same amendment that was pending beforehand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To address rules of professional responsibility for \n                               attorneys)\n\n       At the end of the instructions add the following:\n       ``(c) Rules of Professional Responsibility for Attorneys.--\n     Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     section, the Commission shall establish rules, in the public \n     interest and for the protection of investors, setting forth \n     minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys \n     appearing and practicing before the Commission in any way in \n     the representation of public companies, including a rule \n     requiring an attorney to report evidence of a material \n     violation of securities law or breach of fiduciary duty or \n     similar violation by the company or any agent thereof to the \n     chief legal counsel or the chief executive officer of the \n     company (or the equivalent thereof) and, if the counsel or \n     officer does not appropriately respond to the evidence \n     (adopting as necessary, appropriate remedial measures or \n     sanctions with respect to the violation), requiring the \n     attorney to report the evidence to the audit committee of the \n     board of directors, or to another committee of the board of \n     directors comprised solely of directors not employed directly \n     or indirectly by the company, or to the board of directors.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4272 To Amendment No. 4271\n\n (Purpose: To address procedures for banning certain individuals from \n serving as officers or directors of publicly traded companies, civil \n  money penalties, obtaining financial records, broadened enforcement \n           authority, and forfeiture of bonuses and profits)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a second amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. REID], for Mr. Levin, for \n     himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Corzine, and \n     Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 4272 to amendment \n     No. 4271.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator \nfrom Arizona. There are other ways we could have gotten to the point we \nare now. This just made it a lot easier. I appreciate that very much.\n  I say this, before I yield the floor, to my friend from Arizona. We \nare now in the exact same posture we were in prior to the Senator from \nArizona offering his amendment--his instructions, I should say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Nevada leaves the \nfloor, I wonder if he would respond to a question. Do we intend to vote \non these pending amendments and the motion to recommit?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we have been trying very hard. I have \nreceived instructions--it is probably the wrong word, but Senator \nEdwards has been here for 2 days, and he left here for a while this \nafternoon waiting to vote on his amendment. Senator Levin has been here \nfor several days--2 days. We would like very badly to vote on the Levin \nsecond-degree amendment and the Edwards first-degree amendment.\n  I have spoken to the manager of the bill for the minority. It appears \nvery unlikely that we are going to be able to do that. I think that is \na disappointment. I think some of these relevant--I shouldn't say \nsome--I think all of these relevant amendments we can get up to prior \nto the cloture vote, we should try to dispose of.\n  But I understand the rules of the Senate. I am disappointed to say, \nmy friend from Texas also understands them, so even though I would like \nvotes, it does not appear we are going to be able to have votes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada for his \ncandor. I think it is pretty obvious. Everybody ought to understand \nwhat is happening as we go through these arcane procedures.\n  The whole purpose of this--the whole purpose of what we just went \nthrough--is to not have a vote on anything that has to do with stock \noptions. Let's be very clear what that is all about.\n  Whatever side you are on on the issue, the fix is in, as we say all \ntoo often in the sport of boxing. The fix is in and we will now have \ncloture invoked and there will not be a vote on stock options.\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\n  While my friend from Nevada is still here, I can tell him, I \nunderstand the rules of the Senate. I have been through other difficult \nissues on which I have been blocked from getting votes. I tell my \nfriend from Nevada, and all of my colleagues, we will have a vote on \nstock options. We will have--sooner or later--a vote on stock options. \nAnd I only regret that we cannot do it now, get it over with, and get \neverybody on record.\n  I also would make one additional comment. I hope I do not harm the \nfeelings of any of my colleagues. This is an important issue. This is a \nvery important issue, no matter where you stand on the issue of stock \noptions and how they should be accounted. It is a very important issue.\n  Why is it that this body would not take up the issue and have an up-\nor-down vote on how stock options are treated? I would ask the manager \nof the bill, why would we not at least allow a vote up or down?\n  I will read editorials. In fact, it may be sometime before I give up \nthe floor because I have a lot to say about this issue. I will read \nfrom Mr. Greenspan's speech, a fairly widely respected individual, who \nsays--well, I will read his speech in just a minute. He is in favor of \ntreating stock options as an expense.\n  So is Mr. Stiglitz and Mr. Buffett, and so many others, who are aware \nof this issue and its impact and the way it has been terribly abused by \nthe same people we are trying to go after, the same people we are \nafter.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a response to his question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. According to a recent analysis from 1996 to 2000, Enron \nissued nearly $600 million in stock options, collecting tax deductions, \nwhich allowed the corporation to severely reduce their payment in \ntaxes. According to reports that I think I have here, over $1 billion \nin stock options were issued to the senior executives of WorldCom.\n  This is an important issue. I respect the views of my colleagues who \ndisagree with my position and that of Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Stiglitz, and \nMr. Buffett in various op-eds and editorials in newspapers throughout \nAmerica. But why would we not vote on it? That is the question.\n  Why would the distinguished Senator and friend from Nevada feel it \nincumbent upon himself to not allow a vote on stock options? I guess \nthat question can be answered by observers.\n  But here is the deal. I want to tell my friend from Nevada again, \nthere will be a vote on how stock options are treated. I will repeat \nthe amendment. I will repeat the amendment and will repeat it again \nseveral times before I finish discussing this issue. The issue, no \nmatter how you feel, should be addressed. But through the invocation of \ncloture, everybody knows that the amendment and the motion to recommit \nwill fall.\n  I want to repeat. The amendment is fairly clear-cut, fairly simple. \nWe deal with a lot of arcane issues in the discussion of this \nregulatory reform. But I repeat:\n\n       Any corporation that grants a stock option to an officer or \n     employee to purchase a publicly traded security in the United \n     States shall record the granting of the option as an expense \n     in that corporation's income statement for the year in which \n     the option is granted.\n\n  It is very simple. It does not say anything about the tax treatment \nof it. It does not say anything about a number of other rather \ncontroversial aspects. It just says it will ``record the granting of \nthe option as an expense in that corporation's income statement. . . . \n''\n  Mr. President, it is curious to me--actually, it is not curious to \nme--why a vote on this amendment is blocked. It is because every \nlobbyist in this town for the high-tech community has said: Don't do \nit. Don't do it. The one thing that the folks in Silicon Valley are \nscared of more than anything else is that they would lose their \nprecious stock options--all of it, of course, in the interest of the \nemployee, only the employees, the secretaries, the workers, those \npeople who are down there toiling in the bowels of the corporation, \ntrying to get some incentive to stay there and have their retirement.\n  Meanwhile, Mr. Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, last year, cashes in $706 \nmillion worth of stock options, $706 million worth of stock options in \n1 year. Are we going to vote on it? Yes, we will vote on it. Maybe not \nnow, but unless there is cloture on every single bill that comes before \nthis body, there will be a vote on stock options. I want to assure my \nfriend from Nevada of that.\n\n  I will just remind him, there were many who wanted to block a vote on \ncampaign finance reform for a long period of time. Well, we got our \nvote on campaign finance reform, and we will get a vote on stock \noptions.\n  We have to end the double standard for stock options. Currently \ncorporations can hide these multimillion-dollar compensation plans from \ntheir stockholders or other investors because these plans are not \ncounted as an expense when calculating company earnings.\n  I want to make it perfectly clear to all, I am not in favor of doing \naway with stock options. Stock options have a valuable place in \nAmerican corporate life. What we are addressing here is how they are \ntreated so investors can know exactly what the profit and loss of a \ncorporation is.\n  I repeat: I am not in favor of eliminating stock options. What I am \ntrying to do is exactly in accordance with Mr. Greenspan's comments \nfrom which I will quote. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, New \nYork University, March 26, 2002:\n\n       Some changes, however, appear overdue. In principle, stock-\n     option grants, properly constructed, can be highly effective \n     in aligning corporate officers' incentives with those of \n     shareholders. Regrettably, the current accounting for options \n     has created some perverse effects on the quality of corporate \n     disclosures that, arguably, is further complicating the \n     evaluation of earnings and hence diminishing the \n     effectiveness of published income statements in supporting \n     good corporate governance. The failure to include the value \n     of most stock-option grants as employee compensation and, \n     hence, to subtract them from pretax profits has increased \n     reported earnings and presumably stock prices. This would be \n     the case even if offsets for expired, unexercised options \n     were made. The Financial Accounting Standards Board proposed \n     to require expensing in the early to middle 1990s but \n     abandoned the proposal in the face of significant political \n     pressure.\n       The Federal Reserve staff estimates that the substitution \n     of unexpensed option grants for cash compensation added about \n     2\\1/2\\ percentage points to reported annual growth in \n     earnings of our larger corporations between 1995 and 2000. \n     Many argue that this distortion to reported earnings growth \n     contributed to a misallocation of capital investment, \n     especially in high tech firms.\n\n  Especially in high-tech firms? Where is most of the opposition coming \nfrom to the proper accounting of stock options? From the high-tech \nfirms. I repeat:\n\n       Many argue that this distortion to reported earnings growth \n     contributed to a misallocation of capital investment, \n     especially in high tech firms. If market participants indeed \n     have been misled, that, in itself, should be surprising, for \n     there is little mystery about the effect of stock-option \n     grants on earnings reported to shareholders. Accounting rules \n     require enough data on option grants be reported in footnotes \n     to corporate financial statements to enable analysts to \n     calculate reasonable estimates of their effect on earnings.\n       Some have argued that Black-Scholes option pricing, the \n     prevailing means of estimating option expense, is \n     approximate. But so is a good deal of other \n     earnings estimates, as I indicated earlier. Moreover, \n     every other corporation does report an implicit estimate \n     of option expense on its income statement. That number for \n     most, of course, is zero. Are option grants truly without \n     any value?\n\n  I repeat Mr. Greenspan's question: Are option grants truly without \nany value?\n\n       Critics of option expensing have also argued that expensing \n     will make raising capital more difficult. But expensing is \n     only a bookkeeping transaction. Nothing real is changed in \n     the actual operations or cash-flow of the corporation. If \n     investors are dissuaded by lower reported earnings as a \n     result of expensing, it means only that they were less \n     informed than they should have been. Capital employed on the \n     basis of misinformation is likely to be capital misused.\n       Critics of expensing also argue that the availability of \n     options enables corporations to attract more-productive \n     employees. That may well be true. But option expensing in no \n     way precludes the issuance of options. To be sure, lower \n     reported earnings as a result of expensing could temper stock \n     price increases and thereby exacerbate the effects of share \n     dilution. That, presumably, would inhibit option issuance. \n     But again, that inhibition would be appropriate, because it \n     would reflect the correction of misinformation.\n\n  I am not sure this debate is between me and the high-tech community. \nI think the debate is somewhat different. When you look at the \npreponderance of opinion, not only that stock options need to be \nexpensed but the incredible effect that it has had on the whole \ndistortion of the market, then it is an important issue.\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\n  I ask again: How can we really address the entire issue we are facing \nwithout addressing the issue of stock options? That is like playing a \nbaseball game without third base.\n  Mr. Joseph Stiglitz, noble laureate professor of economics at \nColumbia University on Tuesday, March 12, 2002:\n\n       Some contend that it is difficult to obtain an accurate \n     measure of the value of the options. But this much is clear: \n     zero, the implicit value assigned under current arrangements, \n     is clearly wrong. And leaving it to footnotes, to be sorted \n     out by investors, is not an adequate response, as the Enron \n     case has brought home so clearly. At the Council of Economic \n     Advisers, we devised a formula that represented a far more \n     accurate lower bound estimate of the value of the options \n     than zero. Moreover, many firms use formulae for their own \n     purposes, in valuing stock options (charging them against \n     particular divisions of the firm). However, Treasury, in its \n     opposition to the FASB concerns, was singularly uninterested \n     in these alternatives. I leave it to others to hypothesize \n     why that might have been the case.\n       If we are to have a stock market in which investors are to \n     have confidence, if we are to have a stock market which \n     avoids the kind of massive misallocation of resources that \n     result when information provided does not accurately report \n     the true condition of firms, we must have accounting and \n     regulatory frameworks that address these issues. As \n     derivatives and other techniques of financial engineering \n     become more common, these problems too will become more \n     pervasive. While headlines and journalistic accounts describe \n     some of the inequities--those who have seen their pensions \n     disappear as corporate executives have stashed away millions \n     for themselves--what is also at stake is the long run well \n     being of our economy. The problems of Enron and Global \n     Crossing are part and parcel of the current downturn.\n\n  I was under the impression this legislation was all about trust and \ntransparency--regaining the trust of the American people and investors \nin the stock market and, frankly, the economic system that drives \nAmerica and has been so successful, and transparent. Perhaps under this \nlegislation, by beefing up many of the penalties and regulations and \nmany other things--many of which I have recommended and strongly \nsupported and will have in further amendments, but how in the world do \nwe say that we have given transparency when, in the view of most \nexperts, this is one of the greatest hindrances to transparency in the \nsystem as it exists today?\n  I would now like to read the opinion of Mr. Warren Buffett, in the \nWashington Post, April 9, 2002, Stock Options and Common Sense:\n\n       In 1994 seven slim accounting experts, all intelligent and \n     experienced, unanimously decided that stock options granted \n     to a company's employees were a corporate expense.\n\n       Six fat CPAs, with similar credentials, unanimously \n     declared these grants were no such thing.\n       Can it really be that girth, rather than intellect, \n     determines one's accounting principles? Yes indeed, in this \n     case. Obesity--of a monetary sort--almost certainly explained \n     the split vote.\n       The seven proponents of expense recognition were the \n     members of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, who \n     earned $313,000 annually. Their six adversaries were the \n     managing partners of the (then) Big Six accounting firms, who \n     were raking in multiples of the pay received by their public-\n     interest brethren.\n       In this duel the Big Six were prodded by corporate CEOs, \n     who fought ferociously to bury the huge and growing cost of \n     options, in order to keep their reported earnings \n     artificially high. And in the pre-Enron world of client-\n     influenced accounting, their auditors were only too happy to \n     lend their support.\n       The members of Congress decided to adjudicate the fight--\n     who, after all, could be better equipped to evaluate \n     accounting standards?--and then watched as corporate CEOs and \n     their auditors stormed the Capitol. These forces simply blew \n     away the opposition. By an 88-9 vote, U.S. senators made a \n     number of their largest campaign contributors ecstatic by \n     declaring option grants to be expense-free. Darwin could have \n     foreseen this result: It was survival of the fattest.\n       The argument, it should be emphasized, was not about the \n     use of options. Companies could then, as now, compensate \n     employees in any manner they wished. They could use cash, \n     cars, trips to Hawaii or options as rewards--whatever they \n     felt would be most effective in motivating employees.\n       But those other forms of compensation had to be recorded as \n     an expense, whereas options--which were, and still are, \n     awarded in wildly disproportionate amounts to the top dogs--\n     simply weren't counted.\n       The CEOs wanting to keep it that way put forth several \n     arguments. One was that options are hard to value. This is \n     nonsense: I've bought and sold options for 40 years and know \n     their pricing to be highly sophisticated. It's far more \n     problematic to calculate the useful life of machinery, a \n     difficulty that makes the annual depreciation charge merely a \n     guess. No one, however, argues that this imprecision does \n     away with a company's need to record depreciation expense. \n     Likewise, pension expense in corporate America is calculated \n     under widely varying assumptions, and CPAs regularly allow \n     whatever assumption management picks.\n       Believe me, CEOs know what their option grants are worth. \n     That's why they fight for them.\n       It's also argued that options should not lead to a \n     corporate expense being recorded because they do not involve \n     a cash outlay by the company. But neither do grants of \n     restricted stock cause cash to be disbursed--and yet the \n     value of such grants is routinely expensed.\n       Furthermore, there is a hidden, but very real, cash cost to \n     a company when it issues options. If my company, Berkshire, \n     were to give me a 10-year option on 1,000 shares of A stock \n     at today's market price, it would be compensating me with an \n     asset that has a cash value of at least $20 million--an \n     amount the company could receive today if it sold a similar \n     option in the marketplace. Giving an employee something that \n     alternatively could be sold for hard cash has the same \n     consequences for a company as giving him cash. Incidentally, \n     the day an employee receives an option, he can engage in \n     various market maneuvers that will deliver him immediate \n     cash, even if the market price of his company's stock is \n     below the option's exercise price.\n       Finally, those against expensing of options advance what I \n     would call the ``useful fairy-tale'' argument. They say that \n     because the country needs young, innovative companies, many \n     of which are large issuers of options, it would harm the \n     national interest to call option compensation as expense and \n     thereby penalize the ``earnings'' of these budding \n     enterprises.\n       Why, then, require cash compensation to be recorded as an \n     expense given that it, too, penalizes earnings of young, \n     promising companies? Indeed, why not have these companies \n     issue options in place of cash for utility and rent \n     payments--and then pretend that these expenses, as well, \n     don't exist? Berkshire will be happy to received options in \n     lieu of cash for many of the goods and services that we sell \n     corporate America.\n       At Berkshire we frequently buy companies that awarded \n     options to their employees--and then we do away with the \n     option program. When such a company is negotiating a sale to \n     us, its management rightly expects us to proffer a new \n     performance-based cash program to substitute for the option \n     compensation being lost. These managers--and we--have no \n     trouble calculating the cost to the company of the vanishing \n     program. And in making the substitution, of course, we take \n     on a substantial expense, even though the company that was \n     acquired had never recorded a cost for its option program.\n       Companies tell their shareholders that options do more to \n     attract, retain and motivate employees than does cash. I \n     believe that's often true. These companies should keep \n     issuing options. But they also should account for this \n     expense just like any other.\n       A number of senators, led by Carl Levin and John McCain, \n     are now revising the subject of properly accounting for \n     options. They believe that American businesses, large or \n     small, can stand honest reporting, and that after Enron-\n     Andersen, no less will do.\n       I think it is normally unwise for Congress to meddle with \n     accounting standards. In this case, though, Congress fathered \n     an improper standard--and I cheer its return to the crime \n     scene.\n       This time Congress should listen to the slim accountants. \n     The logic behind their thinking is simple.\n       One, if options aren't a form of compensation, what are \n     they?\n       Two, if compensation isn't an expense, what is it?\n       Three, and if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of \n     earnings, where in the world should they go?\n\n  Mr. President, I have to admit to you that I stood fifth from the \nbottom of my class at the Naval Academy. I don't pretend to understand \na lot of the nuances and hidden workings of the stock market or many of \nthe issues we are facing today because there were some very imaginative \nCEOs and corporate officers who have deprived investors of their money \nand hundreds of thousands of people of their jobs. But even I can \nunderstand Mr. Buffett's questions:\n\n       If options aren't a form of compensation, what are they?\n       If compensation isn't an expense, what is it?\n       And if expenses should not go into the calculation of \n     earnings, where in the world should they go?\n\n  Mr. President, that is why this amendment is simple:\n  Any corporation that grants a stock option to an officer or employee \nto purchase a publicly traded security in the United States shall \nrecord the granting of the option as an expense in that corporation's \nincome statement for the year in which the option is granted.\n  That is not a complicated issue, and there will be discussion from \ntime to time about what the tax implications are and all those things. \nI would be glad to have smarter people than I figure it out.\n  I want to read a letter to the editor of the New York Times by Steven \nBarr,\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\nsenior contributing editor of CFO Magazine, April 5, 2002. Reference: \n``Leave Options Alone'' by John Doerr and Frederick W. Smith:\n\n       What if, in the mid-1990s, accounting-rule makers had not \n     caved in to lobbyists and instead had forced companies to \n     recognize options as a compensation expense on financial \n     statements?\n       There would still have been a technology boom, a bear \n     market, and a period of recession. Such cycles are immutable. \n     But there may have been less of the accounting gamesmanship \n     that is now the object of government investigation and \n     investor ire.\n       Options should count as an expense to the corporation, and \n     the ability to exercise them should be based on stock \n     performance that exceeds an index of peers.\n\n  Mr. President, one of the more egregious activities we have seen with \nsome of these really unsavory people has been that while their company \nstock was declining, they exercised their stock options and sold them, \nmaking hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  As I said earlier, in the case of Enron--I heard WorldCom was $1.8 \nbillion, or Enron, I am not sure which--at the same time in the case of \nEnron, the employees, in testimony before the Commerce Committee, said \nthey were urged to hang on to the stock, hang on to the Enron stock. \nMeanwhile, the executives were selling the stock. I do not know of \nanything quite as egregious as that.\n  As I mentioned, according to a recent analysis from 1996 to 2000, \nEnron issued nearly $600 million in stock options, collecting tax \ndeductions which allowed the corporation to severely reduce their \npayment in taxes.\n  I repeat, no other type of compensation gets treated as an expense \nfor tax purposes without also being treated as an expense on the \ncompany books. This double standard is exactly the kind of inequitable \ncorporate benefit that makes the American people irate and must be \neliminated.\n  If companies do not want to fully disclose on their books how much \nthey are compensating their employees, then they should not be able to \nclaim a tax benefit for it.\n  The Washington Post, Thursday, April 18, 2000:\n\n       Alan Greenspan, perhaps the nation's most revered \n     economist, thinks employee stock options should be counted, \n     like salaries, as a company expense. Warren Buffett, perhaps \n     the nation's foremost investor, has long argued the same \n     line. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the expert \n     group that writes accounting rules, reached the same \n     conclusion eight years ago. The London-based International \n     Accounting Standards Board recently recommended the same \n     approach. In short, a rather unshort list of experts endorses \n     the common-sense idea that, whether you get paid in cash or \n     company cars or options, the expense should be recorded. Yet \n     today's Senate Finance Committee hearing on the issue is \n     likely to be filled with dissenting voices. There could \n     hardly be a better gauge of money's power in politics.\n\n  The Washington Post said:\n\n       There could hardly be a better gauge of money's power in \n     politics.\n       Why does this matter? Because the current rules--which \n     allow companies to grant executives and other employees \n     millions of dollars in stock options without recording a dime \n     of expenses--make a mockery of corporate accounts. Companies \n     that grant stock options lavishly can be reporting large \n     profits when the truth is they are taking a large loss. In \n     2000, for example, Yahoo reported a profit of $71 million, \n     but the real number after adjusting for the cost of employee \n     stock options was a loss of $1.3 billion. Cisco reported $4.6 \n     billion in profit; the real number was a $2.7 billion loss.\n\n  Mr. President, those numbers are staggering. Let me repeat:\n\n       Yahoo reported a profit of $71 million, but the real number \n     after adjusting for the cost of employee stock options was a \n     loss of $1.3 billion. Cisco reported $4.6 billion in profits; \n     the real number was a $2.7 billion loss. By reporting make-\n     believe profits, companies may have conned investors into \n     bidding up their stock prices. This is one cause of the \n     Internet bubble, whose bursting helped precipitate last \n     year's economic slowdown.\n       It is not surprising, therefore, that the expert consensus \n     favors treating options as a corporate expense, which would \n     mean that reported earnings might actually reflect reality. \n     But the dissenters are intimidated by neither experts nor \n     logic. They claim that the value of options is uncertain, so \n     they have no idea what number to put into the accounts. But \n     the price of an option can actually be calculated quite \n     precisely, and managers have no difficulty doing the math for \n     purposes of tax reporting. The dissenters also claim options \n     are crucial to the health of young companies. But nobody \n     wants to ban this form of compensation; the goal is merely to \n     have it counted as an expense. Finally, dissenters say that \n     options need not be so counted because granting them involves \n     no cash outlay. But giving employees something that has cash \n     value amounts to giving them cash.\n       The dissenters include weighty figures in both parties. \n     Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Connecticut) is the chief opponent of \n     options sanity in the Senate, and last week President Bush \n     himself declared that Mr. Greenspan is wrong on this issue. \n     What might be behind this? Many of the corporate executives \n     who give generously to politicians are themselves the \n     beneficiaries of options--often to the tune of millions of \n     dollars. High-tech companies, an important source of campaign \n     cash, are fighting options reform with all they've got. But \n     if these lobbyists are allowed to win the argument, they will \n     undermine a key principle of the financial system. Accounting \n     rules are meant to ensure investors get good information. \n     Without good information, they cannot know which companies \n     will best use capital, and the whole economy suffers in the \n     long run.\n\n  Mr. President, again, transparency and trust. Transparency and trust. \nWithout transparency, we are not going to have trust.\n  A Washington Post, April 21, 2002, editorial; byline David S. Broder. \nMr. Broder writes:\n\n       Thanks to the Enron scandal, the public is getting to know \n     about a scheme that corporate executives have used for years, \n     but that most of us were not smart enough to understand.\n\n  I include myself in that group that Mr. Broder describes.\n\n       You can call it the have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too ploy.\n       It involves stock options, the rights to buy company stock \n     some time in the future at the (presumably bargain) price at \n     which it is selling currently. Stock options awarded to \n     senior management by their (usually hand-picked) boards of \n     directors mushroomed from $50 billion in 1997 to $162 billion \n     just three years later. As Business Week pointed out in its \n     April 15 issue, boards have been ``lavishing options on \n     executives'' so profligately ``that they now account for a \n     staggering 15 percent of all shares outstanding.''\n       This is obviously a good deal for the executives. One of \n     them, Oracle Corporation's Lawrence Ellison, exercised \n     options worth $706 million in one week. A nice mouthful of \n     cake, by any standard.\n       But here's how his company--and all others like it--can \n     have its cake, too. The value of the stock options granted \n     Ellison is a cost to Oracle for tax purposes, but it doesn't \n     come off the bottom line when Oracle is reporting its \n     earnings for the year.\n       This would seem to defy common sense--and it does. Almost a \n     decade ago, as the options craze was getting under way, the \n     Federal Accounting Standards Board--the watchdog group--said \n     that when options are granted, they should be treated as an \n     expense in company reports as well as in tax returns. The \n     corporate CEOs and the accounting firms they hire went nuts, \n     and the next thing you knew, the Senate in 1994 was passing a \n     resolution . . . telling the watchdog: forget it.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I do not want to \nbreak in, but a key point I would like to make--and I thought the \nSenator might want a breather----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would appreciate it if the Senator would phrase it in \nthe form of a question, as he is very adept at doing. I will be glad to \nyield for his question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thought it was very important to make this point. What \nhappened almost a decade ago when we saw this blossoming of stock \noptions? The answer is, in 1993, we passed a law that said that if you \npaid a corporate executive more than $1 million a year in a plain old \npaycheck, you could not deduct it as an expense in running the \nbusiness.\n  At that time, the largest companies in America--and I am trying to \nmake a point that is in no way contradicting anything the Senator says, \nthough I do not agree with a word of it, but what we said was you could \nnot pay a corporate executive, through their paycheck, more than a \nmillion a year, even though the 50 largest companies in America were \npaying their corporate executives $3 million a year, on average.\n  When we passed that law, what happened? What happened is that \ncorporate America, being clever--you do not make $3 million a year if \nyou are not pretty smart--figured out ways around the law. Some of the \nways around the law were getting loans from the company at low interest \nrates and getting stock options, which are now criticized as giving \ncorporate leadership a very short-term horizon.\n  The only point I want to make is that everybody has forgotten that in \n1993 Congress, in a demagogic amendment aimed at ``rich people,'' \nstarted this whole process.\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\n  It struck me when you were saying this group of accountants got \ntogether in 1994, what they were doing was responding to a bad law, and \nthe bad law helped trigger this. One of the things--and God knows it is \nnot going to happen in the environment we are in now--but one of the \nthings Congress ought to do is to repeal that law so General Electric \ncould pay its CEO with a paycheck, like everybody else, instead of \ntrying to find all these ways around the law. I just wanted to get in \nthat advertisement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to respond to the Senator's question by \nsaying that I think the Senator makes a very valid point. I think this \nis probably none of Congress's business as to what salaries should be \nbestowed on a corporate executive, with truly independent boards of \ndirectors and with a voice of the stockholders.\n  Let me say to the Senator before he leaves, I am not talking about \ndoing away with stock options. I am talking about how they are treated. \nThey may have gotten around that, but it is how they are treated. As we \nget into the debate further, I would be glad to hear him respond to Mr. \nBuffett's three questions.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to respond to Mr. Buffett.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for Senator Gramm to respond \nwithout me losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to respond to him. First, I would have \nbeen happy to have voted on the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Second, this is something I am happy to debate. The only \npoint I wanted to make is that while we are all damning corporate \nAmerica, our law, which said if you paid somebody more than $1 million \na year it could not count as a business expense, really helped trigger \nall of this. One of the things we ought to be doing in the name of \nreform is to repeal that law.\n  When I tried today in Finance--the Senator said this would not be \nbrought up in Finance, but today in the Finance Committee I thought we \nought to have one Good Government amendment, and it failed, like logic \nand truth, for the lack of a second. That is my only point.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. I especially thank him for agreeing \nbecause the Senator from Texas--we have had our agreements, mostly \nagreements and occasional disagreements--has never, in all the years we \nhave known each other, which goes back to our days in the other body, \nwanted to deprive anybody of a vote on an issue, no matter where he \nstood on that issue.\n\n  I regret deeply that it is clear, as I said earlier, the fix is in; \nthere is not going to be a vote on this issue before cloture is \ninvoked, but I want to again assure my colleagues there will be a vote. \nThere will be a vote on this issue, just like when I was blocked for a \nlong time on the line-item veto, I was blocked for a long time on \ncampaign finance reform, I have been blocked on a lot of other issues \nbut we always got a vote because that is my right as a Senator to get a \nvote.\n  It is not my right as a Senator to determine the outcome, but it is \nmy right as a Senator to get a vote on an issue, particularly when, in \nthe view of any observer, stock options are a key issue in this entire \ndebate.\n  Again, I respect the views of the Senator from Texas who disagrees \nwith my position. I think it is a respectful disagreement that we have. \nI look forward to debating him. I do so at some disadvantage because he \nis a trained economist and former professor of economics.\n  I can also see why he would want to do away with that million-dollar \ncap because I am sure the Senator from Texas will make more than a \nmillion dollars when he leaves this body, and justifiably so given his \ntalent, expertise, and experience. I wish him well. I wish him every \nsuccess in doing so.\n  At least the Senator from Texas is in agreement that we should have a \nvote on this issue.\n  The question is going to be raised by me and others, time after time: \nWhy did we not have a vote on this issue? If we are truly committed to \nreforming the system, restoring trust and transparency to the system, \nwhy do we not have a vote on it? That is a very legitimate question. \nThere will be a vote.\n  I will return to Mr. Broder's editorial. He talks about that:\n\n       The Federal Accounting Standards Board said that when \n     options are granted, they should be treated as an expense.\n\n  And the Senate passed a resolution telling the watchdogs, forget it.\n\n       And that has had a truly wondrous effect. On average, the \n     Federal Reserve Board estimates, the ruling has boosted the \n     reported earnings growth of corporations by 3 percentage \n     points from a realistic 6 percent to an inflated 9 percent. \n     Enron, it is estimated, used that same ruling in 2000 to \n     inflate its earnings by more than 10 percent. Overstated \n     earnings, of course, boost stock prices, thus benefiting the \n     executives who have been given stock options.\n\n  By the way, I might add, not only stock options but it increases \ncompensation because the stock value is inflated.\n\n       But that is not the end of it. Because these stock options \n     are deductible for tax purposes, and their cost can be \n     carried forward for years, they also enable companies that \n     hand out a lot of options to stiff-arm the IRS. In Enron's \n     case, they allowed the company to cut its tax bill by $625 \n     million between 1996 and 2000.\n\n  Especially on my side of the aisle, there is this continuous \ndrumbeat: Let us make the tax cuts permanent; let us do away with the \ndeath taxes; let us make the tax cuts permanent; let us help the \nAmerican taxpayer. Should we not try to make a corporation pay its \nlegitimate taxes? In Enron's case, because of the use of stock options, \nthey allowed the company to cut its tax bill by $625 million over a \nperiod of 4 years. Amazing.\n\n       Thanks to Enron, another push is under way to stop the \n     double-dealing. But it faces tough sledding. The Coalition to \n     Preserve and Protect Stock Options, which includes 32 \n     influential trade associations, is flooding Congress with \n     `talking points' claiming that `stock options are a vital \n     tool in the battle for economic growth and job creation . . . \n     (and) to attract, retain and motivate talent.'\n       The coalition is trying to kill a bill that would not end \n     stock options but simply specify that companies could not use \n     them to reduce their taxes unless they also report them as an \n     expense in their financial statements.\n       The bill has bipartisan sponsorship: Democratic Senators \n     Carl Levin of Michigan, Mark Dayton of Minnesota and Dick \n     Durbin of Illinois; Republican Senators John McCain of \n     Arizona and Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois. Fitzgerald is \n     particularly interesting. He is from a wealthy banking family \n     and is a staunch conservative, but Enron has made him almost \n     a raging populist.\n       It has had no such effect on President Bush. Concerned as \n     always for the deserving rich, he told the Wall Street \n     Journal he opposes this kind of legislation. . . . But \n     Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified \n     recently in support of expensing stock options. The only \n     issue, he said, is whether under current rules, ``is income \n     being properly recorded? And I would submit to you that the \n     answer is no.''\n\n  That is what Alan Greenspan says: Is income being properly reported? \nAnd I would submit to you that the answer is no.\n\n       And superinvestor Warren Buffett, who hands out bonuses but \n     not stock options to his employees--\n\n  By the way, I have not heard of any bad morale or failure to attract \nemployees out at Berkshire Hathaway out in Omaha, a lovely place to \nlive--for years has been asking three questions: ``If options aren't a \nform of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense, \nwhat is it? And if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of \nearnings, where in the world should they go?\"\n\n  That is what Mr. Broder has to say.\n  Paul Krugman, on May 17, 2002:\n\n       On Tuesday Standard & Poor's, the private bond rating \n     agency, announced that it would do something unprecedented: \n     It will try to impose accounting standards substantially \n     stricter than those required by the federal government. \n     Instead of taking corporate reports at face value, S. will \n     correct the numbers to eliminate what it considers the \n     inappropriate treatment of ``one-time'' expenses, pension \n     fund earnings and, above all, stock options--a major part of \n     executive compensation that, according to federal standards, \n     somehow isn't a business expense. S.'s estimate of ``core \n     earnings'' for the 500 largest companies slashes reported \n     profits by an astonishing 25 percent.\n       Why does S. with Warren Buffett, Alan Greenspan \n     and just about every serious financial economist--think that \n     current accounting standards require a drastic overhaul? And \n     if such an overhaul is needed, why doesn't the government do \n     it? Why does S. think that it must do the job itself?\n       To see the absurdity of the current rules, consider stock \n     options. An executive is given\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\n     the right to purchase shares of the company's stock, at a \n     fixed price, some time in the future. If the stock rises, he \n     buys at bargain prices. If the stock falls, he doesn't \n     exercise the option. At worst, he loses nothing; at best, he \n     makes a lot of money. Nice work if you can get it.\n       Yet according to federal accounting standards, such deals \n     don't cost employers anything, as long as the guaranteed \n     price isn't below the market price on the day the option is \n     granted. Of course, this ignores the ``heads I win, tails you \n     lose'' aspect; executives get a share of investors' gains if \n     things go well, but don't share the losses if things go \n     badly. In fact, companies literally apply a double standard: \n     they deduct the cost of options from taxable income, even \n     while denying that they cost anything in their profit \n     statements.\n       So how could it possibly make sense not to count options as \n     a cost? Defenders of the current system argue that stock \n     options align the interests of executives with those of \n     investors. Even if that were true, however, it wouldn't \n     justify ignoring the cost--no more than it would make sense \n     to deny that wages, which provide incentives to workers, are \n     a business expense. Furthermore, it's now clear that stock \n     options, far from reliably inducing executives to serve \n     shareholders, often create perverse incentives. At worst, \n     they handsomely reward managers who run their companies as \n     pump-and-dump schemes, executives at Enron and many other \n     companies got rich thanks to stock prices that soared before \n     they collapsed.\n\n  I hope the opponents of this provision, including my friend from \nTexas, will put it into the real-world context. It is nice to talk \nabout economic theory. I know of no one better at that than the Senator \nfrom Texas. What happened at Enron? What happened at Enron when it \ncashed in $600 million worth of stock options and the stock tanks and \nthere are 10,000 or so employees out of work? And there was a period of \ntime where the employees were not allowed, because they were undergoing \nsome managerial change of their portfolio, to cash in their stock \noptions. But the executives were not prohibited from doing so. They \nkept on doing it. They kept on doing it.\n  So I hope we can have this debate not in the world of theories of \neconomics. I am not a CPA, nor am I a professor of economics, nor am I \nas smart as most of the Members of this body, but I know what happened \nto these people. I know of the thousands left penniless. I know of the \nthousands whose retirement savings were wiped out.\n  Meanwhile, the very people this whole stock option deal was supposed \nto be protecting were not protected, and yet somehow the executives all \nmade out like bandits.\n  Perhaps my colleagues, as they oppose this legislation, can talk \nabout the real-world examples--not the theoretical world of economics, \nwhich I will immediately grant them a distinct advantage on. I would \nlike for them to have the opportunity to meet some of these employees, \nas I have, who were told by the executives of the corporation the stock \nwas in great shape, while they were dumping the stock. I would like for \nthem to talk to the employees or the retirees who invested enormous \namounts of their money and their life savings, in some cases in a \nstock, and were told by their employers and executives that everything \nwas great, things could not be better, estimates of double the stock \nvalue over the next few years.\n  That is the framework of this debate, not the framework of whether \ncertain economic theories are valid or not.\n\n       Options are only part of an accounting system in deep \n     trouble. As David Blitzer, S.'s chief investment \n     strategist, recently wrote, ``Financial markets are as much a \n     social contract as is democratic government.'' Yet there is a \n     growing sense that this contract is being broken, undermining \n     the trust that is so essential to the operation of financial \n     markets. Clearly, major reforms are needed. And bear in mind \n     that this isn't a left-right issue; it's about protecting \n     investors--middle-class and wealthy alike from exploitation \n     by self-dealing insiders. So who could possibly be opposed? \n     You'd be surprise.\n       Harvey Pitt, the accounting industry lawyer who heads the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission, has clearly been dragging \n     his feet on reform.\n\n  Bear in mind, this is not a left-right issue. It is about protecting \ninvestors, middle class and wealthy alike, from exploitation by self-\ndealing insiders. So who could possibly be opposed? You would be \nsurprised. Harvey Pitt, the accounting industry lawyer who heads the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, has clearly been dragging his feet \non reform. Mr. Blitzer of S points out that in previous periods of \ncorporate scandal, legislatures and prosecutors took the lead with \npublic concerns over the market.\n  It is a sad commentary on our leadership that this time he believes \nhe must do the job himself--referring to Standard and Poors--and \nannounced that it would impose accounting standards substantially \nstricter than those required by the Federal Government.\n  Boston Globe, June 10, 2002:\n\n       Stock options have become the currency of choice to reward \n     high ranking executives in part because under current rules \n     the company need not count them as an expense with much of \n     their compensation. Depending on the difference between the \n     option price of the stock and the market price, it is no \n     wonder that some executives have used trickery to show \n     quarterly growth and inflate the worth of their companies. \n     Excessive reliance on stock options is a license for some \n     executives to drive their companies along treacherous roads.\n\n  I have a number of other views, but I think I have made my point. The \npoint is this: Why should we, in the name of restoring confidence, \ntrust, and transparency to the American people on an issue of this \nimport, not have a vote? That is the first question.\n  The second question that needs to be answered is Mr. Buffett's \nquestion, not mine; not mine because I don't claim to have a corner on \nexpertise and knowledge on this issue. But I believe that Mr. Buffett \ndoes. I believe that Mr. Greenspan does. I believe that literally every \noutside observer and economist does. If options aren't a form of \ncompensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is \nit? And if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, \nwhere in the world should they go?\n  I know what I will hear in response. In fact, most of those have \nalready been responded to so I don't intend to engage in extended \ndebate about it. We all know where the majority stock options have \ngone--to the executives, not to the workers. Mr. Buffett, and many \nothers, have been able to attract good and talented employees and \nretain them without having to resort to stock options.\n  But the real question is not whether stock options are good or bad \nbecause the intent of the amendment is not to do away with stock \noptions. The intent of the amendment is simply to give an accurate \ndepiction of what stock options are. And that is clearly compensation. \nDepreciation is listed as an expense. In the view of many, that is much \nharder to calculate than a stock option.\n  Another argument I anticipate will be, how do you treat it taxwise? \nFrankly, I would be glad to treat it taxwise as to how the smartest \npeople at the SEC would say it should be treated. I would leave that up \nto the two experts. But to not treat it as an expense, as Mr. Buffett \nsays, of course is just Orwellian. It is Orwellian.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry my colleague will not allow a vote. I will be \nglad to respond to my colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the Senator's yielding for a question. I \nwonder if the Senator would agree that the following individuals and \norganizations support the change in accounting for stock options, which \nthe Senator has outlined: Alan Greenspan, Paul Volcker, Arthur Levitt, \nWarren Buffett, as the Senator mentioned, TIAA-CREF, Paul O'Neill, \nStandard & Poor's, Council for Institutional Investors, Consumer \nFederation, Consumers Union, AFL/CIO--among others? Would the Senator \nagree that those organizations support a change in the accounting for \nstock options?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my friend, yes. I think there is another \nimportant organization, the Federal Accounting Standards Board--I \nbelieve it is--the international.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are some additional organizations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wanted to give the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator remember, as I do very vividly because I \nappeared before the Federal Financial Standards Board in the middle \n1990s to support their independence, when they decided that you had to \nexpense options, that it was compensation, that it had value like all \nother forms of compensation?\n  Does the Senator remember what the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\ndecided when they left it optional, as to whether or not to either \nexpense options or to show them as a footnote--just to disclose them \nwithout actually expensing them? Because if the Senator does not, I \nwould like to read what the Financial Accounting Standards Board said \nabout the pressure they were put under, the horrendous, horrific \npressure they were put under, and how they could have, indeed, been put \nout of existence if they went forward with what they believed was \nright, which is what Warren Buffett says.\n  If the Senator does not remember those words, I wonder if he might \nyield to me to read them, without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is what the Financial Accounting Standards Board \nsaid. They had proposed that stock options be expensed. That was their \nproposal. This is the board of accountants.\n\n       The debate on accounting for stock-based compensation, \n     unfortunately, became so divisive that it threatened the \n     Board's future working relationship with some of its \n     constituents. Eventually the nature of the debate threatened \n     the future of accounting standards setting in the private \n     sector. The Board continues to believe that financial \n     statements would be more relevant and representationally \n     faithful if the estimated fair value of employee stock \n     options was included in determining an entity's net income, \n     just as all other forms of compensation are included. To do \n     so would be consistent with accounting for the cost of all \n     other goods and services received as consideration for equity \n     instruments. However, in December 1994, the Board decided \n     that the extent of improvement in financial reporting that \n     was envisioned when this project was added to its \n     technical agenda and when the Exposure Draft was issued \n     was not attainable because the deliberate, logical \n     consideration of issues that usually leads to improvement \n     in financial reporting was no longer present.\n\n  That is the climate that was created for this Board in 1994. And when \nthe accountants, the Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board of \nthis country, said they have value, these options, they are \ncompensation, they should be accounted for in the financial statement, \nthey were hit upon so hard that even when they said we are throwing in \nthe towel because it could destroy us, even when they said we will \nallow it to be shown as a footnote, not required to be taken as an \nexpense--even then, they said this is not the right way to proceed.\n  We are now creating--I should ask a question, I think, given the \nrequest I made.\n  Does the Senator not agree that ideally what we should be allowing \nhere is an independent Financial Accounting Standards Board to \ndetermine the rules?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I could not agree more with the Senator from Michigan. I \nthink he knows how strongly I believe that options should be expensed \nbecause they are compensation and they have value and there is no other \nform of compensation that is not expensed. It is a stealthy form of \ncompensation and has driven the excesses of the 1990s. These options \nhave driven the deceptions that make these financial statements for \ncorporations look better than those corporations' situations really are \nbecause they have created so much value in those options that then \nexecutives--mainly executives--were able to cash in on these options \nand make tens of millions of dollars based on financial accounting \nwhich was deceptive.\n  Would the Senator agree with that and agree that ideally these \nstandards should be set by an independent financial accounting \nstandards board?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Michigan, first of all, it was \nthe Senator from Michigan who first initiated discussion with me on \nthis issue several years ago. We were treated as virtual pariahs for \nhaving the audacity to challenge what was then, as we now know, a high-\ntech bubble in the way stock options were being disbursed.\n  By the way, let's do away with the myth that these stock options are \nfor the average worker. The fact is the overwhelming majority of the \nstock options have gone to the chief executives. That is just a matter \nof record and fact.\n  But I think the Senator is correct. I think the Senator has also an \nadditional, I think important, corollary to this amendment, that we \ncould have certain direction from FASB, as it is known. But I think it \nis also a clear-cut, black-and-white issue as to how stock options \nshould be treated.\n  I would be glad to agree with the Senator from Michigan that some of \nthese aspects of it can be better handled by the experts.\n  Finally, the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Maryland are in \nthe Chamber. I hope they will reconsider and allow a vote postcloture \nat some time on this important amendment. I do not see how you can \npossibly go to the American people and say: Look, we have discussed and \ndebated all these issues, but we wouldn't allow a vote on the issue of \nstock options.\n  There is no observer who does not believe that the issue of stock \noptions is one of significant importance in this entire scenario of \nreturning trust and transparency so we can regain the confidence of the \nAmerican investor.\n  Again, I assure my friends, we will have a vote on this issue at some \ntime, whether it be now on this bill or whether it be the next bill or \nthe bill after that. So I hope my colleague from Nevada and my \ncolleague from Maryland will allow an up-or-down vote on this \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for one last question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Assuming cloture is invoked, there is still, does my \nfriend agree, the possibility at least of voting on germane amendments \nrelating to this subject? So the amendment which is germane postcloture \ndoes not state what the Senator from Arizona and I believe, which is \nthat unless we deal with this, we are missing a huge problem, we are \nnot addressing a huge problem that has driven the situation that we now \nface in terms of deceptive financial statements. But, in any event, \nwill the Senator from Arizona agree that at least postcloture, if an \namendment is germane which says it is determined that FASB or an \nindependent accounting board reviewed this matter, that at least there \ncould be a vote at that time on something which carries out the spirit \nof what the Senator from Arizona and I have been fighting for, which is \nthat an independent accounting board be allowed to proceed without \nthreatening its very existence to determine what is the proper \naccounting for stock options?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I apologize to my colleagues for taking as much time as I \nhave on this subject. As I said, I believe it is one of transcending \nimportance in the minds of average American citizens. Yes. I would \nsupport the Senator's amendment postcloture. But I would also have to \nadd that it doesn't address the issue completely. Here is why.\n  The Senator from Michigan just talked about how these boards have \nbeen intimidated and bullied into backing off of a position they had \nbefore. I can't have the confidence that any board that is subject to \nthe kind of intimidation and bullying that has happened in the past \nwould properly carry out what is a pretty simple operation.\n  I understand the Senator's point. I will support his amendment \npostcloture. I think it is an important one. But there has to be a \nclear signal sent. That clear signal is this: As Mr. Buffett says, if \nit isn't compensation, what is it? If options are not a form of \ncompensation, what are they? If compensation is not an expense, what is \nit? If expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, where in \nthe world should they go? This answers Mr. Buffett's question. We know \nwhere it should go--as an expense.\n  Again, I am not trying to do away with stock options but how it is \ntreated so the American people can restore their confidence.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a couple of questions which his \ncomments have raised?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield? The Senator directed a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Maryland for \na comment without yielding my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I wanted to respond at this point because the Senator \njust directed a question. We are not trying to prevent a vote on your \namendment. We have been trying repeatedly to get votes on these \namendments. Senator Edwards has had an amendment pending in here for \nnow more than a day.\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\nWe can't get a vote on it. Senator Levin has had an amendment pending. \nWe have a list of people who want to offer amendments. We have been \ntrying to work through these amendments. Now the Senator has come with \nhis amendment. There are a lot of amendments around here on which \npeople are trying to get votes. I think they are entitled to those \nvotes.\n  I know you have a problem. But I take some umbrage as sort of having \nit placed on my shoulders. In fact, I think that is totally inaccurate, \nand I just want to make sure I put that on the record.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the McCain amendment be allowed \npostcloture.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So you see.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. That doesn't approve anything. The Senator wants \nhis amendment----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And denies everybody else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I think I have made my point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. You haven't made your point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to respond to the question of the Senator \nfrom Michigan, if he would like.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield, if the Senator from Michigan \nwould be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is a very clever trick, but you haven't made your \npoint. There are other Members here with amendments that are very \nimportant to them which they are trying to have considered. We have \nbeen trying to process those amendments in an orderly way. The Senator \narrives on the scene and apparently thinks, well, there should be a \nspecial set of rules for the Senator to do his amendment. So he just \nnow tried to jump ahead of other people, and a reasonable objection was \nmade. And I think it ought to have been made. The Senator from Arizona \ncomes in, and, all of a sudden, there is going to be a special set of \nrules to deal with his amendment. The Senator doesn't even recognize \nwhat is in the bill, which does try to address to some extent this \nproblem with independent funding and FASB that this legislation \nprovides for--which everyone agrees is long overdue and is an important \ncontribution.\n  But we have these people lined up here who want to do amendments. We \nhave the Edwards amendment, we have the Levin amendment, and we have a \nwhole list of people with amendments. We have been trying to process \nthose amendments, and we have not been able to do it.\n  As one who is down here trying to work overtime to get these \namendments processed, I want to very strongly register that point.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I still have the floor. I thank the Senator from \nMaryland. I appreciate his hard work managing the legislation. I have \nmanaged bills in my time. I know that sometimes it gets very \nfrustrating and difficult.\n  I have some suggestions. One is that the Senator oppose cloture so \nthat we can address all of these issues and prevail on his colleagues \nto do so so that we can have relevant amendments considered.\n  I also think--it is not just in this Senator's view but in the view \nof almost everyone, in the view of Alan Greenspan, in the view of \nWarren Buffett, in the view of the Washington Post and the New York \nTimes, and everybody--that this is a serious and vital issue.\n  So my suggestion is that we not have a cloture vote, and that we go \nahead and take up the amendments in an orderly fashion. The Senator \nfrom Nevada, obviously, will not allow my amendment to be considered \npostcloture.\n  The Senator from Michigan has a question. Would the Senator from \nNevada, the distinguished whip, like to wait until the Senator from \nMichigan is finished, or would you like to go ahead?\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question was actually touched upon by the Senator from \nArizona relative to the independence of the Financial Accounting \nStandards Board, and as to whether or not the Senator was aware--at \nleast now in this bill--that we have the source of financing for that \nboard which hopefully will not only allow it to reach its own \nconclusion, as it did once before, that options have value and should \nbe expensed but also that it carry through with it without threatening \ntheir own survival.\n  I think that is an important part of this. But at least that gives us \nhope this time that when the Financial Accounting Standards Board \nreviews this matter--if it does--it will reach a conclusion not only \nthat it believes it, but it can then implement it through an accounting \nstandard.\n  That was my question about that funding source in this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to respond. I understand that. I did know it \nis part of the bill. I also know what has happened in the past. The \nfact is that we have not made the changes which are necessary because \nof enormous pressures that have been brought to bear.\n  The Senate should be on record on this issue. This is not a minor \nissue. This is not a small item. The Senate should be on record on this \nissue, and it apparently will not be at this time.\n  I thank my colleagues, though I do think that it is an important step \nforward. But I also believe this is something that we could address in \na straightforward fashion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for 60 seconds so I \ncan make a statement on this subject prior to a unanimous consent, or \nan address on a different part of my amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his steadfast \nsupport of the issue which is critically important.\n  Unless we address the way stock options are dealt with in this \ncountry--the fact that it is now a free ride, and stealth compensation \nwhich has caused, in large measure, the problems because accepted \naccounting practices, as we have seen, are significantly driven by the \noption accounting which allows options to be left off the financial \nstatements as an expense, and, therefore, cashed in when those books of \nthe company show great value, which is not reality, but nonetheless \ndrives up stock prices--I want to say that I agree with the Senator \nfrom Arizona. Unless we address this issue, we are leaving a huge gap \nin our reform efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Maryland has tried now for \nseveral days to figure out a way to have amendments. We have tried to \nnegotiate. We have had those which have been arbitrated. We have had \nsome cajoling. We have had a little bit of begging. We have gotten \nnowhere. But the rules of the Senate are the rules of the Senate. \nTherefore, it would be contrary to my beliefs to have a special set of \nrules for the Senator from Arizona, as well intentioned as his \namendment may be.\n  I have had phone calls. I have had personal visits from at least 15 \nDemocratic Senators saying they have amendments that they believe in \nvery strongly. They and their staffs have worked on some of these \namendments for months. They are not going to be able to offer those \namendments.\n  Mr. GRAMM. There are 58 Democratic amendments.\n  Mr. REID. So it would be totally unfair to have a nongermane \namendment that would be available for us postcloture. That is why I \nobject. If I had to do it again, I would do the same thing.\n  But let me say this. People can complain--and I have no problem with \ntheir doing so--that we have not been able to go through the relevant \namendments, but this legislation that has been brought to us by the \nBanking Committee and has now been improved upon by the Judiciary \nCommittee's amendment of Senator Leahy is a very fine piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let's not lose track of that. This is a very fine vehicle. Maybe we \ncould do a better job--put some rearview mirrors on both sides of it, \nmaybe improve the upholstery a little bit, but the legislation we have \nthat will be voted on and approved by the Senate is very good.\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\n  The Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Agent \nwould establish the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to set \nstandards for auditing public companies.\n  It would inspect accounting firms. It would conduct investigations \ninto possible violations of its rules and impose a full range of \nsanctions. It would restrict the nonaudit services a public accounting \nfirm may provide to its clients that are public in nature. It would \nrequire a public accounting firm to rotate its lead partner and review \npartner on audits after 5 consecutive years of auditing a public \ncompany.\n  It would require chief executive officers and chief financial \nofficers to certify the accuracy of financial statements and \ndisclosures. It would require CEOs and CFOs to relinquish bonuses and \nother incentive-based compensation and profit on stock sales in the \nevent of accounting restatements resulting from fraudulent \nnoncompliance with Securities and Exchange Commission financial \nreporting requirements.\n  It would prohibit directors and executive officers from trading \ncompany stock during blackout periods. It would require scheduled \ndisclosures of adjustment statements. It would establish bright-line \nboundaries to prohibit stock analyst conflicts of interest.\n  It would authorize about $300 million more than the President's \nbudget for the SEC next year to enhance its investigation and \nenforcement capabilities.\n  I will not go through all the details of the amendment that has been \napproved by the Senate, offered by Senator Leahy, making certain things \ncriminal in nature and increasing the penalties.\n  This is a fine piece of legislation. But I do say this. The Senator \nfrom Maryland is in the Chamber. I am confident the Senator from \nMaryland would agree to a unanimous consent request that on relevant \namendments, determined by the Parliamentarian, we have a half hour on \neach one, and as soon as the half hour is up, vote on them.\n  I ask the Senator from Maryland, you would agree to that, wouldn't \nyou?\n  Mr. SARBANES. It would be one way of trying to deal with these \namendments and dispose of them. A request of that sort ought to be \ncarefully considered, certainly.\n  We have this problem. Members have amendments pending. We have been \ntrying to move the amendments forward. We have not been able to do \nthat. I know how frustrated they are. I share their frustration.\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. But in spite of all this, I want the Record to be spread \nwith the fact that we have a good piece of legislation. I would like, \nas I said before, to have some of the fancier upholstery----\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, it is interesting, in the \ndebate we just had, until the Senator from Michigan underscored the \nfact, it was not pointed out that we provide independent funding in \nthis legislation for the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which \nhas the responsibility of setting these accounting standards.\n  Their problem in the past has been that they are voluntarily funded \nfrom the industry. They have to go to them and beg for money in order \nto carry out their activities. And if the industry thinks they are \ngoing to do a ruling that is contrary to what they want, then they are \nnot as willing to support their activity.\n  We eliminate that in this bill because we have a mandatory fee that \nmust be paid by all issuers, and the Board will be funded out of that \nmoney. So that, in itself, is a very important and significant step in \nestablishing the independence of the Accounting Standards Board.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken with the Presiding Officer \nand staff on several occasions. Yours is our next amendment in order. \nYou have been waiting 2 days to have that amendment offered, a very \nimportant amendment. And you are just one of several. You are fortunate \nin that you are the next one, if we can ever get to the next one.\n  I would ask my friend----\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have the next Republican amendment.\n  Mr. REID. We know we have to be burdened with a Republican amendment \nonce in a while.\n  I say to my friend, would the Senator consider my proposal to have \nrelevant amendments debated--and the relevancy would be determined by \nthe Chair--for a half hour on each one of those and, at the end of the \nhalf hour, have a vote up-or-down on that amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator is already in a big fight with Senator McCain. \nI do not know why he wants to try to pick one with other people.\n  Where we are is, we are going to cloture. And there are rules in the \nSenate. And postcloture, for an amendment, the ticket to get into the \narena is it has to be germane, which means it must be directly related \nto a provision in the bill. It cannot amend the bill in more than one \nplace. There is a certain set of rules.\n  If the Senator would indulge me a second, we have 36 Republicans who \nwant to offer an amendment. My amendment is next on the list. I am the \nranking member of this committee, and it appears I am not going to get \nan opportunity to offer an amendment. Now, I could cry and pout about \nit, but it would not change anything and would not change the world \neither. There are 58 Democrat amendments.\n  The point is, we all agree on one thing: Whether you like this bill \nor you do not like it, it is an important bill and we need to get on \nwith it. We need to pass it. We need to go to conference. We need to \nwork out an agreement with the House and with the White House. If we \nsat here and tried to do 36 Republican amendments and 58 Democrat \namendments--and some of them having to do with things such as the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals and bankruptcy law--we would literally spend 3 \nor 4 months. So there is no other alternative than following the rules \nof the Senate. And that is exactly what I want to do.\n  Mr. REID. Reclaiming the floor, I have always enjoyed the Texas drawl \nof my friend, the senior Senator from Texas. But even through the \ndrawl, I understood that to be a no.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes. Yes, it was a no.\n  Mr. REID. My friend, the other Senator from Arizona, is on the floor. \nWe are waiting for the Republican leader. I assume that will be soon.\n  I ask my friend from Wyoming, when the Republican leader does appear, \nif he would be kind enough to allow us to attempt to enter into an \nagreement.\n  I ask the Senator, if you see him come to the floor, would you be so \nkind as to yield the floor for just a short time? It would be \nappreciated.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would be happy to interrupt my remarks at that time. I \nwould hope my remarks would appear as uninterrupted.\n  Mr. REID. I would agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6633-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6633-S6636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 5011\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Republican leader is on the floor. I \nwill propound a unanimous consent request. This relates to H.R. 5011, \nthe military construction appropriations bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, following consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 486, H.R. 5011, the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill; and that it be considered \nunder the following limitations: that immediately after the bill is \nreported, all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of \nCalendar No. 479, S. 2709, the Senate committee-reported bill, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; that debate time on the bill and substitute \namendment be limited to a total of 45 minutes, with an additional 20 \nminutes under the control of Senator McCain; that the only other \namendment in order be an amendment offered by Senators Feinstein and \nHutchison of Texas which is at the desk, with debate limited to 10 \nminutes on the Feinstein and Hutchison of Texas amendment; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of time on the amendment, without further \nintervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of \nthe amendment; that all debate time not already identified in this \nagreement be equally divided and controlled between the Chair and \nranking member of the subcommittee or their designee; that upon the \ndisposition of the Feinstein-Hutchison amendment and the use or \nyielding back of the time, the substitute amendment, as amended, be\n\n[[Page S6634]]\n\nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read three times; that section 303 \nof the Congressional Budget Act be considered waived; and the Senate \nthen vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage of the bill, the \nSenate insist on its amendment and then request a conference with the \nHouse on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses; and that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate without \nfurther intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, reserving the right to object, first, I \nwould say that I am glad we have reached the point where we are \nprepared to start trying to move some appropriations bills. We are way \nlate in the year. But ordinarily, we move anywhere from as few as five \nto as many as nine in July. I hope we can begin to get on a roll here \npretty soon on the appropriations bills because there are a lot of \nthings we need to do, but there are a few things we must do. One of \nthem is, we have to pass the bills to fund the Government for the next \nfiscal year, and the fiscal year ends the 1st of October.\n  I am glad this is being asked for consideration now. I want to thank \nthe managers and both sides of the aisle for allowing time for Senator \nMcCain and others to review the managers' package. I understand that \nhas been worked out and has been cleared. I think this is a good way to \nconsider this legislation.\n  There may be objection, but I want the Record to reflect that I \nstrongly support this unanimous consent request and I support this \nlegislation. It is more than what the President asked for in this \nparticular category, but it still has to go to conference. I hope that \nit can be worked out in such a way that it would be acceptable to the \nPresident.\n  There are those who are worried that any time a bill of this nature \nmoves through the process, they lose an opportunity for critical \nmatters to be considered. For instance, let me be specific, because I \nthink Senator Kyl may talk about this, there are those from the West \nand maybe other areas that have had fires in their States--we know some \nof those in Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico--and floods, such as the \none they have had in Texas. There has probably been well in excess of \n$1 billion used, involved in fighting the fires. Now that is going to \nbe needed to deal with the floods in Texas.\n\n  Those funds have been provided by transfer of funds from other \naccounts. One of two things is going to happen: We are going to \nreplenish the funds taken from those accounts or those accounts are \ngoing to come up short. Understandably, the Senators from the States \naffected want to make sure there is going to be an opportunity for them \nto provide the funds that have been used or replace the funds that have \nbeen used to make sure money is there for upcoming needs.\n  I am sympathetic to that. I don't think this is the last train out of \nthe Senate. If this bill moves, there will be another one, and \nhopefully we will be moving two or three appropriations bills every \nweek.\n  There may be other considerations about what do we do if we don't get \nan agreement on the supplemental this week. I hope that within the next \n24 hours something can be worked out on the supplemental appropriations \nbill, which, by the way, has been hanging around now for over 100 days, \nprobably closer to 120 days by now. It is time to get an agreement. At \nsome point, if we don't get the supplemental funds, we may wind up not \nhaving adequate funds for our airport security workers, the \nTransportation Security Agency, and it will begin to affect the Defense \nDepartment. I hope we can get all of this worked out.\n  I am sympathetic to those worried about that and the fires. But I \ndon't think that is justification for not moving forward on the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill. I support this request. I \nwant the Record to be clear about how I feel about the request and the \nlegislation.\n  With that, I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know there is another reservation, but I \njust want to respond to the leader because I want him to be able to \nretire to his office when he feels necessary.\n  I had the opportunity to chair the Military Construction Subcommittee \nand worked as ranking member. It is an extremely important subcommittee \nfor the military. With what has been going on in Afghanistan, it is \ncompounded as to its importance. That is why the two Senators who run \nthis committee, the Senators from California and Texas, Mrs. Feinstein \nand Mrs. Hutchison, have worked so hard getting it in a posture that \nhas been signed off by literally everyone, including Senator McCain, \nwho has reviewed the work done. They have done a wonderful job.\n  I would also say to my friend from Arizona, Nevada, last year and the \nyear before, was scourged with terrible fires. We didn't have forest \nfires; we had range fires that burned millions of acres. We were able \nto get money to help replenish those rangelands so depleted as a result \nof the fires.\n  I have been here a long time. I never remember a time when we did not \nrespond to take care of the needs caused by fires in this country. Most \nof the fires occur in the West. We have always handled that.\n  We have 12 other appropriations bills coming through here. With all \ndue respect, I say to the junior Senator from Arizona, this is not the \ntime to hold up this legislation. There are at least 12 other bills. We \nreported another one out of the committee today.\n\n  I would say to my friend, the Republican leader, I had the \nopportunity to speak to Senator Byrd a short time ago. There is hope \nthat the supplemental conference will be completed tomorrow. Great \nprogress is being made. I hope we can move forward on this bill. This \nis so important that we get it out of here and get it to the House.\n  I have no doubt, as tight as money is, that we will take care of the \nfire needs of the western part of the United States. We always take \ncare of emergency needs, whether it is fire or flood. We will do so in \nthe future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I object, and I would like to explain the \nreason why. I concur with the comments Senator Lott has made about the \nimportance of moving this legislation forward. I have conferred with \nthe ranking member of the committee, the Senator from Texas, who makes \na strong case that the legislation has been carefully crafted, and it \nis important to move it forward. I totally concur with her on that.\n  I also have no problem with the way in which the unanimous consent \nagreement has been constructed in terms of moving forward as soon as it \nis possible to do so. I have no objection to any of that.\n  I do simply want to, as the minority leader said, preserve the option \nof dealing with the subject of the recent floods and droughts on this \nappropriation bill. The reason is as follows: The ranking member of the \ncommittee, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and the \nranking member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee are all meeting \ntoday with other people, including the Director of the OMB, the Senator \nfrom Texas, and others, to try to figure out the best way to deal with \nthe new issue of the fire and flood and drought damages that have \noccurred in this country since the supplemental appropriations bill was \nput together.\n  My personal view is that the supplemental would probably be a \npreferable place to include the disaster relief to replenish the funds \nfor the forest fires to the BIA and the Forest Service. There are \nthose, however, who disagree. If the Director of OMB and chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee believe that it is not \nappropriate to use the supplemental as the vehicle for doing that, then \none of the other appropriations bills will be appropriate, and the \nfirst one before us is the military construction bill. That would be \nthe next appropriate vehicle.\n  I am simply preserving their option to decide which is the best \nvehicle for moving this forward. The reason specifically for wanting to \ndo it right now--in response to the Senator from Nevada, I am confident \nthat we will deal with this issue because it has to be dealt with.\n  Here is the very practical problem. We have had about one-fourth of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\nentire budget of the Forest Service now consumed in fighting forest \nfires; whereas, ordinarily it is something like 4 percent of their \nbudget, or something like that. So they have borrowed from other \naccounts in order to pay these firefighters.\n  The fires in Arizona cost almost $50 million to fight. As a result, \nthey have had to borrow that money from other accounts. The result of \nthat is that right after the fire is over, before it is even cool, they \nwill not be able to go into the area of these fires and prevent the \nerosion that inevitably occurs as soon as the rains start, and now the \nrainy season is beginning, and the planting of the grasses and trees \nand so on that further inhibits that erosion. They literally want to go \nin as soon as they can after the fire to stabilize the ground. If they \nwait too long, it doesn't do any good. So they have to do that right \naway.\n  The problem is, they have spent all the money in the restoration \naccounts. The head of the Forest Service put a stop on the expenditure \nof any money that doesn't have to be spent almost on an emergency or \ndaily operations basis. So right now, both the Department of the \nInterior and the Department of Agriculture are significantly precluded \nfrom doing the other things Congress mandated that they do.\n  We need to make sure they know they are going to have the funds to \nrestore those accounts so they can get on with the jobs we have asked \nthem to do; and, most importantly, in the very near term they can get \ninto the area of these fires and begin the restoration that is \nessential in a timely fashion. That is why the first vehicle in terms \nof an appropriations bill that can be used should be used for this \nprocess--whether it is the supplemental or this appropriations bill.\n  There have been suggestions that the Interior Appropriations bill \nwould be a better vehicle. From a purely substantive point of view, \nthat is true, but that will not come before us for another month, or 6 \nweeks, or 2 months. That is, obviously, way too late.\n  That is the reason why we need to preserve this particular option. I \nhope we can move quickly to the consideration of the MILCON bill, both \nfor the purpose of completing the work of the Senator from Texas, as \nwell as the work we are talking about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am the ranking member of the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee. I have worked very hard with \nSenator Feinstein, the chairman of that committee, to produce a bill \nthat takes into account all of the priorities of the Department of \nDefense, the administration, and the Members' requests. I think we have \ndone a good job. We didn't give every Member everything they asked for, \nof course, but I think we have done a terrific job in meeting the needs \nof the military and the requests of the administration.\n  We need to pass this bill. I appreciate the support of Senator Lott, \nalong with, of course, Senator Reid and Senator Daschle and Senator \nFeinstein, that we need to move this forward. However, I wanted to say \nthat although Senator Kyl has objected--and I disagree with his \ndecision to do so--I understand his frustration, and Senator Reid said \nhe understands his frustration. We see it every night on the news--the \nfighting of these incredible fires, people being put out of their \nhomes, ruining vast hundreds of thousands of acres of our forestland in \nthis country, and we are running out of money.\n  I hope that people have also seen the floods in my home State of \nTexas. The Governor is now saying that the damage is estimated to be $2 \nbillion. It only happened last week, so I cannot tell you exactly what \nwe are going to need to clean up the floods. But I know that the people \nare suffering. I am going to be there tomorrow with Joe Albaugh, head \nof FEMA, to look at the damage myself because I want to make sure we \nare doing the right thing for the people of Arizona, the people of \nColorado, the people of New Mexico, the people of Idaho, and the people \nof Texas. We have always done that.\n  So I understand Senator Kyl's frustration. I am sorry he is holding \nup this bill, but I am committed to seeking a vehicle for an amendment \nthat would ensure that the money is there to fight the forest fires in \nthis country and to clean up the flood damage that we see happening in \nTexas. We will do that. We will find the vehicle to do it. I commit \nthat we will. We are not going to appropriate money that isn't needed. \nWe are going to have a contingency appropriation so that if the money \nis needed, it is there.\n  We all want to be careful with taxpayer dollars, but there has never \nbeen an earthquake, or a flood, or a fire that we have not responded to \nas a country and said we are not going to let people suffer when they \nhave nowhere to turn but to us. We will be there for them. So I am \ncommitted to trying to find the right vehicle. I want to make the \ndecision now so we can get on with MILCON. If military construction is \nthe right vehicle, let's put that emergency appropriation on military \nconstruction. I would prefer to see it on the supplemental \nappropriations on which we are having a conference tomorrow. I would \nlike to put it there.\n  This is an emergency. We have had a change in circumstances since the \nPresident sent his request to Congress. It seems to me that it is \ncommon sense that we have had a change in circumstances that would \nwarrant a change in the cap. That would be the preferred way to handle \nthis emergency, which we all acknowledge we need to do. If we cannot do \nthat, I want the commitment for Senator Kyl, for Senator Domenici, for \nthe Senator from Colorado, that we will handle this issue. So if it is \nnot going to be on the supplemental, then I am willing to try to help \nthem put it on military construction. If it is not military \nconstruction, then I don't think we will be handling any appropriations \nbills until we get a commitment to address this issue.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't need the Senator to yield for a question, but I \nwill talk for a moment. Sometime yesterday I raised this issue when \nmost of the Republican Senators were in a meeting. It seemed, from the \nfeedback, that most of them agreed with the comments that were made \nthen. Essentially, we don't often have this situation, but what really \nhappened--I used the word ``yesterday''--the supplemental has been \naround here for so long that it has run into a new problem. It ran into \nthe problem of forest fires--huge ones--and into flooding that has been \ndescribed by those who come from States where flooding has occurred. \nBut there is no question that the forest fires and the floods, because \nthey came a long time after these urgent supplementals, should have \ncleared it.\n  In normal times you would be beyond the supplemental and you would be \nwaiting for something else; but the supplemental bumped right into the \nfires and the floods, it took so long to get its rightful place here on \nthe Senate floor. It didn't seem to be very urgent when it took 2 \nmonths to get done. But now we want to try to live by the facts the \nWhite House put into the budget before this new set of facts occurred. \nAfter that meeting yesterday, I was very pleased to note that the \ndistinguished Republican leader joined with us and submitted to the \nWhite House, to the Budget Director for the executive branch the fact \nthat this was going to happen sooner or later, that most of the people \nwe had talked to and that he had talked to--and shortly thereafter we \nstarted talking with Democrats--that there was going to be substantial \nsupport, if not 100 percent.\n  So I am pleased that we are at a point where we are going to put this \namendment on one of the bills.\n  I understand our distinguished ranking member of Appropriations has \nconcurred with others and doesn't want it put on the supplemental. That \nis all right with me, provided we are standing in line with commitments \nfrom those who we need commitments from, that the fire and flood money \nwill be on the next appropriations bill that comes by. Since I don't \nwant to take additional time, I assume that is where we are.\n  I will ask the Senator from Nevada a question: Are we now at a point \nwhere we are going to decide on which appropriations bill we are going \nto be free to put the emergency language for the floods and the fires?\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico \nthat we are trying to move these bills.\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\n  I cannot imagine that Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens would have the \nfire money in the military construction bill. We reported, as the \nSenator knows, another bill out of the committee, the legislative \nbranch appropriations bill. There are other bills coming up. As the \nSenators from New Mexico and Arizona said, fire money should be in the \nsupplemental, but it is not. I just do not think it is going to be in \nthe military construction bill. That is why we should get it out of the \nSenate and get it to the President. There are some significant military \nneeds that will be satisfied.\n  I say to my friend who is so aware of everything that goes on around \nhere because of his position on the Appropriations Committee and the \nBudget Committee, I can never ever remember a time when we have not \ntaken care of fire needs and the flood needs of this country, and we \nwill do it this year also. If there needs to be another supplemental, \nwe will do that, or if we have to put the money in the Interior \nappropriations bill or other bills, we will do that. I just do not \nthink this is the vehicle on which to do it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I said yesterday that I do not \nrecall--I have been here a few years longer than the Senator from \nNevada--a situation where we would not pay for an emergency of forest \nfires and the damages and costs that ensued.\n  Frankly, there are a lot of people in the West, particularly in \nNevada and my State, who have seen these fires and now hear on the \ntelevision that the Forest Service does not have money in its budget to \npay for them. They do. They are borrowing from another account.\n  As the Senator said and I have said, they are going to get reimbursed \nshortly. The sooner we do it, the sooner we keep faith with the \nhundreds of thousands of people in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, \nand Colorado who have been watching. It would be good if it is sooner \nrather than later. While we are paying for many things, we should pay \nfor their account also. I assume that is what you are going to try to \ndo in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, and I say to my friend, these moneys are so important \nto the people of our respective States, there is no question about \nthat. I think it is a shame, for lack of a better description, that we \ndo not have it in the supplemental. I repeat that. If there ever was an \nemergency, this is it. We have not budgeted for these moneys, and the \nfire that swept Arizona is 400,000 acres.\n  We had a fire in Nevada at Lake Tahoe--we are so thankful it did not \nravage that basin--of only 1,000 acres. In the last 2 years, we have \nhad over 2 million acres burn in Nevada, not forestland but rangeland.\n  We need to take care of this emergency. It should be done in the \nsupplemental, but the majority leader, myself, and anyone on this side \nwho has jurisdiction will do whatever we can to speed this up as \nquickly as possible.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I say to those who want to make \nsure the supplemental not only passes but is signed, the Senator from \nNew Mexico is on their side. I am with them. I am certainly not going \nto do anything to delay that, although it does seem strange to this \nSenator, an urgent supplemental, which is intended for urgent \nsupplemental needs, would have to be isolated from this need because \nsome kind of arrangement has been made. The arrangement comes very \nlate, but it is an effort to get the bill done and to get the important \nparties to agree.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6636-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6636-S6643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING REFORM AND INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT OF 2002--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \nvote immediately on or in relation to the Levin amendment, the second-\ndegree amendment. Following disposition of that amendment, we vote \nimmediately on the Edwards amendment; and following that, we vote on \ncloture, which motion was filed yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I noticed the McCain \namendment was not listed. Was that an inadvertent error or was it the \nintention to exclude that amendment which was offered after the two \nlisted?\n  Mr. REID. The last two amendments offered were the Levin and Edwards \namendments.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \ncloture occur immediately; that we proceed with the process of dealing \nwith germane amendments; and that we set the time of 8 o'clock for all \ndebate on the bill to end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4269\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I do have to answer some of the questions. \nI am sorely disappointed that the Senator from Arizona left the floor. \nHe asked some important questions. He has asked three questions about \naccounting. I don't get to answer questions about accounting very \noften. I was very excited about that.\n  Now, I do warn people who may be watching in their offices, or \nsomewhere else, that accounting questions often put people to sleep. So \nit might not always be that exciting for them.\n  But I do have to say, from what we saw, there is no passion like the \npassion of a repentant sinner. This is not the first time somebody has \nsaid we are going to tell FASB what to do.\n  On May 4, 1994, the Senate said: We do not care what you said in your \nmultiple pages of FASB rules, we are going to tell you what to do. And \nthe vote was 88 to 9 the last time we interfered with FASB. I have to \ntell you, the Senator from Arizona was in the 88. He was one of the \npeople who said: I know how to do this. I know how to do this better \nthan FASB. So listen to me: I am going to vote my conscience on this \nand dictate how FASB is going to handle accounting on stock options.\n\n  If he and several other people had not voted to tell FASB what to do \nat that time, we wouldn't be having this discussion at all.\n  Now we have another amendment. It is very important to pay attention \nto the wording.\n  What I am trying to do is--as I mentioned, there is no passion like \nthe passion of a repentant Senator--I am trying to keep people from \nsinning again. There are some very important reasons. We cannot take a \ncomplex situation such as stock options, which I think all of us can \nspell but for which not all of us can account, and put it into a simple \nlittle paragraph on how it should be handled. This amendment, which is \njust one sentence which makes up the whole paragraph, says:\n\n       Any corporation that grants a stock option to an officer \n     employee to purchase a publicly traded security in the United \n     States shall record the granting of the option as an expense \n     in that corporation's income statement for the year in which \n     the option is granted.\n\n  One of the problems we are having right now is investors are a little \nbit shaken because there are restatements of income being done. Not all \nrestatements are because something was hidden. Some of those \nrestatements are because of changes in rules. This will be one of the \nbiggest changes in rules we have made in decades, and the way this is \nwritten, while it is intended to move to an expense system, does not \nreally say that. It says that you have to expense it in that \ncorporation's income statement for the year in which the option is \ngranted.\n  There are a lot of options that are already granted. Some of them are \noutstanding maybe 25 years. It is more common that it be 2 or 3 years. \nThe new stock options are done on a much shorter period of time. Even \nif it is just 2 or 3 years, what this amendment is saying is, redo your \nincome statements and restate them for the last 3 years for all of your \noptions that are outstanding. We did not make you do that before; now \nwe want you to show a huge change or maybe just a small change, but at \nany rate a change, and every time a company announces a change--and I \nhave had some call and say: I am going to have to do a restatement and \nthat restatement is going to be upward; you know what it is going to do \nto my stock; I am showing an increase in profit, and it is going to \ndestroy me. All I can say is, it is the law; you have to restate.\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\n  This will cause the biggest restatement in the history of the United \nStates, the way it is done. One cannot dictate in very simple language \nsomething that will take multiple pages to be able to explain and to \nallow reconciliation. If we listened to the explanation earlier, it \nsounds as if companies are writing this stuff off and nothing ever \nhappens with it. That is not true. Every time there is an exercise, \nevery time somebody trades their option for real stock, there is an \naccounting for it. At the end of each year there is a reconciliation \nfor it to make sure the taxes are paid on the stock options that are \nexercised.\n  We heard something earlier about $625 million that we are losing \nbecause of Enron. It is because they went bankrupt. It is not because \nthey are not reconciling, because they are not paying taxes. They do \nnot have anything with which to pay the taxes.\n  One of the problems with this bill is that we have gotten into a \nfeeding frenzy. I think of Enron as this huge, dead carcass. In \nWyoming, we have kind of a pecking order of feeding. There are the \ngrizzly bears, there are the wolves, and there are the coyotes. Each of \nthem come up and take their bite out of the carcass, but not until the \nprevious one has finished, and that is kind of the way that we are \nhandling this bill.\n  We have this huge carcass of Enron, and we are trying to figure out \nhow to get rid of it and make sure we do not have any more carcasses. \nWe have a bill that has the primary right to feed on it. Then we have \nthe wolves, which are the germane amendments, that have the right to \nfeed on it. Then we have the coyotes, which do not have any right until \neverything else is finished. Those are the nongermane amendments.\n  What we are trying to say is let us get this carcass finished off \nbefore we have a whole bunch more carcasses, before the stock market \nhas more problems. They are a little bit worried about us working on \nthis stuff at all, and if they see an amendment like this with the \noversimplification being thrust on this legislative body to make a \nmassive accounting decision, they ought to panic. We do not want that \nto happen.\n  There are a lot of reasons this amendment should not be passed should \nit ever come to a vote, and I hope everybody would do that. Now, I have \nan option I had drafted up. I have over 25 cosponsors from both sides \nof the aisle now. It deals with stock options. What it does is put it \nback on FASB to come up with a proper solution and gives them some \nguidelines to look at. That would be the way to handle a massive \nproblem like this with a lot of detail for which none of us, including \nme, have the expertise.\n  I am kind of fascinated that Warren Buffett is the main authority on \nstock options these days. As I look at it, there are several camps of \npeople that are opposed to stock options, not opposed to the accounting \nof stock options. They are flat out opposed to stock options. Warren \nBuffett is one of those. And that is because when stock options are \nexercised, it dilutes his stock. I think he probably has more stock \nthan anybody else in the whole world, and I guess if I had more stock \nthan anybody else in the whole world I would have gotten there by being \nsure that every single piece of that was accounted for. Unfortunately, \nthat is not the case. But that would give one some compunction to make \nsure that none of it can be diluted, which is what stock options have \nthe possibility of doing.\n  It is also based on the premise that the company is going to grow and \nexpand, and that is why all of the people who are employees are willing \nto take stock options instead of hard cash. I think all of them would \nlove to have hard cash as Berkshire is doing.\n  I suspect that the hard cash does not come to quite as much as the \nincrease in value of the stock. So given an option between hard cash \nand potential in a company that you yourself can work in, you yourself \nbelieve in, you yourself know can grow, you want to participate in all \nof that economic growth. So stock options would be something that might \nlure you from another company, that might lure you into a startup \ncompany, that might lure your expertise to where you can make this \ncompany grow.\n  One of the questions that was asked was: If stock options are not a \nform of compensation, what are they? At the time they are granted, they \nare not anything. There is no assurance of them being worth anything. \nThey are a potential liability, and there are some models for \ndetermining how to calculate that. They are very complicated. I am not \neven sure an accountant can handle all of those things. I think they \nhave computer models now that are designed by engineers that go through \nthis thing to calculate what that worth would be so they could put down \nsome number on their balance sheet. Or they can use the other option, \nwhich is to disclose it in a footnote. If I wanted to devote more time \nto this, I would bring over a chart that shows the disclosure that is \nin the footnote.\n  So if people read the annual report of the corporation, they know \nwhat the potential dilution and value of those stock options are.\n  Then the next two questions are: If compensation is not an expense, \nthen what is it? And if expenses should not go in this calculation, \nwhere should they go? Those are two questions built on a false premise. \nThat is why it makes it difficult to answer the last two questions. If \nyou answer the first one, the next two are not answerable.\n  Like I said, if I were one of those people such as Warren Buffett who \nwanted to do away with stock options, that is the attack I would take. \nI would appreciate it if they were a little more honest: We just want \nto do away with stock options.\n  There is another group of people who say all the stock options go to \nthe top employees and consequently they do not want stock options \neither, but the honest part of that is that they do not want stock \noptions either.\n  I heard all the references to the newspapers that say expense these \nthings. Of course, I know that all the newspapers have all the \ntechnical expertise to make that kind of an evaluation. I say that \nfacetiously, of course.\n  Senator Sarbanes and I have been working on this accounting bill for \nmonths, and as we went through the hearings that he did with so much \ncare, very carefully picking the people with the most expertise to be \nable to explain to us what went wrong in the Enron situation and what \ncould be done in the future to prevent that sort of thing from \nhappening again, it was very educational and he did a magnificent job.\n  While we were going through that process, I was keeping notes and he \nwas keeping notes. I think everybody else in the Banking Committee was \nkeeping notes. From those notes, several of us drafted up a bill. I \nnoticed that an editorial in the Washington Post down near the end said \nsomething needed to be done, which all of us agree on, and then down at \nthe end it says Senator Enzi's bill is a sham.\n\n  My first reaction was to get ahold of them and say: Can I talk to the \naccountant that looked at my bill? Well, the newspaper has journalists, \nnot accountants. It might be a small flaw in expertise even on stock \noption expensing. I have not seen anything in there since I continued \nto work with Senator Sarbanes, and some of the principles I had in mind \nwere some of the same principles that he had, and those were easy to \nresolve. Some of the other ones that I had wound up in the bill and are \nin this bill that we have before us now. I have not seen any editorial \nthat recognizes their expertise of that evaluation either.\n  There were comments about Chairman Greenspan, and I did read the \nspeech he gave. As soon as I read the speech he gave, I wanted a little \nbit more information. So I asked if I could get together with him, and \nhe was nice enough to come to my office. Through the discussion, which, \nagain, was educational, I keep learning things every day. This is such \na marvelous institution for education. One of the things he concluded \nwith was to say: Yes, they should be expensed, but Congress should not \ndecide how that is done. He was not in favor of us passing something \nthat said how to handle stock options. I think he could see the wisdom \nor the folly, whichever way you want to consider it.\n  Now, one may have guessed that I am in opposition to the McCain \namendment on expensing stock options. I\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\nthink there are some other ways of doing it better. I think there are \nways that it could actually be voted on by this group if it were done \nbetter. I do not think the one that is presented is the one that is \nvotable, and I assume he will work with us and make some changes.\n  As we all know, Enron's executives and employees were issued numerous \nstock options. It is now clear that months before Enron filed for \nbankruptcy, executives were aware of the true condition of the company. \nThey exercised millions of dollars of options. Enron employees kept in \nthe dark on company finances are left with worthless Enron stock, and \nretirement savings, while some bad Enron executives absconded with \nstock openings. The financial fraud causing the collapse of Enron had \nnothing to do with the company's accounting procedures for stock \noptions.\n\n  I appreciate my colleagues' effort to try to fix the problems posed \nby Enron, and perhaps WorldCom and Xerox and Global Crossing as we get \ninto those. Congress must react to what happened with Enron, but it \nmust be careful not to overreact. I have a principle with legislation \nhaving watched it for a long time: If it is worth reacting to, it is \nworth overreacting to. It goes back to the feeding frenzy on the huge \ncarcass that is here--an overreaction, adding things to one up or \noutbid.\n  While legislation may be appropriate to ensure employees are \nprotected and prevent future Enrons from occurring, we should not do \nanything to hamper rank-and-file employees from receiving stock in \ntheir company. A couple of years ago we passed a bill that went through \nboth Houses by unanimous consent. That bill was so that the rank-and-\nfile employees could get it without more difficult accounting. We said \nwe want the rank-and-file folks to have it. We passed a bill by \nunanimous consent. That means everybody who was here at the time said \nyes, that is good, without any amendments. That is tough to do around \nhere. It was a definite recognition we wanted all employees to have \nstock options. When properly used, stock options can be a marvelous \nopportunity for all of the employees.\n  In addition, as I mentioned, small businesses and startup companies \nmust continue to have an incentive to issue options, which is often \ntheir only means to attract qualified employees. I feel so strongly \nabout protecting stock options for rank-and-file employees in small \nbusinesses that on April 18 of this year I testified before the Finance \nCommittee against the legislation in this McCain amendment, although it \nhad more detail to it so it made a little bit more sense. This was \nrevised so it could perhaps meet the test of not being blue-slipped by \nthe House because it has the potential for being a revenue issue.\n  I am against this amendment because it seriously hurts employees, \nsmall businesses, startup companies, and in general the high-tech \nindustry and many listed corporations which employ thousands of \nemployees. This legislation will not solve the problem of Enron, that \ndead carcass I referred to, or WorldCom, which is still out there \nkicking a little bit, Xerox, and perhaps failing dot-com companies, but \ninstead it will create additional problems for the rank-and-file \nemployees of the small and large corporations because they will no \nlonger get the benefit of stock options. Why? Because companies will no \nlonger have an incentive but, rather, a disincentive to grant them.\n  We have all heard that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and \nWarren Buffett support the purpose behind the McCain legislation \nbecause they believe stock options should be treated as compensation. \nAdmittedly, they may at some point become compensation, but there is \ndisagreement at what point that is. Even Chairman Greenspan admitted to \nme, as I mentioned earlier, that Congress should not legislate \nexpensing but that the Federal Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, \nshould make such a determination.\n  This is not an easy determination, although in our discussions we \nmake it sound like an easy determination. Concepts are much easier than \nthe detail. That is what makes our legislating so difficult. We can all \nagree on huge concepts, but when you figure out the details of how you \nget to that, it becomes very difficult.\n\n  Secretary O'Neill disagrees that expensing of stock options is a \nsolution and believes better disclosure provisions would cure the \ncurrent problem with regard to stock options. The McCain-Levin bill is \ncreating the same debate over expensing stock options on company \nfinancial statements that occurred a few years ago. At that time, the \nsolution was to give companies the option of listing the number of \nstock options issued by a company in a footnote to the financial sheets \nor directly on its income or financial statements as an expense. Either \nway, investors and employees have the ability to see how much stock is \noutstanding before they invest in the company or before they exercise \ntheir stock options. These footnotes provide a lot more information to \nshareholders or investors than you might imagine, or than the \nsupporters of the McCain amendment would like you to believe.\n  Some would like you to believe the average person out there doesn't \nhave the ability to read a footnote, let alone understand it. I think \nat any meeting of employees they would have people contesting that. \nThey look at some of those annual reports, probably more so than some \nof the major investors. Some of it is difficult to understand. \nFinancial literacy is difficult but very important when you are \ninvesting.\n  It was mentioned that Berkshire buys companies and switches to cash \nbonuses. It does not cause any problem. The problem is, except cash \nbonus, you lose your job. Now if they had the option between cash \nbonuses and a stock option, in a growing company, which would they \ntake? It is hard to tell.\n  Rather than estimate the value of stock options and expense them on \nthe balance sheets, the companies estimate them in a footnote using \nsomething called the Black-Scholes model. That is because they don't \nknow what the future value of the stock will be when the option is \nactually exercised and sold. That is very important because I have seen \na number of different proposals on this, and one of them, unless you \nexpensed it and guess exactly what it was at the time you expensed it, \nyou are not allowed to claim any additional expense. But they don't \nrealize these things are reconciled so that there is a running value of \nactually expensed items.\n  Again, that gets into a lot of the accounting detail that would put \npeople to sleep. I have some fascinating charts I would love to drag \nout, but I have already lost most of my audience so I won't do that. \nThey use that model because they don't know what the future value of \nthe stock will be when the stock option is actually exercised and sold. \nSo they attempt to make an educated guess. Their footnote predicts what \nthe expense might be and the diluted earnings per share for the \noutstanding stock.\n  Currently, most companies list the outstanding stock options as a \nnote to their financial statements. Unlike Boeing, Microsoft, Winn \nDixie, and a few other companies, most companies do not want to list \nthe options as an expense on their financial statement because it \ncreates a perception of a drop in value of the company, even though the \nstock options have not yet been exercised. In other words, there has \nbeen no expense yet and may not be an expense if the options are never \nexercised. Yet under the McCain amendment, companies must list these \nstock options as an actual expense to their company when granted. This \nwould mean taking the estimated value in a footnote and making it an \nexpense to the company.\n  A problem with expensing early on, how do you value stock options \nwhich have been granted but not exercised or sold? Almost everyone \nbelieves the current practice of using the Black-Scholes method to \nvalue stock options as currently used on footnotes is fatally flawed. \nUnder the McCain amendment, companies are going to now have to use this \nflawed model to make a guess at what the value of the options are to \ndetermine an expense to the company.\n  The tax consequences will also be based on this flawed estimate. But \nlater, when some of the stock options are exercised and the value is \ndifferent than estimated, this amendment provides no opportunity for a \nreconciliation of company records or taxes.\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\nThat is kind of an accounting principle that there is supposed to be an \nexplanation for how taxes match up with the books of the company. Yes, \nwe do force different kinds of calculations for taxes than we do for \nthe accounting that goes to the stockholders. But the accountants are \nable to draw the reconciliation, they are able to show how one number \ngoes to another number. That is a requirement, as well.\n  Currently, when the estimates are placed in the footnote, they appear \nas what they are, a best guess at their value, with no effects on the \ncompany's books and no need for reconciliation of records later. Yet an \ninvestor can see what outstanding, possible estimated expense might \noccur to the company.\n  Another problem with the McCain amendment is it does not provide for \na method of reconciliation if the stock options are never exercised. So \nwhat appeared as an expense may never happen, yet the value of that \nstock actually goes down instead of up. No one would buy the option and \nhave it cost more than just going out and buying stock. So it is not \nexercised. So what appears as an expense may never happen, yet the \nfinancial statement prepared months before reflects an expense and a \ndecrease in company profit that never occurred. Meanwhile, the current \nfootnote method shows this estimate to investors as a worst case \nscenario of what could occur if all the options were exercised but no \nreconciliation were required.\n  As a result, the McCain amendment creates a disincentive for \ncompanies to issue stock options to those rank-and-file employees.\n  If this amendment becomes law, many companies will cut back on giving \nstock options to rank-and-file employees rather than list those options \nas an expense, and create a perception of a decrease in the value of a \ncompany when the stock options are not yet an expense and may never be \nexercised. This means employees will lose a valuable means of \nincreasing their income.\n  But, these companies are not going to cease offering CEOs and senior \nexecutives this form of compensation--that is deferred compensation. \nBig companies will continue to issue stock options to attract the best \ntalent to top levels of their companies, because this is the only way \nthey can get the most talented management personnel. Despite what the \nmedia and supporters of this amendment want you to believe, stock \noptions are not issued to just executives. In fact, those who claim \nonly a small percentage of stock options are offered to rank-and-file \ncompanies are misguided. For example, Sun Microsystems, which has \napproximately 40,000 employees, distributed only 9 percent of its stock \noptions to executives in 2000 and 2001. In contrast, distribution of \nstock options to employees who were not executives was a whopping 91 \npercent for both those years.\n  This is not an isolated example. In 1998, over 66 percent of large \ncompanies gave options to some portion of their non-executive \nworkforce. Of this group, 26 percent granted options to all their \nworkers and another 15 percent gave options to at least half of their \nemployees. A 2000 survey of Pricewaterhouse-Coopers and the National \nAssociation of Stock Plan Professionals reported 44 percent of 345 \nlarge domestic companies with stock option plans made grants to all \nemployees, including hourly employees. The San Francisco Chronicle \nreports that in the technology sector, this percentage is even higher. \nOf the top 100 e-commerce companies, 97 percent give options to all \ntheir employees.\n  The San Francisco Chronicle also points out that:\n\n       Ten years ago, about a million workers were in a few \n     hundred employee stock programs around the country.\n\n  In 2001, that number had grown to 10 millions Americans receiving \nstock options. The National Center for Employee Ownership confirmed the \ntrend is toward more non-managers receiving stock options. However, the \nLevin legislation will stop this trend by having a negative effect on \ncompanies which offer stock option compensation packages to their rank-\nand-file employees. The McCain/Levin Amendment will also hurt small \nbusinesses and start-up companies which cannot afford to offer the \nsalaries larger companies give, so they offer stock options as an \nincentive to attract highly-skilled employees. And it works. They do \nnot have the hard cash for bonuses, but they have stock options. In \nturn, employees that risk working for start-up companies have the \nability to make much more money than through traditional methods of \npayment by salaries or wages.\n  The National Commission on Entrepreneurship points out that, without \nstock options, startup companies which are now household names, like \nIntel, Federal Express, Apple, Dell and Starbuck, would not exist. In \naddition, the McCain-Levin bill will cause the whole tax structure to \ndramatically change. Currently, when stock options are granted or \nissued there is no tax consequence for either the employer or employee. \nBut when stock options are exercised, the employees are taxed as if it \nis ordinary income. The income amount is based on the difference \nbetween the market price and the exercise price.\n  Of course, if it goes down and there are not stock options exercised, \nthen there is no income tax because there is no gain.\n  I do have some charts, again, too, that show that the Federal \nGovernment does receive the taxes that are due, unless there is a \nbankruptcy.\n  At the same time, the employer can take a deduction based on the \namount equal to what is considered income to the employees. For \nexample, if the amount is $25,000 worth of income to employees, the \ncompany may take a deduction based on the same amount, $25,000, times \nits marginal tax rate. If the marginal tax rate is 35 percent, the \ncompany would have a tax savings of $8,700. This deduction provides a \nuseful incentive for a company to offer options to its rank-and-file \nemployees. Unfortunately, the McCain-Levin bill will force companies to \nlist the numbers of stock options issued as an expense on its financial \nstatement before they can take the current tax deduction. And they way \nthat this particular amendment is written, it will have to be a \nrestatement for all the years for which there are stock options out. As \nI mentioned, this added expense to the financial statement alone is a \ndisincentive for companies to issue stock options. In addition, under \nthe McCain-Levin amendment, the tax treatment of the deduction totally \nchanges, becoming much more complicated because it involves valuing \nstock that has never been exercised. The tax complexity created by this \namendment is another disincentive for companies to issue stock options \nto rank-and-file employees.\n  Add to all of this, the fact that stock options are not all exercised \nat the same time. But that is the optional part of it. When you are \ngiven a stock option, you have the control over when you personally \nwant to take the stock option or not take the stock option.\n\n  Then there are some other interesting amendments out there that could \ndeal with stock options and whether lawyers could ever exercise them, \nor whether they would have to reinvest them--a lot of complications. \nBut even assuming they are exercised at the same time, the McCain \namendment imposes much more complexity to the current system.\n  Again, I have some charts that could show how all that complexity \ncomes about, but it looks as if we are ready to move on to another \ndecision here so I will pass on that.\n  If I have confused anybody, I know that I have not confused them \nnearly as much as if I showed them how this actually worked. This is \nnot easy stuff. I guess that is what keeps accountants in business. It \nreally isn't all the taxes that people pay, although a lot of the \nrevenue comes from figuring the taxes.\n  I do hear from accountants who say: You really need to simplify the \nsystem. Yes, I do hear from accountants that way--not just about this \nsystem but the tax system as well. There is plenty of work out there \nfor them to do and not enough accountants, and there are less and less \nevery day. However, I think I have made one thing crystal clear--99 \nSenators with no accounting degree, and 1 Senator with an accounting \ndegree, have no business trying to rewrite the accounting methods of \npublicly listed companies. In other words, if you or your staff don't \nunderstand any of this, then you shouldn't vote for the McCain-Levin \namendment. Instead, the Federal Accounting Standards Board, or even the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, have much more expertise to make \nthese determinations. We can direct them to look at\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\ncurrent accounting methods, rather than passing specific legislation on \nreplacing the current system. We can direct them to look at possibly \ndeveloping a better pricing model to value stock options than the Black \nScholes method. We can ask it to look at possibly improving disclosure \nprovisions to better inform investors, including using plain English \nand charts and graphs. We should direct them to create rules that \ncontinue to promote ownership of company stock by employees, rather \nthan providing disincentives to companies in granting stock options. \nLet's let the entities with expertise study and recommend what will \nprevent future Enrons. Otherwise, we may create a remedy that is worse \nthan the disease.\n\n  As mentioned before, I worked with Senator Lieberman and Senator \nAllen and Senator Boxer and numerous other Senators to come up with an \namendment that would give some direction to FASB. It would show them \nthat we do want them to take a look at this, that it is a priority, and \nthat we would like to have a solution as soon as possible, but not one \nthat will destroy the entire market, not one that will require \nretroactive restatements for all of the companies to bring them up to a \nspecific present point.\n  There will be companies that will choose to do that, but in the \npresent atmosphere that could be very detrimental to the entire stock \nmarket. So I hope we will not try to go with something oversimplified \nas the McCain amendment is, and that we will take a look at making sure \nthat options are treated properly, as we are trying to do in this bill, \nwith all accounting. We are trying to set up a mechanism--a mechanism, \nnot specific language on accounting--a mechanism for determining proper \naccounting, and I think the bill before us does a good job of doing \nthat. It sets up oversight for discipline and ethics. It will be the \nfirst time that we have had centralized any profession. But it will \nsolve some problems, and it needs to be done quickly for the sake of \nthe stock market. I am sure we will get to address this at a later \ntime.\n  I heard the threat of the Senator from Arizona. I hope in the \nmeantime that his threat will include a little rewrite that gives a \nlittle bit more latitude and puts the situation in the hands of the \npeople who actually have some expertise on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to talk briefly today about how \nAmerica got caught in the current quicksand of corporate scandal and \nhow we can help dig our economy out of it.\n  Our economy is in trouble today not because we have a shortage of \nparts, labor, or ingenuity, but because the American people have a \nshortage of confidence in the basic mechanics of the marketplace. Every \nnew corporate scandal jostles our markets with the force of a jab or an \nuppercut. If the punches keep coming and we don't react, our economy \nwill get even wobblier. It may even get knocked down.\n  Investors are shaken. They don't know what's real anymore. Trust has \neroded. The stock exchanges are suffering. These are serious problems \nthat demand a serious response, which is why I strongly support Senator \nSarbanes' legislation to reform accounting oversight and strengthen \ncorporate accountability.\n  I welcome President Bush's voice to this discussion, and appreciated \nthe principled remarks he made in New York on Tuesday. But the \nPresident's substantive proposals were late and they were limited. I \nregret that he still hasn't committed, and committed forcefully, to the \nmeaningful, systemic reforms in the legislation before the Senate \ntoday. This is a responsive bill. It is a responsible bill. A vote for \nit is a strong vote of confidence in the American economy. And the \nPresident's failure to speak out in favor of it, in my view, sends the \nwrong message to our markets.\n  In the wake of Enron's collapse, I had hopes that self-regulation \ncould heal many of the wounds inflicted on our markets and on our \neconomy. I have called for the markets to toughen listing standards, \nand for companies to make ethics a front-burner issue, not a footnote. \nMany companies have made progress. The stock exchanges and other \nbusiness groups have worked to root out conflicts of interest and to \ndemand more independent corporate oversight.\n  But the new revelations, which seem to come daily, have demonstrated \nthat these problems go far beyond a bad company or two or three. We now \nhave to ask not whether there are more scandals lurking in the fine \nprint, but how many more are there? And we have to ask, what is it \nabout the shape of the system that needs to be corrected to prevent \nsimilar debacles from happening again?\n  The system isn't broken, but it is strained. And we all now \nunderstand that self-regulation, as critical as it is, will not do \nenough to fix the damage.\n  The stakes are high. Over the last two decades we have witnessed an \nexplosion in middle-class participation in the capital markets. A \nmajority of Americans now have a direct stake in stock or mutual funds, \nusually, through their 401-k plans. Those American investors have \ndiscovered, through the painful shock of every new recent revelation, \nthat the basic, traditional ethical values of small businesses, where \nyou respect every dollar, pay back your investors, treat your employees \nwell, and serve your customers honestly, are not always shared in the \nboardrooms of some large corporations.\n  Today and tomorrow, the American people deserve every confidence that \ntheir government is setting the highest standards of honesty, \ntransparency, and accountability and enforcing those standards without \nhesitation.\n  That is why I strongly support Senator Sarbanes' bill. It is a potent \nprescription for the serious ethical ills that ail our economy. The aim \nhere is not just to penalize individuals when fraud happens; it is to \nprevent future economic catastrophes, to the degree that we can, and \nre-instill confidence in the marketplace. I regret that after the \ncollapse of Enron and the pretty pathetic parade that has followed of \nGlobal Crossings, Tycos, ImClones, and WorldComs, the President still \nhasn't awakened to the full scope of the problem or the need for a \nstrong solution like that proposed by Senator Sarbanes.\n  Gene Sperling, former Economic Adviser to President Clinton, put it \nwell. After September 11, we all understood what was necessary to get \npeople back in airports and on airplanes. Cracking down on hijackers \nwith tough new criminal penalties wouldn't be enough. We knew that we \nneeded to improve baggage and passenger screening, fortify cabin doors, \nand make a whole host of other changes that addressed the systemic \nproblems that let the attacks happen in the first place.\n  The same is true here. If we want Americans to regain confidence in \nour economy and get back in the market, as they have gotten back in the \nskies, we need to not only get tough on offenders, but to get tough on \nthe structural problems that enable the offenses. That means closing \nloopholes and rooting out the endemic conflicts of interest that put \neven decent people in difficult if not untenable situations.\n  Senator Sarbanes' bill would set up a strong, independent board to \noversee accountants--a critical step that will give Americans reason to \nbelieve their numbers again. The President hasn't come out clearly in \nfavor of that. The bill would restrict firms from doing both consulting \nand auditing for the same company in most cases, addressing what is a \ncorrosive conflict in the system today. The President hasn't supported \nthat as a law yet. The bill would also go further than the new NASD or \nNYSE rules to address the inherent conflicts of interest that currently \nprevent Wall Street analysts, who make the judgments so many Americans \nrely upon in making their investment decisions, from thoroughly and \nindependently scrutinizing the companies they cover. In the hearings of \nthe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee I chair, we discovered that \nthose conflicts are real, deep, and widespread. Unfortunately, the \nPresident hasn't been strong enough or sharp enough on this issue. And \nthe bill would require disclosure within 7 days anytime a corporate \nexecutive takes a loan from the company he is working for.\n  We in Washington cannot and should not pretend to be able to fix all \nthese problems single-handedly, but we have an essential role to play. \nWe must lead.\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\nAnd at the same time, we must take care not to let this turn into an \nanti-business crusade. I believe in American business. My father was a \nsmall business owner in Stamford, CT. Through hard work he bought a \nhouse, sent his kids to college, prepared for retirement, and bettered \nhis community.\n  You cannot be pro-jobs and anti-business. You can't be pro-growth and \nanti-business. You can't be pro-opportunity and anti-business. Business \nhas created our unprecedented prosperity, and business will continue to \nextend more and more opportunities to more and more Americans and \npeople around the world. But not if we let this erosion of confidence, \nthis rust of distrust, keep eating away at our markets.\n  American values are better than Enron's values. They're better than \nGlobal Crossing's values. They're better than WorldCom's values. And so \nis the American economy better and stronger than these companies' \nethical and economic breaches of trust. This bill will point the way to \nboth better ethics and better economics. It should become law.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support S. 2673, the Public Company \nAccounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002, and I commend \nSenator Sarbanes for his efforts to produce this measure. That it is \nneeded is a sad commentary on the state of corporate finance, but it is \nalso a reminder that free markets do not work well without a set of \nrules and regulations in which the marketplace can be confident. It is \nalso a reminder that if government is to farm out the task of \nregulating corporate finance, then those entities that are designated \nto patrol corporate activities must also have the confidence of the \nmarketplace.\n  The Enron and WorldCom disasters were notable but not isolated. \nObservers have noted the increase in corporate financial restatements \nin recent years. In testimony on this point, Robert Litan of the \nBrookings Institution reports that the number of American corporations \nwhose earnings have been restated had been modestly rising throughout \nthe 1990s, but then took a big jump in 1998 and hit a peak of over 200 \nin 1999. Many reasons have been offered for this development. Some \npoint to the tying of executive compensation to stock performance. \nOthers have noted the potential conflict of interest that arises when a \nfirm provides both auditing and consulting services to the same firm. \nBoth explanations have some merit.\n  And I will add to both of those reasons the enactment of a so-called \nsecurities reform measure in December of 1995, a law that made it more \ndifficult for stockholders to hold corporations and accounting firms \naccountable for bad behavior. One newspaper has characterized that law \nas expanding ``a climate that invites the kinds of securities and \naccounting abuses that investors and employees suffered in Enron's \ncolossal collapse.'' In reviewing the history of that bill, the \nWashington Post reported that ``accountants at what were then the Big \nSix firms lobbied aggressively for the measure, spending millions of \ndollars.'' The Post story also adds a foreboding note that ``leaders of \nArthur Andersen were so pleased with their efforts they encased the \ntext of the new law in a paperweight and handed it out as a souvenir.''\n  The reforms we consider today are extremely modest, and I look \nforward to supporting amendments that will further strengthen this \nbill, including Senator Leahy's amendment that will strengthen \nenforcement and sanctions for securities fraud. That amendment passed \nunanimously out of the Judiciary Committee earlier this year. It \ncreates new criminal laws for altering or shredding documents and \nprovides tough new penalties specifically for securities fraud. It \nprevents wrongdoers from avoiding those monetary damages by filing for \nbankruptcy. It provides specific whistleblower protections for \nemployees who provide information to Federal regulators or criminal \ninvestigator about corporate wrongdoing. And it increases the statutes \nof limitation in securities fraud cases, responding to clear evidence \nthat the shorter time limits put in place by the 1995 securities reform \nlaw have allowed wrongdoers to escape liability. These are necessary \nsteps, and I applaud the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for \nbringing this amendment forward on this bill.\n  We should also consider other steps, if not on this bill then as part \nof another vehicle, to close down abusive tax shelters that encourage \nthe kind of creative bookkeeping used by Enron, and to address the \ndouble standard of allowing certain forms of executive compensation to \nbe deducted from taxes, while remaining hidden from investors.\n  All of these steps face opposition by interests who are more \nconcerned with their own profits and survival than with the public \ninterest. Unfortunately, these interests have held great sway over the \nCongress over the last decade, using soft money contributions and \nlobbying might to smother reform proposals before they could receive a \nfair hearing and action by the Congress. It is very unfortunate that \nthe measures we are considering today were not enacted years ago. If \nthey had been in place, thousands of employees might not have lost \ntheir jobs and millions of investors might not have lost their life \nsavings.\n  Let us not forget that the central players in the scandals of the \npast year are not rogue companies operating at the fringe of American \neconomic life. No, they are some of the biggest companies in the \ncountry, and they have been central players in a corrupt campaign \nfinance system that this Congress finally started to address by passing \nthe McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan bill a few months ago.\n  We have all heard of how Enron curried favor in Government. It gave a \ntotal of nearly $3.7 million in soft money to the political parties \nfrom the 1992 election cycle through June 3 of this year according to \nDemocracy 21. Arthur Anderson made about $645,000 in soft money \ncontributions during that period. Global Crossing gave just over $3 \nmillion to the parties in soft money from the 1998 election cycle to \nthe present. And WorldCom, whose failure has brought us to the point \nwhere we will actually pass these long needed reforms, has given over \n$4 million in soft money, dating back to the 1992 cycle. Just in this \ncycle, with all its problems, WorldCom has already made $400,000 in \nsoft money contributions, according to the Center for Responsive \nPolitics.\n  These are enormous sums. They show, frankly, that our political \nparties are among those who were unjustly enriched by these companies \nwho cheated their shareholders and employees. I understand that some \ncontributions have been returned, but just as in the case of the \nemployees who lost their jobs or the investors who lost their life \nsavings, the damage has been done. The contributions had their intended \neffect when they were given.\n  As I mentioned before, and as we all know, Congress passed and the \nPresident signed a bill to ban soft money earlier this year. So these \nenormous soft money contributions should be a thing of the past \nstarting in the next election cycle. Members of Congress will no longer \nbe allowed to call up the CEOs of Enron, or Arthur Anderson, or Global \nCrossing or WorldCom, or any other corporation, and ask for enormous \ncontributions for the political parties and then have to come back to \nthis floor and vote on legislation that might affect their activities. \nAt least that is what we intended. But in just the last few weeks, the \nFederal Election Commission has undermined the law that we passed after \nso many years of effort. The new regulations on our soft money ban that \nare about to be promulgated open enormous new loopholes in the law \nbefore it even goes into effect. If we want to remove the stain of soft \nmoney from the legislation we pass in this Congress, we cannot allow \nthat to happen.\n  The sponsors of campaign finance reform intend to invoke the \nCongressional Review Act to overturn these regulations. That will send \nthe FEC back to the drawing board to do the job of implementing the law \nright. Doing this is part and parcel of addressing the corporate \nscandals that have led to our work on the floor today on this important \nbill. Unless we defend the soft money ban, the influence of \nunscrupulous corporations on the Congress will continue, and we will \nfind ourselves again in the situation of trying to explain to America \nwhy we didn't act to prevent further corporate and accounting scandals \nor other scandals before they happened.\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\n  According to Consumers Union, just over half of all U.S. households \nare investing in the stock market, many through their retirement \nsavings. If the public is to have confidence in the financial markets, \nthey must have a complete and honest accounting of the financial health \nof the firms in which they invest. This bill is a good starting place, \nand I look forward to supporting it. And I look forward to maintaining \npublic confidence in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 by \noverturning the FEC's loophole-ridden regulations before they take \neffect.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as Congress debates S. 2673, the Public \nCompany Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002, it is \nimportant to keep in mind certain facts: The United States of America \nis the most successful country in the world. No other country outworks, \noutproduces, or economically outperforms the United States. Americans \nhave much to be proud of and it is due to the vigor of our businesses, \nthe entrepreneurial spirit of our citizens, and the willingness of both \nto take risks. For hundreds of years, people from every corner of the \nglobe have chosen to come to our country and pursue what has become \nknown to the world as the American Dream.\n  The American Dream can and should be available to all Americans who, \nwith diligence, determination, and a sound moral compass, choose to \npursue it. Unquestionably, our government has an important role to play \nin ensuring its viability. By the passage and enforcement of laws to \nprotect Americans seeking to achieve success, lawmakers reaffirm that \nAmerica's prosperity rests on the rule of law, on the existence of \nsafeguards, checks, and balances to ensure that all compete fairly in \nthe marketplace. These protections must be transparent and easy to \nunderstand. This is not only so that businesses and individuals can \nreadily determine what distinguishes appropriate from inappropriate \naction, but so that all may have faith in the governmental bodies \ntasked with enforcing the rules.\n  The implosion of Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, and other public \ncompanies has caused widespread concern about the soundness of American \nbusinesses. Public confidence in corporate practices has been \nundermined, and serious questions have been raised about the accuracy \nof corporate audits and the integrity of auditors. Many Americans have \nbecome worried that neither internal corporate safeguards nor the \ngovernment's financial oversight mechanisms are functioning properly.\n  I share these concerns and I am glad that the Senate is seeking to \naddress them. All Americans have a stake in a healthy business climate, \nand we know that health depends on having an ethical business climate. \nWhile the past two decades have unleashed a tidal wave of \nentrepreneurship and successful business growth, we have also \nwitnessed, most notably throughout the late 1990's, an ``anything \ngoes'' relativism that has increasingly penetrated our corporate \nbusiness and political culture.\n  We've always taught our children a moral principle well expressed by \nMacauley: that ``The measure of a man's real character is what he would \ndo if he knew he would never be found out.'' We do so because, as \nparents, we know that we cannot supervise our children forever. When \nthey face, as they inevitably will, a choice between the easy road of \ncheating or the tough road of following the rules, we want them to \nchoose right, not wrong.\n  Sadly, this lesson seems to have been forgotten lately. In the haze \nof morally gray areas, corporate executives have come right up against \nthe limits of what is acceptable behavior, and in several cases, have \ngone beyond it. What's worse, these companies' boards of directors have \nstood by in the face of wrongdoing, either unable to discover it or \nunwilling to rouse themselves to take corrective action.\n  I am very troubled by the inability of the markets to see through the \nphony numbers being generated by these enterprises. As a result, \naverage investors no longer enjoy the protections put in place to \nensure accountability and transparency. I agree with President Bush, \nwho said that ``to properly inform shareholders and the investing \npublic we must adopt better standards of disclosure and accounting \npractices for all of corporate America.''\n  Yesterday, President Bush outlined an aggressive plan to rejuvenate \nthe mechanisms that ensure corporate responsibility. This plan will \nexpose and punish acts of corruption, make corporate accounting \nstandards more transparent, and protect small investors and pension \nholders. The President has urged Congress to adopt tough new criminal \npenalties and enforcement provisions in order to punish those who \nrefuse to play by the rules and who choose to undermine the integrity \nof our financial markets.\n  The House of Representatives have already passed legislation \naddressing this slippage in corporate responsibility, while also \npermitting enough legal and regulatory flexibility to tackle future \nproblems. Rather than seeking to provide a statutory answer for every \ncurrent deficiency and every recent transgression, the House bill \nrecognizes that this is a job for experts and gives the Securities and \nExchange Commission the authority necessary to prevent future abuses.\n  By attempting to legislate detailed accounting standards, the bill \nbefore us puts Congress in the position of micro-managing details that \nwe know less about than SEC experts. So, the legislation before the \nSenate represents a less workable approach than the President's \nproposal. Although I support its goals, particularly the need to \nimprove the quality of independent audits and financial reporting and \nensure meaningful accountability by executives of public companies, \nthis bill has other specific problems.\n  For example, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which \nwould be created by the bill, would be allowed to begin proceedings \nagainst accounting firms without affording them the same due-process \nprotections they would have in court. Their livelihood could be at \nstake. Certainly, bad actors should be held accountable for wrongdoing. \nBut our system of justice has always had safeguards to protect the \ninnocent; checks need to be in placed to prevent the wielding of \nunbridled government power.\n\n  The bill would make accountants liable for not reporting ``any \nmaterial noncompliance'' with the law that auditors ``should know'' \nabout. What does that mean? That standard is so vague that it is \ncertain to invite a flood of litigation. Unfortunately, we have had \nsome experience with frivolous lawsuits trumped up by trial lawyers \nover alleged securities violations.\n  Section 105 of the bill establishes liability for any ``failure to \nsupervise,'' another vague standard that is likely to invite \nlitigation.\n  Again, let me say that bad actors must be held accountable for \nwrongdoing. But as we attempt to root out and punish the wrongdoers, we \nmust be mindful of the impact legislation will have on the greater \nnumber of people who are acting in good faith. Setting up a system that \nis too costly to comply with, or one that even good people find too \nonerous to comply with, will ultimately harm the very people we are \ntrying to protect--employees, retirees, and others who have invested in \nAmerican corporations. If the liability potential is too great, it will \nbe hard for many businesses to obtain accounting services at a \nreasonable cost.\n  Fortunately, we can still improve the bill in conference, before we \nsend it to the President and he must decide whether to sign it.\n  And while we're at it, the Senate would be wise to look at its own \nfinancial practices. We, too, are accountable to the American people. \nThe Budget Enforcement Act of 1974 requires Congress to approve a \nbudget resolution on how much the government can spend each fiscal \nyear. Yet, this year, the Majority has refused to bring a budget to the \nSenate floor. This is unprecedented and unacceptable. The majority is \nabrogating its duty to the Senate and the American people. Its stubborn \nrefusal to do what is right, while the whole country watches, is \nindefensible. Its eagerness to hammer away at what are admittedly acts \nof wrongdoing in American business, while gliding over its own \ndereliction of duty in the same general area--is breathtakingly \nhypocritical.\n  So while we work to pass these important reforms, we must remember \nthat, like the CEOs of public companies, we, too, have an ethical duty \nto protect and use wisely other people's\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\nmoney. I would remind my colleagues that it is thoroughly disingenuous \nto rise today to demand clean accounting practices by the private \nsector, while failing to ensure even basic general accounting standards \nfor the federal government.\n  In closing, consider the thoughts of George Will on capitalism and \nethics. Mr. Will wrote that a properly functioning free-market system \nis ``a complex creation of laws and mores that guarantee, among much \nelse, transparency, meaning a sufficient stream, a torrent, really, of \nreliable information about the condition and conduct of corporations. \nBy casting a cool eye on Enron's debris and those who made it, \ngovernment can strengthen an economic system that depends on it.''\n  I am confident that, despite these recent abuses of the public's \ntrust, our economy and our system remain fundamentally sound and \nstrong. The vast majority of businesspeople respect legal norms and \nlive by them. We will make our free enterprise system better for them, \nand for all Americans, by penalizing those who did wrong and repairing \ncreaky enforcement mechanisms. The President has acted. The House has \nacted. Now it is time for the Senate to act, to return trust, \naccountability and transparency to our financial institutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the effects of a \nnatural disaster that lingers across much of the west, drought. There \nis not a segment of the New Mexico population that will not be touched, \nin some form or fashion, by drought this year.\n  People in other parts of the country have turned on their television \nsets over the past few weeks and have seen the blazes of catastrophic \nwildfires that are again devastating the western United States. This \nmay be the only effect of the drought that many are aware of. Let me \ntell you, the devastation is even more profound.\n  Ranchers are being forced to sell off livestock because they can't \nfind enough water for them and can't afford the significant feed costs. \nOther agricultural businesses are being forced to shut their doors \nbecause the agriculture sector as a whole is hurting.\n  Most of the National Forests in New Mexico are closed to the public. \nThis has added to a decrease in tourism. Let me mention a couple of \nspecific examples. First of all, there is a small railroad, the \nhistoric Cumbres and Toltec Railroad, that takes people through a very \nbeautiful part of the State. The railroad contributes to the tourism \nand economic stability of a very poor part of the State. That railroad \nhas had to close because it runs through National Forest system lands \nand the fear that the railroad might spark and start a wildfire is a \nthreat to imminent to risk. A second example is the river rafting \noperations that have been forced to cease operations because of the \ndrought conditions and lack of river flows.\n  Municipal and private wells are running dry. In the City of Santa Fe, \nemergency wells for municipal water use are needed because Santa Fe's \nwater storage is at 18 percent capacity, the spring run off is only at \n2 percent, and current wells are pumping 24 hours a day. The City of \nSanta Fe is at a Stage 3 water shortage emergency, which allows outdoor \nwatering once a week, but the City Council is considering going to \nStage 4, which would eliminate all outdoor watering. To put this in \nperspective, the last substantial rain for the area was in late \nJanuary.\n  A recent article in the New York Times accurately depicts the dire \nsituation. It talks about how gardening in a desert is challenging, \nespecially during a drought and at a time of mandatory water \nrestrictions. The article went on to talk about people spray painting \nplastic flowers and artificial turf, while also using freeze dried \nplants to beautify porches and other areas.\n  Santa Fe is only one of the numerous municipalities that have imposed \nrestrictions on water use. The article also notes that these \nrestrictions are enforced by ``water police'' and that violators face \nsteep fines ranging from $20 for a first offense to $200 for a fourth \noffense and stay at $200 for each repeat violation.\n  A second article appearing in the Albuquerque Journal, referenced a \n``drought reduction'' cattle sale. The sale took place last week on the \nedge of the Navajo reservation. While most livestock sales generally \ntake place on the reservation during September and October, this year \nemergency sales are being held almost every weekend. Hundreds of \ncattle, horses and sheep have already died as a result of the severe \ndrought conditions.\n  The article goes on to describe the severity of the conditions. \n``Stock ponds have gone dry, fish have died in evaporating lakes, and \ngrass has disappeared. Sand blows across reservation roads, and the \nstiff bodies of dead cattle litter the land.''\n  The seriousness of the water situation in New Mexico becomes more \nacute every single day. I reiterate that every single New Mexican will \nfeel the impact of this drought in one way or another--whether they are \nselling off the essence of their livelihood--livestock, or losing daily \nrevenues in other small business, whether they are actually having to \nrefrain from watering their own lawns and washing their cars to looking \nfor alternative recreational opportunities this summer, the drought and \nits devastation is very real.\n  There is a need out west and I stand ready to do what I can. It will \nbe a monumental and expensive challenge, but one we cannot avoid. I ask \nunanimous consent that the two articles referenced in my remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 8, 2002]\n\n               In Santa Fe, It's Time to Paint the Plants\n\n       Gardening in a desert is challenging. Gardening in a desert \n     in a drought is tough. Gardening in a desert in a drought at \n     a time of mandatory water restrictions is ridiculous.\n       It's enough to make a hard-core gardener break out the \n     spray paint and feather dusters. Why? To brighten the \n     artificial turf and plastic flowers, of course, and to keep \n     the cobwebs off the freeze-dried evergreens.\n       ``Isn't this a hoot?'' said Kay Hendricks, a 70-year-old \n     interior designer who cheerfully pointed out a now-dead \n     wisteria vine as she stuffed a plastic sprig of purple \n     lavender into a pot of freshly painted silk red flowers. ``A \n     little red paint will make any flower a geranium.''\n       In a whirlwind tour of her home, Ms. Hendricks showed off a \n     bouquet of what may have once been silk purple zinnias, now \n     painted red to match an American flag hanging on her garage; \n     a potted four-foot-tall plastic cactus with fake thorns; and \n     English ivy with fake dewdrops draped from another pot.\n       With drought gripping several Western states this summer, \n     Santa Fe is one of a number of municipalities that have \n     instituted mandatory restrictions on lawn watering, car \n     washing and other uses of water. The restrictions are \n     enforced by ``water police,'' who can impose steep fines and \n     even decrease water flows to scofflaws' homes. Phone lines \n     have been set up so people can report wasteful neighbors to \n     city officials.\n       Fines for illegal watering here start at $20 and go up to \n     $200 after the fourth offense, and then stay at $200 for each \n     repeated violation.\n       ``There is a guilt to watering things,'' said Mary Thomas, \n     manager of the American Country Collection furniture store in \n     downtown Santa Fe. She used to plant colorful annuals in pots \n     outside her store each spring, but now she has 18 freeze-\n     dried miniature evergreens instead.\n       ``They don't have to be watered and we can paint them if \n     they lose their color,'' she said. Ms. Thomas said her \n     parents liked the freeze-dried trees so much that they bought \n     some for their own patio.\n       The city is at a Stage 3 water shortage emergency, which \n     allows outdoor watering once a week, but the City Council is \n     considering going to Stage 4, which would eliminate all \n     outdoor watering. Reservoirs that the city relies on for \n     water are at 23 percent of normal capacity, and the last \n     substantial rain was in late January, said Chandra Marsh, a \n     water conservation educator and compliance specialist with \n     the City of Santa Fe Water Department.\n       Not every plant here is fake or dead. Established low-water \n     perennials are surviving, and hollyhocks and lilies can be \n     seen blooming here and there. But, Ms. Marsh said, it is \n     difficult to establish many plants without regular watering.\n       It seems as if everyone in this town is either adding a few \n     silk and plastic plants to their yards, or knows someone who \n     is doing\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\n     so while letting the grass die in the baking dry heat.\n       Mary Branham, 71, has switched from pots with nearly 200 \n     red geraniums to all silk and plastic plants and flowers this \n     year. ``It seemed irresponsible even when we can water once a \n     week,'' she said. Ms. Branham's terra cotta pots now have \n     blue hydrangeas, ornamental grasses, orange marigolds and \n     pink and purple lilacs ``planted'' in the soil.\n       She said she now dusts her flowers twice a week.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Albuquerque Journal, July 7, 2002]\n\n                          It's Like the Sahara\n\n                         (By Leslie Linthicum)\n\n       Life-draining drought drives ranchers on Navajo reservation \n     to sell off gaunt livestock.\n       About 200 people filled the stands of the Naschitti \n     Livestock Association arena on the eastern edge of the Navajo \n     reservation last week, waiting for the start of what was \n     being billed as a ``drought reduction'' cattle sale.\n       Livestock auctions usually take place on the reservation in \n     September and October, when sheep and cattle are fat.\n       But this is a year when the reservation is baking in one of \n     the worst droughts anyone can remember, and hundreds of \n     cattle, horses and sheep have already died. This year, \n     emergency sales have been cropping up almost every weekend.\n       In a place where harmony is prized and people live close to \n     the land, hot afternoon winds carry fear and uneasiness as \n     the landscape becomes ever drier and prayers for rainfall go \n     unanswered. Stock ponds have gone dry, fish have died in \n     evaporating lakes, and grass has disappeared. Sand blows \n     across reservation roads, and the stiff bodies of dead cattle \n     liter the land.\n       ``It's bad, really bad,'' said John Blueeyes, director of \n     the tribe's agriculture department. ``Mother Nature's not too \n     nice to us lately.''\n       Sagebrush turns black.\n       Livestock are not the only victims of the lingering \n     drought.\n       Last week an elk cow wandered into The Gap, a community on \n     the edge of the Grand Canyon, desperate for water.\n       She jumped a fence and sought relief in a sewage lagoon, \n     where she died and lay floating three days later.\n       Many Farms Lake on the Arizona side of the reservation \n     usually spreads across about 1,500 acres, shimmering in the \n     summer sun and inviting fishermen to try their luck catching \n     bass and catfish.\n       With no water flowing in the creeks and washes that feed \n     it, the lake has gone completely dry. It is now a 2\\1/2\\-\n     square-mile, crackly graveyard for tens of thousands of fish.\n       At the base of Gray Mountain just east of the Grand Canyon, \n     usually hardy sagebrush has turned black.\n       Elsewhere, sand blows across highways in a rippling \n     reminder that rain is a distant memory. The last rain most \n     people can remember was last October.\n       Last week on the two-lane highway that links Canyon de \n     Chelly to Monument Valley a road that sees plenty of \n     tourists' cars during the summer a front-end loader scooped \n     buckets of sand into dump trucks bound for a construction \n     site at a nearby community.\n       Chancellor Damon, a heavy equipment contractor from Window \n     Rock, was doing the work under hire by the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs to keep the road safe from sand dunes that had been \n     encroaching on the roadway since the spring.\n       ``It's like the Sahara,'' Damon said. ``It's just been \n     windy, hot and dry.''\n       Damon is a lifelong resident of the Navajo reservation and \n     is accustomed to huge winter snows in the mountains that hug \n     the New Mexico-Arizona border. Usually, a three-wheeler is \n     needed to make it through the snow. This year, passenger cars \n     had no trouble.\n       ``Almost no snow. No rain whatsoever, It's bad,'' Damon \n     said.\n       Hardship bargains\n       Elderly women in velveteen blouses, ranchers in Wranglers \n     and toddlers in pint-sized straw hats helped to fill the \n     stands during a 100-degree afternoon at the livestock auction \n     while a handful of Anglo ranchers from out of state lined the \n     top row.\n       The Navajos, out of water and feed, had come to sell.\n       The cattlemen, fortunate to have rain and pasture grass in \n     Nebraska and Louisiana, were looking for some hardship \n     bargains.\n       First, the invocation in Dine, the native language of the \n     Navajo: ``Please give us rain. Please give us moisture. Let \n     it be like it used to be grass green and high and rain every \n     day.''\n       As the auction rolled on under a sizzling sun, stunted \n     calves and skinny cows were paraded in and sold.\n       Some were to be fattened up in greener pastures; others \n     were bound directly for the slaughterhouse. Prices were \n     moderate and, considering that the cost of hay to continue \n     feeding the cows hovers between $6 and $11 a bale on the \n     reservation the auction satisfied both the buyers and the \n     sellers.\n       The Becenti family from Naschitti had brought 30 calves and \n     cows to the auction. Three weeks ago they sold another group \n     of 30 cattle and sheep at an auction in Aztec.\n       Ilene Becenti is reducing her herds by about 50 percent, \n     banking the money from the sales and hoping to buy more \n     animals once rains come.\n       Like the rest of the animals on sale at Naschitti, \n     Becenti's animals are healthy; they are just much lighter \n     than they should be at this time, and it is costing more to \n     feed them as hay prices rise.\n       ``There's no grass. It's completely dry,'' said Patricia \n     Arviso, Becenti's niece and one of the many family members \n     who look after the animals.\n       ``When I was growing up,'' Arviso said, ``it never looked \n     like this.''\n       Becenti is not in the ranching business to make money, and \n     she did not consider only economics when she made the \n     decision to sell.\n       ``There's no rain, no grass. We don't want these animals to \n     suffer,'' she said.\n       She will not, under the advice of some of the tribe's range \n     management specialists, sell all of her animals and wait out \n     the duration of this drought with no livestock.\n       ``It makes you feel good if you have livestock around your \n     house. It's how we were raised,'' Becenti said. ``If you look \n     outside your house and you don't see cows and sheep and goats \n     and horses, it doesn't feel right. It's life to us.''\n       Too many animals.\n       About 700 cattle and horses were sold at Naschitti, less \n     than one-fifth of what the tribe's range management \n     specialists and tribal president had been hoping for.\n       ``We want people to sell,'' said Blueeyes, of the tribe's \n     agriculture department.\n       Rather than use hay to feed cows that are old, sick or not \n     reproducing, the agriculture department wants owners to thin \n     their herds dramatically, keeping only young and healthy \n     animals.\n       The drought has brought into sharper focus an issue that \n     has troubled natural resource managers for a century: The \n     Navajo reservation, with so much land and so little \n     vegetation, is being eaten away by too many animals.\n       The reservation is immense some 25,000 square miles spread \n     over northwestern New Mexico, northeastern Arizona and \n     southeastern Utah. Range surveys have found large portions \n     where overgrazing and drought have combined to kill grass. \n     Without grass anchoring the soil, it blows away.\n       As early as 1930, a federal survey described the Navajo \n     range as ``deteriorating rather steadily and more rapidly \n     each year.'' In 1933, tribal lawmakers approved a livestock \n     reduction plan that, carried out over one traumatic decade, \n     reduced the livestock on Navajo lands from 800,000 head to \n     about 460,000.\n       Estimates of the number of sheep, cattle, goats and horses \n     on the reservation today vary between 100,000 and 200,000.\n       They have symbolism that goes beyond their ability to \n     provide meat and transportation. Sheep and goats are an \n     integral part of family and ceremonial life; cattle are vital \n     to the Indian cowboy tradition; and Navajo elders believe \n     horses bring rain.\n       Last week Navajo President Kelsey Bagaye issued a statement \n     to Navajos, imploring them to sell some of their animals.\n       ``We need to help our Mother Earth recover so that it may \n     yield and sustain green pastures again in the future when \n     moisture comes to our land,'' Begaye said.\n       ``Owning livestock,'' he said, ``is more a privilege and \n     gift than a right.''\n       Grazing reforms have been suggested for years and never \n     enacted. Blueeyes expects Navajos will haul water and buy hay \n     for their animals and wait for rain to make things better, \n     but will not be open to discussions of limiting their herds \n     so the land can heal.\n       ``It is the Navajo sacred cow,'' said Blueeyes. ``Nobody \n     wants to talk about it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6644-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 19, \n2000 in Cambridge, MA. A Muslim student, who was wearing a praying cap, \nwas returning to his dorm from Islamic prayer when two white men with \nshaved heads attacked him. The men grabbed the student from behind and \npunched and kicked him. One of the perpetrators used a racial epithet \nduring the beating.

Madam President, I rise to recognize the outstanding \ncontributions of The Company of Fifers and Drummers to the people of \nConnecticut and beyond. The largest organization of its kind in the \nWestern world, The Company has both increased awareness of fife and \ndrum history and fostered communication amongst corps worldwide. I \nwould like to take the opportunity to commend its hard work and \nnumerous achievements over the years.\n  Rooted in early American musical tradition, The Company of Fifers and \nDrummers is a nonprofit organization founded in 1965. The historical \nsignificance of The Company is evidenced through the early \nestablishment of various corps dating back to the 1760s and 1800s. \nThroughout its existence, The Company has broadened corps membership \nbeyond Connecticut and New England to include an impressive 150 corps \nworldwide, including corps in Europe and along the Pacific coast. In \naddition to showcasing fife and drum music and history, The Company \norganizes all activities for member corps, both inside and outside the \nUnited States.\n  The efforts of The Company of Fifers and Drummers extends far beyond \nmusical events and fellowship. The commitment of this organization to \nthe art of fife and drum is also evidenced through its creation of the \nMuseum of Fife and Drum in Ivoryton, CT. Since 1987, the museum has \nserviced the community by providing access to artifacts, including \neighteenth and nineteenth century instruments and uniforms, a music and \nvideo library, as well as an extensive archives. The Company is \ncertainly worthy of praise for its efforts in maintaining the only \nmuseum devoted to fife and drum to date.\n  As the fife and drum first appeared in the early colonies, The \nCompany of Fifers and Drummers is a reminder of the importance of our \nhistory as Americans. While the drum arrived in America with the first \nEnglish settlers, the fife was introduced in the colonies during the \nFrench and Indian War. By 1775, the year of the Lexington Alarm, most \ncolonial regiments were comprised of fifers and drummers. The spirit of \npatriotism rooted in the Company is a great example for all Americans.\n  I am proud to honor The Company of Fifers and Drummers for its \nremarkable service and accomplishments over the past 30 years. My \nexperience with The Company, most recently at the Eight Mile River \nDedication Ceremony in East Haddam, CT, has proved both enlightening \nand inspiring. I wish to show my appreciation for its outstanding \ncontributions to society, and I wish The Company continued success in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6645-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATIONS TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL TIM JONES, BATTALION COMMANDER, \n                               U.S. ARMY\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

ALBERT SOLNIT\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, it is with sadness that I come \nto the floor today to note the untimely passing of a great man whose \nlife and work in Connecticut have made my State, and our country, a \nbetter place, particularly for our children.\n  Dr. Albert Solnit, Chair of the Yale Child Study Center from 1966 to \n1983 and Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services for the \nState of Connecticut from 1991 to 2000, died tragically and suddenly on \nJune 21, as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident earlier \nthat day. This loss has compounded the mourning of the men and women of \nthe Yale Child Study Center, who lost another former director in Donald \nCohen last October.\n  Albert Solnit spent an entire lifetime serving his fellow human \nbeings with great dedication, enthusiasm, and distinction. Having \nserved in the U.S. Army as a psychiatrist, Dr. Solnit arrived at Yale, \nmy alma mater, in 1948, as a psychiatric resident. Two years later, he \nbecame the first trainee in child psychiatry ever at the Child Study \nCenter. In another 2 years, he joined the faculty of the Center. And by \n1964, he was a full professor there. With years of diverse training in \nmedicine, pediatrics, anatomy, and communicable diseases and a \npassionate commitment to bettering the lives of children of \nConnecticut, Dr. Solnit became director of the Child Study Center in \n1966.\n  Every day, Dr. Solnit would arrive at the Yale Child Study Center \nlong before his colleagues. He would work late into the evening. He \ndidn't have to; after all, he was the boss. But he did, because he had \na tireless work ethic and a clear vision of how his effort could better \nthe world.\n  Even if I had an hour or two here on the floor, I could not catalogue \nDr. Solnit's accomplishments in full. So let me focus briefly on what \nwere his deepest interests: assisting children caught in complicated \ncustody situations, children being adopted, or children committed to \nthe well-intentioned, though often challenging, foster care system of \nmy state. Dr. Solnit didn't simply observe and dissect problems with \nthe status quo; he corrected them. He helped set the standards for how \nthe legal system would work with child development experts on behalf of \nchildren. In the late 1960s, he worked with the state government to \ndevelop a new department of juvenile delinquency called the Department \nof Children and Youth Services, and to build a separate State \npsychiatric hospital that would treat only children, and treat them \nwith special focus and care.\n  He wrote two books, ``In the Best Interests of the Child'' and \n``Beyond the Best Interests of the Child,'' that are known as classics \nin the field of child mental health.\n  This man was always taking his vast range of knowledge and figuring \nout how best to apply it to touch the lives of others. He was always \nmentoring his colleagues. He was always nurturing children. It is with \nsorrow that I mourn his sudden death, and it is with far greater pride, \nrespect, and love that I pay tribute today to the life of inspiration \nthat Dr. Al Solnit gave to us all.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to his colleagues at the Child Study \nCenter, to his wife Martha, and to his children David, Ruth, Ben, and \nAaron--and their families.\n  And I ask that the following obituary, written by Dean David Kessler \nof the Yale School of Medicine, be printed into the Record, so that \nthis man's life, a model to which we might all aspire, is remembered \nforever.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n       Dear Faculty, It is with great sadness that I write to \n     inform you of yet another deep and tragic loss of a member of \n     the faculty and senior leadership of the Yale Child Study \n     Center and Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Albert J. Solnit died \n     on Friday evening, June 21st, as a result of injuries he \n     sustained in an automobile accident earlier that day. His \n     wife, Martha, was also involved in the accident and is in \n     stable condition in the intensive care unit of Waterbury \n     Hospital.\n       Dr. Solnit was chair of the Child Study Center from 1966 to \n     1983 and Commissioner of\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\n     Mental Health and Addiction Services for the State of \n     Connecticut from 1991 to 2000. He was also the Sterling \n     Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics and Psychiatry in the Child \n     Study Center. Named a Sterling Professor in 1970, he was the \n     middle of three Sterling professors who led the Center. The \n     most recent was Donald J. Cohen who succeeded Dr. Solnit as \n     chairman of the Center in 1983, and who died last October.\n       Al arrived at Yale in 1948 as a psychiatric resident and in \n     1950 became the first trainee in child psychiatry in the \n     Child Study Center. He was born in 1919 and grew up in Los \n     Angeles, California, attended the University of California in \n     Berkeley and San Francisco, and received his medical degree \n     in 1943. After pediatric training in Long Island College \n     Hospital, he entered the U.S. Army and served as a \n     psychiatrist during his two-year commitment. He joined the \n     faculty of the Child Study Center in 1952 and became a full \n     professor in 1964. Like his predecessor, Al came to his \n     leadership position at the Child Study Center with a broad \n     background that also included a masters degree in anatomy and \n     a year as a resident in communicable diseases. He also had \n     begun psychoanalytic training in the New York Psychoanlytic \n     Institute from which he graduated in 1955.\n       Al's tenure as chair of the Center was infused with his \n     distinctive energy and broad vision, he was a man of \n     remarkable stamina, arriving at Center long before his \n     colleagues and continuing to work late into the evening, a \n     characteristic that was enduring from his very first years at \n     Yale through the day before this death. Long concerned for \n     the needs for poor and underprivileged children, he had been \n     working as consultant to various school districts and many \n     child-serving such social agencies in the New Haven community \n     and the state. In the late 60's, he worked with the state \n     government of Connecticut to develop new department of \n     juvenile delinquency, the Department of Children and Youth \n     Services, and to build a separate state psychiatric hospital \n     for children.\n       In his effort to bring the Center into the community, Al \n     built bridges throughout the university and the city of New \n     Haven. Among those initiatives was his collaborative work \n     with the law school. Trained as a child and adult \n     psychoanalyst he cared deeply for children caught in the \n     turmoil of the foster care system, or complicated custody \n     situations. With his close colleagues, Anna Freud and Joseph \n     Goldstein, he set the standards for an informed, \n     collaborative interface between the legal system and child \n     development experts on behalf of children. His books, In the \n     Best Interests of the Child and Beyond the Best Interests of \n     the Child, are recognized classics in the field of \n     child mental health. Throughout his career--even up to \n     last week--he was regularly consulting with colleagues and \n     trainees about how to think about complex questions of \n     adoption, custody, and child placement. His perceptiveness \n     in these often difficult areas was legendary and much \n     respected by judges and child psychiatrists alike. Other \n     of his scholarly contributions, set forth in seventeen \n     books and over two hundred papers and chapters, set the \n     tone of the emerging field of child psychiatry.\n       Al maintained strong and close ties to pediatrics and to \n     pediatricians. He established a long-standing collaborative \n     group involving both child psychiatrists and practicing \n     pediatricians that has met monthly for over forty years to \n     discuss the common clinical ground between the two \n     disciplines. He developed the concept of the `vulnerable \n     child' that detailed the effects on parents and children of \n     neonatal or very clearly serious illness or threatened \n     illness. With his close colleagues, Sally Provence, Julius \n     Richmond, and Irving Harris. Al also began the organization \n     Zero To Three that defined the field of infant psychiatry.\n       Al was a recognized and prodigious leader in the world of \n     child mental health and child psychoanalysis. He was \n     president of the American Psychoanalytic Association from \n     1970 to 1971; of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent \n     Psychiatry from 1971-73; and of the International Association \n     of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions \n     from 1974-76. In the latter organization, he remained an \n     active, contributing member of the leadership and was \n     intimately involved just this past week in developing a new \n     training agenda to bring international child mental health \n     scholars together. He was editor of the Psychoanalytic Study \n     of the Child, a position he assumed in 1971 and through which \n     he turned the journal into one of the leading publications in \n     the field. Al was an international leader in psychoanalysis. \n     He was actively involved with the Yale Press and with the \n     Muriel Gardiner Seminar for Psychoanalysis and the \n     Humanities. Both of these efforts reflect Al's broad \n     intellectual interests and his ability to span fields. He was \n     an enduringly curious scholar and enjoyed most bringing \n     individuals from different disciplines together to encourage \n     cross-talk and interdisciplinary understanding. He was \n     masterful in his ability to detect even the faintest \n     possibility of common ground among apparently disparate \n     points of view and for bringing these groups together.\n       Many individuals in the field of child psychiatry, and more \n     broadly child mental health, attribute their careers to Al's \n     ability to see their potential and make connections that put \n     them in the right place at a critical time for their personal \n     development. He worked often quietly behind the scenes to \n     help young faculty members find sufficient help and resources \n     to start their research or to feel sufficiently grounded so \n     that they could flourish. He stayed in touch with his \n     patients for years, long after they were adults and parents, \n     even grandparents, themselves and he never ceased to be their \n     physician, always available and sensitive to their needs.\n       Though an emeritus professor, Al Solnit was by no means \n     retired. He was mentoring, guiding, and caring every hour of \n     the day. He was a vital, present member of the Child Study \n     Center's leadership and carried the wisdom afforded by living \n     the history of a place. His untimely, unexpected death cuts \n     short a continuing vigorous life with mentoring and \n     leadership yet to give.\n       I know you join me in extending sympathy to all of his \n     colleagues in the Child Study Center and to his wife Martha, \n     his children David, Ruth, Ben, Aaron, and their families.\n       Al Solnit was a vital citizen of this medical school and \n     university. We shall miss him and do our best to carry out \n     his constant imperative that there is always more to be done \n     on behalf of the world's children.--David Kessler, M.D., \n     Dean, Yale School of Medicine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6645-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6645-S6646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO DR.

ALBERT SOLNIT\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, it is with sadness that I come \nto the floor today to note the untimely passing of a great man whose \nlife and work in Connecticut have made my State, and our country, a \nbetter place, particularly for our children.\n  Dr. Albert Solnit, Chair of the Yale Child Study Center from 1966 to \n1983 and Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services for the \nState of Connecticut from 1991 to 2000, died tragically and suddenly on \nJune 21, as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident earlier \nthat day. This loss has compounded the mourning of the men and women of \nthe Yale Child Study Center, who lost another former director in Donald \nCohen last October.\n  Albert Solnit spent an entire lifetime serving his fellow human \nbeings with great dedication, enthusiasm, and distinction. Having \nserved in the U.S. Army as a psychiatrist, Dr. Solnit arrived at Yale, \nmy alma mater, in 1948, as a psychiatric resident. Two years later, he \nbecame the first trainee in child psychiatry ever at the Child Study \nCenter. In another 2 years, he joined the faculty of the Center. And by \n1964, he was a full professor there. With years of diverse training in \nmedicine, pediatrics, anatomy, and communicable diseases and a \npassionate commitment to bettering the lives of children of \nConnecticut, Dr. Solnit became director of the Child Study Center in \n1966.\n  Every day, Dr. Solnit would arrive at the Yale Child Study Center \nlong before his colleagues. He would work late into the evening. He \ndidn't have to; after all, he was the boss. But he did, because he had \na tireless work ethic and a clear vision of how his effort could better \nthe world.\n  Even if I had an hour or two here on the floor, I could not catalogue \nDr. Solnit's accomplishments in full. So let me focus briefly on what \nwere his deepest interests: assisting children caught in complicated \ncustody situations, children being adopted, or children committed to \nthe well-intentioned, though often challenging, foster care system of \nmy state. Dr. Solnit didn't simply observe and dissect problems with \nthe status quo; he corrected them. He helped set the standards for how \nthe legal system would work with child development experts on behalf of \nchildren. In the late 1960s, he worked with the state government to \ndevelop a new department of juvenile delinquency called the Department \nof Children and Youth Services, and to build a separate State \npsychiatric hospital that would treat only children, and treat them \nwith special focus and care.\n  He wrote two books, ``In the Best Interests of the Child'' and \n``Beyond the Best Interests of the Child,'' that are known as classics \nin the field of child mental health.\n  This man was always taking his vast range of knowledge and figuring \nout how best to apply it to touch the lives of others. He was always \nmentoring his colleagues. He was always nurturing children. It is with \nsorrow that I mourn his sudden death, and it is with far greater pride, \nrespect, and love that I pay tribute today to the life of inspiration \nthat Dr. Al Solnit gave to us all.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to his colleagues at the Child Study \nCenter, to his wife Martha, and to his children David, Ruth, Ben, and \nAaron--and their families.\n  And I ask that the following obituary, written by Dean David Kessler \nof the Yale School of Medicine, be printed into the Record, so that \nthis man's life, a model to which we might all aspire, is remembered \nforever.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n       Dear Faculty, It is with great sadness that I write to \n     inform you of yet another deep and tragic loss of a member of \n     the faculty and senior leadership of the Yale Child Study \n     Center and Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Albert J. Solnit died \n     on Friday evening, June 21st, as a result of injuries he \n     sustained in an automobile accident earlier that day. His \n     wife, Martha, was also involved in the accident and is in \n     stable condition in the intensive care unit of Waterbury \n     Hospital.\n       Dr. Solnit was chair of the Child Study Center from 1966 to \n     1983 and Commissioner of\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\n     Mental Health and Addiction Services for the State of \n     Connecticut from 1991 to 2000. He was also the Sterling \n     Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics and Psychiatry in the Child \n     Study Center. Named a Sterling Professor in 1970, he was the \n     middle of three Sterling professors who led the Center. The \n     most recent was Donald J. Cohen who succeeded Dr. Solnit as \n     chairman of the Center in 1983, and who died last October.\n       Al arrived at Yale in 1948 as a psychiatric resident and in \n     1950 became the first trainee in child psychiatry in the \n     Child Study Center. He was born in 1919 and grew up in Los \n     Angeles, California, attended the University of California in \n     Berkeley and San Francisco, and received his medical degree \n     in 1943. After pediatric training in Long Island College \n     Hospital, he entered the U.S. Army and served as a \n     psychiatrist during his two-year commitment. He joined the \n     faculty of the Child Study Center in 1952 and became a full \n     professor in 1964. Like his predecessor, Al came to his \n     leadership position at the Child Study Center with a broad \n     background that also included a masters degree in anatomy and \n     a year as a resident in communicable diseases. He also had \n     begun psychoanalytic training in the New York Psychoanlytic \n     Institute from which he graduated in 1955.\n       Al's tenure as chair of the Center was infused with his \n     distinctive energy and broad vision, he was a man of \n     remarkable stamina, arriving at Center long before his \n     colleagues and continuing to work late into the evening, a \n     characteristic that was enduring from his very first years at \n     Yale through the day before this death. Long concerned for \n     the needs for poor and underprivileged children, he had been \n     working as consultant to various school districts and many \n     child-serving such social agencies in the New Haven community \n     and the state. In the late 60's, he worked with the state \n     government of Connecticut to develop new department of \n     juvenile delinquency, the Department of Children and Youth \n     Services, and to build a separate state psychiatric hospital \n     for children.\n       In his effort to bring the Center into the community, Al \n     built bridges throughout the university and the city of New \n     Haven. Among those initiatives was his collaborative work \n     with the law school. Trained as a child and adult \n     psychoanalyst he cared deeply for children caught in the \n     turmoil of the foster care system, or complicated custody \n     situations. With his close colleagues, Anna Freud and Joseph \n     Goldstein, he set the standards for an informed, \n     collaborative interface between the legal system and child \n     development experts on behalf of children. His books, In the \n     Best Interests of the Child and Beyond the Best Interests of \n     the Child, are recognized classics in the field of \n     child mental health. Throughout his career--even up to \n     last week--he was regularly consulting with colleagues and \n     trainees about how to think about complex questions of \n     adoption, custody, and child placement. His perceptiveness \n     in these often difficult areas was legendary and much \n     respected by judges and child psychiatrists alike. Other \n     of his scholarly contributions, set forth in seventeen \n     books and over two hundred papers and chapters, set the \n     tone of the emerging field of child psychiatry.\n       Al maintained strong and close ties to pediatrics and to \n     pediatricians. He established a long-standing collaborative \n     group involving both child psychiatrists and practicing \n     pediatricians that has met monthly for over forty years to \n     discuss the common clinical ground between the two \n     disciplines. He developed the concept of the `vulnerable \n     child' that detailed the effects on parents and children of \n     neonatal or very clearly serious illness or threatened \n     illness. With his close colleagues, Sally Provence, Julius \n     Richmond, and Irving Harris. Al also began the organization \n     Zero To Three that defined the field of infant psychiatry.\n       Al was a recognized and prodigious leader in the world of \n     child mental health and child psychoanalysis. He was \n     president of the American Psychoanalytic Association from \n     1970 to 1971; of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent \n     Psychiatry from 1971-73; and of the International Association \n     of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions \n     from 1974-76. In the latter organization, he remained an \n     active, contributing member of the leadership and was \n     intimately involved just this past week in developing a new \n     training agenda to bring international child mental health \n     scholars together. He was editor of the Psychoanalytic Study \n     of the Child, a position he assumed in 1971 and through which \n     he turned the journal into one of the leading publications in \n     the field. Al was an international leader in psychoanalysis. \n     He was actively involved with the Yale Press and with the \n     Muriel Gardiner Seminar for Psychoanalysis and the \n     Humanities. Both of these efforts reflect Al's broad \n     intellectual interests and his ability to span fields. He was \n     an enduringly curious scholar and enjoyed most bringing \n     individuals from different disciplines together to encourage \n     cross-talk and interdisciplinary understanding. He was \n     masterful in his ability to detect even the faintest \n     possibility of common ground among apparently disparate \n     points of view and for bringing these groups together.\n       Many individuals in the field of child psychiatry, and more \n     broadly child mental health, attribute their careers to Al's \n     ability to see their potential and make connections that put \n     them in the right place at a critical time for their personal \n     development. He worked often quietly behind the scenes to \n     help young faculty members find sufficient help and resources \n     to start their research or to feel sufficiently grounded so \n     that they could flourish. He stayed in touch with his \n     patients for years, long after they were adults and parents, \n     even grandparents, themselves and he never ceased to be their \n     physician, always available and sensitive to their needs.\n       Though an emeritus professor, Al Solnit was by no means \n     retired. He was mentoring, guiding, and caring every hour of \n     the day. He was a vital, present member of the Child Study \n     Center's leadership and carried the wisdom afforded by living \n     the history of a place. His untimely, unexpected death cuts \n     short a continuing vigorous life with mentoring and \n     leadership yet to give.\n       I know you join me in extending sympathy to all of his \n     colleagues in the Child Study Center and to his wife Martha, \n     his children David, Ruth, Ben, Aaron, and their families.\n       Al Solnit was a vital citizen of this medical school and \n     university.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out \ncritical restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, great endeavors begin with a vision. \nLast fall, I joined the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District and the \nArmy Corps of Engineers in unveiling a vision that would rehabilitate \nand restore the Rio Grande Bosque in Albuquerque, NM.\n  Today, I rise to introduce a bill that will make that vision a \nreality. Since last fall, the Army Corps of Engineers has undertaken \nthe task of conducting a feasibility study so that we might gain a \nbetter understanding of how best to rehabilitate and restore this \nbeautiful Albuquerque green belt.\n  I remain grateful to each of the parties who have been involved with \nthis idea since its inception. Each one contributes a very critical \ncomponent. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District owns this vital \npart of the Bosque which runs from the National Hispanic Cultural \nCenter north to the Paseo Del Norte bridge. The MRGCD has proven to be \na valuable local partner in identifying areas for non-native species \nand other environmental restoration work. Additionally, MRGCD continues \nto work on the development and implementation of an educational \ncampaign for local public schools on the importance of the Bosque. \nFinally, MRGCD has continually worked with all parties to provide \noptions on how the Bosque can be preserved, protected and enjoyed by \neveryone.\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\n  Last year I committed to requesting the Army Corps of Engineers to \ndevelop a preliminary restoration plan for the Bosque along the \nAlbuquerque corridor. I have done that and the plan is well underway. \nThis bill that I introduce today is the next step in following through \non this project.\n  Specifically, this bill authorizes $75 million dollars to complete \nprojects, activities, substantial ecosystem restoration, preservation, \nprotection and recreation along the Middle Rio Grande.\n  Having grown up in Albuquerque, the Bosque is something I treasure. I \nhave been very involved in Bosque restoration since 1991 and I commend \nthe Bosque Coalition for the work they have done, and will continue to \ndo, all along the river.\n  This new vision, specific to the Albuquerque Corridor, builds on that \nidea and is a logical complement to these previous efforts as well as \ntowards Bosque revitalization, restoration and recovery along the \nentire Rio Grande river.\n  This area was designated as a State park many years ago. As many of \nyou know, this area has been overrun by non-native vegetation, peppered \nwith graffiti, cluttered with trash and as we saw this past year, has \nbecome more susceptible to fire.\n  I want to ensure that the Albuquerque corridor, which is a unique and \nirreplaceable part of the desert Southwest's ecosystem, is preserved \nfor generations to come. A healthy ecosystem is key to such things as \nthe protection of threatened species and overall river flow.\n  We know that the river in this area is vital habitat for many \nspecies, including the endangered Rio Grande Silvery minnow. Efforts \nreducing non-native species, while protecting all from the possibility \nof devastating wildfire, will also improve the flow of the river and \nhabitat for its many species.\n  At the same time, the Bosque is a natural green belt through \nAlbuquerque. This area should be made beautiful and more accessible to \nthe public for enjoyment.\n  I am grateful that all parties have come together and that I can be a \npart of making this vision a reality. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2719\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the voucher rental assistance program \nunder the United States Housing Act of 1937, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nthe Housing Voucher Improvement Act of 2002. I am pleased that this \nlegislation is being co-sponsored by a number of my colleagues on the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs: Senators Reed, \nSchumer, Carper, Stabenow, Corzine, and Akaka. This legislation will \nmake important changes to the housing voucher program, a program that \nserves over 1.5 million low-income American families. These 1.5 million \nfamilies are part of a growing number of people in this country who are \nunable to afford rising housing costs. As we learned in hearings before \nthe Committee earlier this year, for too many people, the paycheck they \nbring home is too small to cover housing and other expenses. Low-income \nfamilies are forced to live in crowded, unsafe conditions or forgo \nother necessities to make ends meet.\n  In order to ensure that families have decent, safe and affordable \nhousing, the government provides assistance in a variety of ways \nincluding public housing, section 8 vouchers, FHA mortgage insurance, \nand homeless assistance programs. While we have provided funding for \nthese programs over the years, more must be done. It is estimated that \nover 14 million working families in this country pay more than they can \nafford for housing. In addition, 1.7 million families live in \nsubstandard housing--housing that is unsafe or overcrowded. \nHomelessness continues to be a major problem, with approximately 2 \nmillion people experiencing homelessness at some point this year. These \nstatistics show that millions of Americans are unable to afford the \nmost basic of needs, housing.\n  The solution to the affordable housing crisis is not found in any one \nprogram or in any one policy. We must\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\nwork on a variety of fronts to combat this crisis. We must preserve the \naffordable housing that already exists; we must build new affordable \nhousing; and, we must ensure that the housing programs we have in place \nwork effectively to house families in need. The Housing Voucher \nImprovement Act is not intended to address all of these needs, but it \nis an important step forward in making sure that the voucher program \nworks to provide the greatest range of housing opportunities to the \nlowest income Americans.\n  The bill I am introducing today is intended to work towards three \nobjectives: ensuring that the voucher program works effectively and \nthat all families receiving vouchers are able to find adequate housing; \nproviding families with vouchers the widest range of possibilities as \nto where to live; and assisting families receiving housing assistance \nin attaining self-sufficiency.\n  The voucher program has provided millions of Americans with the \nopportunity to live in safe and decent homes. However, as housing \nmarkets tighten, families are finding it more difficult to use housing \nvouchers. This difficulty may result from a lack of rental housing, \navailable housing being too expensive, or too few landlords who accept \ntenants with housing vouchers. The Housing Voucher Improvement Act will \ngive local public housing authorities a number of tools to assist \nvoucher holders in finding housing and to make the voucher program \nattractive to private market landlords.\n  To help people find decent and safe housing, this bill will give \npublic housing agencies the flexibility to use a limited amount of \ntheir funds to provide search assistance to voucher holders. For many \npeople who receive vouchers, additional assistance, such as housing \ncounseling, transportation services, or security deposit funds may make \nthe difference in finding a place to live. This bill will also increase \nhousing opportunities for voucher holders by allowing public housing \nagencies to increase the amount that the voucher is worth where a \nsignificant number of families given vouchers are unable to find \nadequate housing. Provisions are also included in the bill to make it \neasier to use vouchers in housing developed with HOME funds or Low \nIncome Housing Tax Credits. Ensuring that vouchers can be used in these \ndevelopments will greatly expand housing opportunities for extremely \nlow-income families.\n  In order to operate a successful program, enough apartments must be \navailable for people with vouchers. Therefore, vouchers must be an \nattractive option for landlords. Towards that end, the Housing Voucher \nImprovement Act allows public housing agencies to use their funds to \nreach out to local property owners to increase landlord participation \nin the vouchers program. It also scales penalties for inspection \nviolations to the magnitude of the violation and helps guarantee timely \npayments to apartment owners by creating an incentive for housing \nauthorities to use automatic payment systems for interested owners. \nThis bill will also allow public housing authorities to streamline \ninspections while still ensuring that housing is decent, safe and \nsanitary. All of these provisions will make vouchers easier to use for \nprivate-market apartment owners.\n  This bill also creates a new use for vouchers, allowing housing \nauthorities to couple a limited number of vouchers with housing being \nconstructed with HOME dollars, tax credits, or other funds. These \n``thrifty vouchers'' will cost less than regular vouchers, allowing \nmore families to be served.\n  While most of this bill will help to expand housing opportunities for \npeople searching for housing, one critical component of housing policy \nis self-sufficiency. Housing assistance is key in moving people from \nwelfare to work. A stable home is needed for job stability. While this \nseems intuitive, I do not rely on intuition alone in making this \nassertion. Recent studies, including one done by the Manpower Research \nDemonstration Corporation, show that people receiving housing \nassistance are more successful in moving from welfare to work. They had \nhigher wages and retained employment for longer periods of time. This \nbill strengthens the role that housing plays in self-sufficiency by \nproviding greater opportunities for voucher holders to become involved \nin educational and employment programs. We also authorize welfare to \nwork vouchers, which will strengthen relations between housing and \nwelfare agencies. Given the role that housing assistance can play in \npromoting self-sufficiency, greater confidence between housing and \nwelfare agencies makes good common sense.\n  I introduce this bill today with the hope that it will strengthen one \nof the most important federal housing programs. People given vouchers \nshould be able to find adequate housing, and should have greater \nchoices in where to live. And those families already receiving housing \nassistance should be able to access programs that will assist them in \nmeeting their educational and employment goals. There is widespread \nconsensus that the changes made in this bill will assist in these \nefforts. This bill is supported by a wide range of organizations \nincluding public housing agencies, industry groups, and advocacy \norganizations. The bill is strongly supported by the National \nAssociation of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities, the Local Initiatives Support \nCorporation, the Enterprise Foundation, the National Low Income Housing \nCoalition, the National Apartment Association, the National Affordable \nHousing Management Association and others.\n\n  I want to take a moment to thank my staff for their hard work on this \nbill, and I want to specifically thank Mary Grace Folwell, a fellow \nfrom the American Planning Association, who has been crucial in working \non this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation and to \nrecognize the important role that housing assistance plays in the lives \nof millions of Americans.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous that letters of support and a \nsection-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 11, 2002.\n     Senator Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Chairman, Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We, the organizations signed below, \n     are writing in support of the Housing Voucher Improvement Act \n     of 2002. The Section 8 housing voucher program provides many \n     low-income families with the means to find affordable \n     housing. However, in many cities, suburbs, and rural housing \n     markets around the country, vouchers are very difficult to \n     use. In some markets, there is just not a lot of rental \n     housing available, the available housing is too expensive, or \n     there are too few landlords who accept tenants with Section 8 \n     vouchers. This legislation is narrowly tailored to make \n     vouchers more effective by giving PHAs various tools to \n     assist voucher holders in finding housing and by making \n     vouchers easier for private properly owners to use.\n       To make vouchers easier to use for private-market apartment \n     owners, the Housing Voucher Improvement Act changes the unit \n     inspection requirement to make it more time-efficient; scales \n     penalties for inspection violations to the magnitude of the \n     violation; and, to guarantee timely payments by the PHA, \n     creates an incentive for PHAs to use automatic payment \n     systems for interested owners.\n       To help PHAs deal with high-cost rental markets, the bill \n     increases local flexibility in setting maximum rents. The \n     legislation grants PHAs limited authority to increase their \n     Fair Market Rents to a maximum of 120% of the area's fair \n     market rent. Current law allows PHAs to use this maximum only \n     after the waiver is granted by HUD. The bill also adds \n     provisions to facilitate the use of vouchers in units in \n     lower-poverty neighborhoods that are developed with HOME \n     funds or Low Income Housing Tax Credits.\n       To help voucher-holders find housing, the bill authorizes \n     PHAs to use existing funding to provide landlord outreach and \n     education and apartment-search assistance to voucher-holders \n     as well as assistance with security deposits, application \n     fees and credit checks.\n       The bill gives local public housing authorities the option \n     of turning a limited portion of its available vouchers into \n     lower cost ``thrifty vouchers,'' which can be attached to a \n     new housing development or to a development this \n     rehabilitated or preserved. Because the vouchers cost less \n     than regular vouchers, a larger number of families can be \n     served by the same level of funding. The bill also makes it \n     easier to administer the project-based component on the \n     vouchers program and to attach vouchers to buildings in a \n     range of neighborhoods.\n       Appropriately in this year of welfare reauthorization, the \n     bill contains several provisions to promote employment among \n     tenants of HUD's major rental assistance programs, including \n     a 5-year authorization of Welfare-to-Work vouchers.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this issue and for your \n     continued support of affordable housing programs.\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\n       Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Housing Task \n     Force, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Local \n     Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), National Apartment \n     Association, National Association of Housing and \n     Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO), National Coalition for the \n     Homeless, National Housing Conference, National Housing Law \n     Project, National Low Income Housing Coalition, National \n     Multi Housing Council, The Enterprise Foundation, and \n     Volunteers of America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       National Affordable Housing\n\n\n                                       Management Association,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sarbanes, The National Affordable Housing \n     Management Association (NAHMA) is pleased to support \n     provisions in the Housing Voucher Improvement Act which make \n     the Section 8 voucher program more user-friendly for both \n     tenants and landlords, improve administration, and address \n     many problems which inhibit voucher utilization.\n       In recent years, the difficulty of satisfying the Section 8 \n     regulatory burdens has created a strong disincentive for \n     private landlords to accept the vouchers. The Housing Voucher \n     Improvement Act makes several constructive reforms to the \n     voucher program which address this reality. First, it makes \n     the unit inspection requirement more time efficient. \n     Likewise, it makes penalties for inspection violations \n     commensurate with the severity of the violation. Furthermore, \n     it will improve the timeliness of payments to landlords by \n     creating an incentive for public housing authorities (PHAs) \n     to use automatic payment systems.\n       This bill also addresses voucher utilization problems in \n     high-cost areas by offering PHAs flexibility to establish \n     maximum rents in high cost areas. By allowing PHAs to set the \n     voucher payment standard at 120 percent of fair market rent \n     (FMR), housing authorities will be able to automatically \n     increase their payment standard to address market changes.\n       In short, NAHMA is pleased that you have offered \n     legislation to improve Section 8 voucher utilization and \n     increase housing opportunities for extremely low income \n     families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    George Caruso,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                      Council of Large Public Housing Authorities,\n\n\n                              1250 Eye Street NW, Suite 901 A,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2002.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Chair, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sarbanes: We write in support of your efforts \n     to make Section 8 vouchers easier to use through the \n     ``Housing Voucher Improvement Act of 2002.'' In light of the \n     great need for more affordable housing opportunities and the \n     difficulty many low-income families have encountered in \n     utilizing the program due largely to rising costs in many \n     markets, we agree that legislative changes are needed so that \n     the program can be more effective in providing housing \n     subsidy to low-income families. We very much appreciate the \n     attention this legislation will bring to this important \n     issue.\n       As a November 2001, HUD study shows, tight market \n     conditions brought about by extremely low vacancy rates in \n     many communities is biggest impediment to voucher holders \n     succeeding in utilizing their subsidy. We support several \n     provisions in the bill that would help address this problem, \n     particularly the proposal to enable PHAs to increase payments \n     to 120% of the payment standard without prior HUD approval, \n     In addition, the sections which authorize a $50 million \n     Voucher Improvement Fund and provide some flexibility for \n     PHAs to use voucher resources to pay for housing counseling, \n     search assistance, and incentives to landlords will help \n     voucher holders become more competitive in the market place. \n     The proposed revisions to the current project-based Section 8 \n     program will also assist PHAs that can better serve low-\n     income families by increasing the supply of assisted units, \n     instead of relying on exclusively on private market.\n       While we understand that this bill is designed to make only \n     modest changes to the Section 8 program, it highlights the \n     need for a more dramatic reform. Legislative changes over the \n     years have addressed particular issues to help Section 8 keep \n     pace with changing market conditions, however, some of these \n     piecemeal modifications have added significantly to the \n     program's complexity. Ultimately, we believe that local \n     authorities need even more flexibility to make the most \n     efficient use of Federal funding for housing in an ever-\n     changing market place. Your bill is a step in that direction.\n       Again, we very much appreciate your staunch support of \n     affordable housing programs and your efforts to increase \n     Federal investment in this area. We look forward to our \n     continued work with you and your dedicated staff to continue \n     to make the Section 8 program work better for needy families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sunia Zaterman,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Summary of the Housing Voucher Improvement Act of 2002\n\n       Section 1. Short Title.\n       Section 2. Purposes--(1) to ensure that the Section 8 \n     program works effectively and all families receiving vouchers \n     are able to find adequate housing; (2) to provide families \n     with vouchers the widest range of possibilities as to where \n     to live; and (3) to assist families receiving housing \n     assistance in attaining self sufficiency through encouraging \n     partnerships between housing authorities and welfare \n     agencies.\n       Section 3. Authorize ``Thrifty Vouchers'' designed to make \n     additional housing affordable to extremely low-income \n     families.\n       Thrifty Vouchers (TVs) are intended to encourage the \n     production or preservation of housing affordable to extremely \n     low-income families. PHAs would be authorized to issue TVs \n     out of their existing allocation of vouchers. In addition, \n     Congress could appropriate additional incremental assistance \n     for use as TVs.\n       TVs would cost less than regular vouchers because there \n     would be no debt service included in the rent calculation for \n     a TV unit. Rents would be based on the operating costs of a \n     development and would be capped at 75% of the FMR (unlike \n     regular vouchers which are set between 90 and 110% of the \n     FMR). Data indicate that 75% of FMR should be adequate in \n     most places to cover the costs of operation of multifamily \n     housing. The bill provides an exception to the 75% cap for \n     PHAs that can demonstrate both that this cap could not \n     support a reasonable operating cost of rental housing and a \n     need for the production or preservation of affordable housing \n     in the PHA's service area. Since these vouchers cost less \n     than regular vouchers, PHAs could serve more families with \n     the same amount of funding.\n       At the beginning of the development of a project, \n     developers receiving tax credits, HOME funds, or other \n     capital subsidies could link TVs to not more than 25% of the \n     units in a development. The 25% cap is intended to prevent \n     concentration of poverty. While tax credits and HOME are \n     producing new rental housing, such housing is not affordable \n     to extremely low income families without additional operating \n     subsidies. A recent study done by HUD found that extremely \n     low-income families living in HOME units who do not also \n     receive vouchers, pay 69% of their income for rent. In some \n     cases, residents use tenant-based vouchers to afford such \n     units. However, linking TVs to a project would ensure that \n     some of the units in a given project would be affordable to \n     those most in need of housing.\n       This section makes TVs a subparagraph of the project-based \n     voucher statute. This is in response to a concern expressed \n     by HUD that they do not want to administer two separate \n     programs. Thus, TVs would be counted against a PHA's 20% cap \n     on project-based vouchers; however, new incremental \n     assistance appropriated by Congress for use as TVs would not \n     be counted against the 20% cap.\n       Several changes were made to the project-based voucher \n     statute to make it easier for PHAs and private owners to \n     administer these vouchers. The most significant include the \n     expansion of the purpose of project-based vouchers to include \n     the revitalization of low-income communities and the \n     prevention of the displacement of extremely low-income \n     families, and changes to the waiting list provisions to \n     allow for separate project-based lists and to permit PHAs \n     to allow owners to maintain their own waiting lists, \n     subject to certain requirements.\n       Section 4. Providing assistance to voucher holders in their \n     search for decent, safe and affordable housing.\n       1. Allow PHAs with unutilized Section 8 funds to use those \n     funds on activities designed to assist families in finding \n     housing. PHAs that have low utilization rates (they do not \n     use all of their Section 8 funds to house families) will have \n     unused Section 8 funds that could be made available to assist \n     families in finding housing. This legislative change would \n     allow PHAs to use 2% of the funds they receive under the \n     voucher program to provide additional services to families \n     searching for housing if they have a low voucher success rate \n     and/or problems with concentration of voucher holders in \n     high-poverty neighborhoods. PHAs could use funds for \n     counseling, security deposits, application and credit check \n     fees, and search assistance such as transportation services.\n       2. Allow PHAs that use all of their Section 8 funds to use \n     up to one week of reserves on activities designed to assist \n     families in finding housing. For PHAs that use all of their \n     funds and whose families still face difficulties in funding \n     adequate housing (a success rate less than 80%), the bill \n     allows PHAs to use up to one week of reserves to provide \n     additional service to families searching for houring.\n       3. Create a Voucher Success Fund of $50 million for PHAs \n     that do not have unused funds, but still need additional \n     resources to assist families in finding housing. These PHAs \n     use almost all of their Section 8 funds, but families that \n     receive vouchers still face difficulties in finding adequate \n     housing. PHAs that use almost all of their Section 8 funds \n     but have a success rate lower than 80% would apply to HUD for \n     funds to help families find housing through counseling, \n     security deposits, application and credit check fees, and \n     search assistance such as transportation services.\n       Section 5. Expanding housing opportunities for voucher \n     holders\n       1. All PHAs to set their voucher payment standard at 120% \n     of FMR if they have had their payment standard set at 110% or \n     above\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\n     for the previous 6 months AND continue to have problems with \n     utilization, success rates, or concentration of Section 8 \n     units. Currently, PHAs may set their payment standard (which \n     determines the amount the voucher is worth) between 90% and \n     110% of the Fair Market Rent. HUD can approve higher payment \n     standards on a case by case basis. This change will allow \n     housing authorities to automatically increase their payment \n     standard to address market changes. Raising the payment \n     standard will help ensure that more vouchers could be used in \n     high cost Areas.\n       2. Allow PHAs to pay 120% of FMR as the payment standard in \n     individual cases for people with disabilities. People with \n     disabilities may be limited in their housing opportunities, \n     and their choices may be restricted based on special needs. \n     This provision will allow housing authorities to pay up to \n     120% of the FMR as a reasonable accommodation for voucher \n     holders with disabilities without prior HUD approval, and \n     would authorize HUD approval for payment standards above \n     120%.\n       3. Allow PHAs to set higher payment standard for voucher \n     used in Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) developments. \n     The LIHTC program provides substantial funding for low-income \n     housing development. Though tax credit housing serves low-\n     income people, these properties are not usually affordable to \n     extremely low-income households (with incomes below 30% of \n     the Area Median Income). One way to serve the poorest \n     families in tax credit developments is to house families with \n     vouchers. The recent increase in tax credits presents an \n     opportunity to expand housing choice for even the lowest \n     income families. In some areas, the tax credit units will \n     have higher rents than are normally covered by a voucher. In \n     2000, Congress changed the project-based statute to allow \n     project-based assistance to cover these higher rents so long \n     as the LIHTC building was not in a high poverty census tract. \n     This provision would make a similar change for vouchers.\n       4. Allow PHAs to pay up to their full payment standard for \n     units in HOME developments. Currently, HOME units may only be \n     rented up to the Fair Market Rent to voucher holders. This \n     provision will allow a PHA to pay a rent at their regular \n     payment standard, where above the FMR, in order to provide an \n     incentive to HOME developments to seek out voucher holders as \n     renters, only where the units are located outside of high-\n     poverty areas.\n       5. Addressing Housing in the Consolidated Plan. Cities, \n     counties and states that receive Community Development Block \n     Grant (CDBG) funds (known as ``participating jurisdictions'') \n     are required to complete Consolidated Plans detailing the \n     housing and community development needs in their \n     jurisdictions. This provision of the bill makes the following \n     changes to the Consolidated Plan requirements:\n       a. Include a requirement that the jurisdiction identify \n     barriers to voucher utilization and potential solutions. This \n     would ensure that entities other than the PHA (such as cities \n     and counties) are aware of issues with voucher recipients and \n     their ability to find housing. While no direct action would \n     be required from the city or participating jurisdiction, they \n     would be acknowledging the difficulties in using vouchers, \n     and identifying the causes. This would hopefully lead to the \n     jurisdiction deciding to take actions to alleviate the \n     barriers where possible.\n       b. Include a requirement that the jurisdiction consider \n     employment opportunities in determining the location of \n     housing development. Housing opportunities close to \n     employment opportunities and/or transportation are important \n     to ensuring the success of low-income people in finding and \n     retaining employment. This provision would ensure that \n     jurisdictions are looking at location in determining where \n     housing resources should be allocated.\n       c. Include a requirement that a participating jurisdiction \n     must consult with social service agencies in certain aspects \n     of planning for housing opportunities. When determining how \n     to address affordable housing problems, housing planners and \n     welfare administrators should be working together to help \n     plan for people moving from welfare to work, and to help link \n     people receiving housing assistance with welfare agencies and \n     resources (and vice versa).\n       Section 6. Access to HOME and LIHTC developments\n       Require that HUD ensure that PHAs have a list of LIHTC and \n     HOME developments to give to voucher holders. While LIHTC \n     developments could provide housing opportunities to very poor \n     families, and while LIHTC developments may not discriminate \n     against voucher holders, there is almost no communication or \n     coordination between PHAs and state HFAs, which operate the \n     LIHTC program. This provision will require HUD to compile \n     information on where tax credit and HOME developments are \n     located and ensure that this information is readily available \n     to PHAs. PHAs will be responsible to access such information \n     and provide it to families searching for housing assistance \n     with vouchers.\n       Section 7. Reallocation of vouchers. Currently, HUD allows \n     PHAs to return unused vouchers to HUD. HUD published a notice \n     (which has not yet been fully implemented) which requires \n     that unused budget authority be recaptured from PHAs with low \n     utilization rates (under 95% utilization). While HUD's notice \n     describes how they will reallocate these vouchers, the \n     reallocation is not structured in a way that ensures that \n     communities do not lose needed vouchers. This provision will \n     require that vouchers to be reallocated be distributed to one \n     or more administrators in the region. HUD would, through a \n     competition, designate such an administrator with Section 8 \n     experience, which could be a PHA, a state or local agency, a \n     non-profit, or a private entity. The administrator would \n     receive all vouchers available for reallocation in its region \n     and would be able to operate the vouchers on a regional \n     basis, allowing and encouraging families to live anywhere in \n     the metropolitan area while still serving people on the \n     original PHA's waiting list. The new administrator would have \n     to reach certain levels of performance--in both success rates \n     and utilization in order to retain the vouchers.\n       Section 8. Promoting Self-Sufficiency\n       1. Allow people who live in a project-based Section 8 \n     housing to be eligible for Family Self Sufficiency \n     activities. The Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) program \n     provides services to assist families in public housing or \n     those who receive vouchers in attaining educational and \n     employment goals. This provision would also make residents of \n     project-based Section 8 housing eligible for the FSS program. \n     Under this provision, owners of project-based section 8 \n     housing would be able to choose to operate their own FSS \n     program, and if they opted not to provide such services, the \n     PHA, at its discretion, could choose to serve such families \n     in its FSS program. While this change will have some cost, it \n     will be small, given that only a small percentage of families \n     currently participate in FSS programs.\n       2. Allow Resident Opportunities and Self-Sufficiency (ROSS) \n     funds to be used to serve Section 8 families. ROSS grants are \n     given to PHAs and resident organizations to fund self-\n     sufficiency activities. Currently, PHAs can only serve public \n     housing residents with these funds, though the predecessor to \n     ROSS allowed PHAs to serve Section 8 residents as well. This \n     provision would permit PHAs to serve Section 8 tenants with \n     ROSS funds, though it would leave the decision to each PHA to \n     determine where funds are best used.\n       3. Incentives to Families to Increase Earnings. State and \n     local welfare agencies have an enormous amount of flexibility \n     in using their funds to help low-income families. In some \n     cases, welfare agencies and housing authorities have worked \n     together to use some of these funds to assist people \n     receiving federal housing assistance. This section would \n     ensure that payments made by welfare agencies (or other \n     agencies) to help families with rental payments that have \n     increased because of increased earnings, are deducted from \n     the family's income when the PHA determines that family's \n     share of rent. These provisions will create incentives for \n     families to increase earnings and retain employment by \n     allowing them to retain more of their income.\n       4. Authorize Welfare to Work Vouchers. In FY 1999, Congress \n     authorized 50,000 Welfare to Work vouchers in an \n     appropriations bill. The program has never been authorized \n     and new vouchers have not been allocated beyond the initial \n     50,000. However, given that welfare will be reauthorized this \n     year, the timing seems perfect to authorize this program, \n     giving housing authorities additional incentives to \n     collaborate with welfare agencies. In authorizing this \n     program, we strengthen the requirements that PHAs work with \n     welfare agencies in administering these vouchers. Recent \n     studies show that housing assistance is critical in allowing \n     people to retain employment, and these vouchers will help in \n     this effort.\n       Section 9. Inspection of Units under Section 8. Currently, \n     when a voucher holder wants to rent a unit, prior to the \n     voucher holder moving in, and payments being made to an \n     owner, the PHA must inspect that individual unit and any \n     deficiencies must be repaired. Owners and PHAs agree that \n     this is disincentive to owners participating in the program \n     because of the amount of time it takes to lease-up the unit \n     and receive payment. This provision will allow a PHA to begin \n     payments to an owner prior to inspection of that particular \n     unit so long as: (1) a building inspection has been conducted \n     by the PHA in the last 6 months; (2) a unit inspection is \n     completed within 30 days; and (3) the PHA and the owner have \n     an agreement that any repairs on the unit must be made within \n     30 days of the unit inspection. This section will also allow \n     PHAs to annually inspect units within 3 months of the \n     anniversary date of that unit entering the Section 8 program \n     if they are conducting inspections on a geographical basis.\n       Current regulation allows PHAs to withhold their entire \n     portion of a rent payment for an inspection violation, \n     regardless of the magnitude of the violation. This provision \n     would scale penalties for inspection violations to the \n     severity of the violation--if a garbage disposal needs to be \n     fixed the PHA payment will only be withheld to the extend \n     that the garage disposal would merit.\n       These changes will help to bring owners into the program \n     while still ensuring that units meet HUD standards for being \n     safe and decent.\n       Section 10. Automatic Payment Systems. Currently, some, but \n     not all, PHAs use electronic fund transfers to pay Section 8 \n     dwelling unit owners. This section would allow PHAs to use \n     technical assistance funds and other means to establish \n     electronic fund transfer systems for rental payments. \n     Landlord participation is optional. Automatic\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\n     payment systems would assist PHAs in making timely rent \n     payments and thereby encourage owner participation in the \n     Section 8 program.\n       Section 11. Enhanced Workers. To protect tenants from \n     displacement, in 1999 Congress passed legislation creating \n     ``enhanced vouchers'' for all tenants facing conversion of a \n     project from project-based Section 8 to market-rate housing. \n     In several respects, the law as passed and interpreted by HUD \n     fails to clearly protect tenants as Congress intended. Some \n     PHAs require existing tenants to go through an application \n     process for enhanced vouchers, which occasionally results in \n     a tenant being denied voucher benefits. To protect tenants, \n     this section amends the existing statute to clarify that \n     tenants cannot be required to go through the application \n     process again to receive an enhanced voucher.\n       ``Empty nesters,'' elderly tenants whose household members \n     have either moved or died, sometimes reside in units that are \n     too large for their current family size under normal program \n     and occupancy requirements. Likewise, growing families may \n     reside in units that are too small under normal program and \n     occupancy requirements. In both situations, these tenants \n     could be displaced due to family/unit size mismatches. This \n     section clarifies the current enhanced voucher statute to \n     allow tenants with family size/unit mismatches to remain in \n     the unit until an appropriately sized unit becomes available \n     in the property.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2722. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure \nthe proper tax treatment of executives compensation, and or other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, the corporate accounting scandals \nthat have unfolded over the previous few months have caused \nincalculable damage to the American economy. Millions of people have \nbeen harmed, among them some of our most vulnerable citizens, including \nretirees on fixed incomes and families who have saved for years to \neducate their children or finally buy a home. Loss of confidence \nthreatens our economy and diminishes hope for the millions who have \nlost their jobs in the last 18 months. And the cost of equity is \nrising, making it more difficult for the vast majority of honest and \nenergetic entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into economic growth.\n  This is not a bubble bursting; it is, in great measure, the result of \na considerable diminution of regulation at the behest of powerful \nlobbies, over the objections of many people.\n  Today, the Senate is debating the most effective way to restore \nbalance between entrepreneurship and oversight, to ensure that \ncorporate excesses do not again steal the savings of millions of \npeople. The underlying Senate bill is based on accounting reforms and \ntougher enforcement. The Finance Committee is about to mark up its own \nbill dealing with diversification requirements, executive compensation, \nand notification and disclosure regarding 401(k) plans.\n  I fully support Senator Sarbanes' bill and will support the Finance \nCommittee proposal as well. And today I propose legislation that will \ncomplement my colleagues' efforts and help us move toward our goal of \nrestoring confidence in American business and American businesspeople. \nWhere legislation already under consideration focuses largely on \noversight and punishment--two critical sides of the triangle--my bill \nattacks the incentives to cut corners or commit crimes in the arena of \nexecutive compensation.\n  This legislation will protect workers and shareholders as Congress \ncarefully sorts through the appropriate measures.\n  Currently, Federal regulations permit a number of frankly sleazy \naccounting practices which allow corporations and their executives to \ntake millions of dollars away from shareholders, creditors, and the \nTreasury, without any penalty at all. Some of the most obvious abuses \naren't even crimes. My proposal will help to stop white collar crime \nbefore it is committed, by taking the common sense step of putting the \nlid on the cookie jar.\n  This bill will do four things: 1. Right now, corporations may \ntransfer funds to an executive's deferred compensation account, giving \nthat executive certain access to the money but potentially also \nremoving it from the reach of shareholders and creditors. But since it \nis termed ``deferred,'' the executive pays no taxes. Currently, Section \n132 of the Revenue Code prevents regulators from cracking down on this \npractice. My legislation gives Treasury the authority to examine the \nconstructive receipt doctrine and close loopholes that allow \ninappropriate deferral of taxation. It also gives Treasury the \nauthority to act on situations where executive assets are supposedly \nsubject to the claims of an employer's creditors, but in reality, are \nprotected from legitimate claims. Either the individual must pay income \ntax, or the funds must be corporate assets subject to claims. They \ncan't have it both ways.\n  2. Currently, corporations can give their senior executives massive \nloans, with no real expectation of repayment. These loans are \neffectively theft from the employees and shareholders, since they \nrepresent revenue given in compensation which will never be repaid, \nreinvested, or distributed as dividends. And they are theft from the \nTreasury as well; since they are accounted as loans, the recipient \ndoesn't pay taxes on them. It's a tax-free performance bonus, often \ngiven--as we saw in the Adelphi and WorldCom cases--when the executive \ndeserves more to be fired than to be paid. My legislation will make \nsure a loan is a loan: if a loan doesn't require security or have any \nenforceable repayment schedule, it's income and it will be taxed, just \nlike the salaries of rank-and-file workers are taxed.\n  3. Right now, company employees may be unable to sell their stock \nwhile executives are dumping theirs and creating--as analysts take note \nand supply overwhelms demand--the kind of stock-price death spiral that \ntook the life savings of thousands of Enron employees.\n  Back in the early 1980's, Congress responded to the trend of \ncorporations providing their executives with ``gold parachutes'' with a \n20 percent excise tax on those payments. I believe that the excise tax \non golden parachutes should also be applied to the sales of corporate \nstock by corporate executives during periods when regular employees of \nthe company are not able to freely sell their stock in their company \nretirement plans. This would be a temporary, six-month provision, to \ndeter corporate executives from taking advantage of the existing \nuncertainty as Congress considers other possible reforms to encourage \nmore equitable treatment of rank-and-file employees and corporate \nexecutives. And it will be a bridge from the current structure to one \nin which employees have the same ability to sell their stock as \ninsiders have.\n  4. Additionally, my bill will prevent corporate executives from \ngetting a free ride when their corporation moves offshore for tax \navoidance purposes. Under current law, if an American corporation \ndissolves and is then reincorporated in a foreign country, shareholders \nof the corporation are required to pay capital gains on the \n``exchange'' of their stock in the ``old corporation'' for stock in the \n``new corporation,'' even though they never actually sell their stock. \nMeanwhile, corporate executives, who have engineered the move offshore, \nare under no such obligation regarding stock options they receive as \ncompensation. My bill would require executives to pay capital gains \ntaxes on the ``exchange'' of their stock options when they move \noffshore to avoid taxation. I believe this provision will provide a \nmuch-needed disincentive to corporate executives seeking to avoid the \nreach of the IRS through corporate expatriation.\n  I agree with all those who would increase oversight and penalties, \nbut I say, let's also look at first causes--the executive compensation \nfunds. That's where some of the greatest opportunities for \ninappropriate, unfair, and unethical practices are--practices that \ndisadvantage average workers and investors and are undermining \nconfidence in America's capital markets. And it's time for that to \nchange.\n  Finally, I am appalled at the problem of executives benefitting from \nwhat can only be considered excessive compensation arrangements in the \nwaning days before bankruptcy of a failing corporation. I am looking \nfor a way to prevent those arrangements in the final months before a \ncorporation closes, and I hope to have a proposal ready for \nintroduction soon.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\n  S. 2723. A bill to provide transitional housing assistance for \nvictims of domestic violence; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce the \nTransitional Housing Assistance for Victims of Domestic Violence Act of \n2002 to provide grants for transitional housing and related services to \npeople fleeing domestic violence situations.\n  I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence early in my \ncareer as the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. Today, a \ngrowing number of homeless individuals are women and children fleeing \ndomestic violence. More than half the cities surveyed by the U.S. \nConference of Mayors in 2000 cited domestic violence as a primary cause \nof homelessness. Shelters offer short-term assistance, but are \novercrowded and unable to provide the support needed. Transitional \nhousing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving a domestic \nviolence situation and becoming fully self-sufficient.\n  A transitional housing grant program was last authorized for only one \nyear as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act \nin 2000. This program would have been administered through the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and provided $25 million in \nFY2001. Unfortunately, funds were never appropriated for the program, \nand the authorization has now expired.\n  The grant program established in the bill I am introducing today \nwould be administered through the Department of Justice, in \nconsultation with the Departments of Health and Human Services and \nHousing and Urban Development. This program would have the benefit of a \nwide range of expertise in the three departments, and has enormous \npotential to improve people's lives.\n  This new grant program will make a big impact, in many areas of the \ncountry, availability of affordable housing is at an all-time low. \nThere are many dedicated people working to provide victims of domestic \nviolence with resources, such as Rose Pulliam of the Vermont Network \nAgainst Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, but they can not work \nalone. We should all be concerned with providing victims of domestic \nviolence a safe place to gain the skills and stability needed to make \nthe transition to independence. This is an important component of \nreducing and preventing crimes that take place in domestic situations, \nranging from assault and child abuse to homicide, and helping the \nvictims of these crimes. I urge the Senate to take prompt action on \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Lugar, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 2724. A bill to provide regulatory oversight over energy trading \nmarkets and metals trading markets, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am very pleased to introduce this \nbill today along the Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar, chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Our bill is already \nco-sponsored by Senators Fitzgerald, Cantwell, Wyden, Corzine, Leahy, \nDurbin, and Boxer.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee held a hearing on this bill \nyesterday and I understand it is the intentions of the chairman and \nranking member to try and have a bill that can be marked up before the \nrecess.\n  The bill closes the loophole that was created when Congress passed \nthe Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000 which exempted on-line \nenergy and metals trading from regulatory oversight.\n  The bill is supported by: The New York Mercantile Exchange, The \nPacific Exchange, Aquila Energy Corporation, Cambridge Energy Research \nAssociates, Mid-America Energy Holding Company, Pacific Gas and \nElectric, Southern California Edison, Calpine, The Apache Corporation, \nThe American Public Gas Association, The American Public Power \nAssociation, The Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Association, \nThe California Municipal Utilities Association, The Consumers Union, \nThe Consumer Federation of America, The Derivatives Study Center, The \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association U.S. PIRG, The \nTransmission Access Policy Study Group, The Sierra Club, and all four \nFERC Commissioners.\n  This bill could not be more timely in light of what we have learned \nabout the energy sector in the past couple of months and the operations \nof these energy companies: 1. CMS Energy admitted that 80 percent of \nits trades were round trip or wash trades and were made simply to \nincrease volume; 2. Reliant admitted to $6.4 billion in wash trades \nfrom 1999-2001 which the company characterized as energy swaps; 3. Duke \nconfessed to $2 billion in wash trades and stated that $650 million of \nthese trades were executed on the Inter-Continental Exchange, ICE, and \nelectronic trading facility exempt from CFTC oversight because of the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act.\n  But electronic exchanges like ICE have no responsibility for trades \nor wash trades executed on its exchange and does not even have any \nresponsibility for checking that a transaction has been executed. Thus, \na company that wanted to manipulate prices or game the market would not \nhave to even execute a single trade.\n  In the past year, 12 of the largest energy companies in the U.S. have \nlost about $188 billion of capital, accounting for 71 percent of the \nmarket value. The credit ratings of several of those energy companies \nhave been severely downgraded; some are at junk bond or near-junk bond \nstatus.\n  In May, 2000, a severe energy crisis began in California. Electricity \nthat had typically sold for about $30 a Megawatt hour all of a sudden \nstarted selling for 10 times that. This led to the bankruptcy of \nCalifornia's largest utility and the near-bankruptcy of California's \nsecond largest utility. It also resulted in overcharges of billions of \ndollars to California ratepayers and taxpayers.\n  In November, California encountered a natural gas crisis. Natural gas \nis the main cost component of electricity. At one point gas was selling \nfor $12 per decatherm in San Juan New Mexico and $59 in Southern \nCalifornia when the cost to transport it was less than one dollar.\n\n  Just about the time Congress passed the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act exempting electronic energy trading exchanges from \noversight, the crisis began spreading to the other western states. For \nmore than six months Oregon, Washington, and the other Western States \nexperienced the same price spikes as California.\n  The entire crisis lasted for more than a year while energy companies \nlike Reliant, Enron, Duke, Williams, and AES enjoyed record revenues \nand profits. Obviously we are all a bit wiser today about energy \nmarkets and about wash trades in particular.\n  Wash trades or round trip trades involve two or more companies \nplotting together to execute offsetting trades. These trades would be \nillegal if they were done on NYMEX, the Chicago Merc, or the Pacific \nExchange and those exchanges would have the responsibility to report \nit.\n  However, there is no such reporting or enforcement requirement on \nelectronic exchanges because as I said before, the CFMA created a big \nloophole. This legislation would ensure that wash trades are subject to \nfull CFTC oversight no matter where they are done.\n  And of course there is Enron which controlled a large share of the \nenergy market while they engaged in activities that were downright \nillegal. Many of these activities could have been prevented or at least \nstopped if regulators simply had the proper authority and the will.\n  Let me recap what happened with the Commodity Futures Modernization \nAct. In November, 1999, the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the CFTC and the \nDepartment of Treasury produced a study titled Over the Counter \nDerivative Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act, A Report of the \nPresident's Working Group on Financial Markets.\n  It was signed by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Secretary \nof Treasury Larry Summers, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and CFTC Chairman \nBill Rainer.\n  The report said that the case had not been made that energy or other \ntangible commodities should be exempted\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\nform CFTC oversight. The report found that because of the immaturity of \nthe energy market, the lack of liquidity in the market and finite \nsupplies, in energy markets, energy markets were more susceptible to \nmanipulation than the deep and liquid financial markets.\n  Recent history has certainly borne that to be correct; these \ncommodities are more subject to manipulation!\n  On June 21, 2000 shortly after the President's Working Group issued \nits report, the Banking Committee and Agriculture Committee held a \nhearing on the Report and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.\n  Let me read from that committee report:\n\n       The Commission has reservations about the bill's exclusions \n     of Over the Counter (OTC) derivatives from the Commodities \n     Exchange Act. On this point he bill diverges from the \n     recommendations of the President's Working Group, which \n     limited the proposed exclusions to financial derivatives. The \n     Commission believes the distinction drawn by the Working \n     Group between financial (non-tangible) and non-financial \n     transactions was a sound one and respectfully urges the \n     Committees to give weight to that distinction.\n\n  And the Senate Agriculture Committee marked up the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act consistent with what was in the President's Working \nGroup Report.\n  That version of the bill however, was not reflected in the final \nprovision that passed Congress as part of a much bigger bill at the end \nof the 106th Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues in Congress to pass this legislation and fix \nthis problem as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/11/senate-section/article/S6657-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6657-S6658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4209.

I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the \nreport of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.\n  The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance \ntreaties being negotiated by the United States in order to counter \ncriminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective \ntool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of crimes, \nincluding terrorism, drug trafficking, fraud, and other white-collar \noffenses. The Treaty is self-executing.\n  The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal \nmatters. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: taking \nthe testimony or statements of persons; providing documents, records, \nand articles of evidence; locating or identifying persons; serving \ndocuments; transferring persons in custody for testimony or other \npurposes; executing requests for searches and seizures; identifying, \ntracing, freezing, seizing, and forfeiting the proceeds and \ninstrumentalities of crime and assistance in related proceedings; and \nsuch other assistance as may be agreed.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, July 11, 2002.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Agreement between the Government \nof the United States of America and the Government of the Russian \nFederation on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka \nPolar Bear Population done at Washington on October 16, 2000 (the \n``U.S.-Russia Agreement''). I also transmit, for the information of the \nSenate, the report of the Department of State with respect to that \nAgreement.\n  The U.S.-Russia Agreement provides legal protections for this \npopulation of polar bears in addition to those found in the Agreement \non the Conservation of Polar Bears done at Oslo, November 13, 1973 (the \n``1973 Agreement''), which was a significant, early step in the \ninternational conservation of polar bears. The 1973 Agreement is a \nmultilateral treaty to which the United States and Russia are parties. \n(The other parties are Norway, Canada, and Denmark.) The 1973 Agreement \nprovides authority for the maintenance of a subsistence harvest of \npolar bears and provides for habitat conservation.\n  The proposed U.S.-Russia Agreement, which would operate as a free-\nstanding treaty separate from the 1973 Agreement, is the culmination of \nan 8-year effort. The U.S.-Russia Agreement builds on the 1973 \nAgreement to establish a common legal, scientific, and administrative \nframe work for the conservation and management of the Alaska-Chukotka \npolar bear population, which is shared by the United States and the \nRussian Federation. For example, the U.S.-Russia Agreement provides a \ndefinition of ``sustainable harvest'' that will help the United States \nand Russia to implement polar bear conservation measures while \nsafeguarding the interests of native people. In addition, the U.S.-\nRussia Agreement establishes the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Commission, \nwhich would function as the bilateral managing authority to make \nscientific determinations, establish taking limits, and carry out other \nresponsibilities under the terms of the U.S.-Russia Agreement. The \nproposed U.S.-Russia Agreement would strengthen the conservation of our \nshared polar bear population through a coordinated sustainable harvest \nmanagement program.\n  Early ratification of the U.S.-Russia Agreement by the United States \nwill reinforce our leadership role in international conservation of \nmarine mammals and will encourage similar conservation action by other \ncountries. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable \nconsideration to this Agreement and give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, July 11, 2002.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Second Protocol Amending the \nTreaty on Extradition Between the Government of the United States of \nAmerica and the Government of Canada, as amended, signed at Ottawa on \nJanuary 12, 2001. In addition, I transmit, for the information of the \nSenate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the \nSecond Protocol. As the report explains, the Second Protocol will not \nrequire implementing legislation.\n  The Second Protocol amends the Extradition Treaty Between the United \nStates of America and Canada, signed at Washington on December 3, 1971, \nas amended by an Exchange of Notes of June 28 and July 9, 1974, and by \na Protocol signed at Ottawa on January 11, 1988.\n  The Second Protocol, upon entry into force, will enhance cooperation \nbetween the law enforcement communities of both nations. The Second \nProtocol incorporates into the U.S.-Canada Extradition Treaty a \nprovision on temporary surrender of persons that is a standard \nprovision in more recent U.S. bilateral extradition treaties. It also \nprovides for new authentication requirements for documentary evidence, \nwhich should streamline the processing of extradition requests.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Second Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.

Madam President, over the course of the last 6 months, \nthe longstanding, systemic fraudulent activities of numerous \ncorporations have been exposed in America and around the world. This \nfraud has cost American investors massive amounts, perhaps hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, perhaps more. Beyond the tangible losses, investor \nconfidence in the integrity of our capital markets has also taken a \ntremendous hit, as the Presiding Officer knows.\n  As we move forward to address the shortcomings in the oversight of \nour financial markets, we must carefully consider the true impact of \nwhat has occurred. Thousands of people have lost billions of dollars. \nThousands of people have lost jobs. Millions of people have lost or are \nlosing faith in our capital markets every day.\n  The fact is, none of this is made any easier because of the manner in \nwhich this has happened. Americans don't feel better because the \nmugging took place in the boardroom rather than the back alley. In many \nways, what has happened is even worse. Because of the sheer size and \nnumber of participants in our markets, the corporate scams have been \nmuch more efficient and much more effective than the average boiler \nroom fraud.\n  The bottom line is this: Real people are facing tremendous losses, \nand confidence in our system is eroding.\n  I believe we must address this situation with concrete measures. \nFraud, even if committed by white-collar individuals--indeed, \nespecially if committed by white-collar individuals--needs to be \nseverely punished with criminal sanctions.\n  I commend the efforts to create new, tough penalties for people who \ncommit fraud through our securities markets. I supported that, as most \nof the people in the Senate did.\n  Additionally, I believe there is more that we can do to stop or slow \ndown the kinds of conduct that lead to situations where investing \nAmericans are swindled out of hundreds of billions of dollars. The fact \nis, in one key area, the appropriate disincentives for participating in \nsecurities fraud are just not in place today.\n  Since 1994, after the Supreme Court ruling in the Central Bank case, \nthere has been no liability for secondary actors who aid and abet \nsecurities fraud in America. Think about that. Since 1994, there has \nbeen no liability for secondary actors who aid and abet securities \nfraud. In effect, the decision in the Central Bank case led to legions \nof accountants, lawyers, and other security specialists who play a \nvital yet behind-the-scenes role in securities transactions, off the \nhook for down-the-line fraud in the sale of securities.\n  Think of it like this: The guys who procure the getaway car before \nthe robbery, tune it up, fill it up with gas, put air in the tires, and \nsometimes even drive it away, face no financial liability for their \ninvolvement.\n  Does that make any sense? Not to me. I believe not to the majority of \nthe Senate, if we could get a vote on the Shelby-Durbin amendment. And \nwe will someday because this is not an issue that is going to go away.\n  When attorneys, accounting firms, and other securities professionals \nknow that assisting securities fraud is nothing to worry about, as it \nis today, there is no wonder there has been a proliferation of audit \nfailures, restatements, Enrons, Global Crossings, WorldComs, and many \nmore to come. Civil and criminal penalties are important and necessary, \nbut they are not sufficient. They serve a separate but important \npurpose of punishing fraudulent behavior. But they do nothing to ensure \nthat investors, the victims, have an opportunity to seek financial \nredress. Civil liability supplements criminal and civil penalties and \nacts as a further disincentive to engage in or assist fraudulent \nactivities.\n  Here are a couple of basic questions we all need to answer. Why \nshouldn't investors--that is, so many million in America--be able to \nrecover losses from aiders and abettors of securities fraud? What \npublic interest do we serve by inoculating aiders and abettors of \nsecurities fraud from civil liability? Why should this type of tort, \nthis fraud, not give rise to a civil claim, particularly when the loss \nto the investor and impact on the markets is so great, as it is today?\n  Investors are intentionally being defrauded. Yet they have no remedy \nat the moment to seek monetary redress from those who aid and abet \nthese crimes. Why? The answer is, aiders and abettors play a vital role \nin allowing primary actors to commit fraud. They should, accordingly, \nbe held proportionately liable for their participation in these \nfraudulent schemes.\n  I believe for our capital markets to function properly, it is not \nsufficient that financial information is accurate. The public must also \nhave full faith and confidence that it is honest, that we have \nintegrity there.\n  Accountants, lawyers, and other securities professionals perform, by \ndesign, a gatekeeping function within our securities markets. It is \nunacceptable, I believe, that those upon whom so many rely--all of us--\nthose whose activities can literally move markets, are not held to the \nhighest standards. Something is wrong.\n  Forty years ago, at a time when securities transactions were \nconsiderably less sophisticated than they are today, Judge Henry \nFriendly, a distinguished jurist remarked:\n\n       In our complex society, the accountant's certificate and \n     the lawyer's opinion can be instruments for pecuniary lost \n     more potent than the chisel or the crowbar.\n\n  Today's staggering shareholder losses demonstrate that over time \nlegal and accounting gimmicks have only grown more potent.\n  I believe we must create greater disincentives for those who would \nassist securities fraud. Restoring liability for aiders and abettors of \nsecurities fraud should make securities professionals think once, \ntwice, even three times before they put their seal of approval on \ninformation sent to the marketplace. Such carefulness will serve \ninvestors and our markets well in the future.\n  Our economy has provided the best material standard of living in the \nworld because our capital markets have traditionally favored clarity \nover complexity, disclosure over dissembling, and fairness over \nfavoritism. For the sake of future economic growth and prosperity, I \nbelieve we must put those principles back into practice.\n  Senator Durbin and I are going to continue to pursue our amendment. \nAs I said earlier, this is not going to go away because there are going \nto be more scheduled. I wish we could have done it on this bill.
