We intentionally adopt for our lives four things Helen \nKeller urged us to learn in life: ``To think clearly without hurry or \nconfusion; To love everyone sincerely; To act in everything with the \nhighest motives; To trust God unhesitantly.'' And for our work, \nKeller's words ring true: ``Alone we can do so little; together we can \ndo so much.'' Thank You, Father, for the memory of this great woman. \nHelp us today to use all that we have to do as much good as we can in \nas many circumstances and to as many people as we can. You are our Lord \nand Saviour.

On behalf of Senator Daschle, the Senate is advised that \nthe Senate will resume consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights \nthat has been called by the Chair. There is going to be an hour of \ndebate on the Allard amendment and thereafter on the Kyl amendment. \nThere will be votes on those two matters this morning.\n  Madam President, I have been advised by the managers of this bill \nthat there has been progress made during the night. If things go as \nexpected, we should be able to meet the deadline that has been set by \nthe leadership; that is, we are going to finish this bill by the Fourth \nof July break and we can also do the supplemental bill and organizing \nresolution.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ALLARD. My understanding is we have an hour for the Allard \namendment equally divided between both sides; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  I would just say, Madam President, the managers of this legislation, \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Edwards, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, \nhave done outstanding work. Senator Gregg and the people he has been \nworking with have been very cooperative. I think this is a good sign \nfor this legislation and movement of this legislation generally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the \nsenior Senator from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Colorado. I will be very brief. \nI would just like to say to all my colleagues, on this issue I think we \nhave made significant progress. Overnight we have the outlines of an \nagreement, thanks to Senators Snowe and DeWine, Nelson, Lincoln, and \nothers, on the issue of employer liability. We hope we can get the \nfinal details of that ironed out soon. I thank those four Senators and \nothers on this issue.\n  On the issue of scope, I think we are close to an agreement on that \nmajor issue.\n  I thank all involved, including Senator Frist and many others, for \nthe serious negotiations that have been ongoing.\n  We may end up with a couple of issues that simply require votes on \nthe floor to resolve them and the majority of the Senate will prevail. \nBut I am very hopeful, and frankly very pleased at the progress we have \nmade. All parties are seriously negotiating. That is the only way you \ncan resolve an issue that has this much detail and this much complexity \nassociated with it.\n  Again, I echo the sentiments of the Senator from Nevada. I think we \ncould easily complete this in the next couple of days with the kind of \nwillingness that has been displayed so far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. One thing I forgot to mention, Senator Kennedy and I, late \nlast night, spoke to Senator Judd Gregg--well, it wasn't late; it was \nin the evening. He indicated he would try today to get a list of \namendments so we would have a finite list of amendments so we could \nwork through those. If we can do that, it will be very easy to schedule \nwhat we will be doing in the next couple of days. If that doesn't \nhappen, there is no question we will have to work late tonight and \ntomorrow night. Everyone should be advised Senator Gregg said he would \ntry to get a finite list of amendments to us this morning.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could just proceed for a moment, I just thank all \nour Members for their cooperation. We have made some progress. There is \na lot of work to do on this. We are encouraged by the cooperation of \nall our Members. But having been around here a long time, we have a lot \nof work to do. We have to keep at this job. There are very important \nmatters before us.\n  We ought to just recognize we have a lot of work to do and we will \nhave a chance to see where we are as we take this step by step. We have \nimportant debates this morning, and we have some additional issues on \nemployer liability that we will address, on medical necessity, and \nhopefully on the areas of scope.\n  Those are being worked out; I hope are being drafted. As we all know, \nthe key is in the details. I don't want to have any false sense of \nanticipation. We have still some very important policy issues that have \nto be resolved. But we are making progress. We are very grateful to all \nthe Members for their help and cooperation, and we look forward to this \nmorning's debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I want to echo the words of my \ncolleagues, the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  There is certainly significant work to be done. Important issues need \nto be resolved. But we spent a good part of the day yesterday working \non the issue of scope, making sure that every American is covered by \nthis bill. I think we have, in fact, made great progress on that issue.\n  On the issue of medical necessity, which is one of the pending \namendments--the Kyl-Nelson amendment--we expect to offer our own \ncompromise amendment on that issue later today, something that was \nworked out yesterday through the process of discussions. As I think \neveryone knows, Senators Snowe, DeWine, and Nelson have worked very \nhard, along with the three of us, to work out an agreement on employer \nliability--all of us believing that employers all over this country \nneed to be protected. That is not what this legislation is about. It is \nabout giving patients rights and putting health care decisions back in \nthe hands of doctors and patients and not in the hands of big HMOs. All \nof us are in agreement that in that process it is important to protect \nemployers so they continue to provide coverage for employees all over \nthis country.\n  So I echo the words of my colleagues. I do think it is true that we \nhave made great progress. I think it is also true there is work left to \nbe done. We will continue to work diligently with our colleagues. We \nhave had colleagues on both sides of the aisle working on all these \nissues. We will continue to work on them as we go forward with these \nvotes and this debate. But we are optimistic that we will be able to \nconclude this bill this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time does this side have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-eight and a half minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I yield 18 minutes to the junior Senator \nfrom Arizona. And I would like to reserve the last 10 minutes for \nmyself.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 818\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I do not intend to take the full time right \nnow. There may be others who wish to speak.\n  Senator Allard has been kind enough to allow those who support the \nNelson-Kyl-Nickles amendment to take some of the time right now. I \nwould like to change the subject back to that amendment which we \nbrought before this body last night and debated for about an hour, and \nthen we will also have an opportunity to conclude the debate on it \nafter the vote on the Allard amendment. But now that we have a few \nmoments, I would like to discuss that.\n  For those who were not in this Chamber last night to hear the debate, \nlet me make it clear that there were two essential problems that we saw \nthat needed resolution. We had worked with Senator Kennedy, Senator \nEdwards, and others--and Senator Nelson had extensive conversations--\nabout how to resolve these issues. One of the issues has apparently \nbeen resolved by agreement, although no amendment has yet been proposed \nto deal with it; and that all has to do with reviewing a case by the \nexternal reviewer. In other words, the insurance company has an \ninternal review of an issue, and then if that isn't resolved, it goes \nto an external reviewer.\n  I think everybody agrees that if we can resolve the case at that \nstage and not have to go to litigation, it is better for everybody. So \nthe question is, what exactly can be considered by that independent \nreviewer? The first problem that we saw was that the independent \nreviewer actually had the authority, under the bill, to order that \nbenefits be provided to a patient that were excluded by the contract--\nlegally excluded. The insured bought a certain set of benefits, and \nthere were certain benefits excluded, but the independent reviewer \nwould theoretically have the right to order excluded benefits to be \nprovided for a patient.\n  I think everybody realized that was not what was intended, and it is \nat least the representation of those on the other side--and \nspecifically Senator Edwards has made the point--that there is a way to \nfix that, and a very specific way, which we all understand. If that \namendment is offered, then I think it will be a satisfactory conclusion \nto that particular matter.\n  The other matter that remains has to do with the other kind of issue \nthat can come up. There is a benefit which is covered but the question \nis, what exactly is the appropriate medical service in this case? Here \nis a very simplistic example. The plan says: We are not sure exactly \nwhat is wrong with this person. We will take an x-ray to find out. But \nthe doctor and the patient say: Look, we already had an x-ray, and the \nx-ray was not definitive enough. We think we need a CAT scan or an MRI.\n  Those are pretty expensive. The plan says: Look, we just don't think \nwe need the MRI.\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\n  That is the dispute. There is no question that the diagnostic service \nis covered. The question is, which diagnostic service is appropriate or \nmedically necessary in this particular case? So it goes to the internal \nreviewer. Let's say the internal reviewer says that an x-ray is good \nenough, but that is not what the doctor or the patient wants to hear. \nSo they go to the independent or external review and make their case.\n\n  What is the standard for the external reviewer to decide whether or \nnot an x-ray is good enough or whether or not there should be a CAT \nscan or an MRI, for example? There should be some kind of standard that \nis relatively uniform, unless the States have adopted a specific \nstandard for review of plans within their particular State.\n  I will read the language in the bill that causes us concern because \nthis is the deficiency as we see it. It is on page 37 of the bill. \nUnder ``Independent Determination.--'':\n\n       In making determinations under this subtitle, a qualified \n     external review entity and an independent medical reviewer \n     shall--\n\n  Let me read the two subparagraphs here.\n\n       (i) consider the claim under view without deference to the \n     determinations made by the plan or issuer or the \n     recommendation of the treating health care professional . . \n     .; and\n       (ii) consider, but not be bound by the definition used by \n     the plan or insurer of ``medically necessary and \n     appropriate'' or ``experimental or investigational''. . . .\n\n  ``Consider, but not be bound by the definition used by the plan''--of \ncourse, that could raise a question of abrogation of contract. When the \ninsurer says: Look, this is the insurance that you bought, and here is \nthe definition under the plan, who has the right to go in and change \nthe definition? So we think that language is inappropriate. The \nindependent reviewer should not be able to just ignore the definition \nin the plan. But that then raises the question of whether or not a \nplan's definition could be overly restrictive.\n  What we basically agreed to, at least some of us believe is an \nappropriate compromise, is to say: You have to use the definition of \nthe plan, but the plan has to have a reasonable definition. What would \nthat definition be?\n  First of all, if a State mandates certain language, then obviously we \nneed to use that language. So for the 13 or so States that actually \nmandate language, that would have to be applied. But for the rest of \nthe States, there would be a definition, and the definition that we use \nis the definition that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan has \nused, approved by the Office of Personnel Management for fee-for-\nservice plans.\n  So, Madam President, you and I, and the other Members of this body \nhave an opportunity to acquire health insurance through the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Plan just as all other Federal employees do. \nAnd there are basically two standards that they use for these \ncontracts. One is for managed care. We consider that to be \ninsufficiently protective of the patients. The other is for the fee-\nfor-service. It is a more strict standard. That is the standard that we \nuse.\n  For 49 percent of the people who are covered by a Blue Cross-Blue \nShield contract--and that language, we believe, is also used by another \n23 percent. So almost three-fourths of the people are covered by very \nspecific language. That is exactly the language we have included in the \nbill.\n  There are five specific elements of it. The one that matters the most \nis the second one, which is: ``Consistent with standards of good \nmedical practice in the United States.''\n  So the reviewer--if you are in a State that does not have a mandatory \ndefinition--would then apply this definition. You might say: \n``Consistent with standards of good medical practice.'' That is pretty \nbroad. That could be almost anything. It is not almost anything. What \nit is is good medical practice. And good medical practice can be \ndetermined by experts in the field, based upon the standards of the \ncommunity, what literature suggests should be done in a particular \ncase, and at least affords an opportunity for the independent reviewer \nto decide whether or not the patient needs the MRI or the CAT scan, in \nthis case, whether good medical practice would ordinarily call for \nthat, or whether, based on the circumstances of this case, it is just \nnot that difficult and an x-ray ought to be good enough.\n  There are four other elements to it as well, but that is the key one.\n  There is a third opportunity here. If people do not like that \ndefinition, even though it covers three-fourths of us under a Federal \nplan, then we provide for a negotiated rulemaking procedure whereby all \nthe stakeholders can get together and figure out a definition. I do not \nknow what that would be. If they can all agree on a definition, we \nprovide a mechanism for them to do so. And if they do, then that \nsupplants this other definition. One year after that is agreed to, then \nthis other definition is gone.\n  So there is an opportunity to come up with something that all of the \nparties agree is better if, in fact, they can do that. In the meantime, \nthis is the definition that would apply. We think that is reasonable. \nWe think it is an improvement on the legislation. Certainly something \nhas to be done with this particular section.\n  Senator Kennedy last night talked to both Senator Nelson and me about \nsome possible changes in that. We are very open to that. I am hoping \nthat in the remaining hour of debate on the Allard amendment--and then \nwe will have the vote on the Allard amendment--and then we have an hour \nof debate on the Nelson-Kyl amendment--I am hoping in that 120 minutes \nor so we can come to an agreement as to what exactly this language \nshould be. If we can, we are very willing to change the amendment and \nadopt whatever we can agree to. Senator Kennedy had one particular idea \nlast night that both Senator Nelson and my staff are exploring right \nnow.\n  If we can do this, then we will announce it to the body. We will \nexplain what it is, and hopefully we will have an agreement that \neveryone can support. If not, then obviously we will need to proceed \nwith this language. In any event, we have identified a problem. We have \na reasonable solution to the problem. If somebody has a better idea, we \nare open to consider what that might be.\n  I urge my colleagues who are interested to come to the floor and \nspeak to it. We not only have a few remaining minutes under Senator \nAllard's time, but we have additional time when the amendment is \ndebated after the vote on the Allard amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time. Again, I invite anyone who is \ninterested in speaking to this matter to come to the Chamber and \naddress it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-six minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 817\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. At the start of this discussion, we ought to understand \nthe significance of the sort of carve-out that is offered by the \nSenator from Colorado. This effectively would eliminate 45 percent of \nall the workers in this country from the kind of coverage and \nprotections we are trying to ensure through the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  It seems to me if you work for a company that employs 48 employees \nand you happen to have a child who needs a specialist, you should not \nbe denied that protection by an HMO making bottom line decisions more \nin the interest of profits rather than in the interest of the child and \nthe medical decision.\n  That is what this issue is all about. Are we going to say if you work \nin a company with 49 employees, you are not covered, but if you work in \na company with 51 employees, you are covered? What kind of fairness is \nthat for the families of America?\n  We recognize that small business--although employing 50 is probably \nsomewhat larger than most of the small businesses we have in our \nState--needs help. They pay 30 or 40 percent more in terms of their \npremiums. They don't deal, in most instances, with the largest of the \nHMOs, many of which act responsibly. They are dealing with the marginal \nHMOs that are more driven by profits and the bottom line rather than \nservices to patients.\n  We know at the present time small businesses have additional burdens \nin terms of affording health insurance. We\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\nought to address that. I am all for addressing it. But excluding them \nfrom this coverage is not addressing that particular problem. It is not \ngoing to change the premiums for this kind of coverage. That is the \nbottom line. If the Senator wants to give help to those small \nbusinesses in terms of additional kinds of financial incentives, or \nhelping them get into various groups so they could purchase their \nhealth insurance at more reasonable levels, we are all for it. But \nfirst, this is not the way to go.\n  As the Senator from Colorado pointed out last night, the HMO's \npremiums have gone up 13 percent last year, 12 percent this year, with \nthe best cost of our proposal being less than 1 percent a year. It is a \ngross misrepresentation and a distortion to think that this is going to \nsolve their particular problems; it will not.\n  What we will be doing, if we accept the Allard amendment, is exposing \nworking families all over the country. Families who are working should \nget the kind of protections we want through this legislation, the kind \nof protections they thought they were getting when they bought their \nhealth insurance. This amendment effectively puts these families on the \nsidelines and frees them from any of the protections of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, as the Senator is aware, we are \ncontinuing to work very aggressively with Members on both sides of the \naisle, led by Senators Snowe, Nelson, and DeWine on this issue, \nspecifically to provide protection for employers, including small \nemployers. As somebody who has been involved with this issue for many \nyears, I wonder if the Senator believes we can have a real patient \nprotection act, real Patients' Bill of Rights, if, in fact, we exempt \nalmost half of the employees in the country from the legislation?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite right. Of course, we cannot. That \nis effectively what we are doing to about 43 or 44 percent. In \naddition, many of those who have looked at the amendment think there \nwill be larger companies that will break down into units of 50 or fewer \nin order to escape the protections of this legislation. That can go on \nad infinitum. We are talking about 40, 45 employees per employer. It \nmay be a lot more.\n  The Senator is quite correct: This is a position that I do not think \neven the President supports. In the President's list of particulars and \nprinciples, he is for holding the employers accountable that are going \nto be involved in making medical decisions that ultimately work to the \ndisadvantage and the harm of the various patients. That isn't what this \nis all about. More likely than not, and I will let others comment on \nthis--if you are a hardware store owner who has four employees and you \nare paying your premium, you are not involved in making medical \njudgments and decisions. That defies any kind of ordinary understanding \nof what is happening with small businesses. They are not the ones doing \nit.\n  The concern we have is that employers who provide HMO coverage to \nseveral hundred employees could say to the HMO: Let me know anytime \nthere is going to be an expense over $50,000 or $75,000 because I want \nto know about it. When the HMO calls them up, they say: Don't provide \nthe service. That is the real world, not the smaller business men and \nwomen.\n  This is an amendment which undermines a basic concept. If the good \nSenator can explain to me, the proponents, why should families in small \ncompanies be put at more risk? Why shouldn't the family members of a \ncompany that has less than 50 employees be able to get the specialists \nthey need? Why shouldn't a woman worker in a smaller company be able to \nget to the OB/GYN as a primary care physician? Why should the wife in a \nsmaller company not be able to get the clinical trial that will save \nher life from cancer?\n  What is the answer from the other side? What is possibly the answer \nfrom the other side? Well, the premiums have gone up.\n  We have talked about the issue of premiums. The President understands \nthat. It seems to me, with the Allard amendment, we are putting the \nworkers in these plants and factories at enormous risk. Whatever the \nproblems are today, once we give them carte blanche, the problems are \njust going to increase a thousandfold. These employers are going to be \nimmune, effectively, from any kind of action.\n  We are opening the barn door and inviting any employer to go with any \nHMO. It won't make any difference because there will not be a remedy \nfor the workers. Is that what this whole debate and discussion is \nabout? I don't think so.\n  I hope this amendment will not be accepted. It is a carve-out. As the \nSenator from North Carolina has stated, there are Members on both sides \nof the aisle who are working--Senator Snowe and others--to tighten the \nlanguage included in the basic document. We have talked about and \ndebated the language during this time, in terms of the role of the \nemployer and to ensure that there won't be unwarranted additional \nburdens on the employer. That is in the process. That is what we are \ndealing with as the way to go. We are going to have the opportunity to \nconsider that later in the day.\n  Now we have an amendment that is going to effectively eliminate \nresponsibility for almost half of the employees in this country. The \nprotection for those employees is not warranted and justified with the \nlegislation.\n\n  How much time do we have remaining, Madam President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I would like to speak briefly to the Allard amendment. Let me say \nfirst to my colleague, the sponsor of the amendment, who is in the \nChamber, I have no doubt that his intentions in this amendment are \nnothing but good and he is trying to accomplish something he believes \nis important. The problem is this approach is extreme. It is extreme, \nit is outside the mainstream of all the work, essentially, that has \nbeen done on this issue.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill deals specifically with protecting \nsmall employers. The competing legislation, the Frist-Breaux bill, also \ndeals with that issue, without this kind of extreme carve-out. The \nNorwood-Dingell bill that passed the House of Representatives by a wide \nmargin did not have this kind of language in it. The American Medical \nAssociation, the medical groups from all over the country would not \nsupport this kind of carve-out. The reason is, it is impossible to have \na real Patients' Bill of Rights so all patients and families across \nthis country are protected if in fact you exclude almost half the \nemployees in this country.\n  The more sensible approach, the more mainstream approach, which is \nthe one we are taking in our legislation and as we speak, is to make \nsure you provide the maximum protection you can, keeping the interests \nof the patient in mind, for these small employers. That is the reason \nwe are continuing, as we speak, working across party lines, to craft \nlanguage that we believe is appropriate to the purpose of protecting \nemployers in general and specifically to protecting small employers. \nBut to exclude almost half of the employees in this country from this \nlegislation means we have essentially left half the country out of \npatient protection, which I do not think anyone thinks is a sensible \nsolution to the issue.\n\n  So I understand the concern. It is a concern we believe we have \naddressed in our legislation, which is to protect small employers. But \nwe are working to go further with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, Republican and Democrat, to make sure small businesses all over \nthe country are protected. But the solution is not to penalize almost \nhalf the families in this country and not provide them with the same \nrights that all other Americans would have.\n  It just makes no sense to have no patient protection for employees \nwho work at a firm of 48, 49 employees and for a firm with 60 \nemployees, in fact, the protections are there. That is just illogical; \nit doesn't make any sense. Most important, it is an extreme response to \na legitimate issue. The legitimate issue that is raised we believe we\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\nhave adequately responded to in our legislation by specifically \nprotecting employers. But in addition to that, we are taking further \nsteps to make sure all employers, and specifically small employers, are \nprotected.\n  So I say to my colleagues, if you are concerned about employers, if \nyou are concerned about small employers, we have protections for that \ngroup in our legislation. We are going further on that issue as we work \nacross party lines on another amendment that will be offered, we \nexpect, later this afternoon.\n  But this measure is totally outside the mainstream. It is outside \nwhat we have done. It is outside the Frist-Breaux bill. It is outside \nthe Norwood-Dingell bill. It is outside anything the American Medical \nAssociation or medical groups across this country would ever support.\n  So while I understand the issue being raised by my colleague, this \nmeasure is extreme and it penalizes almost half of the families in this \ncountry and leaves them out of patient protection. Those families will \nstill be in the same place they are today, which is HMOs can deny them \ncoverage and they cannot do anything about it; they are simply stuck. \nWomen will not have the right to go to their OB/GYNs; children will not \nhave access to specialists; there will be no emergency room protection \nif they need to go to the nearest emergency room; and there will be no \nway to challenge any decision that an HMO has. That 45 percent of \nAmerican families, almost half of American families, under this \namendment would be totally left out. They would continue to be in the \nplace where the HMO held complete control over their health care.\n  That is what we are trying to do something about. It is not the right \nthing to do, to exempt almost half of America from this patient \nprotection. Not that the concern is not legitimate, because it is, but \nthis response is extreme and totally outside the mainstream of the work \nand thinking that has been done by everyone in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can the Senator conceive of a situation where the \nemployer got hold of the HMO and said: Look, I have a worker who has \nbeen hurt. I know it is going to be a costly process to bring that \nworker back to good health, and I don't want you to spend more than \n$25,000 on this. I want to put a limit on this. We are not going to \nspend more. I don't want you to spend more.\n  The HMO is going to say, if I am going to keep this as a client, I am \ngoing to follow that client.\n  Let me ask you this. If the Allard amendment is accepted, and the \nworker was seriously injured because of the failure to give the kind of \nmedical treatment that the doctors have recommended and suggested, \nwould that patient be able to hold that employer accountable under the \nAllard amendment?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. In answer to the Senator's question, not only under this \namendment the employer couldn't be held accountable, in fact the HMO \ncouldn't be held accountable because they would both be exempted from \nthe legislation. So the family and the patient would be completely left \nout. That was my point earlier in responding to the Senator, in my \ncomment that this is an extreme response. We have a response, both in \nour legislation and legislation on which the Senator has been very \nactively involved, that provides adequate protection, will make sure \nsmall employers are protected, but does not punish almost half the \nfamilies in the country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, this is almost an \ninvitation, is it not, to employers, such as the mom-and-pop stores \nthat have half a dozen employees, that basically are just paying the \npremium and are not making the decisions? Someone will say to them: \nLook, not only do you get your health insurance but you can just tell \nyour HMO not to spend more than $10,000 or $15,000. You can do that and \nbe completely immune and save yourself in terms of the additional \npremiums, although in that way you put at risk your workers. Could they \nnot do that?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Not only that, but I say to the Senator, having worked \nfor and with small businesspeople for many years, I know they care \nabout their employees. They care deeply about their employees, the vast \nmajority of small businesses around this country. They do not want \ntheir employees to be in a position that they have no rights against \nthe HMO.\n  To small businesspeople all over this country, their lifeblood is \ntheir employees. They need those people to come to work every day, \nenjoy the work, and be productive. One of the critical components of \nthat, as the Senator well knows after all his years of work on this \nissue, is that they have quality health care. The small employers in \nthis country who care about their employees--in my judgment, the vast \nmajority--will want to make sure their employees have the best product \nthey could possibly have. They will want them to have the same \nprotections.\n  Those small employers will want to be protected from liability. That \nis a reasonable concern, and that is the concern, as the Senator knows, \nthat we have addressed in our legislation and we are continuing to \naddress with even stronger language with colleagues from across the \naisle.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, if I may yield myself 30 seconds--under the \nproposal that we anticipate and support, I will make the assertion that \nunder this proposal and Senator Snowe's proposal later in the \nafternoon, which will be introduced with the good support of the now \nPresiding Officer, we will ensure those employees are going to be \nprotected. That is the way to go. That is what we want to achieve, to \ngive real protection to those employers. That is the way to proceed.\n  I think it is a much more effective way, efficient way for the \nemployers, a more fair way for them, and certainly a great deal more \nfair for their employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes and then, \nfollowing my 5 minutes, yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I think we ought to just take a little time out here and \nsummarize where we are in this debate on whether or not we exempt \nbusinesses of 50 employees or fewer. And this is the way I want to lay \nit out. The Democrats are arguing that 41 percent of small business \nemployees will lack protection from HMOs. That argument is wrong. \nForty-one percent of small business employees will be subject to \nincreased health care premiums or even losing their health maintenance \ninsurance altogether. They will not be insured.\n  So this argument that there is a line being drawn between 48 and 51 \nemployees, the fact is, when you expose small employers and small \nbusinesses to increased lawsuits when they take on a program, they are \nnot going to take on the program. So employees will not be insured.\n  Moreover, an employee does not get protection from HMOs from suing \ntheir employer. If they need to sue, they should sue their HMO, not the \nemployer, who happens to be, by the way, kind enough to offer the \nhealth insurance.\n  Under S. 1052, employee health costs will increase $1.19 per month. \nAgain, I believe this argument is irrelevant, and because of S. 1052 we \nwill see, in my view, more than 1 million Americans will lose their \nhealth insurance. At least the Senate can do something to help out \nsmall employers by exempting them from these unnecessary lawsuits. I am \ntalking about businesses with less than 50 employees.\n  S. 1052 will allow a small business of five employees, for example, \nto be sued for unlimited economic, unlimited noneconomic damages, and \nup to $5 million in punitive damages. Now, that is not protecting the \nsmall businessman. That is not protecting those businesses that have 50 \nor fewer employees.\n  According to a recent survey of 600 national employers, 46 percent of \nthe employers would be likely to drop health insurance coverage for \ntheir workers if they are exposed to new health care lawsuits, plain \nand simple.\n  I will ask to print in the Record a Denver Post editorial from June \n21,\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\n2001. I will quote a small section of it. It says:\n\n       The competing Democrat bill, in our view, goes too far and \n     includes a provision that will allow employees to sue their \n     employers for denial of a medical request if the employer \n     helped make the decision.\n       We think this type of language would have the effect of \n     encouraging more lawsuits and driving up costs instead of \n     encouraging quick, early resolution of disputes.\n\n  It went on to say:\n\n       We also find fault with the provisions that would authorize \n     individual lawsuits to produce punitive damage awards in the \n     multimillion-dollar range. Compensatory damages are one \n     thing; punitive damage awards are quite another.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, June 21, 2001]\n\n                       Weighing Patients' Rights\n\n       As we are so often reminded, the demands for medical care \n     are infinite while supply is not. HMOs arrived on the scene \n     some years ago and quickly became the primary form of medical \n     insurance precisely because they were designed to hold down \n     medical costs. Employers, who provide the lion's share of \n     insurance, liked them for that reason.\n       Now, but a few short years later, public opinion polls \n     suggest the general public believes HMOs provide an inferior \n     form of insurance.\n       Enter Congress.\n       The U.S. Senate is considering bills that would establish a \n     Patients' Bill of Rights and specifically authorize a patient \n     to sue the HMO for damages incurred when medical care is \n     denied.\n       The issue for the Senate and for the nation is how wide to \n     open the doors to the courts.\n       President Bush has offered what seems to be a sensible \n     compromise. He supports a bill sponsored by Sens. John \n     Breaux, D-La., Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and James Jeffords, \n     former Republican turned independent from Vermont. The bill \n     would establish an independent review process to resolve \n     disputes before a lawsuit could be filed. Thus, a person who \n     wants a particular medical service and is denied would be \n     required first to submit his complaint to a review panel, \n     which, in turn, would consider the facts and make a timely \n     decision.\n       This approach recognizes the legitimate interest of the \n     medical provider in controlling costs by delivering only \n     necessary medical treatments. At the same time, it provides \n     for a second set of eyes to review the quality of the \n     decision.\n       The competing Democratic bill, in our view, goes too far \n     and includes a provision that would allow employees to sue \n     their employers for a denial of a medical request if the \n     employer helped make the decision.\n       We think this type of language would have the effect of \n     encouraging more lawsuits and driving up costs instead of \n     encouraging quick, early resolution of disputes. We also find \n     fault with the provisions that would authorize individual \n     lawsuits to produce punitive damage awards in the \n     multimillion-dollar range. Compensatory damages are one \n     thing; punitive damage awards are quite another.\n       It would be nice if we could all have medical care provided \n     on our terms alone. Somewhere a balance must be struck.\n       We favor something closer to the president's position than \n     to that endorsed by the Democratic leadership, but remain \n     optimistic that--given the high political stakes--the nation \n     will see a bill signed this year.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the employer is not protected. In fact, he \nis exposed to more lawsuits--multimillion-dollar lawsuits. In order to \nprotect himself, he is not going to provide health insurance. That \nmeans the employees will not be covered. The argument was made, why \ndon't you provide coverage for small employers? Why don't you provide \ncoverage for emergency service? Why don't they provide coverage for \nmedical needs that occur in families and what not? The employer isn't \ngoing to provide that coverage if he has to face lawsuits. It is \noptional. He will decide not to offer health insurance.\n  I was a small businessman and I had to face the challenge of medical \ncosts. We had between 10 and 15 employees. The health care costs were \neating us alive. So finally we went to the employees and said what we \nwould like to do is this: We can't afford this, so we will pay you more \nin a salary and then, hopefully, that will be enough of an increase \nthat you can buy your own health insurance. We could not afford to do \nthat. That was in times that weren't as challenging as they are today.\n  We are seeing horrendous increases in premiums to small business \nemployers. Now we are going to tack on top of that these mandates and \nincreased costs and the increased threat of a lawsuit. It is not hard \nfor me to believe that we are going to have at least a million more \nworkers out there who are not going to be insured if this bill passes.\n  Now, it is 41 percent of the workforce that we are talking about with \nthis amendment. But I look at it a different way. I think we are \nhelping assure that they will have health care coverage with this \namendment because we are exempting them from the lawsuits.\n  I think this amendment is a very responsible one. It is needed. If it \nis not adopted, the small business community of 50 employees or less \nwill suffer.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Colorado and I \ncommend him for this amendment, which I think is very important because \nit goes to one of the real key areas in this Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We want to make sure that people have good health care coverage and \nthat they get what they deserve from their HMO, their insurance \ncompany. That is what this debate is all about. How do we get there? \nOne of the most important parts of that question is how we deal with \nthe small businesses that provide health care coverage now for their \nemployees and who may not in the future.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle insist that employers \nwill not drop coverage due to the McCain-Kennedy bill. For some \nemployers, that is probably true. Virtually all large companies offer \nhealth care, and even if we pass this legislation and dramatically \nincrease costs, they will probably have to do so. They will have to pay \nmore and their employees will have to pay more. But they are likely to \nhave coverage. But from everything I am hearing from the small business \ncommunity, it is much less likely that small businesses--even those who \nnow provide health care coverage--will be able to do so.\n  I heard a colleague on the other side of the aisle say that the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill has taken care of small employers--the small \nemployers health care provision. Right. Just like a herbicide takes \ncare of a bed of flowers, it is going to kill small business health \ncare at the roots. I know what ``taken care of'' means in that context. \nI have sprayed herbicide; I know what they do to a flower bed or a \nlawn. That is how McCain-Kennedy takes care of the health care coverage \nof small business. They drive them out.\n\n  Small businesses are the ones that are struggling to survive. Small \nbusinesses are the ones that struggle to provide health care. They are \nat the heart of the problem that the McCain-Kennedy bill totally \nignores--the 43 million Americans who have no health insurance. Of that \n43 million Americans who have no health care insurance, approximately \n60 percent are small businessowners, employees and their dependents, \nthe family members. That is 25.8 million Americans, either small \nbusinessowners, employees, or family members, who are not covered by \nhealth insurance. They can't be a patient under the Patients' Bill of \nRights. In Missouri, we have 570,000 uninsured, and 342,000 are in \nfamilies headed by a small businessperson, man or woman.\n  If we drive more of the small businesses out of health care coverage, \nthose numbers are going to go up. That is a disaster. That is the wrong \nway to go. Many small businesses do not offer coverage. Why is that? \nWell, there are still many barriers to small businesses providing \nhealth care coverage.\n  First, they have higher premium costs.\n  Second, they have higher annual premium increases.\n  Third, there are more difficult administrative hurdles. In mom and \npop operations, neither mom nor pop usually has the administrative \nskills to set up health care and other benefit plans.\n  Limited deductions for the self-employed, we voted on that last week. \nUnfortunately, my colleagues chose to turn a blind eye to the needs of \nthe self-employed and their families and said we are going to skip them \nin this bill. That is one more mistake in this bill. Here are the \nproblems. Under McCain-Kennedy, there would be a 4.2 percent cost \nincrease--slightly more. That is going to make health care coverage \nmore expensive for the small\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\nbusiness and the small business employee. That means fewer patients, \nbecause 300,000 lose coverage for every 1 percent increase.\n\n  Exposure to liability is the big one. Employers throughout Missouri \nare writing: we cannot afford the continuing cost increases in health \ncare and we will not tolerate those plus exposure to liability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the Senator an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for 1 minute.\n  Most small businesses in America are only one lawsuit away from going \nout of business. This lawsuit, under the multitude of causes of action \nprovided in the McCain-Kennedy bill, could drive any single small \nbusiness out of business. They are one lawsuit away from going out of \nbusiness. Small businesses are smart enough to know if they are one \nlawsuit away from going out of business because they provide health \ncare, they are one McCain-Kennedy bill away from getting out of the \nhealth care coverage business.\n  The 43 million Americans who are now uninsured--watch those numbers \nincrease. Yesterday I noted 1,895 Missouri employees of small \nbusinesses would lose health care coverage because their small business \nemployer could not take the risk. That number is going to be higher. It \nis much higher nationally.\n  I commend the amendment offered by my colleague from Colorado. I \noffer this as a suggestion: If Members care about small businesses and \nthe health care coverage they provide their employees, vote for the \nAllard amendment. This is the only way to save small businesses from a \nknife in their back, making health care coverage for their employees \nunaffordable.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Allard. Yesterday we \nhad an amendment on exempting employers from being sued. That amendment \nwas important. This amendment is important, as well.\n  Our basic point yesterday was, when an employer, because they care \nabout their employees and because they want to attract and hold good \nemployees, puts up their own money to help people buy health insurance, \nwe should not reward that voluntary activity by making them liable to \nbeing dragged into court and sued.\n  The bill before the Senate is a classic bait and switch bill, make no \ndoubt. It says you cannot sue employers, and then it says you can sue \nemployers, and it has 7\\1/2\\ pages of conditions under which employers \ncan be sued, including conditions where they exercise control, which is \na little trick phrase because ERISA, the program that governs employer \nbenefits to employees, guarantees that the employers are always deemed \nto be in control. So the bill before the Senate is written to guarantee \nevery employer in America can be sued. If anybody doesn't understand \nthat, it is because they don't want to understand it.\n  This amendment does not fix the problem. This amendment simply makes \na plea that if you are going to force companies such as Wal-Mart to \ncancel their insurance--at least they have smart lawyers and they have \nlots of money and can figure out a way to get around this provision by \nchanging their plans. Some of them won't. They will cancel their health \ninsurance. And the proponents of this bill will be back a year from \nnow, 2 years from now, saying, well, the number of uninsured has gone \nup and we need to have the Government take over and run the health care \nsystem.\n\n  This amendment is simply a last gasp effort to introduce some reason \ninto this bill which says while clearly this bill is aimed at allowing \nemployers to be sued, and clearly large employers are going to be hit \nwith this liability and they are going to be forced either to drop \ntheir plan or change it, they have some ability to make a change. It is \nnot smart. It is counterproductive. It is hurtful to America. But that \nis the way it is. That is the majority position.\n  The point is, this amendment says, if the company has 50 or fewer \nemployees. We are talking about small business; we are not talking \nabout companies that can go out and hire a legion of lawyers; we are \nnot talking about companies that have the ability to junk their health \ncare plan and to figure out a clever way to try to get around the \ndevastating provisions in this bill. If you vote against this \namendment, you are saying to every small business in America, we don't \ncare if you are sued; we don't care if you provide health insurance.\n  It is unimaginable we would not adopt this amendment and say that \nwhile we are willing in the name of bringing lawsuits to the doorstep \nof every employer in America, we are not willing to destroy the ability \nof small business to provide health insurance, and therefore we are \ngoing to adopt this amendment. This does not fix the problem. This is \nan amendment that should bring out some degree of shame as to what we \nare willing to do. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes, and the other side has 7 minutes \n16 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, the issue is the protection of these workers. We have \nhad 22 days of hearings; we have had this legislation for 5 years, \ntrying to get it before the Senate; and now we have the opportunity to \nprovide real protections to families in this country.\n  Now this amendment wants to say, we will provide protections for some \nbut we will eliminate 45 percent of the protections for families in \nthis country. What possible sense does that make?\n  There is a representation that somehow employers will be at risk. \nThey will not be at risk unless they are making medical decisions that \nwill result in harm or injury to the patient. If they are not, they are \nfree, in spite of all the agitation we have heard from those supporting \nthis amendment.\n  I have been around here long enough to realize that when we take on \nthe special interests--and that is the HMO in this case--we hear dire \nconsequences. When we worked on the Family and Medical Leave we heard \nthe estimates that it would cost American business $25 to $30 billion a \nyear. That was all malarkey. We worked on the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill \nregarding portability of health insurance, particularly for the \ndisabled. They said it would increase the premiums 30 percent, it would \nbe the end of small business and the end of the American economy. That \nwas a lot of baloney. We worked on increasing the minimum wage. We \nheard it would put small business out of business, and that there would \nbe hundreds of thousands out of work all over this country. That was \nbaloney.\n  The burden we hear that would be put on small business is baloney. \nThey have nothing to fear. They have nothing to fear in this. But the \nHMOs have something to fear if they are not going to permit doctors and \nnurses and trained personnel to provide for their patients.\n  The facts belie these representations that have been made. If you \nlook at the States that have tough HMO legislation, as we have gone \nthrough repeatedly, the message should become clear. For instance, in \nTexas with their tough HMO law, there have been 17 cases in 5 years.\n  California has a tough law that has been in effect now 9 months, and \nno cases. No cases. Do you hear me? No cases. No small businessmen, \nnobody with 50 or less, none, no cases on it. And what has happened? \nThe employees are getting the protections they need.\n  Now we hear, well, what about the premiums? I read into the Record \nyesterday that the total cost of this amounts to 1 percent a year over \nthe period of the future--4.2 percent over 5 years. That amounts to \nabout $1.19 a month. Let me tell every premium payer in this country \nabout what is happening in terms of their premiums, why they are going \nup.\n  We have Mr. McGuire, United Health Group, who got $54 million in \ncompensation last year and $357 million in stock options for a total \ncompensation of $411 million. That is $4.25 a month for every premium. \nWe are talking about $1.19 a month.\n  You want to do something about the increase in terms of your \npremiums, tell Mr. McGuire he does not need $411\n\n[[Page S6944]]\n\nmillion a year in annual compensation and stock options. We know what \nis happening. They had $3.5 billion--$3.5 billion--in profits last \nyear. Fine. Well and good. But when you see the millions of dollars \nthat they are spending out there on the airwaves every single day, \ndon't cry crocodile tears in this Chamber about what is going to happen \nto the HMOs.\n  We are going to ensure that small businesses will be protected. I \nwill join with the Senators from Colorado and Texas if they want to try \nto assist small business with help through the Tax Code to offset the \n25 to 30 percent increase in premiums. The reason they are getting that \n25 or 30 percent increase is because they are getting gouged by the \nmajor HMOs. That is the real reason. That is what we ought to be about, \nthe real business of that, not taking it out on the injured patients in \nthis country who are not getting the health care they need. How much \ntime do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield that time to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Let me just conclude from our side by saying a couple \nthings about what the Senator from Colorado is trying to accomplish. We \nunderstand his concern about this issue. We do not believe this is the \nappropriate response or the appropriate measure. This is an extreme \nresponse to a legitimate issue. The legitimate issue is making sure \nsmall business people all over this country are in fact protected. We \nhave provided in our legislation that unless they make an individual \nmedical decision, which small businesspeople do not, then they are \nimmune from responsibility.\n  No. 2, in addition to that, we are continuing to negotiate with our \ncolleagues--Senator Snowe, the presiding Senator, and others--on this \nissue, and we expect to have an amendment to offer later today that \nalso will provide further protection for small businessmen.\n  I know that the Presiding Officer and many others on both sides of \nthe aisle care deeply about this issue. This is an extreme response. It \nwill have an extraordinarily bad effect on almost half of the employees \nin this country. It is outside the mainstream, outside our legislation, \noutside the Frist-Breaux bill, outside the Norwood-Dingell bill, not \nsupported by the American Medical Association, not supported by any of \nthe health care groups in this country. This is not what needs to be \ndone. So I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment, to vote against \nit, to vote with the patients, and we will continue to address the \nissue of ensuring that small businesses all over America are protected.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, has time expired on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 42 seconds. The Senator from \nColorado has 1 minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I reserve my time until the majority has used their time \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Very quickly, with the remaining 40 seconds that we \nhave, we urge our colleagues to vote against this amendment. We are \ndoing the things necessary to protect small businesspeople all over \nthis country, but that can be done without leaving almost half of the \nfamilies of America uncovered by the necessary patient protections that \nare in our legislation. For that reason we urge our colleagues to vote \nagainst the Allard amendment.\n  We yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues from Texas and from \nMissouri for their very cogent comments on small business and the \nadverse impact of this particular bill on small business. My particular \namendment exempts businesses of 50 employees or less. This is important \nbecause what we do in this bill is we expose businesses to more \nlawsuits. The consequences are that businesses will not insure their \nemployees. They will not provide health coverage. The other side is \ntrying to make the point that somehow or the other this amendment will \nhurt health care coverage for employees. Just the opposite will happen. \nIf this amendment is not adopted and the bill is passed, small \nemployers all over America will cancel their health care coverage and \nturn to the employee and ask them to provide for their own health care \ncoverage. That is not more health care coverage; that is less health \ncare coverage.\n  I am a small businessman. I have had to face those tough decisions, \nand it is not hard for me to believe that a million employees will lose \nhealth care coverage if this particular bill is passed. I am going to \nask my colleagues in this Chamber to vote for this Allard amendment \nbecause we want to make sure that we have a viable small business \ncommunity in America. We want to assure that coverage for employees now \ncovered by health plans of their small business employers continues.\n  If this bill passes, there is a good chance they are going to lose \nthat coverage and that is going to mean less health care coverage for \nemployees, not more.\n  This is a key amendment. It is a key vote for the small business \ncommunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask Senators to join me in supporting the Allard \namendment. It is important to the small business community. It is \nimportant to health care in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 817. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper) and \nthe Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 199 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Carper\n     Schumer\n       \n  The amendment (No. 817) was rejected.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, could we have order in the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is a very serious matter we would \nlike to discuss with the Senate. I do hope the Senate will come to \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Members will take \ntheir conversations off the floor.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I have asked for recognition at this time \nso\n\n[[Page S6945]]\n\nthat I might inquire of the joint leadership as to when we might expect \nto take up the supplemental appropriations bill. That bill was reported \nfrom the Appropriations Committee several days ago. It is on the \ncalendar. We only have a little time left this week.\n  The administration has asked for this bill. The amount in the bill is \nwithin the request of the President of the United States--not one cent, \nnot one thin dime over the President's request.\n  The bill has had the joint support of the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Stevens, and myself, and our respective sides.\n  I will be able, at a later time, to compliment the members of the \ncommittee. Right now I want to inquire. This is a very serious matter. \nThe administration says it wants this bill before we go out because of \nthe need in the military for moneys for services, for training, and so \nforth. I do not want us to be out through this recess and have this \nbill hanging out there, and have it there when we get back.\n  Now we are ready to go. I would suggest we try to get a time \nagreement that would be amenable to the feelings of the two leaders and \nour respective sides. I think we can do that. I have every confidence \nwe can do that. I just take the floor now to inquire as to what the \nchances are for us to move this supplemental appropriations bill before \nwe go home for the Independence Day recess.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. BYRD. I gladly yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I just received word from the House of \nRepresentatives that they are scheduling two appropriations bills on \nthe floor, and they have bipartisan agreement to finish by Thursday \nnight. That is why this dialog right now is very important. We do have \nto go to conference with the House before they leave.\n  I join the Senator in making the inquiry.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I yield to the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nyielding.\n  I reply that it would be my intention to complete the supplemental \nprior to the time we leave. I do not think we ought to leave Washington \nprior to the time the supplemental has been satisfactorily disposed of. \nI do not think we ought to take vacation until this legislation has \nbeen completed.\n  I have indicated, just now, to Senator Lott that if we could reach \nsome agreement--a finite list of amendments remaining on this bill, \nwith an understanding of how long these amendments would require for \ndebate--that I may be willing to enter into something I was not \nprepared to do earlier, which is to move to the supplemental prior to \nthe time we complete our work on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We will \ncomplete our work on the Patients' Bill of Rights this week, and we \nwill finish the supplemental this week, and the organizing resolution \nthis week --or before we leave, whatever time it takes.\n  I hope our House colleagues will choose not to leave town until the \nconference has been completed and until we have been able to deal with \nthe conference as well. It should not take long in conference. But \nclearly that work must be done. As I say, if we could reach that \nagreement with regard to a finite list, I would be prepared then to \nfind a way with which to schedule and then perhaps take up a unanimous \nconsent agreement that would allow us to consider the supplemental over \na designated period of time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the leader is correct about the timing. \nWe should all stay until we finish this matter. But if we don't finish \nit by Thursday, and the House is already scheduled, I can tell you, you \nare not from as far west as I am, but you can't get reservations out of \nthis place over the Fourth of July now. It is going to be very \ndifficult for all of us and our staffs to get out of town for the \nFourth of July unless we know now what we are going to be able to do. I \nam confident they will stay if they know we are sincere about \nfinishing.\n  I am prepared to stay tonight. We have a Republican dinner tonight, \nbut I think we can stay tonight. That would be a time when we normally \nwould not have votes, but we can have our debates on whatever \namendments might be offered and get an agreement to vote tomorrow at \nthe leader's discretion. We have to get this bill to the House by \ntomorrow noon or it is not fair to ask them to stay to complete it. We \nshould not expect them to just stay here, cancel all their \nreservations, not knowing whether we are going to finish by Thursday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the distinguished majority leader, with the \nunderstanding I not lose my rights to the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Let me just say, the whole purpose in my announcement early last week \nthat we would have to finish the supplemental, the organizing \nresolution, and the Patients' Bill of Rights was to accommodate \nSenators who had reservations. It is not my desire to inconvenience \nSenators or Members of the House with regard to this schedule. I do \nbelieve that the President believes, and many of us believe, that \nvacations are important, reservations are important, but not as \nimportant as finishing the supplemental, not as important as the \nPatient Protection Act, certainly not as important as the organizing \nresolution. We will stay here. I hope our House colleagues will share \nthe same view we have with regard to the importance of getting our work \ndone on the supplemental.\n  I announced that last week. I don't know if people believed I was \nserious about it, but we are serious. We are resolute. That will be the \norder for whatever length of time it takes to complete our work.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n  I yield to my counterpart.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I know the Senator from Oregon wishes to have a \nconversation. I am prepared--I think the Senator should be prepared--to \npresent to the Senate now our wishes with regard to the agreement.\n  From my own point of view, we have a very limited managers' amendment \nwhich Senator Byrd and I are working on, and I think we disclosed it \nwith most people. But other than that, I know of only one amendment \nthat is certain to be offered. That is an amendment of the Senator from \nArizona.\n  I am prepared to enter into an agreement of no more than an hour on \nan amendment, and amendments be disclosed here by noon. We will debate \nthem tonight and vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may I first yield to the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon who has been waiting. Then I want to respond to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. Senator Byrd does not have a bigger fan in this Chamber than \nI when it comes to the way he defends the people of West Virginia.\n  I am one of those who would like not to be holding up this bill, but \nI am looking at a situation in the Klamath Basin of Oregon and \nCalifornia that is in a drought condition. Drought is typical in the \nwestern United States. It is regular. You can count on it. Unlike past \ndroughts, the people of Klamath Basin have had the Government magnify \ntheir drought by cutting off every drop of water. There are probably \n1,500 farm families who have no income because of a Government policy \nwhich has exalted a bottom-feeding sucker fish above their welfare.\n  That is the Government's choice, if it wants to save the sucker fish, \nbut my plea is that in this bill, as the President has asked, that at \nleast the $20 million he has asked for be included or else I can't get \nout of the way.\n  I do this in the spirit of Robert Byrd and the way I have seen him \noperate. I admire it so much because I can't go home and look into the \nfaces of these desperate people who are without now because of the \nFederal Government. The truth is, they need $200 million, if\n\n[[Page S6946]]\n\nwe want to be right by them. But the President only asked for 20. I am \nasking that we do at least that much.\n  I thank the Senator for his consideration.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I know about the Klamath problem. I would \nbe happy to discuss that. I also know that the administration wants \nthis bill. I hope the Senator will not stand in the way of final action \non it. There are many things I have wanted over the years, and the \nSenator has every right to stand on the floor as long as his feet will \nhold him and speak as long as he wants. I will be here listening when \nhe speaks. I have a sick wife. She has been in the hospital now for 10 \ndays--9 days, but she is on the mend. I will be here as long as the \nSenator wants to talk. If he wants to stay in the way of the bill, I \nwill be here listening. But we will talk about this.\n  I am not saying no, but I am saying that when anyone wants to stand \nin the way, they are going to have the administration to compete with \nthere. The President wants this bill. And my friend Ted Stevens and I \nhave busted a gut to get this bill to the floor and to keep it within \nthe President's limits.\n  If any Senator is contemplating calling up an amendment, if it is a \nmoney amendment, that Senator ought to be ready to find an offset in \nthe bill. That Senator ought to be ready to have the administration \ncall that amendment an emergency on this bill. Now, if the \nadministration wants to call it an emergency or if there is an offset, \nI am sure the Senator probably won't have a great deal of trouble. But \nI want to do what the President has asked for in this instance. This \nmoney is needed now.\n  That is a long story, but I say to the distinguished Senator from \nOregon that he won't be by himself if he wants to hold up the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. LOTT. I apologize to my colleagues for not being here to hear the \ndiscussion earlier. I have been briefed on basically what has been \nsaid.\n  I commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nranking member for the work they have done on this very important \ndefense, and other issues, supplemental appropriations bill. They have \nworked hard. They did bust a gut to get it out, and they held it within \nthe area of the President's request. They have done a credible and \nformidable job.\n  I would like to get a time agreement, a tight time agreement, and a \nlimit on amendment or amendments, and would, in spite of the fact that \nthere is a very important conflict tonight, be willing to work with the \nmanagers of the legislation to see if we could get an agreement to do \nit tonight so that a conference would be possible with the House and \nthis very important matter could be completed in the conference and the \nmoney be available for the needs of our defense and the health care of \nour military men and women.\n  I will be glad to work with the Senator from West Virginia and with \nhis leader, the majority leader, and to work with Senators who do have \nconcerns to make sure we address those, that they are heard.\n  The important thing is that we push to try to get this done. I \nappreciate that effort. I know the President wants it. I have spoken to \nhim, and Senator Daschle has spoken to him. Clearly, we need to get \nthis business done. I make my commitment to the Senator that I will \nwork with him and others to see if we can't work out an agreement to \nhandle the bill tonight and then we can do the conference tomorrow. I \nwill be working on that and will confer with Senators as we go forward.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Republican leader. Let me \nclose by urging that our respective staffs--I thank both leaders for \nthe assurances they have given of cooperation and of desire to get the \nbill finished. I would like to suggest that the proposal by Senator \nStevens go forward, that our respective staffs get together, work out a \ntime agreement, and any Senators who want to offer amendments under the \nconstrictions that have been stated here, by which we are bound, let's \nhave those Senators come forward by noon today and tell us about their \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator has finished----\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield for a moment, because of my \nnegotiations with the House, I urge that we set a time limit on when we \nare coming back, if that is agreeable to the leadership, and that we \nannounce that amendments must be presented to us at the desk by noon.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I make that request.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object and I will object, I haven't \nhad an opportunity to confer with the majority leader. He should be in \non this. We will be happy to try to work something out. I object until \nSenator Daschle is apprised of this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I still have the floor. I don't lose it on \nan objection to a unanimous consent request. Let me simply say that I \nwill just express the hope that we can know by noon. I have discussed \nthis with our leader during the break. I certainly want to work with \nour distinguished whip between now and then. There hasn't been any \nDemocratic whip in my time here that is any better, and few have been \nas good as Mr. Reid. I am not one of those who is any better. I am one \nof those who hasn't been as good a whip as Mr. Reid. So I thank him. I \nam sure that we will work together.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for one more inquiry?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there some way to set a time limit so we can go to \nthe House and let them know? They have schedules to meet, too. I urge \nthat we have some way to get an agreement that we have this bill called \nup tonight and we debate any amendments tonight and all amendments must \nbe debated tonight and that we vote tomorrow. That seems to be \nagreeable with the majority leader. I hope it is. But the main thing is \nto get us some way that we know how many amendments are out there, I \nsay to my good friend. I spent 8 years as a whip. I know your task is \ndifficult. I think we have a right to ask for disclosure of the \namendments that would be offered to the supplemental and have it done \nby a specific time today.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from West Virginia will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, but I retain my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the two chairmen, I am also a member of that \ncommittee, and I would like to finish the business at hand. Senator \nDaschle has been very clear. He has stated for more than a week now \nthat we must move forward with the Patients' Bill of Rights. We are \ndoing that. He said this morning--and I have been in conference with \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Edwards. I have spoken to Judd Gregg, \nmanager of the Patients' Bill of Rights bill. I indicated to him we \nneed a finite list of amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights. That \nseems simple. We are very interested in doing that, and that should be \nable to be accomplished quickly. Everybody knows the contested issues \non this matter. We need a finite list of amendments.\n\n  When that is done, Senator Daschle said he would be happy to work \nwith the two Senators and work out something that is fair. We can do \nthat as quickly as possible. I think there could be a finite list given \nto us in the next hour. It should not be very hard to do at all.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I want to make sure the distinguished whip \nunderstood my request. My request was not that we take up the bill by \nnoon. My request is only that Senators who have amendments make it \nknown by 12 noon, that we close out after they have made it known as to \nwhat amendments they want to call up, and that we close out the \namendments at that point. The leader would still retain, of course, his \nright to call up the bill whenever he wishes.\n  Having said that, might I make the request again?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as the Senator knows, I have come to him \non many occasions on various bills saying we need to enter into an \nagreement when the amendments can be filed. We want to do this. I am \nsaying that we will do this as quickly as possible. You need not be on \nthe floor. I will try to get the agreement as soon as possible. We have \ntime limited to the supplemental, but there are certain people I\n\n[[Page S6947]]\n\nhave to check with, and we will do that as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My question to the distinguished whip is plain and \nsimple. Is the Senator from Nevada saying that the finite list of \namendments to the Patients' Bill of Rights must be reached before we \ncan get the finite list for the supplemental?\n  Mr. REID. No. If the Senator allow me to respond.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. REID. We need a finite list on the Patients' Bill of Rights so a \ntime can be arranged to do the supplemental.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Respectfully, that is not how I understood my discussion \nwith the majority leader. We discussed doing this bill tonight. There \nwill be a window. This is the night of the Republican dinner. Some of \nus have agreed to stay and debate the amendments on the supplemental so \nthat it might be voted on in a very short window tomorrow and get it to \nthe House tomorrow so they can finish it so we can get it back by \nThursday or Friday. Unless we do that today, I for one am going to give \nup on the supplemental.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from West Virginia would allow me to answer.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. First of all, probably if you are something like me, that \nwould be a good excuse so you would not have to go to the dinner if you \nhad to be here.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Better not said, but you are right.\n  Mr. REID. But there is no reason that we cannot have a finite list of \namendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights within the next hour or so. \nI am sure Senator Daschle would be happy to work with Senator Lott and \narrange a time. Give us a little time on this.\n  I repeat to my friends again, the question on the list of amendments \nshould be filed and we will work on that very quickly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I hope we have reached an understanding. I \nhave been at this work for many years. I have learned a long time ago \nthat when you are within reach and you have both leaders having \nexpressed their desire for a unanimous consent request, and with the \nwork that the Senator from Alaska and I have already done with respect \nto arriving at such a request, that other amendments, other Senators, \nand other requests can come out of the woodwork. I would like to get \nthis nailed down by noon, or earlier, because the longer we wait, the \nmore Senators there will be that will say, ``This is my chance.''\n\n  In closing, I hope we can go forward with this request soon. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 818\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes for debate on the Kyl-Nelson amendment No. 818.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will speak and then yield time to Senator \nNelson of Nebraska, my colleague on this amendment. In discussing this \nproposed amendment with some of the stakeholders involved, a couple \nquestions have been raised. I want to clarify my intention and turn the \ntime over to Senator Nelson.\n  One question asked was, With respect to the external review, is this \na de novo hearing? That is to say, does the external reviewer begin \nwith whatever record is before it, but can bring in other witnesses, or \nconsider other material or other factors or records in addition to that \nwhich may have been considered by the internal reviewer. The answer to \nthat question is yes. I believe that is what the underlying bill \nprovides. Our amendment intends the same. To the extent that would need \nto be clarified, we are willing to do that.\n  Secondly, there is concern that with respect to the negotiated \nrulemaking procedure that is provided for in the amendment, that the \ncomposition of the stakeholders be fair.\n  Obviously, we believe that should be fair. We believe that the \nproviders need to have adequate representation in such rulemaking \nprocedure, that all stakeholders should be represented.\n  I do not know what we can do to make our commitment any more firm, \nbut to the extent anyone has a suggestion about how we ensure that \nfairness, it would certainly be our intention to do so.\n  In summary, we have identified a specific problem with the bill, a \nneed to add a standard that is uniform and to ensure that the two \nextremes do not represent what occurs here. One extreme is that the \nexternal reviewer has no guidance and can just ignore the contract. The \nother extreme is that an HMO can draft a contract that is so strict \nthat the reviewer has no ability to provide medically necessary care \nfor the patient.\n  We are proposing a standard of care that can be utilized by the \nexternal reviewer to ensure that the patient receives the necessary \ncare and that neither ignores the terms of the contract nor is so \npinched that it would not be able to provide the care. That is why we \nhave chosen the terms that apply to over 73 percent of Federal \nemployees under the FEHBP that serves all the Members of Congress, our \nfamilies, as well as other Federal employees. That is the language we \nhave.\n  I ask my colleague, Senator Nelson, to speak to this. Senator Nelson \nhas probably as much experience as anybody in this body with insurance \ncontracts at the State level from his previous positions in Nebraska, \nas well as being Governor of the State of Nebraska.\n  It has been a pleasure for me to work with Senator Nelson who had the \nidea for this and brought a group together and expressed his idea. It \nmade sense to me at the time. The more I work with him, the more sense \nit makes to me, and what he is proposing is desirable for us to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to respect the experience he brings to this \nissue from his perspective from the State of Nebraska which, I might \nadd, is my State of birth. I am very pleased to have worked with \nSenator Nelson on this. Again, I just hope my colleagues respect the \nexperience he brings to this particular issue.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity \nto join with my colleague, Senator Kyl from Arizona, to support and \npursue the opportunity for making certain there is a definition and a \nstandard in the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation that will give \ncertainty and clarity to the standard by which medical claims can be \nsubmitted and the providing of medical care can be made.\n  There is some concern about whether or not the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan definition of ``medical necessity''--which is \nessentially the definition, the standard, if you will, that is being \nproposed in our amendment--is something where the Office of Personnel \nManagement would be bound by the plan's determination.\n  We have never said that the plan, in this case the medical reviewer, \nwould have to be bound by the plan, but they would have to be bound by \nthe definition. That is what this is about. It is making certain there \nis certainty, clarity, and an understanding, a meeting of the minds, \nabout what will be covered and to what extent, always subject to \noutside standards, outside review.\n  I support having a Patients' Bill of Rights that provides the kind of \npatient protections that are included within this bill. I support the \nopportunity for a patient to have a review from the internal side and \nfrom the external side, and I support the opportunity and the right of \nthe patient to sue the HMO to ensure the medical decisionmaker in \nconjunction with any questions that are provided for in the level of \nsupport that is provided within the current bill.\n  It is important as the decisions are made about the claims that there \nis at least certainty and clarity as to a standard. I do not think even \nthe proponents of the legislation would deny it is important to have a \nstandard. As a matter of fact, I understand the history of this bill to \nsome degree, and I know that in the past there was an effort to arrive \nat a standard. There were two groups with two different pieces of \nlegislation, and they could not quite achieve an understanding as to \nwhat the standard should be or the definition. Perhaps out of \nfrustration, and certainly out of not coming together, the decision was \nmade to leave this open.\n  The problem with leaving it open is there is no basis of a standard; \nthere is\n\n[[Page S6948]]\n\nno way to know what the definition of ``medical necessity'' can be. It \ncan be about anything. When you have a contract and when you have two \nparties to it, an insurer and insured, you need some degree of \ncertainty. That is what we are asking for, so you can know of what \nmedical necessity truly consists.\n  As to the question about whether or not this language, which is taken \nright out of OPM's definition that is included in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan--as to whether or not that is adequate language, \nit seems to me there should be no question about it. This is to what \nthe Federal employees are subject. You and I, those who are insured, \nare subject to the language, the standard, and the definition that is \nincluded within this amendment.\n  I find that it would be unusual if somebody objected to this \nstandard, but our plan provides, even if there is a concern about this \nstandard, that under the rulemaking and the negotiations of regulations \nanother standard could be arrived at with the stakeholders to this \nlegislation. The stakeholders, about 19 of them, would all be \nassembled, and if they did not like this particular standard, then they \ncould achieve, upon agreement, another standard.\n\n  This is about having a standard, and there seems to be very little \nconcern about whether or not the current standard that is included \nwithin this amendment is an adequate standard, certainly from the \nstandpoint of Federal employees. In other words, if it is good enough \nfor me, it ought to be good enough for other people. If it is good \nenough for the thousands of Federal employees, then it ought to be good \nenough to be included.\n  What does it provide? It provides that the determination of services, \ndrugs, supplies, be provided by hospital or other covered provider \nappropriate to prevent, diagnose, treat, a condition, illness, or \ninjury, and that they must be consistent with standards of good medical \npractice in the United States. That is a standard we can all live by \nbecause we cannot ask for more than having care that is consistent with \nstandards of good medical practice in the United States.\n  There are some other requirements as well, but they are essentially \nthe same as what I just read.\n  I cannot imagine anyone would want to argue for not having a standard \nor having a contract that is open-ended and not know that would, in \neffect, leave uncertainty, a lack of clarity, and an openness that \nnobody wants to propose or support.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at this as we fight to keep \ndown the high cost of health care, the availability of health care, and \nthat we work toward making this standard the kind of standard that can \nbe included as part of the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Anything that establishes clarity and certainty is desirable in the \ncontext of this legislation, and certainly that is included within this \namendment.\n  There are some who thought the standard might consist of something \nsuch as a cost benefit. This does not involve any kind of cost-benefit \nanalysis regarding medical care. There are some who were concerned \nabout that. I would be concerned about that. This does not do that. \nThere is some concern that somehow the plan might not be bound by the \ndecisionmaking. It is not, but it ought to be bound by the definition.\n  I realize this is a very complex area that the average person is not \ngoing to deal with every day, so I apologize for the complexity, but I \ndo not apologize for having something that will simplify it, that will \ngive us the certainty and the clarity of having a definition and a \nstandard that we can all understand and one with which we can agree and \nagainst which good medical care, under good medical practice in the \nUnited States, might be compared. That is what we are looking for.\n  There is a proposal that I understand will be coming forth for \nconsideration this afternoon that will solve part of this problem, but \nit does not solve the problem of the standard of care and the \ndefinition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I yield time to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I compliment my friend and colleague \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Nelson, for his expertise in this field. He and \nSenator Collins are probably more qualified in this field because they \nboth worked in their respective States in their insurance departments, \nI think, as commissioners of insurance and they also have expertise in \nthe field from years of experience. When Senator Nelson or Senator \nCollins talk about medical necessity, or being bound or exempt from \ncontracts, they have a certain degree of expertise that the rest of us \ndo not have.\n\n  I remember visiting with Senator Nelson and he brought up the medical \nnecessity and the fact this bill before the Senate unfortunately voids \ncontracts. It goes so far as to even say you have to cover things that \nare excluded.\n  Page 35 of the bill says: No coverage for excluded benefits.\n  That sounds fine.\n  But page 36 says: Except to the extent . . .\n  In other words, you don't have to cover items excluded in contracts. \nExcept to the extent somebody considers it medically necessary--and so \non, even if specifically excluded in contracts. Part of the Nelson-Kyl \namendment clears that up.\n  On contract sanctity, I concur 100 percent. I mentioned a few things \nexcluded under the CHAMPUS program for VA, specifically excluded in \ncontracts under this bill someone might have to pay. They might even be \nsued if they do not provide a benefit specifically excluded in their \ncontract. That sounds absurd but in reading the language, that could \nhappen. The Nelson-Kyl amendment fixes this. Things excluded under \nCHAMPUS include: Acupuncture, exercise equipment, eyeglasses, contact \nlenses, hearing aids, hypnosis, massage therapy, physical therapy \nconsisting of exercise programs, sexual dysfunction, smoking cessation, \nweight control or weight reduction programs.\n  The point is, almost every medical health care plan says we will pay \nfor this list of benefits; we will not pay for these benefits. Those \nbenefits would be excluded. This bill says they will be excluded, but \nmaybe they should be paid for anyway and they will be subject to \nreview. And if the reviewer says it is needed, it should be paid.\n  Part of Nelson-Kyl says no, we will strike the language that deals \nwith ``except to the extent,'' allowing contracts to be contracts that \nwould not cover excluded benefits.\n  That is exactly what the Federal Government does. Many people want to \nmodel private health care after the Federal employees health care \nbenefits. We have many different plans. They work. Employees are happy.\n  Federal employees cannot sue their employer, and Federal employees \nhave to be bound by the contract. If you look at the consumer bill of \nrights and responsibilities, in OPM's guidelines dealing with the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program, it says if someone wants to \nappeal, OPM seeks to determine whether the enrollee or family member is \nentitled to the services under the terms of the contract. It is bound \nby the contract.\n  Blue Cross/Blue Shield, 2001, it says OPM will review your disputed \nclaim requests and use the information it collects from you to decide \nwhether our decision is correct. OPM will determine whether we \ncorrectly applied the terms of our contract when we denied your claim \nor request for service. OPM will send a final decision within 60 days. \nThere are no other administrative appeals.\n  Interesting to note, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, they \nappeal to OPM, appeal through their employer. This is not an \nindependent review entity. Again, OPM will make their determination \nbased on the contract.\n\n  The Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Arizona say a contract \nshould be a contract. We should adhere to the contract and have \ncontract sanctity. We should have some definition, some certainty in \nthe definition, and we even use the definition for Federal employees' \nfee-for-service plans as one option, as well as the rulemaking process \nthat the Senator from Nebraska spoke about.\n  I think there are too many people voting ``remote control,'' \nthinking, I will vote with Senator Kennedy or\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\nwith Senator McCain on this issue. I hope they look at this amendment. \nShould you have contract sanctity? Should you look at the guidelines we \nuse in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan to have some contract \nsanctity? It is obliterated by the underlying bill. I think so.\n  This is an excellent amendment, an important amendment. If you want a \nbill that preserves some sanctity of contract, I think it is most \nimportant we pass this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof the Nelson-Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield 4 minutes?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I yield.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for the \ncare and concern that has gone into this amendment. I support it along \nwith him. I know how important it is for businesses to be able to nail \ndown the prices so they can provide this voluntary insurance to people. \nIf they don't know how much it will cost, if it is going to rise \nastronomically, I guarantee the small businesses will bail out. That is \nwhat the discussion has been about this week and last week--how to \ncontinue to have insurance for people.\n  I am an accountant, the only accountant in the Senate. I like dealing \nwith numbers. The people who really deal with numbers are the \nactuaries. They are the ones who have to figure out what the odds are \nthat something is going to happen to people. The smaller the plan, the \ntougher it is to figure the odds. But those odds have to be calculated \nin order to figure out the price. If the actuary said figure the whole \nuniverse of things that could happen, normally we exclude the ones that \nare difficult to calculate, but you don't get to exclude those anymore. \nYou have to figure it as though those could happen to the person, and \nsome reviewer will charge your plan with that. So we cannot tell you \nwhat you are going to have to pay. We guarantee it will have to be a \nhigher number because of the uncertainty.\n  It is extremely important we avoid the Russia syndrome or the China \nsyndrome, where they don't have contracts worth anything. In this \ncountry we maintain the sanctity of contracts. It is time to do that \nagain. It is time to do that, particularly to protect the people \nworking for small businesses in this country so they will continue to \nhave insurance.\n  This amendment is particularly important because it does several \nthings. First, it allows both the employer and the employee to be \ncertain about what benefits are covered under the health plan. If they \ncan't know that, then what's the point of the contract. Second, the \namendment will virtually guarantee that all health plan contracts will \nnow have a great definition of medical necessity, which is the clause \nin a contract that's used to make many decisions on claims for \nbenefits. If a health plan or employer chooses not to adopt a strong \ndefinition, as defined in this amendment, then they forgo their right \nto rely on that definition in making decisions on claims for benefits. \nThat's achieved by allowing the independent reviewer in the external \nappeals process to ignore that definition if it's not among those \nlisted in the amendment.\n  This amendment brings to bear two important consequence that go a \nlong way helping this bill become law. Again, the contract, upon which \nnot just the breadth of benefits is determined, but also the cost of \nhealth coverage to both the employer and employee is based, is made \nwhole. And, the quality of health care in this country is set at a \nstandard that will assure patients receive medically necessary care as \ndetermined by the standards in the best programs, namely the Federal \nOffice of Personnel Management's definition for fee-for-service plans.\n  Mr. President, I again commend my colleagues for their work. Enacting \nthis amendment is as important to preserving the employer sponsored \nhealth care system as anything else we may do on this bill. There's \nsimply no reason why Members would vote to undo a health plan contract \nor against requiring that health plans adopt a strong definition of \nmedical necessity.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. We reserve our time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I agree with our friends and colleagues, the Senator from Oklahoma, \nabout the competency of my good friend, Senator Nelson, as well as the \nSenator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi. I learned, as I worked with Senator \nEnzi on a number of different issues, including OSHA, about his \nenormous capabilities as an accountant in dealing with numbers. I have \nalso had the good opportunity to work with Senator Nelson on this \nissue. I think there are few Members of this body outside the committee \nor inside the committee that have taken more time than the Senator to \nunderstand the details of this legislation. He has a commanding \nknowledge of this legislation and a very healthy understanding and \nrespect about what is happening in the State and local communities. He \nhas been enormously attentive to detail and concept.\n\n  We do not always agree on every provision, but I have certainly \ndeveloped a deeper understanding of the impact of this legislation from \nmy conversations with him.\n  Even though we differ on the substance on this particular issue, \nwhich I think is an important issue, I have enormous respect for what \nhe has brought to this whole debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I \nvalue, very much, his continued involvement in this debate.\n  I will mention briefly what we have in the legislation and why I \nbelieve it is wise to retain the approach we have currently. It has the \ncomplete support of the American Medical Association, the cancer \norganizations--I will refer to those later--and the overwhelming \nsupport of the medical community. It has evolved over a period of time. \nI will reference that in just a moment or two as well.\n  But it does, I think, meet the standard that has been mentioned here \nabout certainty, clarity, and predictability. That is what the \nproponents of this amendment have asked for. We have just done that on \npage 35, in establishing the particular details of our standard. I will \ngive brief reasons that we ought to retain this.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill allows the doctors, not the HMO \naccountants, to make the important medical decisions and it prohibits \nthe HMOs from using arbitrary definitions of medical necessity. \nUnfortunately, the proposed amendment would undermine this crucial \nprotection and allow plans to use definitions of care that may harm the \npatients.\n  Our legislation asks every Senator the basic question: Do you support \nthe doctors making the critical medical decisions or do you want the \nHMOs to continue to deny care based on language that puts dollars \nbefore lives?\n  The independent medical reviewer should consider the definition \ndecided by the health plan. However, we should not bind their hands by \narbitrary definitions by an HMO. Senators McCain, Bayh, and Carper will \noffer an amendment later today that reflects the bipartisan belief that \nreviewers cannot approve services that are not explicitly covered under \nany circumstances. If a plan covers 30 days of hospital care, a plan \ncannot say they should cover 100 days. This amendment underscores the \npremise in our bill that a reviewer should not be bound by an unfair \nHMO definition of medical necessity. In circumstances where explicit \ncoverage decisions are subject to interpretation, the reviewer should \nhave the opportunity to weigh all the relevant medical facts.\n  I gave the example last evening. If the plan says ``no cosmetic \nsurgery'' and there is a cleft palate on a child, I could see an \nindependent reviewer saying as a matter of medical necessity it is \nimperative that we correct the cleft palate and would be justified in \ndoing so. If, in the plan, it said ``no cosmetic surgery and no cleft \npalate,'' the medical reviewer would be prohibited from doing so. So \nthere is that degree of interpretation in terms of medical necessity, \nthat aspect of judgment that we want to give to the doctors in dealing \nwith this issue.\n  The Kyl amendment, once again, I believe gives the HMOs the \nopportunity to deny critical care by allowing them to use definitions \nof medical care that are stacked against the patients. This amendment \nalso prevents independent\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\nreviewers from weighing all the relevant factors needed to make a fair \ndecision. In addition, the amendment proposes to institute a complex \nrulemaking process to define medical necessity. However, administrative \nrulemaking is only as fair as the participants. If the participants are \nhostile to patients' rights and sympathetic to HMOs, they could \nundermine care for millions.\n\n  As Charlie Norwood said, if reviewers are forced to wait on \nregulation at the speed HCFA moves, leeches might still be considered \nmedically necessary and appropriate.\n  Also, under this amendment the plan gets to choose any of the \nnumerous definitions for medical necessity. It can seek out the worst \nof the worst, but consumers get no comparable rights to demand the best \nof the best. All you have to do is look at the range of definitions and \nit is easy to see why the disability community, the cancer community, \nthe American Medical Association, and other groups are so vehemently \nopposed to this amendment. It fails to protect the patient and allows \nthe health plans to continue to deny medically necessary care. That is \nwhy the overwhelming number of medical groups support our language.\n  Some of the standards that they could pick from say cost-\neffectiveness should help determine whether care should be provided. It \nmight be cost-effective, for example, for an HMO to amputate a young \nman's injured hand, but what about the cost of having to spend the rest \nof your life without the full use of limbs? It might be effective for \nan HMO to pay for older, less effective medication for depression, but \nwhat about the cost to a mother trying to raise her family while \ndealing with the harmful side effects that could have been prevented by \nnewer medication? Why should we subject the American people to them?\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. Passing it would \nreverse the strong bipartisan efforts we have worked out in this \nlegislation.\n  Let me mention here the letter from the National Breast Cancer \nCoalition:\n       On behalf of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and the \n     2.6 million women living with breast cancer, I am writing to \n     urge you to oppose the Kyl amendment and to support the \n     McCain-Bayh-Carper amendment on medical necessity. The \n     National Breast Cancer Coalition is a grassroots advocacy \n     organization made up of more than 600 organizations and \n     10,000 individual members all across the country who are \n     dedicated to the eradication of breast cancer through \n     advocacy and action. With regard to the enactment of a \n     strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights, the NBCC \n     believes the determination about what is medically necessary \n     must remain in the hands of physicians, not HMOs. The \n     coalition is concerned the Kyl amendment would weaken the \n     provisions in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of \n     Rights and would allow financial decisions to override the \n     medical judgments on patient care.\n\n  Let me just mention some of the definitions which have been used. \nHere is a definition that is used in terms of medical necessity. As I \nmentioned, the history of this is that we did have a definition in the \nprevious legislation that was passed. What we used for medical \nnecessity at that time was this:\n\n       Medically necessary or appropriate means a service or \n     benefit which is a generally accepted principle of medical \n     practice.\n\n  That is what virtually every Democrat voted for. That gives the \nmaximum flexibility to the doctor.\n  When we got to the conference and began to work this out, the HMO \nindustry said this definition was so broad and wide, in terms of \ninterpretation, that it could mean anything. Therefore, it would \ncompletely override the contract terms of the HMOs.\n  Then we altered it and said: In the internal review they will use the \ndefinition of the HMO, but in the external we will use a different \ndefinition. That is what is in the legislation. That is basically what \nis in the Breaux-Frist, as well as in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy.\n  Basically, it says ``a condition shall be based on the medical \ncondition of the participant''--therefore you look at the medical \ncondition of the principal--``and valid, relevant scientific evidence \nand clinical evidence including peer review, medical literature or \nfindings, and including expert opinion.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The expert opinion is critical. The essential element of \nthat--which I know has been questioned--was talked about and \nessentially agreed to in the conference last year.\n  This is the concern we have. Here are some of the definitions which \nhave been used in various HMOs, and even in Federal health insurance. \nThe difference, in Federal health insurance is if there is an appeal of \nit, they leave it completely open. I asked staff to get the standard \nthat is used. It is completely left to the doctor. That is where we \nwant it, to the greatest extent possible. We have limited it as I have \ndefined it. But these are some of the concerns.\n  This is in SIGNA, in terms of medically necessary:\n\n       . . . that are determined by our medical director to be no \n     more required than to meet your basic health needs.\n\n  So this definition is going to be what the plan's medical director \ndecides. Clearly, they are going to be biased in the HMO.\n  This is the Hawaii State plan: Cost effective for the medical \ncondition being treated compared to alternative health intervention, \nincluding no intervention.\n\n  Cost effectiveness is unacceptable. It is more cost effective for the \nHMO to put someone in a wheelchair rather than for them to have hip \nsurgery. But it is more effective to the individual to have the hip \nsurgery.\n  Here is another one:\n  A treatment that could reasonably be expected to improve the member's \nconditions or level of functioning.\n  Even though it is used by the Health Alliance HMO in the Federal \nhealth insurance, the problem is that for people with disabilities, the \ntreatment may not be for a condition that can improve, but it certainly \nmay improve the quality of life.\n  Here are the Pacific Care Health plans furnished in the most \neconomically efficient manner.\n  ``Economically efficient'' is a problem.\n  Again, it is what procedures are the most cost effective.\n  We have to be very sure about what we are going to have. We have a \ngood definition in this proposal. It is supported by McCain-Edwards and \nmyself and is also essentially the provision in Breaux-Frist.\n  It has the overwhelming support of the American Medical Association, \nas well as the Cancer Association, and is spelled out in this \nlegislation. So there is certainty.\n  If there is a change on this, we can come back and revisit it. I give \nthe assurances to my friends that we can. But the idea that we are \ngoing to give the authority to a panel that will be set up by the \nSecretary--the makeup of which we don't know--which can propose \nsomething, still indicates that we don't know what is going to come \nout. That doesn't seem to me to be the way we ought to go in giving \npredictability and certainty to patients. If we are interested in that, \nwe ought to get criteria that is sound, responsible, and gives medical \nprofessionals the ultimate ability to make judgments to protect the \npatient.\n  That is what we do in this legislation. That is why I don't believe \nwe should alter or change the proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I am very sorry to have to say this, but the amendment that Senator \nKennedy has just proposed is not our amendment. I want to be very clear \nabout what our amendment does. The amendment that Senator Kennedy has \nbeen talking about was part of last year's bill.\n  When Senator Nelson came forward this year, he said: Let's try to \ncome up with something new. We did that. So the language we have before \nus today is not the language to which Senator Kennedy has been \nreferring.\n  When he talks about the Signet language and the other plan language, \nthat would be absolutely prohibited by what we are talking about here. \nThat was last year. We would absolutely prohibit that. When he talks \nabout the\n\n[[Page S6951]]\n\nplans choosing from among a range of definitions that could include \ncost effective, that would be absolutely prohibited under our language. \nThat was last year.\n  Let me again restate what we did this year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. KYL. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What I read here is ``what is determined by our medical \ndirector to be no more required than to meet your basic needs.'' That \nis in the Federal health insurance program. That would be included. The \nlanguage I have read is ``the treatment that can reasonably be expected \nto improve the member's condition or level of functioning.'' The \nFederal employees' plans are included.\n  The last one, ``furnish in the most economically efficient manner,'' \nthat is Federal employees. That is included. All three are included \nbecause the Federal employees' insurance has been included as well.\n  What is not included is discretion that is given to the medical \ndoctor. The review of that is provided in the Federal employees' plans, \nand OPM is using it. It is not included in the underlying.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator will allow me to answer, that is a factual \nmatter. I will not argue with his answer. I think I can explain the \nreason for the confusion. But the answer to the Senator's question is \nno. What the Senator said is not correct. That was correct a year ago \nbecause a year ago the language of the amendment was that you took the \nFEHBP standard. And the Senator would have been correct a year ago \nbecause it was both the fee-for-service standard as well as the managed \ncare contract standard.\n  So the criticism that the Senator levels would have been correct \ncriticism a year ago. And to some extent, I agree with the Senator from \nMassachusetts about that criticism. We threw that aside. Instead, we \nasked: What is the contract that governs the fee-for-service FEHBP \nplans? The contract that governs, we think, 73 percent of the people--\nin other words, about 6 million people--is the language that they have \napproved for the Blue Cross/Blue Shield fee-for-service contract, as \nwell as some others. We didn't want to allow any discretion whatsoever. \nSo we took the five specific provisions of that contract. Those are \nembodied in the legislation. There is no discretion.\n  If you want a safe harbor now under this amendment, you would have to \nwrite your contract with those five items, and only those five items. \nThat is what the reviewer then would be able to review.\n\n  If I could just continue on with respect to the negotiated \nrulemaking, it was our idea that if anyone didn't like those five \nitems, and all of the stakeholders would want to get together and \nnegotiate something different, we would be very amenable to that. So we \nset up this voluntary rulemaking procedure.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts and others think there is something \nwrong with that and they would not want to create that option in the \nbill, we are very amenable to dropping that out. We thought we were \ndoing people a favor by putting that option in so that if somebody \ndidn't like these five items, they could engage in this negotiated \nrulemaking. But anybody in the negotiations could veto it so that it \nwouldn't go into effect.\n  But if people somehow fear that, it is not our intention to try to \nsuperimpose some nonspecific standard.\n  If the Senator would like to engage further on that, we can certainly \ndiscuss that. I indicated to the Senator last night our willingness to \ndiscuss that. I hope I have cleared it up. I understand the reason for \nthe confusion because that was last year's amendment.\n  Our amendment language was only available a couple of days ago. So it \nis understandable that one might not have been able to read our \namendment language. But I assure the Senator that our language is very \nspecific and very different from that which he criticized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I understand the passion of \nmy colleague from Massachusetts. He has done such great work in this \narea, and I truly appreciate and respect what he has done and the fact \nthat he has taken a very careful look at what we are proposing.\n  I suspect, though, that he would maybe look at me as a person who \ncame to the party late and wants to rewrite the invitation. You can't \ntry to change something where there has been such a history without \nencountering some resistance to it. I understand there is resistance to \nwanting to change this because it was dealt with last year. But you \ndon't weaken this bill by making it more certain.\n  I don't believe there is a problem. But if there is a problem within \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan because there is not a good \nstandard there, we can correct that by passing this amendment and this \nPatients' Bill of Rights, and make Federal employees subject to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts mentioned that there is perhaps a \ndifferent manner of review for Federal employees where they have to go \ndirectly to the Office of Personnel Management rather than getting an \ninternal or external review. We can correct that. We can make that plan \nsubject to the Patients' Bill of Rights, and we can correct that. Or we \nought to take a look at that independently.\n  But this does not change anything that would be detrimental to those \nindividuals my colleague from Massachusetts mentioned.\n  For example, of the list of people, such as a person with a cleft \npalate, the only question about a person with a cleft palate is whether \nthat treatment, in the judgment of the medical professional, the \ndoctor, would be consistent with the standards of good medical practice \nin the United States. That is the dynamic, and I am sure that it would. \nThere is nothing static about this definition. It will continue to \nchange as the good standards of medical practice in the United States \nchange.\n  My good friend also mentioned something about making sure that we \nhave our loved ones well protected. I agree with him and include the \nFederal employees as part of our loved ones. I think we want these \nstandards to apply to all Americans. The way in which you can do that \nis by adopting this amendment on medical necessity.\n  What it does not do is, it does not change the doctor's \ndecisionmaking in relation to what kind of care to provide. What it \ndoes say is that it has to be consistent with the standards of good \nmedical practice in the United States.\n  I, for the life of me, do not see what the resistance to this \nlanguage is, other than the fact that we tried to do it a year ago. We \nhad the Stanford definition. We talked about other definitions a year \nago. Now we have come up with a definition which I think is an \nexcellent definition that will do it, that will establish the standard \nfor certainty, for predictability. And now we are saying it may weaken \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. But certainty will strengthen this. There \nis no effort here to do anything that would not be consistent with--as \na matter of fact, the language requires that the medical profession do \nsomething consistent with the standards of good medical practice. \nWhether it is an amputation, whether it is a cleft palate, whether it \nis deciding on cancer care, or whether it is deciding on other kinds of \ncare, all we are saying is it ought to be subject to these standards. \nThat is the only point that is being made.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Nebraska has \nabout 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The opposition has 13 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator allow me a couple minutes of time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. Absolutely. The Senator from North Dakota was \nlooking forward to talking, but whatever.\n  Do you want me to yield 3 minutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, and also the \nSenator from North Dakota. I would be glad to wait until after the \nSenator from North Dakota speaks, if he prefers.\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have major concerns about the Kyl-Nelson \namendment and unfortunately, must oppose it. While I certainly respect \nthe intentions of my dear friend and follow Arizonian, Jon Kyl, I \nrespectfully disagree with him regarding this proposal.\n  I simply can't support mandating a Federal statutory definition of \n``medical necessity'' that is vague and creates further confusion and \nbarriers for patients attempting to get the medical care their doctor \ndeems appropriate, and is covered by their HMO plan.\n  This amendment would put into statutory language a vague definition \nthat allows health plans to determine whether services, drugs, \nsupplies, or equipment are appropriate or necessary to prevent, \ndiagnose, or treat a patient's condition, illness, or injury.\n  While this appears reasonable, it simply is not.\n  One of the major hurdles currently facing patients is the repeated \ndenial of their medical care on the basis that it is not medically \nnecessary based on a vague or constraining definition. The health plans \nare intentionally denying care to constrain costs by hiding behind \ncleverly crafted definitions.\n  This amendment would allow this practice to continue.\n  For example, part of the definition allows a plan to determine \nwhether the recommended medical care is, ``primarily for the personal \ncomfort or convenience of the patient, the family or the provider . . \n.''\n  It sounds reasonable, but it is not. This is already being used to \nprevent patients from receiving palliative care for managing the \nintensive pain they encounter while battling cancer or other serious \nillnesses.\n  Another portion of the proposed definitions reads, ``Consistent with \nstandards of good medical practice in the United States'' . . .\n  Again, appears harmless, but it isn't. Who establishes the standards \nof good medical practice? What basis is used for developing them? How \ncurrent, considering the pace of new technology and medical research \nwill these standards be?\n  Another portion of the proposed Kyl-Nelson Federal definition reads, \n``In the case of inpatient care, [the care] cannot be provided safely \non an outpatient basis . . .''\n  Legally, this creates an opportunity for retrospective reviews by \nHMOs thereby leaving the patient and/or medical provider responsible \nwith the incurred costs from the inpatient care that the HMO determines \nshould have been provided on an outpatient basis.\n  These are just a few of the problems facing patients if this \namendment is adopted.\n  I wholeheartedly agree with my colleagues that we can't create a \nmethod that obviates health plan contracts and that is not what our \nbill does.\n  Our bill does not empower the independent medical reviewer to \noverride existing health plan contracts or force HMOs to cover anything \nand everything despite a service being specifically excluded in the \ncontract.\n  Our bill relies on the independent medical reviewer to give patients \na second medical opinion when such a medical opinion is necessary to \ninterpret the plan's coverage, but it does not empower them to \ndisregard the plan's specific coverage exclusions and limitations.\n  I will be offering an amendment after the scheduled vote on the Kyl-\nNelson amendment that will further clarify this and protect the \nsanctity of the plan's contract with a patient.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Kyl-Nelson amendment and allow \npatients to have their medical decisions made by doctors and nurses and \nnot by HMO lawyers or bureaucrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how many minutes do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 10\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 8\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a well-intentioned amendment, but \nit must be defeated because it is aimed right at the heart of this \npatients' rights bill, right at the core of the bill. The question is, \nWho is going to make the decisions? Who will make decisions about \nmedical care? An MBA or an MD? Who do we want to make the decisions \nabout medical care?\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill allows doctors and patients to make \nfundamental decisions about their care. It will be based on medical \nnecessity and appropriateness and supported by valid, relevant \nscientific and clinical evidence. In other words, if an HMO makes an \narbitrary decision about some kind of a treatment they believe is not \nmedically necessary, based on its own inadequate definition of \n``medical necessity,'' the reviewers would be able to overturn that and \nadvocate treatment.\n  Under this amendment put before the Senate, the patient would be \nbound to the HMO's decision and have literally no options; the \nindependent reviewer would have no authority whatsoever to recommend \ntreatment if it was needed.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts read a list, and he was challenged on \nthat list. But the fact is, the list he read is absolutely correct.\n  Let met do this in English, if I can. The amendment, as I understand \nit, allows an HMO or managed care organization several different \napproaches to deal with the issue of what is medically necessary. How \ndo you define medically necessary? Several different ways. One is a \nmechanism described by the Senator from Massachusetts. He read some of \nthose definitions. He was accurate about that. But there are two other \nmechanisms by which an HMO could describe what is medically necessary.\n  Do any of us think the HMO will pick the more stringent approach? Of \ncourse not. They will pick the least effective approach, the approach \nthat poses the least cost to them. They will pick the weakest of the \noptions. That is what the Senator from Massachusetts was saying.\n  Give the HMO the opportunity, and they will pick the least possible \noption, the least costly option for themselves. That is why we are in \nthis Chamber with this patients' protection bill. This amendment \nstrikes a blow right at the heart of the patients' rights legislation. \nThe reason we are in this Senate Chamber is to work on providing \npatients' rights, not take them away.\n  Let me do this in a bit more dramatic way.\n  One of our colleagues has used this photo from time to time. This \nphoto shows a young baby with a cleft lip and cleft palate, which is a \nvery severe problem. We are told that about 50 percent of the time \nfixing this would be described as ``not medically necessary'' by an \nHMO. Can you imagine a health care plan saying: ``No, fixing this \ndisfiguring defect is not a medical necessity, therefore, we will not \ncover it''.\n  Let me describe what this child will look like with that problem \nfixed. This photo is of a child with reconstructive surgery. This other \nphoto is of a child with the severe problem before it is repaired. \nFifty percent of the time managed care organizations have told those \nrequesting reconstructive surgery for a cleft lip or palate: ``No, you \nare wrong. This is not medically necessary. And we will not cover it''.\n\n  Is that how we want our health care system to operate? It will be \nallowed if this amendment is adopted.\n  Let me describe another case. I am going to describe how this case \nrelates to this amendment.\n  This is a photo of Ethan Bedrick. We have spoken about Ethan before. \nEthan was born on January 28, 1992. He had a partial asphyxiation \nduring birth, a very significant problem in delivery. He has suffered \nfrom severe cerebral palsy and spastic quadriplegia, which impairs \nmotor functions in all his limbs. At the age of 14 months, his managed \ncare organization abruptly cut off coverage for all of his speech \ntherapy, and limited his physical therapy to 15 sessions in a year. A \ndoctor from his managed care organization performed a ``utilization \nreview.'' He said that there was only a 50-percent chance of Ethan \nbeing able to walk by age 5, which is ``insignificant'' and, therefore, \nthey would restrict coverage.\n  So let me say that again. A 50-percent chance of being able to walk \nby age 5 was ``insignificant'' and, therefore, they would not cover the \ntherapy.\n  His parents went to court 3 years later. A judge said:\n\n       The implication that walking by age 5 . . . would not be \n     ``significant progress'' for this . . . child is simply \n     revolting.\n\n\n[[Page S6953]]\n\n\n  But in the meantime, it took 3 years, and this child did not have the \ntherapy he needed for 3 long years.\n  My point about this is, young Ethan Bedrick, or a young child with a \ncleft lip and a cleft palate, running into a plan that has a provider \nservice saying: ``These are not medically necessary procedures, and we \nwill not cover them,'' will have no ability to have an independent \nreviewer overturn that under the amendment that is offered today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For the benefit of the membership, we had scheduled a \nvote at 12:30. With the agreement of the leadership, that vote will be \npostponed until 2. At 1 o'clock, Senator Gregg will be here to offer an \namendment for himself. At 2, it is the anticipation of the leadership \nthat there will be two rollcall votes. We have not made the unanimous \nconsent request yet, but that is the intention of the agreement of the \ntwo leaders. After the time expires, we will make that unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. From 12:30 until 1 o'clock there will be general debate on \nthe bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note the presence of the Senator from New Hampshire on \nthe floor. We really have an issue of scope, an amendment we need to \nbring up, and of course the so-called Snowe compromise amendment as \nwell. I hope we will be able to put both of those in some kind of order \nin some way today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is absolutely \nright. Progress has been made but not nearly enough. Since Senator \nGregg is here, I wonder if we could restate the unanimous consent \nrequest and have that entered at this time. The only suggestion I would \nmake to Senator Kennedy is that we should have general debate from \n12:30 to 1 on the legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is there a unanimous consent request pending?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, the time will expire in how many \nminutes for the debate on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 3 minutes \nto go, and the other side has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, there has been agreement to vote on \nthat amendment when the time is used or yielded back; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on that amendment \nbe put off until 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is the anticipation of the leadership that between \n12:30 and approximately 1 o'clock there will then be general debate on \nthe legislation. At 1 o'clock an amendment will be laid down by the \nSenator from New Hampshire or his designee. It is anticipated there \nwill be a second vote at 2 which will be on that amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I can't guarantee that there would be a \nsecond vote at 2 on that amendment, unless the parties to that \namendment are agreeable to that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then I withdraw my request. I was asked to make that \nrequest; if there was going to be no objection, that was going to \nproceed. Otherwise, we will go ahead.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I had asked if the Senator would yield. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has about 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me continue by saying, I understand that those who \nhave framed this amendment will not agree with my assertion. But I also \nunderstand that they are trying to craft something that defines what is \nmedically necessary in a manner that would give a managed care \norganization three different options to restrict care.\n  In my judgment, the managed care organization will clearly select the \noption that has the least amount of coverage or the least cost to them. \nThat is precisely why we are here in the first instance. We are trying \nto see if we can create a Patients' Bill of Rights that allows a doctor \nand health care professionals to make judgments about what kind of \ntreatment is appropriate. We have story after story after story about \nhealth care professionals making a decision about what kind of health \ncare is necessary for a patient only to be told later that someone \n1,000 miles away an insurance office decided, no, this was not \nmedically necessary at all, and we won't cover it. We don't agree the \nphysician's decision or recommendation for treatment.\n  The reason the AMA and nurses and others support this legislation of \nours is they believe very strongly that health care professionals ought \nto be the ones practicing medicine. The American Medical Association is \nvery strongly opposed to this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a letter the AMA has sent objecting \nto this amendment in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         [From the American Medical Association, June 26, 2001]\n\nAMA Opposes Kyl-Nelson Amendment That Lets MBAs--Not MDs--Make Medical \n                               Decisions\n\n\n        After 7 years, the debate has suddenly come full circle\n\n       Washington.--Today the American Medical Association (AMA) \n     called on Congress to defeat a Kyl-Nelson amendment that \n     would negate a core provision of the patients' bill of \n     rights. This new medical necessity amendment would allow \n     insurance company bean counters to make medical decisions.\n       ``Today, after seven years of debate, it seems some \n     lawmakers want to start over at the beginning, with the core \n     question: Who should make your medical decisions--MDs or \n     MBAs?'' said Dr. Thomas R. Reardon, MD, AMA past president. \n     ``For patients and physicians there's no debate: Decisions \n     about the health care a patient needs must be left to those \n     who are focused on patients--not on the bottom line.''\n       ``The Kyl-Nelson amendment uses a medical necessity \n     definition that allows health plans to determine whether \n     services, drugs, supplies or equipment are appropriate to \n     prevent, diagnose or treat a patient's condition, illness or \n     injury.'' Dr. Reardon said. ``This is a big step backward.''\n       Insurers and business have repeatedly opposed defining \n     medical necessity in legislation: ``A federal standard of \n     medical necessity will raise premiums, threaten quality, and \n     jeopardize efforts to prevent abuse.'' (Blue Cross/Blue \n     Shield, 2/99); ``We fear a congressionally mandated \n     definition of medical necessity, and therefore do not support \n     it.'' (Ford Motor Company 2/99).\n       ``It's clear that health plans put profits before patients \n     when they define medical necessity as the `shortest, least \n     expensive or least intense level of treatment,' Dr. Reardon \n     said. ``People get health insurance so that they're not \n     limited to the cheapest care--no matter what the outcome.''\n       ``The McCain bill allows physicians to make medical \n     decisions and allows an independent panel of reviewers to \n     determine disputes. AMA calls on the Senate to reject the \n     Kyl-Nelson amendment that guts the patients' bill of \n     rights,'' Dr. Reardon said.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. They are opposed precisely because they understand this \namendment absolutely unravels the central and vital section of this \nbill dealing with medical necessity. Our patients' rights legislation \nprovides a structure by which doctors make decisions and then you have \nthe opportunity for independent review if needed. But in the \ncircumstance as proposed in the amendment up for debate, if we create \ndefinitions that allow diminishment of the level of care in terms of \nwhat is medically necessary, the independent reviewer will have their \nhands tied and patients will not get the care they deserve or need.\n  This is a very carefully drafted bill. I am not in any way ascribing \nmal-intent to anyone who offers this amendment. This amendment will \nunravel the bill in a very significant way. We must defeat this \namendment. We should defeat this amendment and preserve the patients' \nprotections legislation that we have brought to the floor of the \nSenate. This has been going on 5 years. This is good legislation. We \nought to pass it and defeat the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the manager of the bill \nhas expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think the Senator has 2 minutes. I have \n2 minutes; is that correct?\n\n[[Page S6954]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the amendment has 4 minutes \nremaining. All time has expired in opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that cannot be the case. The Senator from \nMassachusetts allotted 8 minutes to me. At that point, he had 10\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. It cannot be the case that we have exhausted our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the colloquy back and forth \nbetween the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senators from New \nHampshire and Nevada was charged to the manager.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from North Dakota \nhave another 10 minutes, if he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield my time to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take the 2 minutes which I \notherwise might have had if we hadn't entered into the request.\n  Here we go again with greater hope in our hearts that we will be \nsuccessful.\n  After the yielding back of the time, we intended to vote on the \nNelson amendment. At the request of the leadership, I ask unanimous \nconsent that that vote be put off until 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I have been informed that \nthere will be a motion to table made on the amendment. That will be \ndone at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. At 2 o'clock. It is anticipated that at 1 o'clock there \nwill be an amendment from the Senator from New Hampshire or his \ndesignee. I am informed that it will probably be the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Thompson; and that we will begin the debate on that at 1 \no'clock and that the time between 12:30 and 1 will be used for general \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend for the \ninterruptions because the Senator has been patient during his \npresentation and is typically kind and generous to permit the workings \nhere.\n  I believe we have a good, solid definition in terms of medical \nnecessity that has been reviewed, evaluated and has gotten broad \nsupport. It has bipartisan support. It also has the very, very strong \nsupport of the medical community: The American Medical Association, all \nof the cancer organizations, as well as the disability community. They \nall have great interest in what that definition is.\n  In too many instances in the past there have been definitions that \nhave been offered and accepted that work to the disadvantage of \npatients. For example, definitions have been made that do not include \npalliative care for patients who have cancer or don't recognize the \nvery special needs of the disabled.\n  We have a definition here. It is defined in the legislation. It has \nbeen reviewed. It is careful. It is predictable. It is certain. It does \nprovide for doctors to exercise their best medical judgment. It is \ncompletely consistent with the purposes of the legislation.\n  As I mentioned, I have great respect for my friend and colleague. I \nthink on this we should stay with the language which should be included \nand which has the broad support, virtually the unanimous support of the \nmedical community.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity \nto engage in a dialog with my colleague from Massachusetts. As I \nindicated earlier, I respect his work and many years of effort in this \nfield. I certainly respect his judgment. If I would disagree with him, \nit would be that somehow there is a standard that is currently in \nplace. As a matter of fact, last year they tried on numerous occasions \nto achieve a standard. They could not come up with one where they \nagreed. So they agreed to disagree and left the standard out.\n  We have an opportunity now to come up with a standard that is good \nenough for Federal employees and put that in this bill. If it is good \nenough for Federal employees, then of course I think it ought to be \ngood enough for the rest of America.\n  As to the charts that were shown, I ask, is there anybody in this \nChamber today who believes that under the definition of consistent with \nstandards of good medical practice in the United States, any doctor \nwould not have ordered that the cleft palate be treated?\n  I understand the importance of having charts. I understand the \nimportance of having faces put on the patients. But I think it is \nimportant that, as we do that, it be very clear that we understand that \nthese cases would be treated appropriately under the standards of good \nmedical practice in the United States. So I think we really have an \nopportunity today to provide more clarity, so that doctors who will \nhave the opportunity to make medical decisions and order care will be \nable to do so consistent with standards.\n  There is no way that this amendment today is designed to take away \nany of the authority of the doctor at all, or any other health care \nprovider. All that it is aimed at providing is a standard. If they had \ncome up with a standard last year and it were included in the bill, I \nwould not be raising the question this year. This issue today is about \nwhether to have the standard or not. I can't imagine we are even \ndebating it. We ought to be debating what the standard is. That isn't \nthe debate we have today.\n  As a matter of fact, some of the objections raised earlier about this \namendment could be equally said of an amendment that I suspect the \nPresiding Officer will be supporting today a little later, and that is \nto make sure you don't have those exclusions from a policy, those \nexclusions from a contract, ignored by a medical examiner in the whole \nprocess of the review.\n  The important point here is that this will provide an opportunity, \nupon an internal or external review, for a medical reviewer to make \ngood decisions consistent with good medical practice, consistent with \nthe needs of the patient, so that the conditions in those pictures that \nwere shown here--very vivid descriptions--can and will be taken care of \nand will not be left open without a definition, without a standard. The \nboundaries would be set, but they would be far broad enough to cover \nthat and any other condition that was discussed here as an example this \nafternoon.\n  It seems to me it is important that we establish a standard, and if I \nwanted to oppose what I am proposing today, I would come in and I would \nsay that it was going to do something bad, that it was not going to \npermit something good. But that doesn't make it so. It is important to \npoint out the language and deal with the reality of the words of this \namendment, rather than setting up a straw man to attack and say that it \nis doing something or it won't do something that it is in fact doing.\n  Mr. President, how much more time is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has about 8 seconds.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment \nand move forward with the important work of the Patients' Bill of \nRights. We can do that. This will improve it and will not detract from \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my good \nfriend, the Senator from Nebraska, and I rise reluctantly, but firmly, \nto oppose the amendment he is sponsoring, along with Senators Kyl and \nNickles, because I am concerned not only about the general issues that \nhave been raised by other opponents, I am concerned also by the \nAmerican Medical Association's very strong and vigorous opposition to \nthis amendment, which they have made very clear to me and my office, as \nwell as, I believe, every other Senator, because of their deep concern \nthat this would be a step backward, permitting health plans to \ndetermine the services, drugs, supplies, or equipment necessary to \nprevent, diagnose, or treat a patient's condition, illness, or injury.\n  But I have a very specific reason for opposing it. I direct this to \nmy good friend from Nebraska because this is something that deeply \nconcerns me. This amendment allows health plans to define ``medically \nnecessary and appropriate'' in a way that poses a great threat to all \npatients and families who\n\n[[Page S6955]]\n\nrequire hospice and palliative care to treat the suffering associated \nwith terminal illness.\n  The Washington Post, just a week ago, published a story outlining the \nvarious ways in which recent advances and end-of-life care have not yet \nreached children with terminal illnesses, causing an enormous amount of \nsuffering for dying children and their parents and loved ones who have \nto watch that suffering at the end stages of a terminal illness. The \narticle quotes one mother who says, looking back on her daughter's \ndeath, that ``pain is such a huge problem.''\n  There are two specific phrases within the safe harbor of the \n``medically necessary care'' language in the Kyl-Nelson-Nickles \namendment that directly undermines the needs of dying patients. First, \nthe amendment declares that care provided ``for the comfort of the \npatient'' is not medically necessary care.\n  Any health care professional--or really any person, such as myself--\nwho has stood at the bedside of a dying friend or a loved one knows \nthat comfort of the patient is absolutely necessary and is often the \nmost appropriate goal of care in those last days, weeks, and even \nmonths sometimes. At the very center of palliative care, and \nparticularly in the hospice movement, is the belief that each of us has \na right to die free of pain and with our human dignity as intact as \npossible.\n  The Institute of Medicine released a ground-breaking report in 1997 \nthat concluded ``too many people suffered needlessly at the end of \nlife.'' A second Institute of Medicine report released last week also \nconcluded that patients are suffering unnecessarily. Furthermore, \nstudies have shown that specific types of patients--patients who are \nelderly, female, African-American, or children--are less likely to have \ntheir pain adequately controlled at the end of their lives.\n  The Kyl-Nelson-Nickles amendment is legislation that could be termed \nas declaring that the comfort of dying patients is not a legitimate \ngoal of medicine. But to me, that has it backwards. Isn't the relief of \nsuffering exactly what doctors are supposed to be concerned about?\n  A second and related problem is that this amendment allows plans to \ndefine as ``medically necessary'' care that is appropriate ``to treat a \nmedical condition, illness, or injury.'' This narrow definition \ncompromises the delivery of appropriate care to dying patients by \nfailing to recognize the legitimacy of care that focuses on the \npalliation of pain rather than a cure. This definition actually \nencourages overuse of invasive--and often futile--medical treatment and \nthe underutilization of hospice and palliative treatment.\n  The Institute of Medicine report released this month concludes that \n``policies and practices that govern payment for palliative care hinder \ndelivery of the most appropriate mix of services.'' A chapter of that \nreport focuses on the terrible effect these policies have had on \nchildren. It found that services necessary to provide dying children \nand their parents with comfort and counseling are not recognized and \ncertainly not even reimbursed by many insurance programs.\n  I believe the definition of ``medically necessary care'' proposed by \nthis Kyl-Nelson-Nickles amendment would further obstruct access to \nhospice and palliative care services for patients suffering from \nterminal illness.\n  We have not done enough to relieve pain and suffering at the end of \nlife. I served for many years on the board of a children's hospital. \nBack in those days, the idea of giving strong medication to a dying \nchild was really not even considered a possibility for many reasons. \nPeople were not sure about the appropriate dosage. Some people were \nworried even with a dying child that the child might become addicted to \nstrong pain relief medicine.\n  I have also seen friends who, at the end of their lives, had to cry \nout for and demand pain relief from an almost unbearable burden. They \ndid not want to leave this wonderful life, but they knew that was going \nto happen and they wanted to do it in a way that relieved both them and \ntheir loved ones of the agony that comes at the end of so many \ndevastating illnesses.\n  There are many wonderful hospice programs in our country, and many \nacademic development centers are developing comprehensive palliative \ncare programs specifically to focus on patient comfort at the end of \nlife.\n  The Kyl-Nelson-Nickles amendment places the comfort of dying patients \nand their families beyond the language of the legislation, really \nrendering it illegitimate; providing this comfort would no longer be \nmedically necessary or appropriate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the article I referred \nto earlier from the Washington Post called ``Children of Denial.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 19, 2001]\n\nChildren of Denial--Recent Advances in End-of-Life Care Haven't Reached \n                         the Youngest Patients\n\n                         (By Abigail Trafford)\n\n       The leukemia had come back. Liza Lister, 5, leaned on her \n     mother's shoulder. As her mother later recalled, Liza asked, \n     ``Will I die soon?'' She quickly went on, ``I want to die on \n     your lap. I want to have my lullaby tape on.'' Just days \n     after her fourth birthday, Liza had been diagnosed with acute \n     lymphocytic leukemia. Now her last chance for a cure, a bone \n     marrow transplant, had failed.\n       Her parents, both physicians in New York City, had access \n     to the most advanced therapies to wage war against her \n     disease. But when a cure was no longer possible, they found \n     themselves outside the mainstream of modern medicine.\n       Hospitals had no formal support system for families caring \n     for a child who was going to die. There was no one health \n     professional to offer consistent guidance throughout the up-\n     and-down course of Liza's illness. The medical team never \n     mentioned a hospice program.\n       At a time when strides have been made in easing the pain of \n     death for adults, most children who die of chronic illness do \n     not receive state-of-the-art care at the end of their lives--\n     mainly because no one wants to admit they're dying. The \n     majority die in hospitals, often in intensive care units \n     where they are hooked up to life support machines. Drugs that \n     could ease pain go unprescribed.\n       Yesterday the Institute of Medicine, in a report on end-of-\n     life cancer care, called for a stronger focus on children, \n     for better relief of suffering, education of doctors and \n     changes in health plans to cover supportive services.\n       ``Kids are suffering. The ones who are sensing they are \n     dying and haven't been told are suffering from loneliness, \n     from a lack of permission. Kids are suffering pain because \n     people are reluctant to give narcotic pain relief to \n     children,'' said pediatric oncologist Joanne Hilden, who \n     founded the end-of-life care task force for the Children's \n     Oncology Group, a national network of pediatric cancer \n     specialists.\n       ``Parents are suffering because they feel they have failed \n     their child. Doctors and nurses are suffering for wanting to \n     do better in a system that is getting in the way at every \n     turn.''\n\n\n                          the invisible death\n\n       Death in childhood can be a taboo subject in the United \n     States. The roughly 28,000 children who die every year of \n     chronic illness such as cancer, heart disease, degenerative \n     disorders and congenital anomalies are like medical orphans \n     in a health care system dedicated to cures and longevity.\n       ``Childhood death is completely invisible,'' said nurse \n     Cynda Rushton, director of the palliative program for \n     children at John Hopkins Children's Center. ``People don't \n     want to be reminded of it. The grief is so profound, it's \n     almost unspeakable.''\n       The medical team generally recognizes that a child is dying \n     several months before the parents do--but doesn't usually \n     tell them. In a study published last November in the Journal \n     of the American Medical Association, physicians tended to \n     realize there was no chance of recovery nearly seven months \n     before a child's death from cancer; parents, on the other \n     hand, did not come to that realization until about 3\\1/2\\ \n     months before. Only about half the parents learned it in a \n     discussion with the doctor.\n       The communication gap between physicians and parents is a \n     major barrier to quality end-of-life care, pediatric \n     specialists said.\n       No one at the hospital could bear to discuss death with \n     Liza Lister. She had pressed her doctors: ``What will happen \n     when I die? How will I know I'm dying?'' Her oncologist \n     promised to let her know when death was imminent. But on the \n     final night, as she lay in her mother's arms next to her \n     father and older sister, and everyone knew the end was near, \n     Liza asked, ``Why didn't the doctor call to tell me?''\n       The Listers were able to put together hospice care for Liza \n     for the last three months of her life. But fewer than 10 \n     percent of children who die in the United States receive \n     such care, according to the National Hospice and \n     Palliative Care Organization.\n       Palliative programs, focused on pain control and quality of \n     life, are aimed at making patients comfortable rather than \n     curing their disease. In addition to doctors and nurses who \n     treat pain and other symptoms, counselors, social workers and \n     spiritual advisers address the patient's emotional and \n     developmental needs. The team also supports\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\n     the parents and siblings, and helps the bereaved family after \n     the child dies.\n       A study published last year in the New England Journal of \n     Medicine concluded that many children with cancer ``have \n     substantial suffering in the last month . . .  and attempts \n     to control their symptoms are often unsuccessful.''\n       Researchers interviewed the parents of 103 children who had \n     died between 1990 and 1997 and were cared for at Boston's \n     Children's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. \n     Nearly half the children died in the hospital--half of those \n     in the intensive-care unit. Overall, nearly 90 percent of the \n     children suffered ``a lot,'' according to the parents.\n       Thirty years ago, when childhood cancer was generally \n     fatal, ``we were experts in end-of-life care,'' said \n     oncologist Joanne Wolfe at Dana-Farber, an author of the \n     study. Today, 70 percent of patients survive. ``We have to \n     turn our focus on the percent who are not cured,'' she said. \n     ``We have to focus on palliative care.''\n       A more recent review of children who died in hospitals in \n     Canada showed similar results. These children suffered from a \n     range of conditions including AIDS, organ failure, cystic \n     fibrosis, heart disease and cancer. Of the 77 patients \n     studied, more than 80 percent died in the ICU and most were \n     attached to tubes and ventilators. The children were rarely \n     told they were dying, according to the report in the December \n     issue of Journal of Pain and Symptom Management.\n\n\n                           moment of decision\n\n       When a life-threatening illness is diagnosed in a child, \n     most families start out with aggressive treatments.\n       Terri Wills, a single mom in the East Texas town of Newton, \n     thought her son's swollen face was due to allergies. It \n     turned out to be a rare, devastating kidney disease called \n     focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.\n       Adam, 5, was treated with heavy doses of corticosteroids \n     and other drugs. He gained weight from the drugs, his height \n     was stunted, his moods were in flux. He lived for almost 10 \n     years with his disease--and lived well, his mother said, \n     pitching for his baseball team and trying not to ``let anyone \n     see he was sick.''\n       In 1996, at the age of 12, Adam went into renal failure and \n     had a kidney transplanted from his mother. The disease \n     recurred almost immediately. A second transplant failed in \n     1998. At that point Wills and her son knew his death was \n     inevitable. ``I'd rather he die on a bicycle than in the \n     hospital,'' she told his doctors at the Children's Medical \n     Center in Galveston, and she took him home.\n       For many other children, the prognosis is not so clear. \n     Chronic conditions are highly unpredictable. Many formerly \n     fatal diseases are now curable. Parents are naturally eager \n     to give their child every chance for survival.\n       Derrick Csati, 9, of Angola, N.Y. has been battling brain \n     cancer since he was 2. His first surgery lasted 17 hours. \n     Since then, he's had several relapses and more surgeries, \n     courses of chemotherapy and radiation, experimental therapies \n     including monoclonal antibodies and a round of stem cell \n     transplants.\n       He's now on his way to Duke University to receive another \n     stem cell transplant, his fifth in the last year. His family \n     has declared bankruptcy and his mother quit her job to stay \n     with him.\n       The Csatis are supported with home care nurses and social \n     workers from the Center for Hospice and Palliative Care in \n     Buffalo. They have been on the brink before. Four years ago. \n     Derrick relapsed with tumors invading his spine, causing \n     horrific pain. They were offered several options; one was to \n     stop aggressive treatment and make him comfortable. They \n     chose instead an experimental regimen of chemotherapy and \n     radiation. The tumors disappeared.\n       ``He's had four years of quality life,'' said his mother, \n     June Csati. Derrick goes to school and has a close \n     relationship with his older brother, Ben. His mother knows \n     ``we could always tell them we're done.'' But ``I keep the \n     faith. I think he could pull this off. He's willing. He's not \n     being hurt by this.''\n       ``How can you stop? It's so worth fighting.''\n\n\n                            the pain factor\n\n       For many families, the crucial decision of whether to treat \n     aggressively or let go takes place in the pediatric \n     intensive-care unit (PIC). Doctors and nurses on the front \n     lines remember the hard cases: The teenager with aplastic \n     anemia who was in so much pain she couldn't be touched. The \n     13-month-old who was born prematurely and stayed on life-\n     support machines virtually all her life until the technology \n     was turned off.\n       ``I wouldn't put my own children through what we put \n     children through here,'' said Ivor Berkowitz, Director of the \n     PICU at Johns Hopkins. ``It is very wrong when you look at it \n     in retrospect.''\n       But he quickly adds that each case is unique and that there \n     are no overall guidelines on how to treat patients with \n     advanced illness in an era of expanding biomedical options. \n     Many children survive crisis that would be fatal for \n     adults.\n       ``At what point do you change your goals?'' Berkowitz \n     continued. ``Where do we set the bar? This is the biggest \n     struggle in the ICUs.''\n       ``The discussions are hard,'' said cancer specialist \n     Hildenof the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. ``Are we going to \n     do experimental chemo for leukemia? Or shall we stop? Do you \n     want to go on or off the ventilator? That's the down-and-\n     dirty stuff. That's not a 10-minute conversation.''\n       Nor is it covered by insurance, Hilden noted. ``How \n     politically incorrect is it to say I don't get paid to talk \n     to parents about the death of their child?''\n       All the while, children with debilitating illness need the \n     medical team to address symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, \n     shortness of breath and depression.\n       Managing pain is difficult in children, especially in those \n     who are not able to talk. Physicians get virtually no \n     training in pediatric palliative care. Doctors and nurses \n     watch for increasing heart rates, crying, agitation, \n     irritability.\n       ``It's very hard to tell what they're feeling,'' said \n     physician Charles Berde, director of pain treatment services \n     at Children's Hospital in Boston. ``The parents say, `My \n     child screams all the time.' Is the child screaming from pain \n     or something else?''\n       ``Pain is such a huge problem,'' remembered psychiatrist \n     Elena Lister, who described her daughter's death in the March \n     issue of the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management. Liza, \n     who died four years ago, suffered severe bone pain even in \n     her skull.\n       When Liza was in the hospital, one of the doctors raised \n     the concern that narcotic pain medicines are addictive. ``To \n     me--who the hell cares?'' said Lister. ``She is going to die. \n     The pain is such an inhibitor for any remaining pleasure.''\n\n\n                           continuity of care\n\n       Several studies have shown that the involvement of the same \n     physicians and nurses from beginning to end helps to minimize \n     a child's pain and suffering.\n       ``Continuity of care was key. To which I say, `Duh?' '' \n     said neonatologist Suzanne Toce, director of the palliative \n     Footprints program at Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. \n     Whether a child is cured or succumbs to a life-threatening \n     condition, ``we need to integrate palliative care into \n     mainstream medicine,'' said Toce.\n       Sometimes when parents want to stop aggressive therapies \n     before their physician does, they have to change doctors--\n     accelerating their sense of isolation and abandonment at a \n     crisis point in the child's illness.\n       That's what happened to Kevin and Brandi Schmidt of St. \n     Augustine, Fla. When their daughter Kourtney was 4 months \n     old, she was diagnosed with a severe form of spinal muscular \n     atrophy, a rare inherited disease. The Schmidts quickly \n     learned that such children die within a year. As the muscles \n     weaken, the child can't eat, swallow, cough, even breathe.\n       Kourtney underwent surgery to have a feeding tube inserted. \n     She received extra oxygen to breathe. She was revived several \n     times.\n       But the Schmidts did not want to put Kourtney on chronic \n     ventilation. ``We went to see a little boy. He was 2 years \n     old and hooked up to a machine. We couldn't see doing that to \n     Kourtney,'' said Brandi Schmidt. ``We wanted her to have a \n     better quality of life. We didn't want to do any measures \n     that would only extend her life.''\n       The low-tech approach did not sit well with their \n     physicians, especially the lung specialist. ``It was like all \n     or nothing,'' said Schmidt. ``He wanted to take the big guns \n     out.''\n       When the Schmidts refused to use more technology to take \n     over Kourtney's breathing, the lung specialist withdrew from \n     the case, ``I don't have the knowledge and experience to \n     counsel the family,'' he said, and he recommended hospice \n     care.\n       That meant the Schmidts had to find a new physician. The \n     local hospice program was not geared to children. The hospice \n     nurse was afraid to touch Kourtney. After negotiating a \n     special arrangement with their health insurance, the Schmidts \n     were able to keep their home care nurse and still receive \n     hospice benefits.\n       Kourtney died in her parents' king-size bed. She was 8 \n     months old. ``She wasn't in any pain,'' said Schmidt. ``It \n     was very peaceful.''\n\n\n                           Focus on Children\n\n       In a national survey by oncologist Hilden, bereaved parents \n     were asked what they most wanted from their doctors in a \n     palliative care program. She summed it up:\n       ``Tell us exactly what different options mean. . . . Some \n     parents, for example, didn't know that patients could talk on \n     a ventilator. . . . Tell us you can control pain, even at \n     home. . . . Tell us that not pursuing curative therapy is \n     okay. . . . Tell us the truth about prognosis. . . . Tell us \n     you won't abandon us. . . . Tell us how to prepare for the \n     funeral.''\n       The American Academy of pediatrics called last summer for \n     regulatory changes in Medicare, Medicaid and private health \n     plans to improve access to end-of-life services for children. \n     Several comprehensive programs have been developed in such \n     cities as St. Louis, Seattle, Buffalo, Boston and Baltimore. \n     These programs offer supportive care from the time of \n     diagnosis and follow some children for years. A study on \n     end-of-life care for children is underway at the Institute \n     of Medicine.\n       ``We have to acknowledge that some kids are going to die,'' \n     said Houston pediatrician Marcia Levetown, founder of the \n     palliative Butterfly Program in Texas.\n       Research suggests that when children have an opportunity to \n     discuss death, they are less anxious and feel less isolated \n     from their parents and caregivers.\n\n[[Page S6957]]\n\n       ``What Liza taught us was not only can you talk about this, \n     you must,'' said psychiatrist Lister. ``Otherwise, the child \n     dies and there's never been a chance for intimacy.''\n       For many families, the intimate bonding that can occur \n     during the dying process is what constitutes a ``good'' \n     death.\n       Teenager Adam Wills of Texas lived another year and a half \n     after the second kidney transplant failed. ``When I die, you \n     wear hot pink or bright red,'' he told his mother. He got a \n     new bike. He made friends at the dialysis center. Just before \n     he died, he gave an elderly man at the center a harmonica. \n     Then he ordered a lemon tree for his mom.\n       ``He was saying his goodbyes,'' said Terri Wills. Adam \n     suffered a massive stroke in October 1999, and was rushed to \n     Children's Hospital in Galveston, where he died in his \n     mother's arms in the Butterfly room. ``It was the most \n     beautiful thing I've ever experienced,'' she said. At Adam's \n     funeral, the elderly man from the dialysis center played the \n     harmonica. Four months later, the lemon tree arrived.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment not only for all the reasons others have enumerated but for \nthis very specific issue. We are at the beginning of work that needs to \nbe done in hospice care and palliative care, and I would hate to see us \nturn back the clock before we really started the race to determine what \nwe should do to care for those who are in the last stages of life.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment and \nto support the ongoing efforts to provide more pain relief, more \npalliative care and, yes, more comfort to those who are leaving this \nlife.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to make two points. One has to do \nwith a colloquy that was underway when I had to leave to introduce \nsomeone in committee about moving to the Defense supplemental \nappropriations and an effort to tie limitation of amendments on this \nbill to that effort. I also want to address the underlying amendment.\n  It never ceases to amaze me that when we debate these issues, we talk \nall around the issue, but we never get to the heart of the issue and \nwhy it is important. We have 1,001 examples of terrible things that \nhappen to good people, but we never talk about what is the issue.\n  Let me make it clear that I am going to vote for the pending \namendment. I think there is a better way of fixing this problem than \nthe way they fix it. I am working on what might hopefully be a \ncompromise to fix the problem, but I want to be absolutely certain that \nit is clear to anyone who has any intent to be objective that there is \na big time problem with the bill on this issue. Let me clearly define \nthe problem.\n  The question is: For example, I have entered into a contract on \nbehalf of my family with standard option Blue Cross/Blue Shield. I \ncould have bought the high option, but I looked at cost and benefits. I \nmade what I thought was a rational judgment, and I decided not to pay \nmore to get the extra coverage. I made a decision, and it involved cost \nand benefits.\n  Every day in America, people enter into contracts to buy health care. \nObviously, a big question in the bill before us is: Are those contracts \nbinding? Are they binding on the purchaser of the health care? Are they \nbinding on the seller?\n  As is usual with this bill, on page 35, gosh, it sure looks like they \nare binding. On page 35, line 14, it says in a bold headline: ``No \nCoverage For Excluded Benefits.''\n\n  Then you read on. It says:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit an \n     independent medical reviewer to require that a group health \n     plan, or a health insurance issuer offering health insurance \n     coverage, provide coverage for items or services for which \n     benefits are specifically excluded. . . .\n\n  Gosh, it seems in this bill they are saying contracts are binding, \nbut when you read on, as is true over and over in this bill, you find \nthat exactly the opposite is true. When you read on, it says:\n\n     . . . except to the extent that the application or \n     interpretation of the exclusion or limitation involves a \n     determination described in paragraph (2).\n\n  Then you go back two pages to find paragraph (2) and you find that \nparagraph (2) has to do with anything that is medically reviewable and \nanything that has to do with necessity or appropriateness.\n  Let me explain what this language says. This is a classic bait and \nswitch. The language says that if something is precluded in a contract, \nit is not covered, except if it is medically reviewable--and all \nmedical decisions are medically reviewable--and unless it has to do \nwith ``necessity and appropriateness.''\n  What this provision actually says is the contract is not binding. The \nmedical reviewer can determine that someone needs care, and even if it \nis precluded by the contract, the plan is required to provide it.\n  Gosh, that may sound wonderful to some people. Let's take the \nstandard option Blue Cross/Blue Shield policy. I have a limit of 60 \ndays in the hospital. Let's say I have the misfortune or someone in my \nfamily does that they are in for 90 days. The plan says you are not \ncovered. I go before a reviewer and say: Look, I want the medical \nreviewers to determine as to whether I need this care or not. They \ndetermine I need it, they override the contract, and so I paid for the \nstandard option Blue Shield policy, but I got the high option. Is that \ngreat and wonderful?\n  What do you think is going to happen when it is time for me to renew \nthat insurance policy? What is going to happen is then I am going to \nhave to pay for the high option. That is not going to be such a big \ndeal for me because I can afford to pay the high option, but what about \nmillions of Americans who cannot pay the high option?\n  If we let these external review committees decide what people need, \nindependent of the contract they entered into to provide care--I got a \nlower price by saying I did not want heart and lung transplant services \nin my policy, and yet I come down with an acute heart problem and my \nphysician stands up in front of this board and says, I am going to die \nif I do not get this surgery. Then the review committee says it is \nmedically necessary and under this bill it is covered, even though my \nplan I paid for did not include it. The net result of this is to cause \nhealth insurance costs to skyrocket.\n  Also, if I am a health care provider as an employer and I have joined \nmy employees in buying health insurance, now the contract is not \nbinding, so the health insurance company obviously is going to want to \nchange the amount they charge us because they are not going to have the \nprotections of their contract.\n  I do not think the way we are doing this is the right way to do it. I \nthink there is a cleaner way to do it. I hope to do it better later if \nthis succeeds or fails, but this brings us to a fundamental question of \nthis bill, and that is, Are contracts binding?\n  What we are saying in this bill is, no, not if they relate to health \ncare. I think that is very dangerous. This is another reason, if we \ndon't fix it, the explosive cost of this provision unfixed is greater \nthan the liability cost about which we spent most of our time talking.\n\n  I hope my colleagues vote for this amendment.\n  Now the final point. Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens were talking \nabout the necessity of passing a supplemental for national defense. I \nam for this defense supplemental. I want it to come forward. I don't \nsee why we can't do it tonight and get it over with, provide the money \nfor national security. I know there will be one controversial \namendment. I intend to vote against it; maybe some will vote for it. \nHowever, there is no reason that tonight we cannot settle this issue \nand vote first thing in the morning.\n  Several of the people who spoke on the issue suggested we will not be \nallowed to go to that defense supplemental bill unless we have set out \na limit on amendments to this patients' bill of rights. I urge the \nmajority leadership to not commingle this bill with the defense \nsupplemental. It may well be that in the end we will reach compromises \non the 6 to 10 major issues on which we will have to reach some \naccommodation to see the bill go forward. I am encouraged by the \nwillingness of Senator McCain to sit down and talk. I hope it is the \nbeginning of a recognition that this bill is not perfect and it can be \nimproved.\n  This morning when we voted down an amendment that exempted small \nemployers with 50 or fewer employees\n\n[[Page S6958]]\n\nfrom this massive liability burden that they can be sued for simply \nhelping their employees buy health insurance, I took that as a very bad \nsign for this bill. I have to congratulate the majority. Oh, that I \ncould be in an army that had that kind of discipline. I can't imagine \nthere is a city in America where Members could defend the provisions of \nthis bill, which basically say that if you are covered by ERISA, you \nare subject to being sued as an employer for helping people buy health \ninsurance.\n  There was an amendment that said just exempt the little employers \nbecause they will almost certainly have to cancel their health \ninsurance if they are subject to lawsuit. I don't believe there is a \ncity in America that any Member of the Senate could go into and \nsuccessfully defend a vote against that provision. Yet that provision \nwas defeated. I am afraid we are moving in the wrong direction in terms \nof building a consensus.\n  I want to see this bill completed. I don't think anybody benefits \nfrom holding this bill up. There are going to have to be certain \naccommodations. If we don't deal with some of these issues, the \nPresident will end up vetoing the bill, and what have we achieved? \nunless your objective is simply a political issue so one can say, well, \nwe were for this bill, the President was against it, Republicans were \nagainst it.\n  If we really want to pass this bill, we are going to have to deal \nwith the sanctity of contracts, we are going to have to come to grips \nwith suing employers and the liability question, we are going to have \nto come to grips with scope.\n  If States have good functioning plans, should they be able to stay \nunder their own plan or should they be forced under the Federal plan? \nThere are a handful of issues that could be counted on your 10 fingers \non which we will have to come to some accommodation.\n  My concern is, the clock is running. Today is Wednesday. Unless we \nbegin to reach an accommodation on these issues, we are headed for a \ntrain wreck at the end of the week, and it is because of that I urge \nthose in positions of leadership to please not try to tie stampeding \nMembers on this bill, by limiting their rights to offer amendments, to \npassing a defense supplemental appropriation that I assume we are all \nfor.\n  Why not pass this bill? I would be willing to pass it on a voice vote \nso it could be done tonight, get it over with, and then focus our \nattention on this bill. I hope we don't have an effort to tie limiting \nour rights on this bill to even bringing up the defense supplemental. \nIf that happens, the net result will be the defense supplemental will \nnot be brought up. No one will benefit from that. It is not good public \npolicy. I urge the two not be tied together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will respond to the plea from my friend from Texas, his \nplea that we finish this bill. No one wants to finish this bill more \nthan the authors of the bill, Senators McCain, Kennedy, and Edwards. \nThey have been working to compromise; they have been working with \nRepublicans. That is the reason we are winning these votes on \namendments, because we are getting Republican and Democratic votes and \ncarrying the majority. We also want to finish this bill and do things \nthe right way.\n  Why do folks stand up and talk about issues that are already taken \ncare of in this bill? I know there is a disagreement on the fine print. \nThat is what the frustration level is. I hope my friend will work with \nSenator Snowe as she seeks to craft a bipartisan amendment dealing with \nthe employer liability.\n  Right now, as I read the bill, employers do not have liability; they \ncannot be sued unless they personally make the decision to withhold \ncare from the patient. Most employers do not do that. They contract \nwith providers, and those providers will be held responsible.\n  I find it very interesting that my friends on the other side of the \naisle--most of them, certainly not all of them; and we are happy to \nhave Senator McCain and other Senators joining with us on many of these \namendments--I find it intriguing that they keep talking about these \npoor HMOs and insurance companies. We know, and we have said it a \nnumber of times, all we want is to see HMOs treated the same way in our \nsociety as we treat every other business, every other individual. If \nany of us goes outside this Chamber and we knock into someone and we \nhurt them, we are responsible. We are held accountable if it was our \nfault.\n  The reason we have the safest products in the world is that we have \nthe toughest liability laws and they act as prevention. People make \nsafe products, one, because most of them in their hearts want a good, \nsafe product. But we have harsh laws if you intentionally hurt someone. \nIf the brakes on the car don't work, if the crib bars are too wide, \nwide enough so a child can be strangled, we have laws on the books. All \nwe are saying to HMOs is, if you in fact hurt people, you should be \nheld accountable as well.\n  Members can stand up and pick apart one sentence in the bill, but the \nfact is this debate goes much deeper. It is not about paragraph 1 on \npage 2; it is about the essence of what we are trying to do. Do \npatients deserve care that is prescribed by their physician or should \nthey be at the mercy of some accountant wearing a green eyeshade \nsaying, no, that is money we cannot spend because our CEO will not make \nhis $200 million this year.\n  Patients deserve to have their care prescribed by physicians. \nCertainly, physicians are making that statement to us, and almost every \ngroup in the country, and certainly every respected group, makes those \ndecisions to support the McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill. Patients deserve \nto be able to know their doctor is taking care of them. You would not \ngo to a doctor to get a tax form filled out; you would not go to an \naccountant to get your health care. We should keep medicine with the \npeople who went to school, with those who know what good care is, and \nwe should keep the bean counting and the bookkeeping with the people \nwith the green eyeshades; they don't have white coats. I would rather \ngo to someone in a white coat if I am in trouble and need a course of \ntreatment.\n  Do patients deserve the medications the doctor prescribe? The HMO \nsays: We have another one we can substitute. If the doctor believes you \nneed a certain medication, you should have it.\n\n  Do patients deserve to get into a clinical trial if, in fact, they \nhave no other recourse? Absolutely they do. That is why the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill is so important.\n  Let's face it; HMO executives are making millions of dollars while \ndenying needed care to our people. This is about who you stand up for, \nwho you fight for. I have many stories.\n  I ask the Chair what is the order now? It is 1 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). The Chair advises that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee is expected to be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield then in 1 minute, if I might, and leave the \nfloor at that time. But I want to sum up.\n  On Monday morning early I held a hearing in San Francisco. I had \npatients and families of patients testify. I had doctors testify. I \nheard stories that absolutely brought tears to my eyes--not just to my \neyes but to those of everyone in that room.\n  No. 1, a husband whose wife was diagnosed with breast cancer had to \nliterally put his work aside. He is in his 50s. He had to fight for her \nto get the treatment she deserves and needs because the HMO was trying \nso hard to save money. He had to threaten to go to the Los Angeles \nTimes and tell his story--threaten--in order to get the care she needs.\n  I had the mother of a little girl who was diagnosed with cancer in \nher eyes. She had to struggle and fight. She said: I gave up everything \nelse I was doing. I could not be with my daughter.\n  This is wrong. Senators can offer amendments until the cows come home \nand I know one thing: It is delaying passage of this bill. It is \ndelaying the chance to vote on a strong Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Bring your amendments on. We are voting them down, most of them. If \nsome of them are good, we will support them. But we want a strong \nPatients' Bill of Rights that says to our people: You are paying for \nthis care. You deserve this care. If you are turned down for care, you \ndeserve the right to a\n\n[[Page S6959]]\n\nspeedy appeal, and then for sure we want to hold the HMOs accountable \nif they hurt you or your family. We say: Treat them as we would anyone \nelse in society.\n  I am grateful for the honor to speak on behalf of the underlying \nbill. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 819\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I do intend to offer an amendment \nshortly. I believe it is being finalized as we speak. We will have that \nbefore the Senate in a moment.\n  Listening to the debate, listening to the discussion this morning, I \nam once again reminded of what passes for policy discourse nowadays. I \nwas reminded of the article that was written by David Broder in the \nWashington Post yesterday. Mr. Broder is obviously one of the most \nrespected members of the press corps. Some refer to him as the dean. He \nis certainly not right of center. I don't know what you would call him \nexcept a very thoughtful, highly respected individual.\n  As I listened to this debate this morning, I thought a few of his \nwords would be appropriate. He says this:\n\n       The Senate debate over the Patients' Bill of Rights has \n     become, in large part, a battle of anecdotes. . . . Backers \n     of the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill, the sweeping \n     legislation President Bush has threatened to veto, come \n     armed each day with stories about the youngsters whose \n     brain tumor was missed because an HMO denied his parents' \n     request for a specialist referral or the mother whose \n     breast cancer was ignored until it was too late.\n\n  Mr. Broder goes on later in the article and says:\n\n       Would that the issue were that simple and straightforward. \n     But it is not. Anecdotal evidence, no matter how powerful, \n     gives no guidance to the scope of the problem being \n     addressed.\n\n  Later on in the article he says:\n\n       Still less do the anecdotes define the proper remedy. \n     Instead, by narrowing the question to dramatic horror \n     stories, they pull the debate away from the genuine policy \n     tradeoffs that must be made.\n\n  I could not agree with him more. The incessant recounting of horror \nstories and the using of these poor and helpless people as instruments \nin this debate, indeed, pull us away from the genuine policy decisions \nthat have to be made.\n  I would like to discuss one of those briefly this morning. That is \nthe subject of the amendment I intend to introduce. It has to do with \nthe exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n  That sounds to be an arcane legal issue that should not be of much \ninterest to very many people. I think the contrary is the case. \nBasically what the exhaustion principle is saying is that under the \nlaw, generally speaking, if you have a remedy before you get to court, \ngo ahead and use it before you go to court. The importance of that \nprinciple of exhausting your administrative remedies--going through the \nadministrative process before you leap to court--is firmly embedded in \nour system. We see it working all the time with regard to run-of-the-\nmill kinds of lawsuits.\n  We have lawsuits in State court where you have to go through a \ncommission or some body or some bureau has a chance to make a \ndetermination--usually because that entity has some expertise in the \narea. We give the entity, under looser rules of evidence and a lot less \nexpense for litigants, an opportunity to take the first pass at this \nproblem. In the process of doing that, a lot of things shake out, a lot \nof frivolous claims are made obvious and are dropped at that level. A \nlot of times the merits of a particular claim are seen and the State or \nwhoever it is--oftentimes it is in the State system--sees that and they \nsettle.\n  It is designed to have someone with some expertise, some objectivity, \nhash out the facts in a way that would be much faster than a court \nsystem, much less expensive than a court system, and would be to the \nbenefit of everyone involved. It still doesn't mean you can't go to \ncourt later, but a lot of things get winnowed out in the process.\n  We know how clogged up our court systems are in many cases. In our \nFederal system, under the speedy trial act, the courts have to consider \nall the criminal cases first. With all the drug cases we have in \nFederal court and everything else, sometimes in some jurisdictions it \ntakes a long time to get your case heard in the Federal court system. \nSo this administrative process before you ever go to court, in \nwinnowing those cases down to the ones that really belong in court and \nproviding expedited expertise to the litigants, is very important.\n  In our system, also, when we go through that process and we get that \ndetermination made by those who have the first look, so to speak, with \nthe expertise, then you give some credence to what they found. Then you \ncan go to court, but you do not turn your back on the fact that this \nprocess has been followed and they came up with a certain result. The \ncourt can live with that result, usually, or it doesn't have to if it \ndoesn't want to. But it is out there and it has served its purpose.\n  That is the general, overall system we have through our system. Not \neverything goes through this administrative process before it goes to \ncourt, but a lot of things do. This Health Care Bill of Rights we are \nconsidering today does that.\n  It sets up independent decisionmakers to consider these claims in a \nrather elaborate and detailed way before they ever get to court. The \nprocess that is set out in this bill is a good one. It sets forth a \nseveral-step process where experts who are independent and objective \nhave a chance to take a look at a claim. We all know, with as many \nhorror stories as are paraded around here by those who support this \nbill, that we cannot cover everything, all the time, for everybody, at \nany cost whether or not it is in the plan or it is something you have \ncontracted for or something your employer covers or not.\n  If we did that, the cost would be so high that nobody could afford \ninsurance, and nobody would be covered for anything. So it is a \ntradeoff. It is the kind of tradeoff that David Broder is talking \nabout. Yes, we want these pitiful people to have coverage, but we also \nwant to have it so that people are not totally driven out of the market \nbecause the cost doesn't match the benefit for the amount of money they \nexpend.\n  That is the process and the balance that we are trying to achieve.\n  We got into the health care business because the medical costs were \ngoing up at almost 20 percent. We created their managed care system. We \nlike to deride it now, but we created it because health care costs were \ngoing up at almost 20 percent and we tried to respond to that.\n  Assuming that, if it is not in the plan, if it is not in the deal, \nand if it is not in the contract, there will be some cases that are \nlegitimately, after being looked at by all experts, not appropriate, \nthis bill assumes there will properly be some cases that are not. If \nyou are going to have some that aren't and some that are, what do you \ndo? You set up a process to find out what is just. You set up a process \nto find out what is right.\n  How do you do that? This bill does a lot of things. It has an \ninternal review process. It is an internal process, first of all, to \neven grant or deny a claim.\n  Let's say under the plan that someone comes in and their claim is \ndenied. Maybe they haven't worked there long enough. Maybe they don't \neven work there at all. Maybe a determination is made that this is not \na medical procedure that is covered or it is experimental. For whatever \nreasons, there are many cases that are denied.\n  Under this bill, there is a process to review that denial, even at \nthe internal stage when the employer still has some say-so with regard \nto some of these plans. Especially even at that stage, this bill begins \nto set up expertise and objectivity.\n  At the internal review level, it says the person making that review \ncannot be associated with the prior decision. He has to be someone who \nis independent of that prior decision. It also says it has to be \nsomeone with expertise. It also says if it is a medical issue, it has \nto be a physician.\n  Even before we get to the external review, while it is still an \ninternal review, this bill sets up expertise and independence in the \nprocess to make sure this claim is adjudicated or decided in an \nappropriate manner. All right. You go through that.\n  Let's say the claim in this external review process is still denied. \nThis person denies the claim. Then, under this\n\n[[Page S6960]]\n\nbill, there is an external review process. At this stage of the game, \nthe person is totally independent of the plan. The legislation demands \nthat he be totally independent, that he have expertise, and that he \nhave nothing to do with the plan or the employers or anybody else. The \nbill spent several pages of setting up a procedure whereby he is \nobjective and independent.\n  The Secretary here in Washington has authority to review what he is \ndoing and to look at the cases he has considered to make sure he is not \nprejudiced in any way, where it looks as though maybe he is denying too \nmany claims or something such as that. There are elaborate processes to \nmake sure this external appeals process is fair, independent, and \nobjective. All right.\n  Let's say we go through that level. Let's say that entity decides \nthat there is a medical issue. Then they hand it over to yet another \nlevel of independent review. That is the independent medical review.\n\n  Once again, the bill sets up someone who is totally independent, \ntotally objective, sets forth supervision by the Secretary, and sets \nforth how he is to be compensated to make sure he is well qualified.\n  That is the third level, you might say, in terms of some degree of \nindependence and objectivity--totally at the last two levels and \nsomewhat at the first level.\n  You have the internal review; you have the external review; and you \nhave the independent medical review--all set up to make sure that \nsomeone who comes with a medical claim gets fair consideration, and you \ndon't have these big, bad, mean HMOs that we hear so much about making \nthese decisions. They are not. These people are under this act.\n  What we do, and what we say in this amendment that I am going to \nsubmit is, let's use it. What I have just described, let's use it.\n  After setting up this process that ought to be used because it is a \ngood process, this bill also says it can be circumvented at any time. \nIt can be. A claimant can stop it if he doesn't like the way things are \nlooking and go to court by alleging that they have received irreparable \ninjury or damage--not that they are about to but that they have \nreceived it.\n  There are two things wrong with that: No. 1, you obviously lose the \nbenefit of the administrative process. For example, part of the problem \ncould be or may be the sole problem could be a question of coverage. \nYou have this process set up. You are maybe in the middle of it. Why \nnot just decide whether or not you are really covered under this bill? \nIt is a factually intensive exercise under this plan: how long you have \nbeen working here, and that sort of thing.\n  The second thing that is wrong with the bill as it is now, and \nallowing them to circumvent this process that I have discussed by \nalleging irreparable injury--they do not use the word ``allege,'' but \nit is the same thing. The only way you can get into court is by \n``alleging.'' That is the way you get into court. It is a low \nthreshold.\n  You can circumvent this plan at any time, or this process at any time \nalong the way.\n  The second thing wrong with it is it doesn't have a claimant in it \nbecause we are talking about money damages. To circumvent this process \nin order to allow a claimant to go over here in the middle of it and \nfile a lawsuit for money damages, all he is doing is getting in line \nover at the courthouse. He doesn't get any expedited treatment for \nthat. It doesn't help him. Why would you do that when you are in the \nmidst of this, admittedly, excellent, objective, costly administrative \nprocess?\n  I don't think that it makes any sense. Costs are relevant because it \nis going to show up in somebody's price for insurance.\n  This plan costs money. This process is expensive to set up. If you \nare going to have it, you ought to use it. Of course, if the result \ngoes in the claimant's favor, it is binding on the plan. But if the \nresults of the independent process go against the claimant, then of \ncourse he can go to court.\n  But my problem this morning or today is not that he can go to \ncourt. It is that he can go to court before he exhausts administrative \nremedies.\n\n  My friends who oppose this--I am going to anticipate this a bit \nbecause we have had some prior discussions about this. Some of my \nfriends have pointed out that there obviously can be a need from time \nto time for emergency care. What if you are in the midst of this \nprocess and you have some kind of an emergency situation that ought to \njustify your circumvention of it?\n  My first answer is, the bill, as drafted now, is not going to help \nany claimant with regard to an emergency because, as I say, we are \ntalking about money damages. All he can do is file a lawsuit. If that \nmakes him feel better, 2 years later he may get into court to try his \ncase. That might help him. But other than that, that is not going to \nhelp the person with some kind of an emergency.\n  What will help that person, though, is in this bill. It is already \nprovided for. In the first place, you have a provision that is in \nERISA, that we adopt in this amendment, that says you have all of the \ncoverage that is given under ERISA, which allows you to go into court \nat any time to recover benefits that are due you, to get a mandatory \ninjunction or to whatever you might be entitled under ERISA, under \ncurrent law. That remains. That will be the same. We have adopted that \nand made that clear in this bill.\n  The second thing is, under section 113 of the bill, the claimant has \naccess to emergency care. There is a provision in the bill that if you \nhave an emergency--of course, the general law requires hospitals to \ntake care of you anyway, but if it is an emergency-type situation, \nunder this bill already, under section 113, an emergency is taken into \naccount.\n  What if you have a situation that is not an emergency, not an \nimmediate thing, but you do not want to go through the administrative \nprocess for just and reasonable reasons? What kind of situation could \nthat be?\n  That could be a situation in the middle that is not an emergency but \nmaybe you are entitled to an expedited review or determination. There \nis a provision in the bill that covers that situation also, under \nsection 103 on internal appeals.\n  At the internal appeals level, if the initial claim is turned down \nand if a person believes they are entitled to an expedited \ndetermination, even at that level, they can go forth and pursue that. \nThen, at the next level, at the external appeals level, if they believe \nthey are entitled to an expedited determination, if a physician \ncertifies that they are entitled to expedited consideration--at either \nof those levels--they can get that. So the claimant is covered.\n  The claimant is covered under those situations, which allows us to go \nback to the basic legal proposition that I mentioned in the very \nbeginning in relation to the exhaustion of the administrative remedies, \nwhich work so well in so many aspects of our judicial system, which is \nset up under this bill but then has massive carve-outs. That process \nshould be allowed to work.\n  There is one other point in this amendment, and then I will offer it; \nand that is, after you go through this process, after you exhaust your \nadministrative remedies, after you go through the internal appeal, the \nexternal appeal, the independent medical review, and after you get a \nresult--whatever that result is--the trier of fact, when you go to \ncourt, ought to know about that result. It is not determinative on the \ntrier of fact--whether it be the judge or the jury in the court--but it \nis relevant.\n\n  If you are not going to do that, you are really wasting a whole lot \nof time, money, and expertise and creating additional problems for \nyourself in terms of cost in reaching a just result. So that is what it \ndoes.\n  I think we all agree we want doctors making medical decisions. When \nthese claims are made, in this review process, if it is a medical \nclaim, doctors are going to be making that medical decision. But if you \ndo not like it, then you can go to court. But let that doctor, let that \nindependent, qualified physician make the first determination before \nyou go to court.\n  Are we so desirous of speeding everything to court, with the \nattendant costs that we know are going to come about? And these are not \ncosts to some HMO, these are costs to the American\n\n[[Page S6961]]\n\npeople. We have 44 million people who already are uninsured in this \ncountry. Even if we add just 1 million to the uninsured in this country \nbecause of what we do here, that ought to bother us. We should not be \nin the business of doing that.\n  So let's let doctors make that initial determination instead of \nlawyers. This is one of those issues that is doctors versus lawyers.\n  If you want to go to court, if you want to rush to court at any time \nin the process, regardless of what has happened--regardless of whether \nor not anybody independent has had a chance to look at this--you are \ngoing to decide, with a lawyers' bill, to do that. The way it is \nconstructed right now, you can sue anytime, for anything, in any \namount. We can discuss those issues later.\n  But with regard to this issue, exhausting administrative remedies, \nlet's let the doctor, let's let the medical people have the first crack \nat it. Who knows. When we get that result in, it might resolve a lot of \nthese potential lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 819.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment has been offered. I have \nmade my statement. I hope we have adequate time to deliberate with \nregard to this important amendment.\n  I yield back my time and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, during my nearly 5 years in the Senate \nI have heard the debate of managed care reform many times. I have \nparticipated in repeating statistics, engaged in legal analyses, \nparticipated in political analyses, all of which convinced me a long \ntime ago of the need for this Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  But there is no substituting that which many of my colleagues have \nbrought to this Chamber; that is, the life experience of American \nfamilies with the system as it is currently designed and how it has \ndealt with the tragedies of their own lives.\n  Many of my colleagues have brought the experiences of frustrated \nfamilies: People who get up every morning, go to work, pay for medical \ninsurance, and participate in a managed care plan, only to find that in \na moment of crisis in their own families, that which they purchased, \nthat which they have relied upon, was not available to them.\n  As do my colleagues, I want to now share with you just two stories \nthat give meaning to all the statistics and illustrate all the failures \nof the system.\n  I begin with Kristin Bollinger, a young girl from Spottswood, \nNJ. Kristin's experiences illustrate some of the troubling practices of \nHMOs and how ineffective and unresponsive they can be in dealing with \nthe needs of a child who requires long-term care when chronically ill.\n\n  Kristin suffers from a unique condition of seizures and scoliosis, \nboth of which can be managed with proper treatment and care. Her family \nwas forced in an HMO by their family's employer in 1993. Kristin's \nparents have been fighting to ensure their daughter receives \nspecialized services ever since.\n  The HMO told Kristin's family she could no longer see a pediatrician \nand the specialists who had treated her all of her life. From birth, \nshe had this condition. She saw a certain specialist, received \nspecialized care. When Kristin needed to see a neurologist and other \nspecialists, her parents had to pay for the specialists because they \nwere not in her managed care plan. After a major surgery in 1997, \nKristin's specialized nursing care was canceled without notice. She \nwasn't even told. The HMO even discontinued coverage for physical \ntherapy because it was deemed medically unnecessary.\n  Eventually, after fighting months and even years, the care was \nrestored. But here is a family dealing with repeated seizures, a child \nwho was not able to function, massive medical bills, although they were \nin a managed care plan, an inability to get the specialists who were \ndeemed medically necessary, and they had to fight their way back to \ncoverage while caring for a child--case in point.\n  What would have worked? First, a right to get to a specialist; \nsecond, after you have been receiving care from a specialist and your \nplan changes, the right to keep the specialist; third, when you are \ndenied the right to an appeal, for someone without an interest to hear \nyour need where you can explain the need. In three important ways, this \nPatients' Bill of Rights would have addressed Kristin's problem and \ndealt with the problem of her family. None of those three rights exists \nin law, and so she was failed three times.\n  Second, Morgan Earle, a 10-year-old from Chatham, NJ, born with \ncortical dysplagia, a devastating developmental\n\n[[Page S6962]]\n\nbrain injury that causes severe seizures. Morgan's parents, like any \nparents, were unprepared for dealing with the care of an infant \nexperiencing these seizures--sometimes every 6 minutes--making it \nimpossible for her to even eat or sleep.\n  When Morgan was 3 months old, her parents sought treatment from a \nteam of pediatric neurologists and neurosurgeons to develop a strategy \nfor dealing with Morgan's lifelong medical needs. By the time she was \n8, Morgan had endured extensive tests, clinical trials, and two major \nbrain surgeries.\n  Through the unbelievable genius of medical science, her team of \nspecialists reduced her seizures that were interrupting her life. But \nin 1999, one of the specialists who headed Morgan's medical team, \nthrough changes in his own career, abruptly transferred to another \nhospital in Chicago. Morgan's parents were shocked to learn that the \nspecialists selected by her new medical team were not part of the HMO. \nThroughout her life, she had relied upon these same doctors. Medical \nscience had found a way to control these continuing seizures that were \ninterrupting her own life and the life of her family. She had found an \nanswer. But the new team was not part of her managed care.\n  Imagine the frustration, that the genius of medical science found a \nway to deal with the suffering of your child in continuous seizures \nonly to find that now you could not avail yourself of it.\n  Morgan's parents appealed the decision to the HMO. They were denied. \nDoctors wrote that they and only their specialists could provide an \nanswer. They were denied. In fact, the doctors report their letters \nweren't even answered.\n  The HMO provided Morgan's parents instead with a list of in-network \nspecialists. They were not even board certified. They could not \nperform. They were not capable. They could not even understand the kind \nof medical care Morgan was receiving.\n  Last Friday, after 2 years of fighting an appeal, Morgan's parents \nreceived a two-sentence e-mail from her HMO that her original \nspecialists, the doctors they had requested, would now be covered--2 \nyears, no money, no care, no answers. It isn't right. It is not a \nsystem that anyone in this Chamber can defend, to Kristin, to Morgan, \nto her parents, or to millions of other Americans who are paying for \nthis managed care or whose employers are paying for it, believing they \nare covered, and tomorrow morning they are but a single tragedy in life \naway from Morgan's or Kristin's experience. It could be anyone in this \nChamber. It could be anyone we represent. That is what this legislation \nis about.\n  It is not a gift. It is not some benefit provided by the larger \nsociety, as if that in itself would not be right or fair. It is \nsomething that has been earned and paid for, but it is not being \nprovided. That is why we call it a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is not \na gift. It is a right. It is a contract. And it is our responsibility \nto provide it.\n  That is what this legislation is about:\n  One, ensure that patients with disability conditions have standing \nreferrals to specialists so they don't have to get permission; the 2-\nyear wait of suffering and bills and lost care never happens.\n  Two, allow patients in these circumstances to designate a specialist \nas their primary care doctor. It is right, and it is efficient.\n  Three, require HMOs to allow access to out-of-network specialists, if \nin-network specialists are inadequate, at no cost. It just makes sense.\n  Four, ensure that chronically ill patients can keep their doctors \neven if they are forced to change plans or their doctors leave the HMO. \nThat is not only right and fair; it is just not being cruel to patients \nand children in these circumstances.\n  The truth is, the alternative Republican plan does not allow these \ndecisions to be made by patients and doctors. It means that an HMO that \ndoes not have a pediatric neurologist can force a child to see someone \nwho is not trained or capable.\n  What are the costs of all this? If you take this one element of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights I have addressed, just this one narrow, \ncritical element for the chronically ill who need these specialists and \na continuum of care, if you just take this small element I have \naddressed, CBO estimates that it would add .2 percent to the cost of \ninsurance.\n  Is there a family in America, given these circumstances, who would \nnot bear that burden? Is there an employer in the country that would \nnot want their employees to have this peace of mind in coverage, just \nknowing that what they are already purchasing might now be relevant and \navailable in a moment of need?\n  Mr. President, I have participated in this debate over these years. I \nhave offered the statistics. I have offered the case. I have argued the \npolitics. I have discussed the merits. I have reviewed the bill. Now I \nsubmit Kristin and Morgan's cases as the most compelling cases of all \nof why there is only one piece of legislation available on this floor \nthat truly addresses these circumstances. It is offered by Senators \nKennedy, McCain, and Edwards.\n  The case is overwhelming, and I urge my colleagues across the aisle \nto join us. They will be proud and pleased that they did it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the benefit of our colleagues, we are \nnow still committed to voting at 2 o'clock on the Nelson amendment \nwhich we debated earlier today. We will then return to a conclusion of \nthe Thompson amendment. We just saw that amendment a short while ago, \nand we are trying to study that more closely.\n  After the completion of the vote on the Nelson amendment, we will be \nable to indicate to Members when we will either vote on or dispose of \nthe Thompson amendment.\n  There has been a proposal made to our colleagues on this side for \nvotes going through the afternoon and times allocated to the different \namendments and then into the evening, also being sensitive to the needs \nof our colleagues on the other side of the aisle for a window, and then \nreturning to the Senate for consideration of legislation.\n  Hopefully, at the end of the vote at 2:30 p.m., we will be able to \ngive the Members a clearer idea both of the substance and the time for \nmoving the process along. We have had good debates on these issues to \ndate. We still have work to complete on the issue on medical necessity. \nAlso, our colleagues, Senators Snowe and DeWine, held a press \nconference at 11:30 this morning on their proposals, which hopefully we \nwill consider later this afternoon, to tighten up language in the area \nof employer liability. We are familiar with the thrust of the proposal. \nIt seems to be extremely valuable and helpful in resolving some of \nthese issues.\n  We will move on hopefully to the issues of scope later in the \nafternoon and into the early evening.\n  This is how we hope to proceed. We are never sure until the actual \nproposal is made, but we want to give assurance to Members we are \nmaking progress, and we will continue to move as rapidly as we can on \nthe measure.\n  Again, the liability issue will be the last outstanding issue. There \nis still no consensus on that particular proposal. We will consider the \nalternatives in a timely way and hopefully be able to conclude the \nlegislation in a timely way as the majority leader has stated.\n  I thank all of our colleagues for their cooperation. These have been \ngood substantive debates. We have had very few interludes. A number of \nour colleagues welcome the opportunity to express their views on the \nlegislation, and we will try to accommodate as best we can when we see \nthe opportunity to have a focused debate on a particular subject matter \nand dispose of that matter in a timely way. I thank all of our \ncolleagues.\n  At the conclusion of this next vote, which we expect will start in \njust a very few moments, we will then have further news for Members.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6963]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 818\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 818 and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina. (Mr. \nHelms), is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 200 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is our understanding that the Senator \nfrom Arizona is going to offer an amendment at this time on behalf of a \nnumber of our colleagues.\n  Hopefully, we can have order, Mr. President. This is a very important \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nThompson amendment be laid aside without prejudice so that the Senator \nfrom Arizona may proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator from \nArizona would agree to an hour of time evenly divided on his amendment.\n  Is that right?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That would be agreeable. But I think we can do it in a \nshorter time than that, depending on the view of the Senator from New \nHampshire on the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not sure I have seen the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator, I will get it to you right away. \nWhy don't we do that.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say, it is my understanding, having spoken to \nall the managers, that Senator Snowe of Maine is ready to offer the \nnext amendment, whenever the time arrives that we complete this McCain \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nyield to me so I might ask a question without his losing his right to \nthe floor?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am always pleased to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIAITONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Stevens, and I entered into a colloquy with several other \nSenators here anent the possibility of reaching an agreement on the \namendments that would be considered at such time as the majority leader \ncalls up the supplemental appropriations bill. I have asked the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona to yield for that purpose again.\n  I wonder if it might be possible at this point to get an agreement, \nor at least to get ourselves on the way to an agreement, that would \nlimit the number of amendments to be called up to the supplemental \nappropriations bill to those amendments that we have ascertained are \nout there via the hotline in the Cloakroom and a managers' amendment, \nthe contents of which Senator Stevens and I are ready to reveal to any \nSenator who wishes to know what is in the managers' amendment.\n  May I ask, with the permission of the Senator from Arizona--I am \nabout to lose my voice for the second time in 83 years--the \ndistinguished majority leader for a reaction to this request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's concern for \nmoving the process along. And since we discussed this matter this \nmorning, we have issued a hotline request for amendments. We have now \nreceived the response. A number of Senators have indicated a desire to \nensure that they have been included in the managers' amendment. Once \nthat confirmation can be made, I think on our side we would be prepared \nto then enter into a unanimous consent agreement which would take on or \nschedule the debate with an appreciation for a managers' amendment and \na designated list of amendments that could be accommodated.\n\n  So we are just about at a position where I think a unanimous consent \nrequest could be propounded. If Senators could just check with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nAlaska to ensure that the managers' amendment is as it has been \nreported to them, we will be able to move forward.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader. I \nwonder if we can't set the hour of 3 o'clock as the time when the \nmajority leader could propound a request in this regard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would be happy to attempt to propound \nan agreement at 3 o'clock and see what happens. No harm done in making \nthe effort.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. The distinguished Republican leader has already \nindicated his strong support for such an effort.\n  So I thank the majority leader. And I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just to clarify, I would be happy to \nenter into a unanimous consent agreement that would limit the number of \namendments and provide for an understanding about how the supplemental \nwould be addressed. But, of course, we cannot schedule the supplemental \nuntil we have completed our work on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I \nknow the senior Senator from West Virginia understood that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. But I wanted to clarify that for the sake of anybody who \nmay have misunderstood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 820\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Bayh, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Edwards, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 820.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S6964]]\n\n   (Purpose: To clarify that nothing in the bill permits independent \n medical reviewers to require that plans or issuers cover specifically \n                      excluded items or services)\n\n       On page 36 line 5, strike ``except'' and all that follows \n     through ``(2)'' on line 8.\n       On page 62, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n       (V) Compliance with the requirement of subsection (d)(1) \n     that only medically reviewable decisions shall be the subject \n     of independent medical review and with the requirement of \n     subsection (d)(3) that independent medical reviewers may not \n     require coverage for specifically excluded benefits.\n\n       On page 62, line 20, after the period insert the following: \n     ``The Secretary, or organization, shall revoke a \n     certification or deny a recertification with respect to an \n     entity if there is a showing that the entity has a pattern or \n     practice of ordering coverage for benefits that are \n     specifically excluded under the plan or coverage.''.\n       On page 62, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       (vii) Petition for denial or withdrawal.--An individual may \n     petition the Secretary, or an organization providing the \n     certification involves, for a denial of recertification or a \n     withdrawal of a certification with respect to an entity under \n     this subparagraph if there is a pattern or practice of such \n     entity failing to meet a requirement of this section.\n       On page 66, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       (5) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the general \n     effective date referred to in section 401, the General \n     Accounting Office shall prepare and submit to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress a report concerning--\n       (A) the information that is provided under paragraph \n     (3)(D);\n       (B) the number of denials that have been upheld by \n     independent medical reviewers and the number of denials that \n     have been reversed by such reviewers; and\n       (C) the extent to which independent medical reviewers are \n     requiring coverage for benefits that are specifically \n     excluded under the plan or coverage.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, I \nhope he and his people will examine this amendment. I apologize for not \ngetting it to him sooner. Perhaps we could agree on this amendment and \nnot have to have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would it be agreeable to have an hour, so we could get--\n--\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 \nhour on this amendment evenly divided.\n  I withhold my unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, in just a minute I believe \nI will be able to respond.\n  Mr. REID. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I said, I believe we will be able to respond to the \nSenator in about a minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, concerns have been raised that under this legislation, \nindependent medical reviewers can order a health plan to provide items \nand services that are specifically excluded by the plan's contract.\n  The amendment I am offering clarifies that the bill does not do this, \nand that specific limitations and exclusions on coverage must be \nhonored by the external reviewers.\n  There are a numerous safeguards already in the bill to ensure that \nexternal reviewers cannot order a group health plan or health insurer \nto cover items or services that are specifically excluded or expressly \nlimited in the plain language of the plan document.\n  First, the external review entity who is responsible for determining \nwhich claims require medical review and which do not, may refer claims \nto independent medical reviewers only if the coverage decision cannot \nbe made without the exercise of medical judgment.\n  I repeat: The external review entity, the one that is responsible for \ndetermining which claims require medical review and which do not, may \nrefer claims to independent medical reviewers only if the coverage \ndecision can't be made without the exercise of medical judgment. For \nexample, the plan document says that the plan doesn't cover heart \ntransplants. Even if the patient has no other treatment options, the \nexternal review entity should not forward the claim for a heart \ntransplant to an independent medical reviewer because no medical \ndetermination is needed to understand that the procedure is not \ncovered.\n  Second, even if the external review entity makes a mistake and \nforwards to the independent medical reviewer a claim for an item or \nservice that is specifically excluded or expressly limited under the \nplan, the legislation states that the independent medical reviewer \ncannot require the health plan or insurer to cover such excluded \nbenefits.\n  The amendment I am offering clarifies this limitation on the \nindependent medical reviewer to make it perfectly clear that although \nwe are relying on the independent medical reviewer to give us a second \nmedical opinion when such a medical opinion is necessary to interpret \nthe plan's coverage, we are not empowering them to disregard the plan's \nspecific coverage exclusions and limitations.\n  The third safeguard and the one we are further strengthening with \nthis amendment is designed to ensure the objectivity and quality of the \nexternal reviewers. The bill provides already for their certification \nand sets out factors that must be considered before they can be \nrecertified, including the external reviewer's compliance with \nrequirements for independence and limitations on compensation. To the \nrecertification considerations already in the bill, this legislation \nadditionally requires the certifying authority, before recertifying an \nexternal reviewer, to consider whether the external reviewer has \nbreached the other safeguards by ordering a provision of items or \nservices that are specifically excluded by the plan.\n  The amendment allows a health plan or insurer to petition the \ncertifying authority to revoke an external reviewer's certification or \ndeny recertification and requires the certifying authority to do this \nupon a showing of a pattern or practice of wrongfully referring for \nmedical review claims that don't require medical decisions or of \nordering the provision of specifically excluded benefits.\n  Finally, the amendment requires the General Accounting Office, within \n1 year after the bill takes effect, to report to Congress on the number \nand the extent to which independent medical reviewers are requiring \ncoverage for benefits that are specifically excluded under the plan or \ncoverage.\n  I guess what we are saying here is that we are trying to make the \nlanguage as tight as possible. We know there may be a temptation on the \npart of reviewers to violate the plan with regard to those procedures \nwhich may be specifically excluded. We will have follow-up action, \nincluding a requirement for taking into consideration, on \nrecertification or even revocation of certification, a study by the \nGeneral Accounting Office which will tell us about the extent to which \nindependent medical reviewers are requiring coverage for benefits that \nare specifically excluded.\n  My friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, had a very good amendment. We \ncould not quite go that far, and we came close to agreement. I hope \nthis amendment does clarify some of the concerns.\n\n  It strikes the language on page 36 of the bill that says: Except to \nthe extent that the application or interpretation of the exclusion or \nlimitation involves the determination described in paragraph 2.\n  This removes what was viewed by many as a possible loophole. So we \nwere willing to strike that portion of the bill in order to try to \ninspire some confidence that in no way does this legislation expect or \nanticipate or even allow in any way exclusions on coverage that are not \nspecifically listed in the medical plan, in the insurance plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, before my colleague Senator McCain leaves \nthe Chamber, I thank him for his leadership on this issue. He has \ndemonstrated his courage in battle and in service to country and is \ndoing so again by leading this important battle for patient care for \nall Americans. I thank Senator McCain for his leadership once again.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Carper from Delaware. We served together \nas Governors for many years, and we now have the privilege of serving \nin this body. I thank him for his leadership on this issue, for his \ninsight. There is no deeper thinker who cares more about the public \npolicy details of what we do in the Senate than Senator Carper. He is \nnew to this body but has already made a substantial contribution to the \nSenate and to the laws that govern our country.\n\n[[Page S6965]]\n\n  I express my appreciation to Senators Edwards and Kennedy for their \nleadership in this important battle on behalf of patients. I express my \ngratitude to two of our colleagues who are not on the floor at this \ntime: Senator Nelson of Nebraska and Senator Kyl from Arizona.\n  In particular, I thank Senator Nelson for his heartfelt work on the \nlast amendment. Although unsuccessful, I know he cared deeply about \nstriking the right balance. We share many of the same objectives, \nalthough we differ in terms of how we go about achieving those \nobjectives. I salute Senator Nelson for his work in this regard. I hope \nour amendment will meet many of his concerns. I believe it does in \nterms of striking the right balance for the American people.\n  Our amendment accomplishes both of the important objectives that the \nAmerican people seek in debating and enacting this Patients' Bill of \nRights. First, we ensure that all decisions that involve the practice \nof medicine, all decisions that involve medical discretion will be \nfully reviewable by an independent panel to ensure the quality of \nhealth care for all insured Americans across our country.\n\n  Second, this amendment seeks to accomplish quality medicine at \naffordable cost, keeping the prices as reasonable as possible for \nconsumers and patients across the country. We do this by removing \nunnecessary ambiguity from this bill, thereby ensuring that we can \naccomplish quality medical treatment but keeping the risks, the \nuncertainty, and therefore the costs to patients and consumers as low \nas possible.\n  The bottom line will be quality health care for all Americans at an \naffordable cost. That is the balance all of us should be seeking to \nstrike in this debate. That is the balance this amendment will help us \nto accomplish.\n  Very simply, we seek to honor the original intent of this bill, that \ndoctors should make medical decisions, that lawyers should draft \ncontracts and practice law, but neither should be in the business of \npracticing the other's profession. We have removed through this \namendment ambiguous language that ran the risk of one encroaching on \nthe other's territory.\n  Specifically, let me read the provisions that will remain in the \nbill. They are explicit and unambiguous. I quote from the legislation:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit an \n     independent medical reviewer to require that a group health \n     plan or health insurer offering health insurance or health \n     insurance coverage provide coverage for items or services for \n     which benefits are specifically excluded or expressly limited \n     under the plan or coverage in plain language of the plan \n     document.\n\n  Under the bill before this amendment, Mr. President, there had been \nseveral exceptions which had consumed the rule, making this clear \nexception for express limitations or prohibitions under the terms of \nthe contract null and void. We put a period at the end of this \nlanguage, removing the exception language, thereby making it very clear \nthat the terms of the contract, in terms of contract language, will \ngovern. This helps to keep the costs low because the uncertainty and \nthe ambiguity will be removed.\n  At the same time, there can be no uncertainty or ambiguity that \nmedical decisions involving the practice of medicine, anything \ninvolving medical discretion, will be fully reviewable by the external \nappeals process, as it should be.\n  In addition, there are other precautionary measures included in our \namendment that I was interested in and I know the Senator from Delaware \nwas interested in. He may elaborate on these provisions in just a few \nmoments. These ensure that the independent reviewers are truly \nindependent. We want to make sure they adhere to the provisions of this \nlegislation, hopefully as amended by this amendment, and that we don't \nhave the risk of panels exceeding their authority by changing the terms \nof the contract where they are expressly provided for, and there is no \nambiguity in the language in terms of limitations or exclusions from \nthe terms of the contract.\n  Once again, this amendment will ensure that independent review panels \ndo not exceed their authority, inappropriately driving up costs without \nimproving the quality of health care for the American people.\n  Finally, we have a rare opportunity to achieve bipartisan consensus \non this amendment.\n  Not only is Senator McCain helping to lead the charge once again, for \nwhich we are very grateful, but I listened with great interest and \ngratitude to something that the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, \nsaid last evening. He recited the very same language that I recited \nabout exclusions and limitations in the contract. And then he said if \nyou put a period at the end of those provisions and remove the \nexception language, that would be--to use his word--``great.''\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what we have done. We have placed a \nperiod there and removed the exception language, thereby removing the \nambiguity, the risk, the unnecessary cost to consumers without a health \ncare benefit. Senator Thompson, earlier today on the floor of the \nSenate, indicated that this action we have proposed in this amendment \nwould also go a substantial way toward correcting what he thought was a \npotential defect in the legislation.\n  So I ask all Senators, regardless of political affiliation, who seek \nto strike the right balance between quality health care on the one hand \nand affordability on the other hand to support this amendment. We have \ntaken a step that some of those who have been concerned about the \nambiguity in the language have encouraged us to do, thereby ensuring \nquality affordable health care for every American. We can accomplish \nthat with this legislation, with this amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto vote in the affirmative.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleagues for their patience and \nattention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I am \npleased to be an original coauthor with Senators Bayh and McCain. The \nSenator from Indiana is very modest in giving to others the credit, but \nthis is really an idea that I first heard from him. Early this week, \nSenator Ben Nelson and Senator Bayh and myself were trying to deal with \nissue of medical necessity. It is a difficult issue around which there \nare competing interests--doctors, nurses, insurers, patients--who \nreally find consensus hard to reach.\n  I thank Senator Bayh for helping us to find this middle ground on \nwhich I am encouraged that maybe we will have strong bipartisan \nsupport. I express my thanks to Senators McCain and Kennedy and Edwards \nfor their leadership in getting us here this day, and to my friend, \nSenator Gregg from New Hampshire, for his thoughtful comments, as well \nas those I heard on the floor yesterday, alluded to by Senator Bayh, \nfrom Senator Nickles. As I recited, earlier today Phil Gramm of Texas \nechoed almost those same comments.\n  Before I return, I want to step back a little bit and go back in \ntime. I used to be State treasurer of Delaware before I was a \nCongressman, before I was Governor, before I became a Senator. Senator \nBayh was Governor of Indiana and was the secretary of state. We worked \nin those venues before we came here to work. With our State treasurer \nat the time, we administered benefits of State employees. Among the \nthings I was mindful of was health care costs.\n  In the 1970s and 1980s, health care costs went up enormously. It was \nnot uncommon to see increases then of 20, 25, or even 30 percent \nannually in the cost of health care for State employees. These really \nmirrored increases that inured to other employees outside the State of \nDelaware.\n\n  Along about the late 1980s, a dozen or so years ago, a number of \npeople began working seriously in this town to figure out how to \nintroduce some competition into the provision of medicine. In a fee-\nfor-service approach in medicine, I might see my doctor and he says, \n``You are not well; I will order tests A, B, C and D, and to be sure we \nwill order E, F, G and H,'' and he owns the lab where the tests are \nadministered. Then he says, ``Come back and we will see how you feel \nnext week.'' There really wasn't much impetus for containing costs. As \na result, costs spiraled out of control.\n  Managed care was designed and conceived to try to stop that spiraling \nand introduce some market forces and competition in order to control \nthe cost of\n\n[[Page S6966]]\n\nhealth care. It really succeeded better than I think any of its \nproponents had imagined. Those costs that were going up 20, 25, even 30 \npercent, back in the 1980s, by the time we got to the end of the 1990s, \nwere going up by 2, 3 percent, in some years nothing at all. As we went \nabout controlling costs, the concerns switched to a different area, and \nthat different area was quality of health care.\n  Instead of a lot of our doctors and nurses making decisions, a lot of \ndecisions for the care to be offered or given to us was made within the \nHMOs running the managed care operation. In some cases, they were \ndoctors and nurses, and in some cases they were not.\n  What we are trying to do in the context of the Patients' Bill of \nRights legislation is restore some balance to the system. We don't want \nto see costs spiral out of control or employers cutting off health care \nfor employees. By the same token, we want to make sure that more of the \nmedical decisions that affect us if we are covered by an HMO, \nespecially if it falls under a Federal regulation, which ERISA is--we \nwant to make sure we are getting the kinds of protections that inure to \nfolks who are in State HMOs.\n  How do we do that and not lead us back to spiraling, out-of-control \ncosts in a way that is fair to doctors and nurses, and in a way that is \nfair to employers and at the same time fair to the HMOs? The issue we \nare trying to address is this: I am in an HMO; I don't like the \ndecision my HMO renders with respect to my health care. I appeal that \ndecision, and it is reviewed by an internal mechanism within the HMO. \nIf they don't provide a decision my doctor and I like, we can appeal to \nan external reviewer. In some cases, certainly in my State, an external \nreviewer can override the HMO's decision and mandate the provision of \nthat health care under a State-regulated plan.\n  What about in a case where there is a federally regulated HMO, one \nthat falls under ERISA? What do you do in a case when the language of \nthe plan explicitly excludes the treatment that a member of that plan \ndesires? What do we do when the language of the plan explicitly \nexcludes the very treatment that I or the member of a managed care plan \ndesires?\n  Unintentionally, the language of the bill as drafted says to the \nexternal reviewer that you have license to go beyond that which is \nexplicitly excluded in treatment for a patient. That external reviewer \ncan order additional explicitly excluded treatment for a patient. That \nmight be great for the patient, might be appreciated by the patients' \ndoctors and nurses. But how fair is that to the insurer who is trying \nto cost out a plan, to charge for that plan and have a sum certain to \noperate with?\n  What Senator Bayh has fashioned, something that he and Senator Nelson \nand I worked on, is a way to provide that certainty for the insurer and \nalso to provide certainty for the consumer, the patient, and the health \ncare providers. It is a simple change--one endorsed, at least \nindirectly, by Senator Nickles and today by Senator Gramm. By simply \nstriking a couple lines in his bill and putting a period where a period \nought to appear, we helped solve a problem. It doesn't solve all of the \nproblems in this bill, but it solves one of the problems. It is clear, \nclean, and easy to understand.\n  Let me close my remarks with some comments about another one of our \ncolleagues who, before he was in the Senate, was a Governor, Ben Nelson \nof Nebraska. Before he was Governor, he was insurance commissioner for \nhis State. He has forgotten more about these insurance matters than \nmost of us will ever know. His insights and perspectives on these \nissues have been enormously helpful to me in this debate. I thank him \nfor joining with Senator Bayh and me and others in the conversations \nthat really led to the emergence of this proposal.\n  Senator Nelson offered an amendment with Senator Kyl a little bit \nearlier today to try to define medical necessity, which is really the \nkind of issue we are talking about here. People have been trying to do \nthat for years without a lot of success. While we are not going to \nagree to change the language in the bill with respect to that, we can \nsay here clearly, if a health plan that falls under the jurisdiction of \nERISA explicitly excludes a particular kind of coverage, then in all \nfairness the external review committee in reviewing an appeal, cannot \noverride the explicit exclusion in that health care plan. That is fair; \nthat is reasonable; it provides certainty for the insurer, and I think \nit is fair to consumers as well.\n  I am pleased to rise in support of it, and I hope that all of us in \nthis Senate, Democrats and Republicans, and Independent as well, can \nsupport this amendment. Thank you very much.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank my \nfriend from Delaware for all his work on this issue. It is very \nimportant to the progress we are making to finally protect patients in \nthis country, along with Senator Bayh, who led this effort, and Senator \nNelson and others involved in this issue. We very much appreciate all \nof their input.\n  The issue of medical necessity, which means how we determine whether \nany particular care is covered and is medically necessary for the \ntreatment of the patient, is a critical issue in the bill. We have now \nagreed on language that we believe appropriately balances the interests \nof the contract between the insurance company or the HMO and the \nemployer on the one hand, and the interest of the patient and having \nsome flexibility on the other.\n  Basically what we have said in this amendment is if the contract \nexplicitly excludes a particular treatment, a test, then that will be \nexcluded from care, period, and the independent reviewers are bound by \nthat language.\n  On the other hand, to the extent we need some flexibility in what is \nproper and good medical care, we have managed to maintain that. I think \nwe have struck the right balance between the sanctity of the contract \non the one hand, so people know they can rely on the provisions of the \ncontract and, secondly, allowing enough flexibility to provide the \nproper care to patients when they go through the review process.\n  More important is this is another step in a very important process. \nWhen we began last week, we were confronted with trying to get real \npatient protections in this country with numerous obstacles--\ndisagreement among our colleagues, different issues being raised by \nMembers of the Senate and a written veto threat from the President.\n  As we have moved forward through the end of last week and through the \nmid part of this week, we have continued to make progress every step of \nthe way. We keep resolving issues. We keep making progress.\n  On the issue of employer liability, about which many of our \ncolleagues have expressed concern, making sure that employers around \nthis country are protected from liability, we have worked with our \ncolleagues--Senator Snowe, Senator Nelson, Senator DeWine, and others--\nto work out compromise language that satisfies a large number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle so that there is consensus on the \nneed to protect the employers, on the one hand, but keeping in mind the \nrights of the patients on the other. Issue resolved.\n  No. 2, scope: What this legislation covers and who it covers. Senator \nBreaux and I and others have been working very hard on this issue. We \nbelieve we have reached a resolution that will result in an amendment \nbeing offered later today that strikes a compromise and a balance \nbetween the interests of the States, being able to maintain the work \nthey have done in the area of patient protection, while at the same \ntime making sure every single American has a floor on the level of \npatient protection.\n  On the issue of medical necessity, as a result of the work of many of \nmy colleagues, we have been able to reach consensus. On the issue of \nscope, who is covered, we have been able to reach consensus. On the \nissue of employer liability, we have been able to reach consensus.\n  Every day we have continued to make progress, but the importance of \nthis is not for what is happening specifically within this Chamber and \nwhat is happening in Washington, DC, and what is happening among \nSenators. The winners in this process are the\n\n[[Page S6967]]\n\nfamilies of America because it is now becoming clearer and clearer that \nwe may finally be able to provide those families with the protections \nthey so desperately need and to which they are entitled.\n\n  That is what this debate has been about. That is what all this work \namong Republicans and Democrats in the Senate has been about. We have \nshown over the course of the last week that we can work together, we \ncan find ways to provide real patient protection in this country. Up \nuntil now, we have a model in problem solving, in trying to give real \nprotection to the families of this country so they can make their own \nmedical decisions. That is what this debate has been about; that is \nwhat our work has been about.\n  We are not finished. We have important issues left to resolve, but I \nam confident, given the good will and hard work that has already been \ndone, that if we continue in that same way, we will be able to reach a \nresolution and hopefully be able to put a bill on the President's desk \nand that he will sign a real Bipartisan Patient Protection Act that \ngives power to patients and lets them make their own health care \ndecisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, over the \npast few days of debate on this Patients' Bill of Rights, we have heard \nthe many horror stories of what happens to people when HMOs put profits \nahead of patients. We have heard of one man in a wheelchair whose HMO \nordered his oxygen tanks removed from his house; we heard of a \nyoungster whose brain tumor was missed because the HMO refused to allow \nthe necessary test; and we heard of others pleading with their HMO to \nget coverage for critical procedures either for themselves or their \nfamilies.\n  These, unfortunately, are not isolated examples. They are happening \nevery day all across this country which is why the people of America \nare demanding reform and why we are seeing the public surveys now \nshowing support for this legislation to the tune of 81 percent in favor \nof this legislation.\n  The people also realize the system is not working for the doctors \neither. Just last week, I learned of a doctor who is assessing his \nexisting patients a $1,500 annual membership fee for the privilege of \ncontinuing their treatment. He wants to cull his current patient list \nfrom 3,000 patients down to 600, and by charging this annual membership \nfee, the doctor shrinks his practice and yet he maintains his profits. \nThe patients who cannot afford the annual membership fee have to find \nanother doctor. I find this outrageous and unethical, and it sets a bad \nprecedent for the future of our health care industry.\n  All of these incidents and the debate over this legislation have made \none thing very clear: Our health care system is failing most of the \npeople in the country.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to reiterate my strong support for this \nBipartisan Patient Bill of Rights. It represents a critical first step, \nan important first step in a long journey of a thousand miles of \nreforming America's health care system.\n  In short, this legislation puts medical decisions back in the hands \nof doctors and patients instead of HMO bureaucrats. It gives patients \nthe right to see a specialist when needed, fixing a system that so \noften blocks a woman's access to necessary care. This legislation will \nensure direct access for a woman to an OB/GYN if that is who she wants \nas a primary care physician. This bill gives patients access to the \nemergency room without first seeking clearance from their health care \nprovider. We have heard many horror stories recounted in the Senate of \npeople denied access to a certain emergency room because they had to go \nto another.\n  This legislation also protects the doctor-patient relationship, a \nvery sacred relationship, by ending restrictions on which health care \noptions doctors can recommend. Currently, we know doctors say they fear \nretribution from the health insurance industry if they pursue more \ncostly medical treatment for their patients.\n  This bill also prohibits HMOs from offering financial incentives to \ndoctors for recommending limited care. It prohibits HMOs from punishing \ndoctors who seek top-notch care for patients.\n  What we are trying to do in this legislation is reinject common sense \nand good medical practice in protecting the doctor-patient relationship \nso the patient knows the doctor is going to prescribe what is the very \nbest medical treatment appropriate for the circumstances.\n  In spite of claims to the contrary, yesterday the American Medical \nAssociation and other health groups reported in States with recently \nenacted accountability and legal remedies, the new laws did not produce \nany documented increase in the number of uninsured, one of the specious \narguments that the opponents to this legislation have advanced.\n  The most crucial issue is whether a patient can seek legal recourse \nfor the wrongdoing by a managed care company. This bill will enable \npatients to hold their insurance companies accountable for harmful \nactions. Under current law, if malpractice is committed, if there are \ngrievous wrongs, a patient can recover from a doctor, from a hospital, \nfrom other providers, but under current law they cannot recover from an \nHMO. That is one of the main fundamental principles of this \nlegislation, to change that, so they can hold those HMOs accountable.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I was the elected insurance commissioner \nof Florida for 6 years. I saw how some insurance companies--and I don't \nsay all because I am proud of those insurance companies that would \nstand up for the rights of their patients and would stand up to protect \ntheir patients, but I saw how some insurance companies tried to put \nprofits ahead of patients. Unfortunately, many patients often have \nlittle or no recourse.\n  There is no reason why HMOs should have special protection from \nlawsuits. The AMA has so stated and endorsed a patient's right to sue. \nIt is estimated more than 190 million Americans are enrolled in health \nplans, and 75 percent of them under current law are unable to sue their \nhealth plans for anything but the cost of denied treatment. Clearly, \nthe status quo works for the industry, but it fails consumers. We need \nthis legislation to enable people to be able to redress their wrongs in \nState courts for damages limited only by State regulations.\n  It has been a long time coming. It has taken 5 years to get this \nlegislation to the floor because for 5 years special interests have \nprevented this bill from becoming law. As a result, the people of \nFlorida and the people throughout this Nation have suffered. We must \nend the industry strangle hold on this legislation and we must take the \nfirst meaningful steps toward overall health care reform. I submit that \nthis legislation is a major first step in the overall journey toward \nhealth care reform. We must put the people before the special \ninterests. We must put an end to these consumer horror tales that we \nhave heard with all too much frequency during the course of debate on \nthis legislation.\n\n  I thank colleagues for the privilege of addressing this issue and for \nindulging me in my comments.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is located in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am very pleased to join with my colleague from \nNebraska as well as the other Senators whom I mentioned in offering \nthis amendment. Our amendment will give true deference to State laws \nand the traditional authority of States to regulate insurance while \nensuring that each State addresses the specific patient protections \nprovided in this legislation.\n  We should pass a strong, binding Patients' Bill of Rights. We should \npass a bill that holds HMOs accountable for promised care and that \nensures that patients receive the health care they need when they need \nit. However, we should do so in a responsible way that does not add \nexcessive costs and complexity to an already strained health care \nsystem.\n  Congress should act to provide the important protections that \nconsumers want and need without causing costs to soar and without \npreempting State insurance laws. We can do so by passing a carefully \ncrafted bill.\n  I strongly believe we should not preempt or supersede but, rather, \nbuild upon the good work the States have done in the area of patients' \nrights and protections. States have had the primary responsibility for \nregulating insurance since the 1940s. For more than 60 years, States \nhave been responsible for protecting insurance consumers. As someone \nwho has overseen a bureau of insurance in State government for 5 years, \nI know firsthand that our States' bureaus of insurance do an excellent \njob of protecting consumers' rights.\n  One of the myths in the debate on this legislation is that unless the \nFederal Government preempts State insurance laws, millions of Americans \nwill somehow be unprotected in their disputes with HMOs. That simply is \nnot true. For example, as this chart demonstrates, the States have been \nextremely active in passing patient protections. In fact, they have \nbeen way ahead of the Federal Government and they have acted without \nany prod or mandate from Washington. Look at this activity: 44 States \nhave dealt with the issue of emergency room access; 49 States have \npassed laws prohibiting gag clauses in insurance contracts that \nrestrict what a physician can tell a patient. Whether it is access to \nOB/GYNs, continuity of care, or many of the other issues such as \ninternal or external appeals or patient information, the States have \nbeen extremely active in this area. Every single State has acted to \npass some sort of patient protections.\n  As is so often the case, it has been the States that have led the \nway. They have been the laboratories for insurance reform. Moreover, we \nknow one size does not fit all. What may well be appropriate for one \nState simply may be unworkable or unneeded or too costly in another. \nWhat may be appropriate for California, which has a high penetration of \nHMOs, may simply not be necessary in a State such as Alaska or Wyoming \nwhere there is virtually no managed care. In such States, a new blanket \nof heavyhanded Federal mandates and coverage requirements simply drives \nup costs that impede rather than expand access to health insurance. \nThat is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the \nNational Conference of State Legislators are very concerned about the \nlanguage in the McCain-Kennedy bill. The language in that bill will \nforce all States to adopt virtually identical Federal standards.\n  I recently received a letter from the president of the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners. She writes that States have \nfaced the challenges and produced laws that balance the two-part \nobjectives of protecting consumer rights and preserving the \navailability and affordability of coverage. For the Federal Government \nto unilaterally impose its one-size-fits-all standards on the States \ncould be devastating to State insurance markets.\n  I think we should heed that caution. I think we should heed that \nwarning. The Federal Government does have an important role to play in \nregulating the self-funded plans under ERISA. That is where our effort \nshould be focused.\n  States are precluded from applying patient protections to these \nfederally regulated plans, and that is why we need a Federal law to \nensure that consumers, enrolled in insurance plans beyond the reach of \nState regulators, have strong patient protections. But the Federal \nGovernment should not be in the business of second-guessing and \noverriding and preempting the carefully crafted patient protections \nthat have been negotiated by our State legislators and Governors to \nmeet the needs of their States' citizens. States which seized the \ninitiative and acted on their own should not have to revise their \ncarefully tailored laws simply to comply with a one-size-fits-all \nFederal mandate.\n  Under the McCain-Kennedy bill, the Federal Government would preempt \nexisting State laws unless the State has enacted protections that are \n``substantially equivalent to and as effective as'' the Federal \nstandard.\n  A reasonable person's interpretation of that standard is the States \nwill have to pass new laws wiping out their carefully crafted work, \nthat are virtually identical to the standards in the McCain-Kennedy \nbill.\n  The approaches taken by the 50 States to the same type of patient \nprotection vary widely, and with good reason in many cases. Why should \nStates that have already acted on their own to provide strong, workable \npatient protections have to totally change and make extensive changes \nin their laws? That is why the National Council of State Legislators \nsupports the Collins-Nelson amendment. It is extremely important to \nState legislators that they\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\ndo not have to spend valuable time recrafting and rewriting and \nreenacting laws already on the books that meet the needs of their \ncitizens.\n  In a recent letter to Senator Nelson and myself, the National Council \nof State Legislators wrote:\n\n       [We] support this amendment. States are best situated to \n     provide oversight enforcement of the patient and provider \n     protections established in this legislation. The record of \n     the states is strong. We are looking for an approach that \n     supports the traditional role of States in the regulation of \n     insurance and that recognizes the differences in State \n     insurance plans and provides a mechanism for States to \n     protect those markets.\n\n  Again, let me be clear. There is a role for the Federal Government, \nand that is to make sure that those plans, regulated under ERISA, \nbeyond the reach of State regulators, include patient protections. That \nis why we need a Federal law to accomplish that goal.\n  It is all well and good and appropriate if Congress decides it wants \nto impose a specific requirement or mandate on these federally \nregulated insurance plans. But the Federal Government needs to be \ncareful in respecting the good work the States have done.\n  Moreover, let's look at the practical consequences of what would \nhappen under the McCain-Kennedy bill. If a State fails to revise its \nlaws to conform to the Federal standard, under the McCain-Kennedy bill \nthe Health Care Finance Administration, HCFA, would displace the State \nas the enforcer of insurance patient protection.\n  Talk about a right without a remedy. If there is no enforcement, \nthere is no protection, and experience has already shown that HCFA is \ncompletely incapable of carrying out this responsibility.\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on which I serve \nhas held yearly hearings to examine the problems that HCFA has \nexperienced as it has attempted to implement and enforce the 1996 \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. There are many GAO \nreports. This one is entitled: Progress Slow In Enforcing Federal \nStandards in Nonconforming States. That is because HCFA is totally ill-\nequipped to take on this task.\n\n  Our States' bureaus of insurance know how to do the job. They have \nbeen doing it for 60 years, and they have been doing it well. Consumers \nshould be very concerned, since HCFA has already proven that it is not \ncapable of enforcing existing Federal insurance standards in States \nthat don't conform. In fact, HCFA has shown it cannot even assess the \ndegree of compliance with those Federal laws, where HCFA does play a \nrole. We should be very concerned that we are proposing an empty \npromise.\n  The States have the systems, the infrastructure necessary to receive \nand process consumer complaints in a timely fashion and to hold \ninsurers accountable to ensure that they comply with State laws. To me, \nthe bottom line is very simple. My constituents would much rather call \nthe bureau of insurance in Gardiner, ME, than have to deal with the \nHCFA office in Baltimore if they have a problem with their insurance.\n  Another problem of the McCain-Kennedy approach is that it would \ncreate a dual enforcement structure that would be extremely confusing \nfor consumers and, frankly, completely unworkable. Under this bill, if \nsome State laws met the new standards but others did not, who would be \nthe regulator? Would it be HCFA or would it be the bureau of insurance? \nWould it be HCFA for some parts of the insurance contract and the \nbureau of insurance in the State for other parts of it?\n  This simply does not work. We would be creating a situation where a \npatient may have to go to a State bureau of insurance for questions or \nproblems associated with certain patient protections and then try to \ndeal with HCFA if the patient has problems or questions with other \nparts.\n  Therefore, Senator Nelson and I, supported by a number of our \ncolleagues, are offering an amendment that will give true deference to \nState laws and the traditional authority of States to regulate \ninsurance. At the same time, we will ensure that each State considers \nand addresses the specific patient protections proposed by this \nlegislation.\n  First, our amendment would grandfather all State patient protection \nlaws that are in place prior to the effective date of this act. That is \nOctober 1 of next year. A State would just certify to the Secretary of \nHHS that it has addressed one or more of the patient protection \nrequirements to be in compliance with the law. This provision would \nalso give States that have not considered these patient protections an \nincentive to act before the effective date to avoid Federal intrusion \nand challenges to their laws.\n  Second, if by the effective date a State has been certified as \ncompliant with all the patient protections in the legislation, it will \nimmediately become eligible for funds from a new patient quality \nenhancement grant program. States that are not in full compliance by \nthe effective date of the legislation would be required to meet a \nhigher standard in order to be eligible for funds under this new \nprogram. If a State has not acted by the effective date, it would have \nto certify to the Secretary, for each of the remaining protections, \nthat either the State has enacted a law that is ``consistent with the \npurposes of the Federal standard'' or decline to enact a law because \nthe adverse impact of the law on premiums would lead to a decline in \ncoverage or simply because the existence of a managed care market in \nthe State is negligible; it is just not relevant to that State.\n  Our amendment would recognize the States are the experts in this \narea. They have led the way. Consumers are best protected if we \ncontinue to respect the work that the States have done and give \ndeference to the State's traditional authority to regulate insurance.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time but yield to the Senator from \nNebraska, my principal cosponsor, who is a true expert in this area. He \nknows more than any other Senator. I hope my colleagues will listen \nvery carefully. It has been a great pleasure to work with him on this \nissue about which we both care a great deal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleague from the New England \nState of Maine for such a glowing recommendation. I hope my colleagues \ndo not think I believe I know more than they do. But it is a subject I \nhave spent a good deal of my life involved in as an insurance regulator \nand as a Governor, somebody who has dealt with the business of \ninsurance.\n  I appreciate so much the opportunity to join with Senator Collins to \nbring this amendment to the attention of our colleagues.\n  It typically is a lot more instructive to talk about the importance \nof patient care and to talk about those who aren't getting good patient \ncare and certainly to bring to our attention those folks who suffered \ngreat injustices under their current health care system. I respect \nthat. I certainly am interested in that aspect. That is why I support a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. That is why I continue to do that.\n  But I have found that any bill which comes before this body or that \ncomes before any legislative body is hardly ever such without some \namendment and some improvement. I think what Senator Collins and I are \noffering today is in that category of an improvement.\n  When our founders created this Union they established a system of \nGovernment that, pursuant to our Constitution, provided for a divided \nGovernment, a Government consisting of our States, and under a well-\nconsidered principle of Federalism, a Federal Government. We have been \nbest served by this Government when we have permitted it to work for \nus. While pursuant to the 10th amendment, the Federal Government may \npreempt States in certain respects, it seems clear from that amendment \nand from the practice over the last 200-plus years that such preemption \nshould be limited to those areas where the States have failed to act in \nsome manner. This is not one of those cases.\n  The bill before us presents a dilemma for me and for my colleagues \nbecause most of us believe that, with some modifications, this is a \ngood bill. The same may be said of the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill.\n  At the outset, let me state unequivocally that I support the purpose \nand the protection of this bill. What I don't support is its preemption \nof State laws in an unnecessary manner. Let me explain.\n\n[[Page S6970]]\n\n  As my colleague has indicated by the chart, the States have acted. \nThey have acted rather aggressively and consistently and in many ways. \nAs a matter of fact, they acted so aggressively and so consistently \nthat the best of those protections which the States passed were \nassembled to create this bill. Let me ask you if that isn't some action \non the part of the States.\n  When Congress passed the ERISA preemption in 1974, it did so because \nsome multi-State employers were having problems complying with the \ndiversity of the State regulation of health insurance.\n  First, it was described as a pension issue to which they couldn't \nquite comply. Then they said, as long as we are getting a preemption, \nlet's grant it in the health insurance area as well. So Congress \nexempted certain plans from State law. That level of exemption involved \nfewer insured than were continued to be served by State regulated \ninsurance plans.\n  What we are faced with today is dealing with the problem that began \nin 1974 with the exemption from consumer protections of these Federal \nplans. Now we are faced with solving that problem.\n  Some have said, as long as we are solving that problem, let's move \naway from diversity and go to uniformity. I am not opposed to having \nuniformity. But to serve uniformity for uniformity sake and ignore what \nthe States have done, the fact is that under the principles espoused by \nThomas Jefferson States have only been acting as laboratories of \ndemocracy by experimenting. Fortunately--and thank goodness--the States \nhave experimented because it is from these experiments and from this \ndiversity that we are now able to assemble for the protection of the \nERISA plan this group of patient protections.\n\n  That is what is important about this. If we look at it to a certain \nextent that virtually all content is taken from various State laws, \nthat is at least some form of congratulations to the States for their \nefforts. But they ought not to be rewarded by that great effort by the \npreemption where it is unnecessary.\n  The framers of the legislation that is before us as well as those of \nthe Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill have really worked hard to try to find a \nway to balance this out. I commend them for that. Their work does not \ngo unnoticed. I appreciate their efforts. But whether the standard is \nsubstantially equivalent as in the McCain-Kennedy Edwards bill or in \nthe Frist-Breaux bill consistent with or in a compromise that is under \nconsideration right now which says substantially compliant, the fact is \nthe States are going to have to come to the Federal Government with the \nplans and say, ``Please let us out'' or they will not be able to get \nout from under the requirements of this legislation unless they are \n``substantially equivalent to.''\n  ``Substantially equivalent to'' means the filings of these State \nprotections would have to be made by their Governors to the health and \nhuman services agency, and they will have to find out whether or not \nthe plans they are submitting are substantially equivalent--not whether \nthey are good or bad but whether they are substantially equivalent.\n  The theory is, if they are substantially equivalent, they are at \nleast as good as or better. But I don't know why we should engage \nbureaucracies in the Federal Government to try to look over the \nshoulders of the States that have seriously considered each and every \none of these protections.\n  Why are we doing it? Because we want to solve the problem that \nexists. Why should we try to solve a problem where there is no problem?\n  Under the Collins-Nelson effort, we give the States the opportunity \nto opt out if their plan is consistent with the purposes of this law.\n  It seems to me that we just simply make it clear that the States can \ncontinue to experiment. It is easy to suggest that if you take away the \nincentive of the State to experiment, the experimentation will either \nwither or will at least stagnate.\n  We want to continue to be sure that there are incentives for the \nStates to continue to experiment because I suggest to you right now \nthis is a dynamic process. Over the next several years, we are going to \nfind some better patient protections, and we are more likely going to \nfind those from the States than we are engaged in the body of this \nlegislative Chamber trying to find those answers.\n  I would prefer that experimentation continue. Then we can pick and \nchoose the best of the class in each case.\n  I spoke today with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy \nThompson, also a former Governor, and I asked him whether he thought \nhis agency could do this. He said simply that he doesn't think that it \ncan.\n  Let me add that I think that translates into, ``I can't unless I have \na larger bureaucracy of several dozens or more Federal bureaucrats and \nmore staff to look over and second-guess Governors and second-guess \nState legislatures.''\n  I asked if that is necessary. Quite frankly, I don't believe that it \nis. And with the stroke of the pen this bill can be amended so that it \nwon't become law so States can opt out and Governors will have the \nopportunity, as State legislatures, to decide what is the policy that \nwill work within their State.\n\n  We are looking for balance with this legislation. All of us want to \nbalance being able to have the right kind of protection for patients \nand the availability and affordability of insurance. The last thing we \nneed to do is to tip the balance one way or the other and end up with a \nmore severe problem than we are trying to solve with this effort.\n  I suggest to you that Thomas Jefferson might be looking at us at the \nmoment. Furthermore, I think he would be pleased if we had a dual \nsystem that recognized that this Federal bill and these Federal \nprotections would apply to the Federal plan, and we would allow the \nStates to continue as they have to protect the people at that level and \nto serve to provide experimentation and better ideas along the way and \npermit us to allow them to continue as they have to protect the \ncitizens.\n  I truly believe that government, when it is functioning at the local \nlevel, will function best and certainly can function better in this \narea than we can function.\n  We have already taken the step of exempting the Federal plans. Let us \nnot now make a mistake of applying what we need to permit for those \nState plans where there is already much protection and probably even \nmore protection.\n  Just this week, Delaware added additional patient protections. It \nseems to me that we ought to continue to support that. We ought not to \ndo anything that detours it or takes away the incentive for the States \nto continue to do as they have been doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his \ncomments. He has stated the case extremely well. He has had the \nexperience not only of being a Governor but of actually being a \ncommissioner of insurance.\n  I spent 5 years in State government overseeing a bureau of insurance. \nWe have confidence in our State's abilities to protect the rights of \ninsurance consumers. Indeed, the States have been way ahead of the \nFederal Government in this area.\n  I have shown my colleagues the charts of the numerous laws that the \nStates have passed during the past decade dealing with patients' \nrights. Each State has taken action on some of these consumer \nprotections. They have done so without any mandate from Washington. \nThey have done so because they want to make sure that in State \nregulated insurance plans these kinds of protections have been \nincluded.\n  In fact, the States have passed over 1,100 laws and regulations \ndealing with patient protections. So this is not a case where the \nStates have failed to act and the Federal Government has to come to the \nrescue. Rather, it is a case where the States have been far ahead of \nthe Federal Government. We have been slow to provide these kinds of \nState protections to federally regulated plans under ERISA. That should \nbe the primary focus of this legislation.\n  Both the Senator from Nebraska and I support a strong Patients' Bill \nof Rights. We want to make sure, in writing this legislation, we do not \nwipe out the good work of State governments.\n  Every single State has at least one law on the books dealing with \nportions\n\n[[Page S6971]]\n\nof the McCain-Kennedy bill. But no State law is identical to the \nprovisions in the McCain-Kennedy bill. States have dealt with these \nissues in different ways, depending on the negotiations between the \nState legislatures and their Governors, to meet the needs of that \nparticular State. There is no need to impose a one-size-fits-all \nFederal mandate on the States when they are already doing a good job.\n  When I was Commissioner of Professional and Financial Regulation in \nthe State of Maine, we had a very active bureau of insurance that lead \nthe way in proposing many reforms in insurance and health insurance \nthat were enacted by our State legislature. In fact, I believe that \nMaine was the first State in the Nation to pass legislation requiring \nautomatic continuity of coverage, renewability of insurance contracts. \nWe did that way back this the 1980s. We were ahead of the Federal \nGovernment by many years in this area.\n  Why should the State of Maine, which has been a leader in insurance \nregulation, have to go back and revisit its laws, recraft them, and \nrewrite them to meet the dictates of the McCain-Kennedy bill? That just \ndoes not make sense.\n  I think we should respect the work that has been done by the States \nin this area by honoring the laws that already exist and are on the \nbooks. We can encourage those few States--and they are just a handful--\nthat have not acted in some area to do so, and then to bring their plan \nto the Federal Government or to tell us why they chose not to.\n  Why does it make sense for a State such as Wyoming or Alaska, which \nhas virtually no managed care, to have to adopt a host of new laws that \nare irrelevant to their insurance market?\n  States have been strong in this area. They have worked hard to \nprotect their health care consumers. I think we should be assisting \nthem, providing incentives for them to act still further in this area, \nnot preempting their good work.\n  I yield the floor but reserve the remainder of the time on the \nCollins-Nelson amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time on this amendment.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I again commend my colleague from Maine who \nhas a wealth of experience in the regulation of insurance by having \ndealt with the professional agencies in her State. I suggest to you \nthat she knows exactly of which she speaks, that the States have been \nactive and have taken a very strong role in trying to protect the \npatients within their States.\n  The legislatures, the Governors, and the regulators have all worked \ntogether to try to create an environment in which patients are \nprotected. They have succeeded in doing that.\n  The one missing piece, though, is not in what the States have failed \nto do but in what the Government today at the Federal level, in \nCongress, is now trying to do, and that is to cover the federally \nexempted plans.\n  There would not be any discussion in this Chamber today about this \nbill if it had not been for the exemption granted in 1974, as a result \nof Congress' action to exempt certain plans from State laws.\n  There is no criticism of what the States have or have not done. There \nisn't any suggestion that the States have not been active or that the \nStates have not attempted to do a good job or that they have not done a \ngood job.\n  What we have is, overcoming an omission, taking care of something \nthat has not been done; that is, applying these protections to the \nFederal laws that have been exempt from State law. That is exactly what \nthis is about.\n  I certainly want to praise, again, Senator Kennedy, who has been \nextraordinarily tolerant of those of us who have had something to say \nabout his labor of love. He has been very tolerant. He has been very \nhelpful. And he has been very suggestive about solutions along the way. \nI want him to know that I personally appreciate that.\n  I am somewhat embarrassed to be suggesting that I might have some \narea of improvement, given the fact that he has worked on this for so \nlong. It is a fact that I come fresh. I said this morning, I feel like \nsomebody who came to the party late who now wants to rewrite the \ninvitation.\n  It seems to me that this bill is such that it can involve some \nadditional improvement. This is an area where I think it could be \ngreatly improved, by giving the States the opportunity to make their \ncase--not that they need to be treated as though their laws are \nsubstantially equivalent--but to give them the opportunity to come in \nand say: We have done this. We chose not to do this in our State after \ncarefully considering it. The Governor may have wanted it, but the \nlegislature, in its infinite wisdom, chose not to do it, or vice versa. \nIt works that way. That system ought to be continued.\n  It will serve the people of our great Nation very well: The people of \nSouth Dakota, the people of Maine, the people of Nebraska, the people \nof Massachusetts, the people everywhere, because it has served this \nNation so very well and has served the people so very well.\n  That is a minor modification. I think it has major implications, but \nit is a minor modification to say that the Governors can certify, and \nthey can seek to support that they have attempted to deal with these \nissues in their way, that they do not have to do it our way. That is \nthe difference.\n  I hope that my colleagues will see it that way and will find the \ncapacity to continue to recognize that States have done, are doing, and \ncan continue to do a good job. Even though there is an effort made to \nlimit the amount of the preemption, I believe this preemption simply \ngoes further than is necessary and further than we certainly would like \nto have it go.\n\n  That is what the National Conference of State legislatures have said \nand other State organizations have said. They would prefer to have less \npreemption and a better recognition of their efforts and a recognition \nthat they will continue to work to increase the level of patient \nprotection.\n  I yield to my colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I know we are about to vote shortly on \nanother amendment.\n  Let me just summarize this part of the debate--we will be resuming \nthe debate after the vote--by quoting a letter from the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners to Senator Nelson and myself. \nThey raise exactly the point that Senator Nelson and I have raised:\n\n       Members of the NAIC are also concerned about enforcement. \n     As you know as a former state regulator, if there is no \n     enforcement then there is no protection. States have \n     developed the infrastructure necessary to receive and process \n     consumer complaints in a timely fashion and ensure that \n     insurers comply with the laws. The federal government does \n     not have this capability, and [these] proposals [before the \n     Senate] do not provide any resources to federal agencies to \n     develop such capability. It has taken the Health Care \n     Financing Administration (HCFA) years to develop the \n     infrastructure required to enforce the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which included \n     only six basic provisions that most states had already \n     enacted. The proposed patient protection bills are far more \n     complicated than HIPAA and will require considerable \n     oversight.\n\n  If we pass the McCain-Kennedy bill without this amendment, we are \nholding forth a hollow promise to consumers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 820\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 5 o'clock has now arrived. Under \nthe previous order, the question now is on agreeing to the McCain \namendment No. 820.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask for the reporting of an amendment \nthat is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux], for himself, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Edwards proposes \n     an amendment numbered 830.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Edwards as well. \nIt attempts to deal with the question of whether States would be \nallowed to continue their programs dealing with Patients' Bill of \nRights or will it be dealt with on a Federal level.\n  We have tried to bring about an agreement between all of the parties \nand, to a large extent, we have been successful in the sense that we \nhave taken ideas and concepts that have been brought before this body \non previous occasions and implemented them in this amendment, a \nprovision that I think makes a great deal of sense.\n  A great deal of the credit should go to the staffs who have been \nnegotiating this amendment for several days in order to bring it to the \nattention of our colleagues.\n  Most of our colleagues recognize the need that States have addressed \nthis problem in a fashion that guarantees to patients that they will \nhave certain rights, and they should be allowed on a State level to run \nand manage these programs. Very few people would be suggesting the \nFederal Government knows the answers to all of these problems.\n  My State of Louisiana, for example, is a State that has already \nenacted into law some 39 guarantees under our State program, \nguaranteeing to patients they will be protected when they deal with \ntheir insurance companies and their managed care companies. They can be \nassured that these rights, in fact, are in place.\n  There are a number of other States that have done the same thing. The \npoint is that while we in Washington are passing a national Patients' \nBill of Rights, there are many States that have already done this. They \nwere ahead of the Federal Government. They did it before us, and these \nStates should be allowed to continue to run their State programs as \nthey see fit.\n  What we had suggested in the original Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nlegislation is that a State would not have their programs superseded by \nthe Federal Government if their plans were consistent with the Federal \nstatute.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from North Carolina, and \nthe Senator from Arizona took the approach that States could only allow \ntheir plans to continue if they were substantially equivalent with the \nFederal program.\n  Our staffs have come up with a realistic compromise, a compromise \nbetween those two standards, something that I think makes a great deal \nof sense.\n  The amendment at the desk tries to reach an agreement and compromise \nthat recognizes the role of the States is very important. Our language \nsimply says the State plan will not be superseded by the Federal \nGovernment when the State plan substantially complies with the patient \nprotection plan we have written on the Federal level.\n  Where do we get that language, ``substantially complies''? I think \nthat is very important. ``Substantially complies'' is the test that we \ninstituted when we passed the so-called SCHIP programs for children's \nhealth insurance. We basically said in that legislation the States \nwould be able to carry on their State programs for insuring children if \nit substantially complied with the guidelines of the Federal \nGovernment. That language is in the existing law of this Government; it \nis being interpreted by HHS, and they interact with the States now on \nthe ``substantially comply with'' test. They know how to handle it; \nthey know what it means; they have interacted with the States on this \nbasic test.\n  We take that language from that legislation and incorporate it into \nwhat we are doing with the Patients' Bill of Rights. Senator Jeffords \nwas a major author of that SCHIP program, and he will speak to this \nissue. We took the language, the test of ``substantially comply,'' and \nwe now have that in place in this amendment.\n  The decision on ``substantially comply,'' whether it is or is not \nbeing complied with, is a decision of the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, who will look at the State plans and make a determination as \nto whether or not they substantially comply with the Federal statute. \nThey have time lines within which they have to make that decision. I \nthink that is appropriate so they do not just languish in Washington. \nThey have a certain time period in which they have to make a decision \non a request by the State to be in substantial compliance with the \nFederal statute.\n  It is important to note we want the State to move in this direction. \nThere has to be an enforcement mechanism. As in the original Frist-\nBreaux-Jeffords bill and the original McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill, if \nthe States decide to do nothing, they will have to be in compliance \nwith the Federal standards on a patients' protection bill of rights.\n  The difference in our approach and my colleague from Maine and my \ncolleague and friend from Nebraska is, if States decide to take a walk \non this, if a State decides, we don't care what you are doing in \nWashington, folks, we are not going to pass any Patients' Bill of \nRights in this State, and we are not listening to anything you are \nsuggesting, their bill is defective in that there is no enforcement \nmechanism to get the States to move in a direction which is in the \ninterests of everyone in this country.\n  One defect in their amendment is that the only penalty the State can \npotentially suffer is to have grant money for this program terminated. \nTherefore, you could have a situation where the State simply thumbs its \nnose at the concept of a national patient protection right and does not \nenact anything if they don't want to, and yet I think that would be a \nserious mistake.\n  I think it is in the interests of this Nation to have a Patients' \nBill of Rights that can be enforced, and what we have offered as a \nreasonable compromise between the Kennedy bill and the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill I think is one that is balanced, it has been well thought \nout, and uses language that is already in Federal law as the \n``substantially comply'' test is already being enforced by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n  I encourage Members, after having a chance to look at what we have \noffered, to be supportive of this compromise effort.\n\n[[Page S6973]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will follow up on the Senator's explanation of what \nwe are trying to do, to make sure we have a less complicated situation \nwith respect to who is in charge and with whom to deal.\n  We have some problems, but the biggest problem, in what was the \nKennedy-Kassebaum bill called HIPAA, was we made the mistake of using \nsuch language that it ended up that many of the States declined to do \nanything, in which case the Federal Government, under the bill, came in \nand tried to do it. That has not worked out. This comes from experience \nin trying to recognize the States will do good a job and want to do a \ngood job and this is the best place to do it. We will do nothing that \nprevents that from continuing.\n  Senator Collins has worked hard on this over the year to make sure we \ncome up with something that will be signed into law and allow the \nPresident to sign it into law. The protections in the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords Patients' Bill of Rights apply to all 170 million Americans \ncovered by the private sector group health plans, individual health \nplans, and fully insured State and local government plans. It covers \nall of them.\n  At the same time, our legislation recognizes the Federal Government \ndoes not have all the answers. States need to play the primary role in \nenforcing the bill's requirements with respect to health insurers. \nHowever, if a State does not have the law or does not adopt the law \nsimilar to the new Federal requirements, Federal fallback legislation \nwill apply.\n  Our amendment strikes a new compromise under scope between the Frist-\nBreaux-Jeffords standard of ``consistent with'' and the much more \npreemptive standard in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill that states laws \n``be substantially equivalent to'' and ``as effective as'' the new \nFederal patient protections. This leaves a lot of indefiniteness in the \nsituation. The Breaux-Jeffords amendment uses a new standard that the \nState law would be certified if it ``substantially complies,'' meaning \nthat the State law has the same or similar features as the patient \nprotection requirements and has a similar effect.\n  Also, we require that the Secretary give deference--try your best to \nmake sure the State can do it if they want to do it --to the State's \ninterpretation of the State law involved and the compliance of the law \nwith the patient protection requirement. This amendment represents a \ntrue compromise. We believe it will make it less likely that the \nFederal Government will have to enforce these new standards and more \nlikely that it will get signed into law.\n  I think we have made a good improvement. I am hopeful it will be \naccepted. I urge its acceptance. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I will make a couple of comments. I \ncompliment my colleagues, Senator Collins and Senator Nelson, for \noffering an amendment which does recognize State roles in enforcement \nof insurance contracts. Unfortunately, I don't believe that is the case \nunder the Breaux-Jeffords amendment. We will have to make a decision: \nDo we believe States should regulate insurance? Or should the Federal \nGovernment? Do we believe one size fits all?\n  I understand there is a little change and there may be some \nimprovement over the underlying bill, but the improvement is very \nsmall. The underlying bill, the McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill, has \nlanguage in it that says all these protections that we are getting \nready to tell the States they have to do, the States have to have \n``substantially equivalent'' and ``as effective as'' the standards we \nare getting ready to pass in the bill.\n  I think the Senator from Maine said there are 1,100 State \nprotections--State protections dealing with ER, State protections \ndealing with OB/GYN, State protections dealing with clinical trials, \nand so on. Almost none of the States has identical protections as what \nwe are getting ready to mandate.\n  Unfortunately, the language that now is being talked about may be an \nimprovement. Instead of ``substantially equivalent,'' it says \n``substantially compliant'' with the Federal standard. ``Substantially \ncompliant'' was written under the SCHIP program, and that was, if they \ndid this, they would get a pot of money. That is a little different \nscenario than coming up with: States, you must do this or we will \nregulate your State insurance--even though the States have always done \nit. Historically, the Federal Government has never regulated State \ninsurance.\n  Under the McCain-Kennedy bill or now under the Breaux-Jeffords \nsubstitute, you are still going to have the Federal Government telling \nthe States, comply with what we are telling you substantially or else \nwe will supersede your regulation and the Health Care Finance \nAdministration is going to do it.\n  There are a couple of problems with that. HFCA can't do it. Maybe \nnobody cares. Maybe we should just go ahead and pass this. We might \njust pass it and laugh at it because I absolutely know, with certainty, \nHFCA can't do it.\n  The Secretary of HHS, Secretary Thompson, basically made that \nstatement before the Finance Committee on June 19. HFCA is already \noverloaded. They haven't even enforced the Medicare rules we passed \nyears ago. They are not even enforcing HIPAA that we passed several \nyears ago.\n  Under HIPAA that is the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that deals with \nportability--there are five States that have not complied. We have \ntestimony that HFCA is not enforcing that. They are supposed to. We \npassed a couple of other bills. Guess what. HFCA is still not enforcing \nthose. There is one dealing with mental parity. They have never \nenforced it. They never have. They are well aware they are not \nenforcing it; that they are not compliant. We have records of that. I \nwill submit a bunch of these for the Record tomorrow. HFCA cannot do \nit.\n  Yet what are we doing? We are getting ready to say if it is not \nsubstantially compliant with the new Federal regulations, HCFA is going \nto come running at the charge and enforce these regulations, which they \nwere not doing.\n  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners basically says \nthe same thing. These are State insurance commissioners who work on \nthis issue full time. They are not part time. I should not say we are \npart-time Senators. As Senators, we are working part time on regulating \ninsurance and we are getting ready to mandate a lot of things to the \nStates they will not be able to do, or we are getting ready to say \nStates do it the way we tell you to do it or the Federal Government is \ngoing to come charging in and take over. I want everyone to know that \nis what we are doing and even ``substantially compliant'' is going to \nhave a State takeover.\n  Here is one of their paragraphs. They say:\n\n       Members of the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners are also concerned about enforcement. As you \n     know --\n\n  And this letter is written to Senator Collins--\n\n     as a former State regulator, if there is no enforcement, then \n     there is no protection. States have developed the \n     infrastructure necessary to receive and process consumer \n     complaints in a timely fashion and ensure that insurers \n     comply with the law. The Federal Government does not have \n     this capability and the proposals do not provide any \n     resources to Federal agencies to develop such capability. It \n     is taking the Health Care Finance Administration years to \n     develop the infrastructure required to enforce the health \n     insurance portability and accountability act, HIPAA, which \n     included only 6 basic provisions that most States already had \n     enacted. The proposed patient protection bills are far more \n     complicated than HIPAA, and will require considerable \n     oversight.\n\n  HIPAA had a few patient protections that almost all States already \nhad, a few States still do not have, and HFCA has yet to really enforce \nthose protections. Now we are going to give dozens of protections and \nhave HFCA determine whether or not the States are substantially \ncompliant with our new protections.\n  I will give an example. In the State of Delaware, they are in the \nprocess of passing a patient protection bill. They have an emergency \nroom provision. In the emergency room provision that the State of \nDelaware is passing, they don't have poststabilization care included in \ntheir provision. We do, under this bill. This bill requires ambulance\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\ncoverage. Guess what. The State of Delaware did not include ambulance, \nfor whatever reason. So we are going to tell the State of Delaware, a \nbureaucrat at HFCA is going to say: State of Delaware, you did not do \nit good enough. Your legislature is going to have to go back, pass a \nbill, have the Governor sign it, have some expansion to make sure that \nyour ER provision is as good as the one we are getting ready to \nmandate.\n\n  I could go on and on.\n  There is an OB/GYN patient protection that basically has unlimited \naccess to OB/GYN and gynecologists. Great. Guess what. The protection \nwe have given to beneficiaries, patients in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan, gives one visit. It is not nearly as aggressive.\n  As a matter of fact, that points out something that maybe a lot of \npeople have missed about all these patient protections. I have heard \ncountless people say we want these protections applied to all \nAmericans. I will inform my colleagues, we did not apply them to \nFederal employees. We do not provide these protections we are getting \nready to mandate on every private sector plan in America. We forgot to \ninclude Federal employees. We forgot to include Medicare beneficiaries. \nWe forgot to include low-income people such as those on Medicaid. We \nforgot to include people who work at the Department of Defense. We \nforgot to include veterans. We forgot to include Indians, who are under \nIndian Health Care.\n  All these patient protections--everybody said we want those to apply \nto everybody. They apply to the private sector, but we did not include \nthe public sector. Did we just sort of forget that, or are we afraid \nmaybe that would cost too much money? We are going to give all these \ngreat patient protections and basically have a Federal takeover of \nState-regulated insurance unless the States are substantially compliant \nwith it or, in other words, States, you do as we tell you or the \nFederal Government is going to take charge. Can Federal employees sue \nthe Federal Government? The answer is no. Can a military officer who \nhappens to be serving overseas, or maybe in the United States, and they \nhave something go wrong and they have poor care, can they sue the \nFederal Government? The answer is no.\n  Are they entitled to the patient protections that are being mandated \non every private sector plan in America? The answer is no.\n  So there are some things that are really wrong. I think one of the \nthings that is wrong is saying we are going to have the one-size-fits-\nall Federal Government supersede the States. States, you are \nsubstantially compliant with what we tell you to do or else we are \ngoing to take over.\n  I have had the pleasure of chairing the conference last year, where \nwe negotiated patient protections. I negotiated them with my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts and other Democrats. We came up with a \nbasic agreement on most of the patient protections. But we never agreed \nwhether or not they should supersede the patient protection laws that \nare in the States. I would never agree with that and I still will not \nagree with it.\n  For whatever reason, I fail to see, when you have 44 States, as the \nSenator from Maine has shown, that have ER protections in their \nStates--I fail to see that we can write an emergency room provision \nthat is so much better than every State, that we know best what should \nbe in Maine or Oklahoma or the State of Washington or in Massachusetts, \nwhat should be in the ER provision in those States.\n\n  I really do not like the idea of having a bureaucrat at HFCA \ndetermining whether or not those laws are substantially compliant and \nif that bureaucrat determines they are not substantially compliant, \nthen they have to rewrite their law.\n  There are legislators who were elected in the various States. The \ninsurance commissioners work with these laws and the application of \nthose laws and the enforcement of the laws day in and day out. I doubt \nwe have the infinite wisdom, when we are coming up with mandated \nprovisions, to know we should supersede all those States.\n  I do not doubt there are a lot of patient protections in the States \nthat do a much better job than what we have done on the Federal level. \nI don't doubt there are State protections that are not as aggressive \nand/or not as expensive as that with which we are getting ready to \nmandate that they be in substantial compliance.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support the Nelson-Collins amendment. \nI think it is an excellent amendment. It is one that has been well \nthought out. It is one that is supported by two of our colleagues who \nhad enormous experience in the insurance field. Both Senator Collins \nand Senator Nelson worked as insurance commissioners in their States. \nThey worked at those jobs for years. They know what they are talking \nabout. They know the Federal Government cannot enforce it. They know \nthe Federal Government should not regulate insurance within the States.\n  Unfortunately, that is what we are getting ready to do. So this is a \nmost important amendment, and I urge my colleagues to use a little \ncommon sense. If we end up passing this amendment and, heaven forbid, \nshould it become law, I will just make a little prediction. Two years \nfrom now we will be back here saying you know what, the States are not \nin compliance. They were not substantially compliant, but HFCA could \nnot tell them that. Or if HCFA told them that, they said they still \ncouldn't be in compliance and so you have a lot of States that are \ntheoretically not in compliance. But the Federal Government couldn't \nreally regulate it anyway. So did they get any additional protection? \nNo. They have a verbal assurance: Here is a bill; you are supposed to \nhave this protection. But it is not regulated by the State and it is \nnot enforced by the Federal Government because the Federal Government \ncould not do it.\n  Tommy Thompson, Secretary of HHS, and HHS enforcement, they have \nthousands of employees. They spend billions of dollars and they still \ncan't do it.\n  They still can't do it. They couldn't do it if we gave it to them. I \nhope we don't give it to them. You didn't actually extend patient \nprotection. What you give is kind of a false protection. It is not \nreal. You have a whole lot of confusion. Oh, wait a minute. The State \nhas been doing this for 40 or 50 years. Now the Federal Government is \nsupposed to be doing it, and they can't do it. There is no real patient \nprotection in the first place. Maybe it makes politicians feel good if \nwe are telling the States to do this. I sure hope they do it. What is \nthe remedy if they don't do it? The Federal Government is going to take \nover. That is not a very good remedy if the Federal Government can't do \nit, especially since the Federal Government should not do it.\n  I want to again compliment my friends and colleagues, Senator Collins \nand Senator Nelson, for offering an outstanding amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no, regrettably, on the Breaux-Jeffords \namendment.\n  I think ``substantially compliant'' may be a tad better than \n``substantially equivalent,'' but not much. It is still a Federal \ntakeover. It still has Federal enforcement. It still has HCFA making a \ndetermination whether or not you are substantially compliant, and that \nis not a good solution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Collins-Nelson amendment. That \nwould be a giant step, and one which I might mention that Governors \naround the Nation are going to wake up to. They have been asleep. But \nGovernors around the Nation, Democrats and Republicans, who want to \nmaintain State control and regulation over insurance are going to wake \nup to what we are doing one of these days and they are going to be \ncoming up saying: What are you doing? Congress, you can't regulate \ninsurance. You haven't been doing that. You don't know how to do it. \nWhat in the world do you think you are doing?\n  We are going to hear from them. I would venture to say that \nDemocratic as well as Republican Governors are going to be outraged \nshould this provision invade the scope, preempting the State, and \nmandating to the States that the Federal Government knows best when it \ncomes to patient protection--and not even giving real credibility to \nwhat the States have already done; not giving them a grandfather. They \nhave already enacted legislation dealing with those particular patient \nprotections. The Collins-Nelson amendment grandfathers States that have\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\ndone patient protections. We should recognize what they are doing and \ngive them credit for it--not try to supersede it with a Government-\nknows-best solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise in support of the Collins-\nNelson amendment. I thank them for their foresight and pointing out to \nthis entire body that Washington doesn't always know best. In this \nparticular case, they are not only saying Washington does not always \nknow best but Washington is incapable of doing the job that this bill \ngives them to do, even if Washington knew best.\n  This is a very important amendment. The people who are proposing this \nbill ought to look at the overburdened responsibilities that the Health \nCare Financing Administration already has and it is not able to do.\n  It is from that point that I want to speak about my support for the \nCollins-Nelson amendment.\n  I want to make very clear that, as most of my colleagues, I believe \nthat any patient protection we pass must be meaningful and enforceable. \nBut the provisions that the Collins-Nelson amendment deals with, and \nthat they strike and change, are the provisions of the bill that \ndelegates most of its new enforcement responsibilities to an agency \nthat is one of the most overburdened bureaucracies in Washington, DC.\n  The Washington bureaucrats who work there are not going to be able to \ntake the action necessary to give patients the protections that are \ndetermined by the authors of this amendment they ought to have, and \nthat we all would agree ought to be there. But it can be done under \nState supervision, and it can be done much better and much more \nexpeditiously than it can be done through the Health Care Financing \nAdministration.\n  It is the difference between going to Des Moines, IA, to get the \nprotections or coming to the Baltimore headquarters of the Health Care \nFinancing Administration--because, historically, this agency has been \nalready slow in publishing regulations, and it lacks in its enforcement \nof existing Federal laws that we passed putting responsibilities on its \nback.\n  Of course, I have high hopes that our new Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Governor Thompson, and the new Administrator of the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, Tom Scully, will turn things \naround. While I hope that and I believe that, I don't expect a radical \nchange is going to be necessary for the Health Care Financing \nAdministration to carry out the responsibilities that the authors of \nthis legislation want them to do, nor that it will be radical enough to \nchange overnight to get the job done of administering this portion of \ntheir bill the way it should be.\n  At this time, shouldering the Health Care Financing Administration \nwith a task of enforcing broad new Federal patient protections is \nclearly inappropriate.\n  Our new Secretary and Administrator have walked into myriad backlog \nregulations, hundreds of unanswered letters, and burdensome internal \npolicies that hinder already efficient and effective work that the \ntaxpayers expect to be done by this agency.\n  Just last week at a hearing we were having on agency reforms before \nthe Senate Finance Committee that deals with this issue, we had \nSecretary Thompson and Administrator Scully pleading with us to keep \nnew tasks away from the agency so that the catchup work on these \nexisting responsibilities can be done.\n  I quote Secretary Thompson on that very point. He used the new name, \nthe Center for Medicare Services. He said:\n\n       The Center for Medicare Services right now is overloaded \n     with HIPAA and with the privacy rules and regulations, \n     with Medicare and Medicaid, and SCHIP, and so on.\n\n  Rather than listing all of the other responsibilities, he said:\n\n       I do not think we can really take on any more \n     responsibilities.\n\n  That is the Secretary who has the responsibility of carrying out the \nlaws that we already passed, along with the regulations that have to be \nwritten to enforce those laws. He would like to get those out of the \nway before he gets any additional new responsibilities.\n  I want to take just a few minutes to share some important examples of \nhow this agency in the past has been unable to meet its existing \nobligations.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act. That is the act that Secretary Thompson referred to \nas HIPAA. We passed it. To date, the agency is over 3 years behind on \nimplementing major provisions of that 1996 act.\n  The agency is almost 2 years behind in implementing a fee schedule \nfor ambulance services that was mandated in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997. There were several more mandates in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 that have had no regulations published at all, such as how \nregional carriers will process clinical laboratory claims, and how \ndurable medical equipment suppliers must comply with the surety bond \nrequirements.\n  And get this: In 1986, Congress passed very sweeping legislation to \nmake sure that the delivery of quality care in the nursing homes of \nAmerica, and the agency took 8 years, from the date of enactment, to \npublish the enforcement regulations on the nursing home laws.\n\n  Even more egregious, there are no final regulations published for the \nMedicaid Drug Rebate Program, a program enacted into law over 10 years \nago.\n  So the list goes on and on. I hope you can see this is an agency that \nis already overloaded and is seriously behind on many Federal mandates \nCongress has put in place over the last decade; and in the case of \nnursing home laws, a decade and a half ago.\n  We cannot expect, nor should we expect, that this agency is capable \nof enforcing patients' protections under this legislation.\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services has already told us they \nare working 24/7 to improve operations and responsiveness for their \nexisting programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n  In the end, it is the patient who is going to suffer when patient \nprotection regulations get delayed or are improperly enforced or, in \nsome instances, such as the nursing home laws, for 8 years, not \nenforced at all.\n  That is exactly what will happen under the Kennedy-McCain bill where \nthe sole responsibility of enforcing and implementing patient \nprotection certification falls on the agency that formerly was called \nthe Health Care Financing Administration.\n  I cannot support the Kennedy-McCain bill with these meaningless \nenforcement provisions. In fact, it would be irresponsible to do so \nwhen the agency itself has made very clear to the public that they will \nnot be able to handle any new patient protection mandates.\n  I do not presume that Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain meant for \nthis provision of their legislation to be meaningless in its \nenforcement. But, as a practical matter, if HCFA is already overloaded, \nand if they are already not writing the regulations for legislation \nthat has been passed over the past 10 years, the ultimate result of \npassing this bill this way--putting this responsibility on the Health \nCare Financing Administration--is that it will not be enforced any more \nthan the nursing home laws, which as I said were left unenforced for 8 \nyears.\n  So I have come to the conclusion that the Collins-Nelson amendment is \nthe right thing to do. Why fool the American people? Washington \nbureaucrats do not always know best. And we, as Congressmen, if we have \nnot lost touch with the grassroots of America, and if we exercise a \nlittle common sense, we ought to be able to show to a majority of this \nbody--and for a majority of this body to understand--that if HCFA \ncannot carry out the law, if they have not carried out a lot of \nmandates of the Congress of the United States in the past decade, why \nwould you put more responsibilities on their back? If you want patient \nprotection, then let it be done where it can be done, and that is in \nthose States that have meaningful enforcement laws already for patient \nprotection, because this amendment allows States to maintain the hard-\nfought patient protections they have put in place for their own \ncitizens. And the amendment encourages States to develop even stronger \nprotections.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this approach, one that recognizes \nthe\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\nvital role that States play in tailoring patient protections to best \nmeet the needs of their respective citizens.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the other side allowing us this opportunity to state our \ncase at the beginning because of some important considerations we have.\n  I particularly congratulate the Senator from Maine, Susan Collins, \nfor her tremendous efforts on this entire Patients' Bill of Rights. On \nany issue in which she gets involved, you will find that she studies it \nto a greater depth than anyone. She does additional research; she gets \nall of the help she can; she gets to the point where she understands \nwhat she is doing; and then she works with others to make it better. It \ndoes not happen a lot around here. But she is one dedicated Senator who \nis always willing to look at a better idea.\n  She has teamed up, in this particular instance, with Senator Nelson, \na neighbor of mine, from Nebraska. One of the reasons this is an \ninteresting team is that they have both been State insurance \ncommissioners. They both understand the State side of this. They both \nunderstand what is in the bill. I would not want to imply that \neverybody does not, but these are two people who absolutely understand \nwhat is going on in the bill. They have teamed up and said there is a \nway that we can provide the protections, that we can get the States \ninvolved, and that we can enlarge the scope. They put it together. I \ncongratulate them for their tremendous efforts.\n  For 2 weeks, I have been saying that on 80 percent of this bill both \nsides agree. On eighty percent of it we agree. It is that other 20 \npercent where there are some philosophical differences.\n  I have seen--both in legislating that I did before I got to the \nSenate and since I have arrived--that one of the keys to passing \nlegislation is to put a good title on the bill. That is something we \nagree on 100 percent: The Patients' Bill of Rights is a great title. \nWhat you do with that can be an abuse of the title. And on 20 percent \nof this bill, there is an abuse of that title.\n  There are some substantial changes that need to be made. One of those \nis, who is going to administer it? There are two very different \nphilosophies involved in the administration of this bill. One side \nsays: Washington knows best. Bring it back to Washington. If the \nbureaucracy isn't big enough now, we will make it big enough. And we \nwill put enough dollars in it that we will be able to solve it.\n  For anybody in America who has ever had to work with the Washington \nbureaucracy, picture the difference between Washington and your local \nand State governments.\n  When you call Washington, have you ever gotten to talk to the same \nperson twice? That means that when you call in today with a problem \nthat you have to explain, and then when they do not take care of it--\nbecause they really do not have the involvement that they do if they \nknow you--you have to call them back. Well, you would not know by \ntomorrow; you would not know by next week. You would be lucky to know \nby next month. But next month, when you are sure Washington has not \nsolved your problem, you have to call again. And I guarantee you, you \nwill talk to a different person who will say: What is your problem? And \nafter you have gone through all of the explanation again, they will \nsay: We will get back to you on it. And you are going to spend another \nmonth getting back to them on it.\n  Contrast that with State and local calls that you have had to make. \nYou can almost always talk to the same person again, so the problem \nthat you discussed yesterday they still remember today. And you do not \nhave to wait a month for the decision because they are doing the job \nefficiently.\n  There are various ranges of bureaucracies and efficiencies in \nWashington, also. This bill has chosen to give the jurisdiction to that \nagency that is doing the poorest job. Don't believe me. Don't believe \nthe debate. What I ask you to do is call your doctor and ask them what \nthey think of HCFA. Call it HCFA; it is the Health Care Financing \nAdministration. But they call it HCFA because that is a four-letter \ncuss word to them. You will find that your doctor thinks HCFA is a cuss \nword. That is how impressed they are with the administration of this \nagency, the one to which we are about to turn over all of the \njurisdiction for the problems you have worked with your State on \nbefore. We are going to take what the States have been doing, and doing \nwell for over 50 years, where there are people you can talk to every \nday, and we are going to say, no, you are not doing a good enough job \nbecause there is some bureaucrat in Washington who decided that they \nknow better and they want to handle your problem.\n\n  Find out how efficient HCFA is. I am certain under the new \nadministration that it will be more effective, but it will be a long \ntime recovering from the problems it has right now. Yes, we can throw \nmore money at it. Is that where you want your tax money to go?\n  Right now, your States are paying for that. We are going to duplicate \nand supersede, without saving you a dime and in fact costing you more.\n  Does the Federal Government do a better job? One of the things I have \nbeen working on since I have been here is OSHA. OSHA allows two \ndifferent processes. One is State plan States. That is where the States \ndo the work. The other is the Federal plan. That is where the Federal \nGovernment takes care. I can tell you that the accidents are less in \nthe State plan States for just the reasons I mentioned before. A \nbureaucracy operating out of Washington, trying to handle the whole \ncountry as a one-size-fits-all problem can't do the same job as the \npeople at home in your State.\n  What are some of the things they have to handle? I will tell you, the \nnew reason that HCFA is going to become a bigger cuss word is called \nHIPAA. This has to do with portability of insurance. The change in some \nof my phone calls this week has been calls from doctors and hospitals. \nThey weren't concerned about a Patients' Bill of Rights yet. They were \nconcerned about the HIPAA privacy rules. Ask your doctors and your \nhospitals what they think about that.\n  Privacy is important to all of us, but they have managed to muff that \none. The same agency that people are calling me and complaining about \nright now is related to where we are going to turn over, under the \nopposing amendment, all of the workload.\n  This week and last week you heard about a number of amendments. One \nof the things I am very proud of is that all of those amendments were \ndifferent solutions that needed to be done on this 20 percent of the \nbill where there is a problem, different approaches. It was not the \nsame amendment time after time after time, which we have seen here \nbefore. It was different approaches to different problems in the bill. \nThere are about six problems that we have to get solved, that we have \nto get some consensus on in order to have a good bill, one that matches \nup to the title of Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  What you are seeing here, of course, is us trying to solve in the \ncommittee of the whole what could have been done in committee. You are \nseeing more amendments here than what you might see on the floor with \nthe bill. But that is because normally we have the committee meetings \nwhere we get to put forward lots of amendments in a smaller group and, \ntherefore, be able to get them decided with less discussion because \nthere are fewer people.\n  I mentioned some phone calls. I have to add that I am starting to get \nsome other phone calls now which are from my school districts, \nwondering how this bill is going to affect them. They know we just \nfinished the education bill and that there might be some more money \nunder the education bill for them. They are asking: But we provide \ninsurance to our employees; is this going to suck up all that money, \nand how liable will we be?\n\n  Again, I congratulate the Senator from Maine and the Senator from \nNebraska for the tremendous work they have done in coming up with a \nsolution--one we talked about last year--on which there was a lot of \nconsensus. There was a lot more give, a lot more understanding, and \neven people supporting this one who seem to think HCFA is a better \nsolution now.\n  One of the groups supporting the Collins amendment that I want to \npoint out is the National Conference of State Legislatures. They \nrecognize the value of the State handling these insurance problems.\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the Record after my \nremarks a letter from the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Among the handful of principles that are fundamental to any \ntrue protection for health care consumers, probably the most important \nis allowing States to continue in their role as the primary regulator \nof health insurance. It is because of my commitment to preserving \nexisting consumer protections that I am glad to be a cosponsor of the \nCollins-Nelson amendment. Their amendment recognizes a principle that \nhas been recognized and respected for more than 50 years.\n  In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a clear \nacknowledgment by the Federal Government that States are indeed the \nmost appropriate regulators of health insurance. It was acknowledged \nthat States are better able to understand their consumers' needs and \nconcerns. It was determined that States are more responsive, more \neffective enforcers of consumer protections.\n  As recently as last year, this fact was reaffirmed by the General \nAccounting Office. GAO testified before the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee saying:\n\n       In brief, we found that many states have responded to \n     managed care consumers' concerns about access to health care \n     and information disclosure. However, they often differ in \n     their specific approaches, in scope and in form.\n\n  Wyoming has its own unique set of health care needs and concerns. \nEvery State does. For example, despite our elevation, we don't need the \nmandate regarding skin cancer that Florida has on the books. My \nfavorite illustration of just how crazy a nationalized system of health \ncare mandates would be comes from my own time in the Wyoming \nLegislature. It is about a mandate I voted for and still support today. \nUnlike Massachusetts or California, for example, in Wyoming we have few \nhealth care providers, and their numbers virtually dry up as you head \nout of town. We don't have a single city with competing hospitals. So \nwe passed an ``any willing provider'' law that requires health plans to \ncontract with any provider in Wyoming who is willing to do so.\n  While that may sound strange to my ears in any other context, it was \nthe right thing for Wyoming to do. But I know it is not the right thing \nfor Massachusetts or California. I wouldn't dream of asking them to \nshoulder the same kind of mandate for our sake when we can simply, \nresponsibly apply it within our borders. That is what States have been \ndoing with the 1,100 laws they have passed dealing with patients' bills \nof rights.\n  What is even more alarming to me is that Wyoming has opted not to \nenact health care laws that specifically relate to HMOs. But that is \nbecause there are ostensibly no HMOs in Wyoming. There is one which is \nvery small. It is operated by a group of doctors who live in town, not \na nameless, faceless insurance company. Yet the sponsors of the \nunderlying bill insist they know what is best for everybody. So they \nwant to require the State of Wyoming to enact and actively enforce--\nthat is what the opposing amendment does, enact and actively enforce--\nwhat they say is the right thing for our State. They want to regulate \nunder 15 new laws a style of health insurance that doesn't even exist \nin our State.\n  It requires States to forsake laws that they have already passed \ndealing with patient protections included in the bill, if they are not \nthe same as the new Federal standard. The technical language in the \nbill reads ``substantially equivalent,'' ``does not prevent the \napplication of,'' and under the process of certifying these facts with \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, the State will have to \nprove that their laws are ``substantially equivalent'' or some other \nvariation of words. There are a whole bunch of words that could be used \nthere.\n  There could be a whole series of amendments to undermine the Collins \namendment. This is one of them.\n  The proponents of this language--whichever version you care to look \nat, except for Collins--say that it won't undo existing State laws that \nare essentially comparable, but that isn't what their bill requires. \nUnder either amendment--the bill or the Breaux-Jeffords amendment--they \nare going to force States to change laws that they have already \nreviewed, that they believe already work in their States.\n  Is it that the proponents aren't overly concerned with the \nimplementation of the law versus being able to say that their bill \nmeets the political test of covering all Americans, regardless of \nexisting, meaningful protections that State legislatures have enacted? \nIf the laws just have to be comparable, why don't they use that phrase? \nI will get into this issue in more detail as the debate proceeds. I \nbelieve we can compromise. I don't think this is the compromise. I like \nthe language of the Collins amendment. The only hard proof that we have \nright now is that States are, by and large, good regulators, while the \nFederal Government has done a lousy job. The General Accounting Office \nhas been reporting to us that since we passed the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act in 1996. And that is the ``consumer \nprotection enforcement'' mechanism around which the bill before us is \nwritten.\n  Wyoming currently requires that the plans provide information to \npatients about coverage, copays and so on, much as we would do in this \nbill; a ban on gag clauses between doctors and patients; and an \ninternal appeals process to dispute denied claims. I am hopeful that \nthe State will soon enact an external appeals process, too. This is a \nlist of patient protections that a person in any kind of health plan \nneeds, which is why the State has acted. But requiring Wyoming to enact \na series of additional laws that don't have any bearing on consumers in \nour State is an unbelievable waste of the citizens' legislature's time \nand resources.\n  As consumers, we should be downright angry at how some of our elected \nofficials are responding to our concerns about the quality of our \nhealth care and the alarming problem of the uninsured in this country.\n  We are talking about driving up the price of insurance and driving \npeople out of the insurance market. I keep mentioning that insurance in \nthis country is provided on a voluntary basis. We have had amendments \nthat dealt with small businesses to see if they could get any kind of \nrelief. Most of them are strained to the maximum. The smaller your \nbusiness, the higher your potential risk, so the higher the rates you \npay. Insurance is risk protection. We discriminate against the smaller \nbusinesses on rates because it is actuarially more difficult to \ncalculate that.\n  Under this bill, we have had some opportunities to provide some \nrelief to those small businessmen. It hasn't happened. They have been \nignored. I will be bringing an amendment that will deal with the large \nbusinesses. I almost exclusively work with small businesses. Tomorrow, \nI will be bringing one that deals with the big self-insured, self-\nadministered companies to see if there is going to be any hope of \nrelief for those people who provide the best insurance in this country.\n  Mr. President, we will be committing two fouls against consumers if \nwe do not adopt the Collins-Nelson amendment. The first would be to \neliminate all meaningful patient protections that are not exactly like \nthe Federal law. Second would be to put in enforcement responsibilities \nwith the agency that has already said it can't do the job. Add to that \nthe third foul that the rest of the bill prices millions of people out \nof health insurance and we have done anything but hit a home run for \npatients.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the valuable experience and wisdom \nof the amendment sponsors, as well as the urging of the National \nCouncil of State Legislatures. Think about the divergence of \nphilosophy. Do you want your health care to be one size fits all in \nWashington, determined by HIPAA and HCFA, or do you still want your \nStates to be involved? Do you want your States to have the control? Do \nyou want your States to be able to continue the kind of service they \nhave been providing through your State legislatures that can make \ndecisions based on your State and your needs?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ben Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Nelson: On behalf of the \n     National Conference of State Legislatures, I would like to \n     take this opportunity to commend you for authoring an \n     amendment to S. 1052, the pending Patients' Bill of Rights \n     legislation. Your amendment recognizes the important work \n     states have done regarding the regulation of managed care \n     entities and supports the continued role of states in the \n     regulation of health insurance.\n       The amendment substantially addresses concerns we expressed \n     in our recent letter to you and your colleagues. In that \n     letter we urged you to: (1) grandfather existing state \n     patient and provider protection laws; and (2) provide a \n     transition period between the enactment of federal \n     legislation and the effective date of the Act to provide each \n     state an opportunity to preserve their authority to regulate \n     managed care entities. This amendment also addresses our \n     concerns regarding the adequacy of the federal infrastructure \n     to enforce the patient and provider protections established \n     in the bill. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the \n     proposed amendment recognizes that insurance markets differ \n     among the states and a ``one size fits all'' approach may \n     have adverse results among states and within regions of a \n     state. This amendment permits a state to certify adverse \n     impact and head off disruption in its insurance market.\n       NCSL supports this amendment. States are best situated to \n     provide oversight and enforcement of the patient and provider \n     protections established in the legislation. The record of the \n     states is strong. We are looking for an approach that \n     supports the traditional role of states in the regulation of \n     insurance and that recognizes the differences in state \n     insurance markets and provides a mechanism for states to \n     protect those markets.\n       NCSL supports passage of Patients' Bill of Rights \n     legislation that makes a promise that can be fulfilled. We \n     believe state oversight and enforcement is an integral part \n     of ensuring fulfillment of the promise and we look forward to \n     continuing to work with you to develop legislation that will \n     improve the quality of health care without adversely \n     affecting access to care.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Garnet Coleman,\n\n                                   Texas House of Representatives,\n                                  Chairman, NCSL Health Committee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will be brief because I see the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts also desires to speak. First, I thank my colleague \nand friend from Wyoming for his extraordinarily generous comments and \nalso for his excellent statement. As a former State senator, he has a \ngreat deal of experience in this area. As a businessman, he knows what \nit is to provide health insurance and to try to provide good benefits \nfor his employees. I am grateful for his support.\n  Very briefly, I want to respond to a couple of comments that have \nbeen made tonight. The former chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley, talked about the burden on HCFA. I think this is very \nimportant because the McCain-Kennedy bill--and, unfortunately, the \namendment offered by my friend from Louisiana continues this problem--\nis expecting that HCFA is somehow going to be able to step into the \nrole of insurance regulator, which is something the States have \nperformed well for more than 50 years.\n  Look at what would be required under the Breaux-Jeffords amendment. \nLet me read you one part of the burden on the Secretary under the \nprovisions called ``Petition Process'':\n\n       Effective on the date on which the provisions of this Act \n     become effective, as provided for in section 401, a group \n     health plan, health insurance issuer, participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee may submit a petition to the \n     Secretary for an advisory opinion as to whether or not a \n     standard or requirement under a State law applicable to the \n     plan, issuer, participant, beneficiary, or enrollee that is \n     not the subject of a certification under this subsection, is \n     superseded under subsection (a)(1) because such standard or \n     requirement prevents the application of a requirement of this \n     title.\n\n  In other words, this sets up a process by which the Secretary of HHS \nis going to be inundated with requests for advisory opinions from \nanyone who is covered under a State-regulated insurance plan who wants \nto know whether or not a certain provision of that particular State's \nlaws is superseded by the Federal law. This is just not workable. There \nis just no way that HCFA is going to be able to take over these \nresponsibilities.\n  My friend from Louisiana drew the analogy with the State Children's \nInsurance Plans. I am very proud of that program. I was one of the \noriginal cosponsors of the legislation that the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Utah proposed to create this \nimportant program to expand access to insurance to low-income children. \nBut these are not analogous situations. We are not talking about a \nfederally funded health program. We are not talking about that. We are \ntalking about the regulation of health insurance.\n  The Federal Government is not providing funds for this. The Federal \nGovernment is not involved in this traditionally. This is entirely \ndifferent from pointing to a Federal program that happens to be \nadministered by the States but which is federally funded where, of \ncourse, it makes sense for the Federal Government to set standards. So \nit is two entirely different matters.\n  Finally, I make the point that one should look--and I encourage the \nSenator from Louisiana to look--at the provisions of his State's laws \non consumer and patient protections. They are not identical to the \nstandards in the McCain-Kennedy bill. For example, when you look at the \nLouisiana law dealing with emergency room access, we find that \nLouisiana has a law, but that it is crafted in a different way than the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill. So now we have to decide, is it substantially \ncompliant with the provisions of the bill, which would be the standard \nthe Senator from Louisiana would have? It differs in some respects--on \nreimbursements, on how much is covered, on poststabilization care.\n  If the State of Louisiana crafted a law dealing with emergency room \naccess, as they have, why should we second-guess that law? Why should \nwe substitute our judgment for the judgment of the good people of the \nState of Louisiana?\n  I remind my colleagues that the States have not fallen down on the \njob. There are more than 1,100 patient protections out there far beyond \nthe confines of this bill.\n  Unfortunately, while the Breaux-Jeffords amendment is an improvement \nover the underlying bill, it is still fatally flawed. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on the Breaux-Jeffords amendment and yes on the \nCollins-Nelson amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have great respect for my friend and \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Collins. Senator Collins is a member of \nour Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. As always, she \nhas demonstrated tonight that she is well informed, articulate, and \npersuasive--I hope in this instance not too persuasive--to her point of \nview.\n  As always, she spends a great deal of time thinking through these \nissues. I commend her for her presentation, and I respect her for her \nposition, although it is a position that I cannot support, and I will \nurge my colleagues to support the alternative, which is the Breaux-\nJeffords amendment.\n  We have tried over time, although we do not receive great \nacknowledgment for it, to find ways we can work with the \nadministration. We have had four or five major issues. The \nadministration really did not take a position about the tax incentives \nin the legislation, although many of us saw that the tax incentives in \nthe legislation, which many of us supported, would have resulted in the \nend of this legislation for reasons that have been pointed out earlier. \nThe tax-raising power lies with the House of Representatives, and not \nwith the Senate.\n  Second, on the issue of responsibility of employers, the President \nmade very clear in his statement that he wanted employers who were \nexercising their judgment in ways HMOs normally do--to bear \nresponsibility if there is injury and harm to patients.\n  We have been wrestling with that definition for several days. We will \nhave an additional opportunity to wrestle with it, but the President \nhas been very clear about wanting to hold responsible those employers \nwho make judgments that interfere with the medical judgments which \nadversely affect patients. He wants to hold them responsible. That is \nwhat many of our\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\ncolleagues have been attempting to do, and they have been doing it in a \nbipartisan way.\n\n  We have had amendments to eliminate all responsibility for employers, \nand amendments for employers with 50 employees or less. These have been \ndefeated.\n  The President was talking in ways many of us understood. We may \ndiffer as to the language, and we do have differences with the \nPresident on the liability provisions, but on those other issues, we \nare very much along the same lines.\n  The President, as well, in his support for the Frist-Breaux bill, \nbasically supported the medical necessity provisions we had included in \nthe McCain-Edwards legislation. They are virtually identical to those \nin the underlying bill, and the President indicated support of the \nmedical necessity provisions. Those are enormously important.\n  We come to the third of the major issues, and that is scope. Who is \ngoing to be covered, and for what particular protections? The President \nagain indicated in his principles for a bipartisan bill that it should \napply to all Americans--all Americans; that a Federal Patients' Bill of \nRights should ensure that every person--not just some people, not just \na few people in some States, not just some who are covered for certain \nprotections in a few States--but that all Americans, every person \nenrolled in a health plan, enjoy strong patient protections. Those are \nwords that he used.\n  The Breaux amendment is consistent with that particular principle. It \nis not drafted exactly the way I would like to have it drafted. It does \nnot go to the extent I would like to have gone to guarantee the strong \nprotections which Americans deserve. But nonetheless, in a very \nimportant way, the Breaux amendment complies with this particular \nprovision. It will ensure that all Americans are going to be covered \nand that they will have strong protections. The Breaux proposal also \nensures that protections for Americans will remain in the States. They \nwill be the primary regulator under the Breaux proposal. That is the \nway it was drafted, and it is a preferable way to ensure not only what \nthe President has stated, but what I think I have heard stated by my \ngood friend, the Senator from Tennessee, our ranking member on the HELP \nCommittee, and others.\n  As a matter of fact, every proposal that the House of Representatives \nconsidered in their debate last year--I believe there were four major \nproposals offered by Republicans--all of them included all Americans. \nThat was not a debatable point. It is tonight, and tomorrow morning, we \nwill have the opportunity to see where the Senate is going to stand.\n  I will make a few points, and if I am not correct, Senator Collins \nwill correct me--we only received the amendment just prior to the time \nthe Senator offered it, although clearly we were very much aware this \namendment was coming and Senator Collins told us about that. I will \nmake a statement and a point, and if I am wrong, the Senator from Maine \nwill correct me.\n  If her amendment is passed tomorrow, or whenever we pass the final \nlegislation, there will no guarantee of one new protection for most \nAmericans. Do my colleagues understand what I am saying? Mr. President, \ndo they understand what I am saying? If the Collins amendment succeeds \nand is passed, when it goes into law, there will not be one new \nprotection for most people in this country. There will not be any \nprotection for the children who need speciality care; there will not be \nany new protections guaranteed for women who need clinical trials; \nthere will be no new protections in a wide range of provisions that are \nincluded in the underlying legislation. None, unless--unless--the \nStates go about the business of applying and providing them.\n  Let me be very clear about it, with the passage of her amendment, \nthere is not one new protection from an HMO making the medical \ndecisions they have made in the past.\n  It seems to me that is why we are here because we have, for the last \n5 years, been battling to make sure families in this country receive \nprotections, whether they are in Massachusetts, Nevada, or Maine.\n  Let's look at what the circumstances are of some of the States. \nFirst, there is an authorization for $500 million, a pool--new funds of \n$500 million. That is in the amendment. Where we are going to get the \nmoney for those funds is not in there. We have authorized funds on many \nother issues and they have not been appropriated. Welcome to the \nclub. This relies on a $500 million appropriation.\n\n  When this is passed, there will still be 39 States that do not \nrequire any access to clinical trials. In the United States, you might \nwork in Massachusetts today, and maybe you will be transferred to \nNevada next year, and then transferred to another State after that. Let \nme make it clear to you and your family you had better make sure they \nare one of the 11 States that have clinical trials. Most of the states \nthat have clinical trials are for cancer, but don't include other life-\nthreatening diseases.\n  When I came to the Senate, you worked at the shipyard, your father \nworked there, and your grandfather worked there. You graduated from \nhigh school and had a good life. Those in the workforce today may have \nnine different jobs over the course of their life, moving all over the \ncountry. We ought to get a dartboard to find out where the protections \nare in the various States for you and your family, moving from one \ncompany to another.\n  There are 39 States that do not require clinical trials. Zero States \naffirmatively require timely access to specialists. If we pass the \nCollins amendment, there will be a signing ceremony at the White \nHouse--hopefully and after the bill is in effect, someone will say: I \nthought when I had a child who had cancer and we went to our HMO, we \nwould get the guarantee of accessing a specialist. And now that is \noverridden. I thought we would get the protections we needed. I \nlistened to the debate in Washington that said we could get specialty \ncare.\n  No, no, no, that is not so, because they passed the Collins \namendment. The Collins amendment says, only if the States provide it do \nthey get access to specialists.\n  We have 20 States that do not ban financial incentives for providers \nto delay or deny care. What is happening in HMOs is, as we heard in the \nnumerous committee hearings we have held, there are financial \nincentives and disincentives for doctors on the procedures they \nrecommend in terms of treating patients. Do we do anything about that? \nNo, no, we are not going to do anything about that, not in 20 States, \nnot if you live in one of those 20 States. They will have incentives \nand disincentives for the doctors.\n  Tell me what consumer knows about that. Ask any Member of the Senate, \nif they didn't have a briefing sheet before them, whether their State \ndoes or does not ban financial incentives. They will not have to worry \nbecause we have good Federal employee health insurance. We will not \nhave to worry. But I doubt whether any Member knows whether their State \nprohibits it or not.\n  There is nothing under the Collins amendment that will make sure \nstates ban inappropriate financial incentives. Under the underlying \nbill, there is a prohibition on their use. No HMO ought to provide \nincentives or disincentives to doctors in terms of providing or \nrecommending necessary treatment. What do we have to learn from this? \nWe have hearings, we find out, we see the affected families, and then \ndo we say, no, Washington does not know best, in this case, ensuring we \ndo not have inappropriate financial incentives? We ought to be able to \nagree on that. Is that a vast intrusion on States rights?\n  The list goes on. We have seven States that have not adopted a \nprudent layperson standard for emergency care. If you live in one of \nthose seven States and you think you are having a heart attack and go \nto the emergency room, you may end up without that care covered. We \nhave seen a number of States take action. It is important to do that.\n  The Breaux alternative says, when the States have taken action in \nthese various areas, there will be respect for that action being taken \nin the State to protect their citizens and deference will be given to \nthem. That is the way it ought to be. In areas where there is no \nprotection, we are trying to establish a federal floor. If the States \nwant to go beyond that, they can, but at least establish a floor of \nprotections.\n  I listened with interest to both the Senator from Maine and the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\nfrom Wyoming about two previous pieces of legislation, CHIP and HIPAA. \nWhen we passed the CHIP program we provided incentives and money. That \nis not the issue. The issue is, we gave the States the certain criteria \nthat had to be met, and if they met those criteria the Federal \nprovisions did not apply. Mr. President, 49 of 50 States have done \nthat.\n  I monitored that program closely in our HELP committee. Even when I \nwas not chairman, we had meetings with the previous administration to \nfind out what was happening with that program. I am familiar with it. \nWe don't have complaints from the States. We are not hearing from the \nStates about the heavy hand of the Federal Government for establishing \nCHIP. They can say they were getting money for that, fine; they were \nalso ensuring that children would have the range of services that would \nmeet needs--not the complete range of services I would like to see. We \nstill don't provide the comprehensive care--eyeglasses or hearing that \nwe ought to provide for children. Dental work was left out, along with \nmany other services that children need, but we find States conforming \nto the package that was developed.\n  The other reference was with regard to HIPAA. I have heard that \nspeech from the Senator from Oklahoma now eight times. He gets better \nat it each time he talks about HIPAA and HCFA. I point out, when the \nGAO recommended $11 million so HCFA would be able to implement HIPAA, \nhe was the one who led the fight against the $11 million, and he was \nsuccessful. They put in $2 million. And he led the fight to strike out \nthat $2 million so that HCFA could not implement it because they wanted \ngreater flexibility in the States so the insurance companies--that is \nmy conclusion--would be less interfered with. I have had that argument \nand I will not spend time on it now.\n  The fact is, tonight there are only five States which are not in \ncomplete compliance with HIPAA. It has taken time. Many of the criteria \nplaced upon the States are similar to what is in the Breaux proposal. I \npersonally would like to see a stronger provision. At the time we pass \nthis bill, I would like to see all Americans have protections. We have \ntaken those steps in the past on other issues.\n  We decided as a pattern of national policy we were going to pass \nFederal laws to outlaw child labor in this country. We didn't say: You \ncan go ahead and have that up in Massachusetts if you want to. We \npassed laws. Anyone can visit now in Lawrence and Lowell, go through \nthe mill, look at the museums and read the poems and letters of 9- and \n10-year-old children trapped in factories for 10 or 12 hours a day who \nwrote as they looked outside and saw other children play. We went \nthrough that as a nation and passed federal laws to prohibit that.\n  We also said, we will pass a minimum wage law. We know there are many \nhere who resented it. We passed laws in order to protect our \nenvironment because we recognize that environmental issues go through \nvarious States and the environmental issues know no borders. I make the \nsame case with regard to workers today, as well. It was not that way in \nthe old days, but it is that way today.\n  We made the same judgment with regard to civil rights. You can say, \nwell, these patient protections are not of the dimension of the issues \non civil rights. I think there is a lot you can say about that. But if \nyou listen to the HMO victims whom many of us have heard, if you see \nthe failure of the recommendations of doctors and nurses and medical \nprofessionals--the failure of their recommendations because of an HMO \nbureaucrat many miles away, and you see how lives have been destroyed \nand how families have been absolutely destroyed--we can ask ourselves, \nwhy shouldn't we give that kind of protection to families in this \ncountry?\n  Americans, I think, are under a lot of pressures today. Working \nfamilies are under a lot of pressure. They are not asking for much. \nThey are asking for good jobs with a good future. They are asking for \nschools where their children can learn. They are asking for health \ninsurance that is going to cover them. They want clean water, they want \nclean air, they want safety and security in their communities, they \nwant to own their own home, they want a national security and defense \nthat are going to protect our interests, and they want human rights \npolicies abroad that are going to represent our fundamental values.\n  They are not asking for much. But one of the things we can do is \nprotect them when they do get that health insurance. We will be back. \nWe give the other side the assurance we will be back. All those \nspeeches we have heard over these past days asking why are we doing \nthis when we have so many people uninsured--we will be back with \nlegislation on the uninsured. We hope for support from so many of those \nwho have been speaking recently about how we ought to make sure people \nare going to be covered. We will be back to try to make sure we deal \nwith those individuals.\n  But when you have an opportunity to relieve families of the anxiety \nso every time they go to a doctor they are going to get the best the \ndoctor can prescribe and the best the nurse can give --when you give \nthat guarantee to every family in America, you are going to ease their \nanxiety when they have a sick one.\n  Why are we going to play roulette? Let's say you live in \nMassachusetts today, or Florida, or New Mexico tomorrow. You shouldn't \nhave to worry, which one is going to give strong patient protections?\n  That is what this is about. I do not know what we need as a record. \nThe reasons for this are so powerful, so compelling, so real. We have \nhad statements from every Member in this body about the damage that has \ntaken place and the disruptions to families. We have the opportunity to \ndo something about it. It seems scope is a key issue, a key question. I \nhope the Senate will come down on the side of the proposal of the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I first want to say I very much enjoyed \nworking with my colleague from New England. He is a passionate advocate \nfor children on health care and education issues. He did, however, make \na misstatement about the implications of my amendment and has invited \nme to correct the record if it was wrong. I want to take the \nopportunity to do so.\n  In fact, my approach does provide new consumer protections. Let me \nexpand on that because I must not have been clear in explaining it \nearlier.\n  Under current law, there are federally regulated insurance plans and \nthere are State-regulated insurance plans. The Federal plans, under \nERISA, are beyond the reach of Federal regulators. So all those laws we \nhave talked about, those 1,100 or more State laws and regulations, do \nnot apply to consumers who are enrolled and covered by ERISA plans, the \nfederally regulated plans, because State governments are prohibited \nfrom applying regulations to ERISA plans. They are preempted in that \nway.\n  All of these great consumer protections that the States have enacted \nover the last decade do not apply to patients who are covered by ERISA \nplans. This legislation--and it is one of the reasons I strongly \nsupport patient protection legislation at the Federal level--would \nclose that gap. It would ensure that consumers who are part of ERISA \nplans receive the kinds of consumer protections that are available to \npatients whose health care coverage is provided by plans that are \nregulated by State governments.\n  So it is not accurate to say my approach will not result in any new \nconsumer protections. Rather, the approach my colleague from Nebraska, \nSenator Nelson, and I have proposed is intended to make sure we can \nprovide the same kinds of protections for consumers in Federal plans \nthat the States have done for consumers who are covered by State-\nregulated plans.\n  In addition, there is a requirement under the Collins-Nelson \namendment for States that have not enacted consumer protection laws--\nthere are many that have in many areas, but there are some holes here \nand there. There is a requirement that those States either enact a law \nthat is consistent with the purposes of those patient protections in \nthe McCain-Kennedy bill by the date of enactment--we are not even \ngiving them very long. They have to do it by October 1 of next year. \nThat is going to be difficult for some States that have biennial \nlegislatures. But we require\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\nthem to either enact a law that is consistent with the purposes of the \nconsumer protections in the McCain-Kennedy law or, if they decline to \ndo so, they have to certify their reasons for not doing so to the \nSecretary.\n  It is just not true to say our approach, the Collins-Nelson approach, \ndoes not result in any new consumer protections. In fact, what it does \nis preserve the good work that the States have done, rather than \nrequiring the States to adopt a one-size-fits-all, made-in-Washington \napproach that may not work in their particular States. We preserve the \nState laws, but then we close the gap by requiring federally regulated \ninsurance plans to have similar consumer protections. That is very \nimportant. That does result in new patient protections for millions of \nAmericans whose insurance is under federally regulated plans.\n  In addition, States cannot ignore this issue. They haven't ignored \nit; they have been very active, but, as I said, there are some holes. \nWhat they would have to do as a State is consider this issue and No. 1, \nenact a law consistent with the purposes of McCain-Kennedy or, No. 2, \ncertify to the Secretary that they did not enact a law because either \nthere is no managed care in their State--such as Alaska or Wyoming, \nwhere it is irrelevant--or they believed the costs were such that they \nwould drive people out of the insurance market and cause people to lose \naccess to health insurance altogether.\n\n  Let us remember the best consumer protection is having health \ninsurance coverage. That is the best patient protection we can apply \nand provide. So our amendment, the amendment I have crafted with my \ncolleague, Senator Nelson, which is supported by so many of our \ncolleagues who have spoken eloquently tonight, is an important one. It \nwill advance consumer protections. But it will respect the good work \nthat has been done by the States, the States that have been far ahead \nof the Federal Government.\n  Finally, let's remember the important point. States have been \nregulating insurance for more than 50 years. They have done a good job. \nThey have acted without any prod or mandate from Washington to provide \npatient protections. They are way ahead of us in this area. Why do we \nwant to second guess their work? Why do we want to supersede their \nlaws? Why do we want to wipe out the good work done by the States? I \nsubmit we should grandfather in those good State laws and concentrate \non the gaps.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her correction. \nThe figures are, of the 195 million Americans with private health \ninsurance, the 56 million who are the self-insured would have coverage. \nThis would leave out the 139 million who are not in self-insured plans, \nas I understand it. These include state and local public service \nemployees. These include firemen. These would be the police officers. \nThese would be the self-employed. There are 139 million who would not \nhave a federal floor of protections. I have read through this, so I \nappreciate what the Senator has said.\n  Listen to this. Under this proposal, there is going to be some $500 \nmillion that is going to be out there. A State can make a proposal for \na new program, and they can receive grants for the new program.\n  They say the States can pass laws which are consistent with the \npurposes of the Federal standard. But they can keep the money and \ndecline to enact a law because of the adverse impact of a law on \npremiums which would lead to a decline in coverage. So they could get \nthe money to pass it. But, if there is a judgment that there might be a \ndecline in coverage, they could, I guess, keep the money. They do not \nhave to do anything further to enact a law if the managed care market \nin the State is negligible. There is no additional responsibility for \nthem to take action for additional protections. They still get money \nfrom their fund.\n  I make the point that during the course of this debate there have \nbeen a lot of different ways of trying to cut the protections. We heard \nin our Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee about the kinds \nof abuses that are taking place across the country. The President of \nthe United States recognized that. He indicated that he wanted every \nperson covered. We want to have every person covered. We don't want to \ncarve out a third and say they will be covered, but we will leave out \ntwo-thirds who will not be covered with a great many of these \nprotections.\n  I continue to believe in the power of this issue and its impact on \nfamilies. Why are we going to draw a distinction between neighbors on \nthe same street? One works for a fire department, their family goes to \na doctor, and the kind of medical advice their doctor gives to them for \ntheir child is overridden by an HMO, and they don't have protections, \nbut his neighbor is protected because his employer self-insures? What \npossible fairness is there in that? What is the possible justice in \nthat?\n  We should be interested in protecting all families. The President \nunderstands that. Hopefully the Senate will understand that tomorrow.\n  If it were left up to me, I would make sure that all of these \nprotections were guaranteed. But we have the Breaux amendment which \nsays: Wait. We are going to say if States have taken action in these \nareas, there is going to be deference given to the State. There is \ngoing to be enforcement and supervision by the State in protecting \nthese areas.\n  I would have liked to see it stronger. But what is very important is \nguaranteeing some floor of protections.\n  Finally, we are talking about commonsense protections. We are talking \nabout access to the emergency room, specialty care, OB/GYN, and \ncontinuity of care. If a woman is pregnant, and the HMO and her \nemployer end their relationship, at least she can see her obstetrician \nuntil after the baby is born.\n  We are talking about prescription drug formularies. If the doctor \nrecommends a certain medically necessary drug and it is not included in \nthe formulary, the patient can still get the needed drug. There is \ngoing to be a shared expense by the patient as well as the HMO. That \nhas been worked out. We use the same cost sharing that is used in the \nvarious formularies.\n  Point of service: There is a closed panel, and a need for outside \nexpertise. Clinical trials are so important. Every one of the \nprotections that is guaranteed are in existence today either in \nMedicare and Medicaid, or they have been recommended by the insurance \ncommissioners, or they were unanimously recommended under President \nClinton's panel, which was bipartisan and included distinguished \nrepresentatives of all aspects of the health delivery system. Those are \nthe only ones.\n  Finally, as we are hopefully coming fairly close to the end of this \ndebate. We have the support of almost every health organization, every \nprofessional medical organization, every patients' organization, every \nchildren's organization, every women's organization, every disability \ngroup, and every cancer organization for this kind of protection.\n\n  The reason is very simple. They are out there on the firing line day \nin and day out. They understand what is happening to families. These \nare trained men and women who have given their lives for the protection \nof good health care for families in this country. They have seen what \nis happening and how many times they are being overruled. They have \nstated that is what is necessary.\n  The scope and protections that Senator Breaux has included are what \nthey strongly support.\n  We will have a chance to say another word about this tomorrow.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend from Maine.\n  I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Let me ask the Senator, as somebody who has been \ninvolved in this issue for so long, as the Senator knows, we have been \nworking very closely with Senator Breaux on his amendment in an effort \nto make sure that all Americans are covered. One of the guiding \nprinciples of our efforts in this area is to make sure that families \nhave protections provided in this legislation so that all families in \nthis country can make their own health care decisions. We have worked \nwith Senator Breaux very closely on his amendment to make sure there is \na floor for every family in America.\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\n  Will the Senator comment on whether, under the amendment of the \nSenator from Maine, every family in America will in fact get the \nminimum protections as provided in our bill as opposed to the language \nwe worked out with Senator Breaux?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the language is constructed, they will only provide \nthe protections to these self-insured and not to everyone else who has \nreceived their health insurance through other means--the self-employed, \nthose who are getting it through state and local employment, those \nworking for employers who purchase health insurance plans. There are \n139 million Americans who will not have those protections.\n  As I mentioned earlier, they will have to rely on protections from \nthe States. There are States that do not require access to clinical \ntrials. There are States that do not require timely access to \nappropriate, accessible specialists.\n  I mentioned earlier the ban on inappropriate financial incentives. \nTwenty States don't ban plans from giving financial incentives and \ndisincentives to doctors to delay or deny care. They won't have those \nprotections.\n  The point I mentioned earlier was that we are a society in movement. \nWe find so many families are moving from State to State. Members of \nfamilies are moving with jobs and going back and forth.\n  We have to ask ourselves ultimately and finally--as the Senator \npointed out, this is a federal floor of protections--if you are in a \nState with clinical trials, why should you have to make sure they have \na similar protection requiring access to the clinical trials which your \nwife might need, but you move to another State and find there is no \naccess to clinical trials?\n  That is strictly because of the protections that you might have in a \nparticular State.\n  It makes absolutely no sense. We ought to have that basic federal \nfloor. I know the Senator agrees with me.\n  The way the Breaux amendment has been devised, it gives the maximum \ndeference to the States if they provide protections in these areas. I \nmentioned just a half dozen different protections. We could go into \nothers this evening. I will not take the time to do so, but they are \nillustrative of the protections. These are pretty commonsense \nprotections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the debate on these two amendments is \ncritical to the issue of whether all Americans--all families in this \ncountry--will have access to the protections provided for in this \nBipartisan Patient Protection Act. That is the reason this vote \ntomorrow morning is critical to the vitality of this bill.\n  We have worked very closely with Senators on both sides of the aisle \nto ensure that two things are accomplished with respect to coverage: \nNo. 1, that every American is covered by this legislation and, No. 2, \nwe give deference to States that, through their own work, have \nestablished good systems for patient protection. We honor those State \nlegislatures and that State legislation.\n  So that is the purpose of this amendment, the Breaux amendment. It \nstrikes the right balance between making sure every American is \ncovered--every family is covered--on the one hand, and, secondly, \ngiving deference to the States that have already done good work in this \narea.\n  We need to ensure that we do not take away the protections we are \nproviding for all Americans by exempting a huge chunk of Americans, \nwhich, unfortunately, the Collins amendment would do.\n  The Breaux amendment, though, is one in a series of consensus \nagreements that have been reached on this legislation. Starting with \nthe issue of scope, which the Breaux amendment addresses, we now have \nan agreement which I think a great majority of the Senate will be able \nto support and be comfortable with.\n  On the issue of the independence of the appeals, we have an amendment \nthat will be supported, I believe, by virtually all of the Senate, \nestablishing the principle that we believe the HMOs should not have \ndirect control over who is on the independent appeal panel.\n  On the issue of exhaustion of remedies--exhaustion of the appeals \nprocess before a case can go to court--we are working very closely with \nthe Senator from Tennessee to reach a bipartisan consensus on that \nissue. We have made great progress, and I am optimistic about it.\n  On the issue of employer liability, from the outset we had--the \nsponsors of the legislation, along with the Presiding Officer--as a \nprinciple that it was important that employers be protected, period. We \nhave worked very hard with Senator Snowe and Senator Nelson from \nNebraska, and other Senators on both sides of the aisle, to ensure that \nthat is being done. Tomorrow morning we will offer an amendment on that \nissue.\n  We have worked our way through a series of hurdles, going from the \nissue of scope, to the issue of exhaustion of remedies, to the issue of \nclinical trials, to the issue of medical necessity, on which we have \nworked with Senators Bayh and Carper to make sure we have a consensus \non what is covered, giving proper deference to the contract and the \ncontractual language but making sure the independent reviewers have the \nability to make sure that if particular treatments are needed, they can \nbe provided.\n  So we started 2 weeks ago with a series of obstacles in front of us, \nstarting with scope and running throughout the legislation. What has \nhappened during the course of this debate, and the work that has been \ndone, is that one by one those obstacles, those barriers, have fallen, \nand we have been able to reach consensus agreement.\n  There is great momentum to do something that really matters to the \nAmerican people. The winners in this debate are not politicians. The \nwinners of this debate are not the people within this Chamber. The \nwinners are the American people and the families all over this country.\n  We have in this body an opportunity to do an extraordinary thing, \nwhich is to give people more control over their lives and more control, \nspecifically, over their health care decisions, the things that affect \ntheir families and members of their families.\n  All of us have worked very hard--Republicans and Democrats--to try to \nget to the place where we have consensus on this legislation, and one \nby one by one the barriers to passing real patient protection have \nfallen to the floor.\n  We have more work to do. We will have issues of liability that remain \nto be resolved. But the reality is, we are a long way down the road. We \nhave tremendous momentum for doing what there is a consensus in this \ncountry to do. Not just in the Senate, not just in the House of \nRepresentatives, but all across America, all of us who have spent time \nin our States have heard over and over that the American people expect \nus to do something about this issue.\n  The time has come. It is time to quit talking about it. It is time \nfor the political debate to stop. It is time to do something that can \nreally affect people's lives. We have an extraordinary opportunity to \ndo something important. We have made extraordinary progress toward that \ngoal, but we are not quite there. We need to keep our nose to the \ngrindstone, keep working, keep debating, and finish this legislation, \nget it through the House, and get it on the President's desk, with \ngreat hope and optimism that the President, when confronted with \nlegislation that during his campaign he vowed to support, will stand by \nhis vow and do what he has told us he would do. We are optimistic about \nthat. We believe the President will do what is right for the American \npeople.\n  So I thank my colleagues for all their work on this issue.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote, tomorrow morning, against the Collins \namendment and for the Breaux amendment, which is a bipartisan consensus \nthat has been reached. And we will continue our work toward providing \nthe American people the protection they need and they deserve.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          explanation of vote\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I regret I was not present to cast my vote \non the motion to table the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. Kyl) and the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Nelson).

Mr. President, I want to take a moment while \nthe leadership of the Senate is, at this very moment, deciding which \ncourse the rest of the day will take with regard to this important \nlegislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights. While we have a moment in \nwhich we might reflect on other items, I want to draw to the attention \nof the Senate the considerable concern of 16 million Floridians that \nthe Bush administration is trying to drill for oil and gas off the \nshores of the State of Florida.\n  It is most instructive, if one looks at a map of the Gulf of Mexico, \nwhere colored in on the gulf waters are the active drilling leases. One \nwill see clearly that, from the central Gulf of Mexico all the way to \nthe western Gulf of Mexico, almost all of the waters of the gulf are \nshaded in, indicating active oil and gas drilling leases. Indeed, there \nis a reason for that. It is because the reserves were there, the oil \nand gas deposits are there, the future reserves are expected to be \nthere. As a matter of fact, I believe it is 80 percent of all \neconomically recoverable, undiscovered gas reserves on the Outer \nContinental Shelf--which not only includes the gulf but also the \nAtlantic and Pacitic--80 percent of the Nation's known, recoverable gas \nreserves in the central and western gulf and 60 percent of the future \nrecoverable oil reserves are in that area too. They are no in the area \noff the State of Florida.\n  The State of Florida has consistently taken the position that we \nshould not have oil and gas drilling because of the high cost and \npotential damage to our environment and to our economy. One of our \nprimary industries is the tourism industry, which so often is dependent \nupon those pure, sugary white beaches being unspoiled so millions of \nvisitors who come to Florida to enjoy the sunshine and the waters and \nthe beaches can do so without having to worry about having oil spread \nacross the beach.\n  I can tell you that 16 million Floridians, in unison, do not want oil \nlapping up on our beaches. The cost to our environment and the cost to \nour economy would be simply too high.\n  Why, you would ask, other than that the oil and gas reserves are in \nthe central and western gulf, is there not any drilling off the coast \nof Florida? It goes back to the early 1980s, under the Reagan \nadministration and a Secretary of the Interior, James Watt. He offered \ntracts for lease from as far north as Cape Hatteras, NC, in the \nAtlantic, south all the way as far as Fort Pierce, FL.\n  I had the privilege of being a Member of the House of Representatives \nat the time. So I went to work, knowing the people of my congressional \ndistrict, in the early 1980s, didn't want oil lapping up onto their \nbeaches. We were able to persuade the appropriations subcommittee on \nthe Department of the Interior appropriations bill to insert language \nthat said no money appropriated under this act shall be used for \noffering for lease tracts such and such, and then listed the tracts all \nthe way from North Carolina south to Fort Pierce, FL. And we prevailed \nin the appropriations.\n  The administration left Floridians alone on offshore oil drilling for \na couple of years but came back under a new Secretary of the Interior \nand tried again. This time it was harder to stop. This time it \nescalated all the way to the full House Appropriations Committee. But \nwe finally prevailed, interestingly, not on the threat to the economy \nor to the environment of Florida, and indeed the United States \neastern coastline, but prevailed by getting NASA and the Defense \nDepartment to own up to the fact that you cannot have oil rigs down \nthere in the footprint of where you are dropping solid rocket boosters \noff the space shuttle and where you are dropping first stages off the \nexpendable booster rockets that are being launched out of the Cape \nCanaveral Air Force station. And we have not been bothered since the \nearly 1980s, in Florida, about offshore oil drilling--until now.\n\n  The bush administration is pressing a 6-million-acre lease off the \nnorthwest coast of Florida in a strange configuration called lease-sale \n181, of which the bulk of the 6 million acres is 100 miles offshore but \na stovepipe runs northward to within about 20 miles of the Alabama \ncoastline, which is about 20 miles, then, from the white sands of \nPerdido Key, State of Florida.\n  In a meeting of the Vice President with a Florida congressional \nmembers delegation, the Vice President suggested a compromise, which \nwas to knock off that stovepipe coming off the bulk of the 6 million \nacres. That is no compromise. That is unacceptable because that is \nstill oil drilling off the State of Florida where the future reserves \nare shown to be not as abundant. The tradeoff to 16 million Floridians \nis simply not worth what potentially could be discovered in oil and \ngas--the despoiling of our environment and the killing of our economy.\n  Thus, it was such welcome news when we learned last week that the \nother side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives, added to the \nInterior appropriations bill an amendment that would prohibit such \ndrilling. The vehicle was the Interior appropriations bill. It \nprohibits it for only 6 months. It will be my intention, and certainly \nthe intention of my wonderful colleague, the distinguished senior \nSenator from the State of Florida, Mr. Graham, that we in the future \nwill offer amendments either to the Interior appropriations bill, to \nbring it in conformity with the House-passed bill, or more likely \namendments that would cause a prohibition of lease-sale 181 as well as \noffering similar amendments to the authorizing bill that will come out \nof Chairman Bingaman's committee.\n  I want our colleagues to be clear. This is an issue of enormous \nmagnitude to 16 million Floridians. It happens to be of enormous \nmagnitude to New Jersey, the State of the Senator who sits as Presiding \nOfficer, as well as all the States in New England which value so much \nthe pristine waters and the waters particularly as you get on north of \nNew Hampshire and Maine--those waters that produce such delicacies as \nthe Maine lobsters. This is a matter of grave concern to many of us.\n  It is time to draw the line in the sand--hopefully, not a line that \nwill be washed over by oil on our beaches' sands but, rather, a line \nthat will indicate the unanimity of 16 million Floridians, joined by \ntheir sister States along the eastern seaboard, of opposition to \noffshore oil drilling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/27/senate-section/article/S6983-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6983-S6984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to join with Senators \nLeahy  and Hagel in submitting S. Con Res. 53, which encourages the \ndevelopment of strategies to reduce hunger and poverty in sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  In the year 2000, almost 200 million Africans, fully a third of the \ntotal population, went to sleep hungry and 31 million African children \nunder the age of five were malnourished. One child out of seven dies \nbefore the age of five, and one-half of these deaths are due to \nmalnutrition. Nearly half of sub-Saharan Africa's population, some 291 \nmillion people, live on less than $1 a day, and almost 85 percent of \nthe world's 41 heavily indebted poor countries are in sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  These problems are compounded by epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, \nmalaria, cholera, and other diseases now ravaging the continent. The \nhuman costs are staggering. Almost 4 million people are infected with \nAIDS each year, adding to the over 25 million already infected. Over 75 \npercent of the people worldwide who have died of AIDS lived in Africa. \nOne million people each year, mostly children, die from malaria.\n  Hunger only adds to the spread of disease, rendering the poor and \nmalnourished too weak to defend against AIDS and other infectious \ndiseases. Even if treatment clinics are available, those suffering from \nhunger are unable to afford fees for care or medicine to aid them with \ntheir battle against the illness.\n  Despite funding shortfalls, the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, USAID, and other U.S. government agencies, foundations, \nuniversities, non-governmental organizations, NGOs, and private sector \ncompanies are presently implementing many innovative programs directed \ntoward alleviating hunger and poverty in Africa.\n  While tremendously significant, these actions are not enough to keep \npoverty and hunger from growing in many African countries. Many of our \nexperts have concluded that the United States is not tapping into the \nfull range of interest, ability, experience and capacity available to \naddress this problem. The introduction of our Resolution, which \naddresses these issues, coincides with the conference of The \nPartnership to Cut Hunger in Africa, an independent effort formed by \nU.S. and African public and private sector institutions, international \nhumanitarian organizations and higher educational institutions. \nMichigan State University continues to play a strong leadership role in \nthis effort. The President of Michigan State University, Peter \nMcPherson, serves as one of the Partnership's co-chairs and was \ninstrumental in arranging conference-discussion activities in the \nSenate this week.\n  The goal of the Partnership is to formulate a vision, strategy, and \naction plan for renewed U.S. efforts to help African partners cut \nhunger dramatically by 2015. For three days this week, the \nPartnership's 22 distinguished policy experts and practitioners from \nthe U.S. and 8 African countries will share their views on hunger in \nAfrica and will open a dialogue on the role the U.S. might play in \ndiminishing hunger and poverty in Africa. On Thursday, June 28, 2001, \nPartnership experts will culminate their 3-day conference with a \nroundtable discussion on Capitol Hill, during which time they will \nshare their findings and action plan to effectively combat hunger and \npoverty in Africa.

Mr. President, I rise to address the threat of \nbioterrorism to our Nation's security.\n  President Bush has asked Vice President Cheney to ``oversee the \ndevelopment of a coordinated national effort so that we may do the very \nbest possible job of protecting our people from catastrophic harm.'' He \nalso asked Joseph Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, FEMA, to create an Office of National Preparedness \nto implement a national effort.\n  On May 9, 2001, Attorney General Ashcroft testified before a Senate \nAppropriations subcommittee that the Department of Justice is the lead \nagency and in sole command of an incident\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nwhile in the crisis management phase, even if consequence management \nactivities, such as casualty care and evacuation, are occurring at the \nsame time. Clearly, FEMA and the Department of Justice need to work \ntogether to shoulder the burden of responding to a large scale event. \nWhat is unclear, however, is how the Department of Justice will know \nthat its crisis management skills are needed during a bioterrorism \nevent.\n  When will a growing cluster of disease be recognized as a terrorist \nattack? How do we differentiate between a few individuals with the flu \nand a flu-like epidemic perpetrated by terrorists? When will it be \ncalled a crisis? When will the FBI or Justice be called in to handle \nthe newly declared ``crisis?'' In the case of a bioterrorist attack, \nthe response will most likely be the same as if it was a naturally \noccurring epidemic. The key question is not ``how to respond to an \nattack'' but ``are we prepared to respond to any unusual biological \nevent?''\n  What would happen if a bioterrorist attack occurred today? It would \nnot be preceded by a large explosion. Rather, over the course of a few \ndays or a couple of weeks, people would start to get sick. They would \ngo to hospitals, doctor's offices, and clinics. Hopefully, a physician \nin one hospital would notice similarities between two or three cases \nand contact the local public health officials. Maybe another physician \nwould do the same and maybe, finally, the Center for Disease Control \nwould be notified. So, the first responders would not be a Federal \nagency.\n  Across the country, local law enforcement, fire, HAZ MAT and \nemergency medical personnel are doing a tremendous job preparing and \ntraining for terrorist attacks, and I commend their efforts. But, in \nthe scenario I described, they would not be our first line of defense. \nInstead, the first responders for a biological event would be the \nphysicians and nurses in our local hospitals and emergency rooms. We \nneed to ensure that hospitals and medical professionals are prepared to \ndeal with this threat. This is not the case today.\n  This past November, emergency medical specialists, health care \nproviders, hospital administrators, and bioweapon experts met at the \nSecond National Symposium on Medical and Public Health Response to \nBioTerrorism. A representative of the American Hospital Association, \nDr. James Bentley, spoke about the challenges hospitals are confronting \nand stated that ``we have driven over the past twenty years to reduce \nflexibility and safeguards.'' Flexibility and safeguards are exactly \nwhat is needed by a hospital to go from ``normal'' to ``surge'' \noperations. Surge operations do not require the extreme scenario of \nthousands of casualties from a bioweapon. Dr. Thom Mayer, chief of the \nemergency department at Inova Fairfax Hospital, was quoted in the \nWashington Post, on April 22, 2001, stating that 20 or 30 extra \npatients can throw an emergency department into full crisis mode.\n  Dr. J.B. Orenstein, an emergency room physician, in a recent \nWashington Post op-ed, wrote about the ``State of Emergency'' the \ndedicated men and women working in our hospitals and clinics are \nalready facing without the added worry of bioterrorism. Until a year \nago, hospitals dealt with surges for only a few days or a week a year \nduring the winter flu, cold and icy sidewalk season. Now, mini-surges \noccur in the spring, summer and fall due to decreasing numbers of \nemergency rooms, beds available in any hospital, and qualified nurses. \nOn May 9, 2001, the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine convened a \nspecial meeting in Atlanta to discuss ``The Unraveling Safety Net.'' \nAre we, with all the planning and funding the Federal Government has \ndone over the past few years to address terrorism, providing sufficient \nhelp for hospitals to prepare for bioevents?\n  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation and Federal Services, I am concerned that we are not \naddressing a fundamental problem. Would a biological event be a \nnational security/law enforcement incident with public health concerns, \nor would it be a public health crisis with a law enforcement component? \nI hope that the effort led by Vice President Cheney will address \nspecifically this question and that the unique problems biological \nweapons present are not overlooked by any national plan to counter \nterrorism. I ask unanimous consent that the text of Dr. Orenstein's \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 22, 2001]\n\n                           State of Emergency\n\n                          (By J.B. Orenstein)\n\n       It's a typical bad-day crowd in my ER: Here's a wheezing \n     baby who developed a blue spell in front of her panicked mom. \n     This 62-year-old gentleman came in with chest pain 36 hours \n     ago; his worrisome EKG and equivocal lab tests should have \n     put him inside for observation, but there's no room in the \n     ICU so he's been waiting here for 24 hours. This lady, razor \n     sharp at 89, suddenly started acting ``not right,'' so her \n     granddaughter brought her in; she's been in the triage area \n     for three hours, but can't get into treatment because chest-\n     pain guy, blue baby and 18 other patients are parked in the \n     treatment beds while they wait to be admitted.\n       Our communications nurse just told an approaching ambulance \n     to find someplace else to take its potentially critical \n     passenger because we had no place to put him. Not in the ER, \n     not in an ICU, not even in a plain old bed in a ward. The \n     official term for what's happening here is ``saturation,'' \n     but down in the pit this is known as buttlock.\n       And it's happening too often, in more hospitals than ours. \n     On May 9, the society for Academic Emergency Medicine will \n     convene a special meeting in Atlanta on ``The Unraveling \n     Safety Net.'' The meeting was called in December because \n     panic buttons were being pushed in overcrowded ERs across the \n     country--Boston, St. Louis, Chicago, New York. It was a \n     medical version of the California power crisis, with our \n     rolling blackouts coming in the form of ambulance \n     ``diversions.''\n       Up until a year or two ago, we faced this nerve-racking \n     logjam for only a few days or weeks in winter, when flue and \n     cold viruses turn into potentially fatal pneumonia, babies \n     fall prey to respiratory and intestional viruses, depression \n     fills the psych wards and slippery ice keeps the orthopedists \n     busy. But now we're seeing mini-surges in the spring, summer \n     and fall as well.\n       When I started at Inova Fairfax Hospital in 1991, the ER \n     treated 55,000 patients in the course of the year. Last year \n     the number was 70,000. This is in keeping with the national \n     picture. In 1988, there were 81 million visits to U.S. \n     emergency rooms, according to the National Center for Health \n     Statistics. The number for 1998: 100.4 million. Meanwhile, \n     over the same decade, the number of emergency departments \n     fell from about 5,200 to just over 4,000. Their average \n     annual patient volume rose from 15,500 to 24,800--that's more \n     than 50 percent.\n       In all of American medicine, the only place that federal \n     law guarantees Americans the right to a physician, 24-7, is \n     the emergency room. This is because of the 1986 ``anti-\n     dumping'' law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, \n     known as EMTALA. ``[A]s enforced by the Health Care Finance \n     Administration and recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, \n     EMTALA is a civil right extended to all U.S. residents,'' \n     Wesley Fields, chairman of the American College of Emergency \n     Physicians Safety Net Task Force, recently wrote. Crowded as \n     we are, if you walk in the door, you'll be treated whether \n     you can pay or not. Just get in line and take a number with \n     everyone else.\n       I don't like this any more than my dissatisfied, frustrated \n     patients do. I tell them that it's like rush hour on I-66--\n     too many bodies packed into a space built ages ago for a much \n     smaller population.\n       But like most of life, the mess is more complicated than \n     that. One very important factor is the total number of beds \n     available in any hospital--particularly ICU beds. State and \n     local health agencies regulate the number of beds based on a \n     long list of factors: population, estimates of disease \n     prevalence, average lengths of stay. In the early 1990s, \n     conventional wisdom held that managed care would reduce the \n     occupancy rate. To a significant extent, that happened, and \n     in the mid-90's empty beds forced a number of underused \n     hospitals to close. In 1990, according to the American \n     Hospital Association, there were 927,000 staffed beds in \n     5,384 community hospitals in America. In 1999, the last year \n     for which there are complete numbers, 4,956 such hospitals \n     provided just over 829,000 beds. Meanwhile, the country's \n     population had grown by 10 percent.\n       Many of those vanished beds might have been superfluous \n     anyway, due to a sweeping explosion in medical technology and \n     therapeutics. Ten years ago, a heart attack kept a patient in \n     the hospital for just under nine days; by 1998, these folks \n     were out the door in six. Stroke? The average length of stay \n     was down by a half: 10 days to five. Home nursing and IV \n     therapy freed countless patients from the confines of a \n     hospital bed. But the hospital closings were uneven. In \n     booming suburban areas such as Northern Virginia, money \n     poured into expanding both high-tech services and customer-\n     friendly support at mega-hospitals like Inova Fairfax. But \n     some smaller hospitals, like Jefferson Hospital in Loudoun \n     County, found their beds chronically empty and had to close. \n     (The planned shutdown of D.C. General's inpatient facility is \n     a result of forces pushing in the opposite direction, \n     resulting in too many unused beds.)\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\n       When hospitals close, it puts more pressure on those that \n     survive. At Inova Fairfax, occupancy averaged a jam-packed 92 \n     percent over the past year. Thom Mayer, chief of our \n     emergency department, put it this way: ``The inpatient \n     population is so high so regularly that a mere 20 or 30 extra \n     patients throws us back into full crisis mode.'' And that can \n     happen during one shift in a busy emergency room.\n       Beyond the number of beds, just how many are available at \n     any given time often comes down to two letters: RN. A \n     hospitalized patient needs a doctor for just a few minutes \n     each day, but nursing care must be available around the \n     clock. But, like hospital beds, fully qualified nurses have \n     been disappearing fast, too. A widely cited study from \n     Vanderbilt University, published last year in the Journal of \n     the American Medical Association, pointed to some ominous \n     trends. A key finding: The average age of nurses is rising. \n     The number of nurses under the age of 30 fell from 419,000 in \n     1983 to 246,000 in 1998; by the end of this decade, the study \n     said, 40 percent of working nurses will be older than 50. \n     Retirement will create an estimated shortfall of half a \n     million nurses in the year 2020. The clear reason: A decline \n     in the number of high school girls who go to college intent \n     on becoming nurses. ``Women, who traditionally comprise the \n     majority of nursing personnel, are finding other career \n     options that are less physically demanding, more emotionally \n     rewarding and come with a higher rate of pay,'' Brandon \n     Melton, representing the American Hospital Association, told \n     a Senate subcommittee earlier this year. And men aren't \n     making up for the shortfall.\n       My wife, a savvy, experienced nurse, last did floor work \n     more than 10 years ago, and though conditions were tough \n     enough then, she recoils at what she would face if she went \n     back now: More and sicker patients on an exponentially higher \n     number of meds; less time getting to know the person who is \n     the patient, and therefore less opportunity to catch early \n     signs of deterioration; widespread use of ``health techs''--\n     people who take vital signs and dispense pills but have no \n     training for more meaningful interaction. No wonder students \n     at nursing schools dread the first few years following \n     graduation, because before they can get to the challenging, \n     rewarding places to work, such as ERs or ICUs, they have to \n     get experience on inpatient wards.\n       It's crowding in those ICUs that puts the worst pressure on \n     the ER. In the highly sophisticated environment of the ICU, a \n     patient's heart rate or blood pressure can be fine-tuned with \n     a shift of an IV drip. A phalanx of monitors register any \n     number of physiological trends to answer the question, ``Is \n     this person getting better or worse?'' When a patient \n     requires this moment-by-moment scrutiny and all ICU beds are \n     filled, the only place with roughly equal capacity--the only \n     place we can perform the same level of care--is the ER. This \n     ties up our nurses and blocks the bed from the next guy \n     waiting to get in.\n       And chances are, that next guy is in pretty bad shape. Most \n     people who come to the ER these days have higher ``acuity'' \n     than a decade ago--that is, they're sicker. There's been no \n     easy way to quantify this change, but, like tornado victims, \n     ER does know what we've been big with. We spend more time \n     trying to get a borderline patient ``tuned up'' enough to go \n     home rather than be admitted to a busy, barely staffed \n     hospital floor. We arrange home delivery of nebulizer \n     machines for asthma patients. We check out the patient \n     discharged yesterday after surgery who is back today, feeling \n     weak, wondering if he's really well enough to be home. I kind \n     of miss the good old days when a 10-hour shift meant a string \n     of straightforward technical procedures--like reducing a \n     dislocated shoulder or sewing a complex laceration. These \n     days, it seems more time is spent tracking down a patient's \n     three or four specialists--the oncologist, the psychiatrist, \n     the infectious disease guy--or negotiating with the intake \n     person to authorize a bed or transfer the patient to a \n     hospital that accepts his insurance.\n       Whine, whine, whine. I started writing this as a letter of \n     apology to all the miserable, aggravated patients who wonder \n     why they have had to wait so many hours to see me, and here I \n     am complaining about my own problems. I'll try to get back on \n     track, because the worst is still ahead. And the worst by far \n     is ambulance diversion.\n       It happened a lot over this past winter. In Boston--hardly \n     a hospital-deprived town--the Globe reported that 27 area ERs \n     went ``on diversion'' for a total of 631 hours in November, \n     677 hours in December and more than 1,000 hours in January. \n     And it was worse in Northern Virginia: In January, the area's \n     13 ERs placed themselves on diversion for more than 4,000 \n     hours. Evenly divided, and it most assuredly was not, that \n     would be every ER refusing ambulances for 10 hours every day. \n     Almost half the time, back in that icy January, if you needed \n     an ambulance to get to an ER you were SOL: severely out of \n     luck.\n       The American College of Emergency Physicians is certainly \n     concerned about the problem: Last October, an advisory panel \n     proposed guidelines for ambulance diversion, blaming ``a \n     shortage of health care providers, lack of hospital-based \n     resources and ongoing hospital and ED [emergency department] \n     closures.'' But it's easy to get the feeling that others at \n     the national level aren't taking it seriously. At a public \n     health conference in November, at the beginning of the \n     critical winter season, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher \n     was quoted as recommending that people be ``educated'' not to \n     go the emergency room unless they really need to. Dennis \n     O'Leary, head of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of \n     Healthcare Organizations, a critical monitoring group, was \n     quoted as saying: ``Quite frankly, this problem waxes and \n     wanes . . . but without anything tangibly happening it \n     resolves itself . . . The system will somehow muddle \n     through.''\n       They're right: I muddle through each shift worrying about \n     patients trapped in the waiting room or ambulances that can't \n     discharge their passengers at our door. I mutter humble \n     apologies to private docs outraged that the patients they \n     sent in specifically for urgent treatment--pain control, \n     antibiotics, whatever--cool their heels for hours on end. I \n     go home exhausted and aggravated with myself after 10 hours \n     of juggling alternatives so as not to put a patient into a \n     scarce bed--telling people to try a ``stronger'' antibiotic, \n     ratchet up the home respiratory treatments, take a few extra \n     tabs of pain reliever each day, and always be sure to follow \n     up with your own doctor tomorrow. I wonder which patients are \n     going to be back in another ER the next day because I missed \n     their real problems or insisted on an ineffective patch.\n       Doctors and nurses have a bottom line that ultimately \n     distinguishes us from other professions: quality patient \n     care. When we can't provide this, we have failed. Our \n     hospital administrators and department chiefs assume that \n     excellent patient care is a non-negotiable minimum standard. \n     But every winter, and increasingly at other times, the crash \n     of the system is the quite capitulation to these accumulated \n     pressures. When forced to maneuver so many sick patients \n     through an overwhelmed system, I just don't know if I'm doing \n     a good job any more. As a result, I often find myself phoning \n     the patient the next day, checking in: ``Everything okay \n     today?''\n       Many of the region's hospitals have received, or are \n     negotiating for, approval for more beds. Where more nurses \n     will come from is another problem. Anthony Disser, the chief \n     executive nurse at Fairfax, says the intrinsic value of \n     nursing is already luring a certain number of burned-out \n     software writers or disappointed entrepreneurs for a second \n     career. Yeah, I guess we are muddling through, after all.\n       I look forward to that ``Unraveling Safety Net'' meeting in \n     Atlanta in three weeks, where I expect to be transfixed, like \n     the audiences at ``Hannibal,'' by the horror stories and dire \n     statistics of other ER docs and public health researchers. \n     Maybe they've been coming up with some solutions. If they \n     have, I hope they haven't been waiting till May to share them \n     with the rest of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/27/senate-section/article/S6986-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

RHEIN\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nTimothy J. Rhein, who recently retired after 34 years with American \nPresident Lines, Ltd. APL is today one of the world's largest shipping \nand intermodal lines, and a globally recognized brand, thanks in large \npart to Tim Rhein's leadership.\n  I came to know Tim through his appearances before the Subcommittee on \nMerchant Marine, and I can personally attest to his commitment to \nmerchant shipping and his leadership in the U.S. shipping industry. His \nrise to president and chief executive officer of APL from 1995 to 1999, \nand then to chairman, was marked by key decisions in a difficult \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\n  He was instrumental in expanding APL from primarily an Asia-America \nbusiness into a truly global operation. He gained a decisive edge on \nhis competitors by embracing information technology earlier than anyone \nelse in his business. He knew the numbers and metrics of his business \nbetter than anyone. He was rarely at a loss for an answer before our \ncommittee, and always worth listening to.\n  And he worked very hard at developing one particular line of \nbusiness--the U.S. military--to the point where our government is today \nAPL's largest customer. One of the reasons for that success was his \nunderstanding of logistics, of managing supply lines, a critical skill \nto the military as well as to APL's multinational corporate customers.\n  But without doubt his toughest decision was to negotiate the sale of \nAPL to a non-U.S. buyer, in order to protect all of APL's stakeholders \nand to preserve the APL presence and brand. APL was the oldest \ncontinuously operating shipping company in America, and a premier US-\nflag shipping company. He stuck his neck out on that one, put his \nreputation on the line, and negotiated the sale personally--and \nsuccessfully.\n  Tim Rhein understood his business. He was a nimble and gutsy \ndecision-maker, and we in Washington will miss his understanding and \nknowledge as we continue our pursuit of a policy to promote a strong \nU.S. flag maritime shipping presence. I hope he will continue to avail \nus of his knowledge and wise counsel.\n  Good luck in your retirement, Tim Rhein.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/27/senate-section/article/S6987-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEATH OF ROBERT McKINNEY\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, earlier today I sent a letter to \nthe oldest daily newspaper in the West, ``The New Mexican'' regarding \nthe death of its publisher, Robert McKinney.\n  Robert McKinney was well known to the Senate. His decades of service \nto this country, in one capacity or another, and his remarkable career \nin business and publishing brought him into contact with many of us, \nand with colleagues who have preceded us in this body. He and Clinton \nAnderson, late a Senator for New Mexico, were great friends, and worked \ntogether on the San Juan-Chama water project for our State.\n  Five presidents called on him for service from Harry Truman through \nRichard Nixon. He put his prodigious skills to work at various times at \nthe Department of the Interior, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the \nDepartment of the Treasury. Under President Kennedy, he served as our \nAmbassador to Switzerland.\n  He was a fine citizen, and a good friend who will be missed, but \nwhose influence, I know, is ``a widening ripple, down a long \neternity.'' The world is a better place for his having lived.\n  I ask that my letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n              Letter to the Editor of ``The New Mexican''\n\n       To the Editor: With so many others, I was saddened earlier \n     this week when word came of the death of Robert McKinney \n     whose American life made him one of the world's distinguished \n     citizens. When he died in New York on Sunday night, this man \n     of the American West had forged great successes in business, \n     journalism, international diplomacy, public service and \n     public policy in the course of his ninety years. His was the \n     ``life well lived'' and much of it was lived in New Mexico \n     where he was the deeply respected publisher of this \n     newspaper.\n       He was a singular individual with a wide-ranging mind, vast \n     talents, and varied interests. He brought his considerable \n     energy to bear on issues from architecture to atomic energy, \n     war to peace, land use to poetry. He was most certainly a \n     force for good in this world. I was honored to have the \n     benefit of his counsel and the gift his friendship.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay \ntribute to a special place in my hometown of Detroit that for the last \ncentury has inspired not only our city but our country. This year we \nare commemorating the tricentennial of the founding of a city that to \nAmericans has long meant great automobiles. To Detroiters, it also \nmeans great sports teams and inspiring hero-athletes. Indeed, as \nDetroit enters its fourth century, our pride in our city is equaled by \nour pride in the house these heroes built--our storied Tiger Stadium.\n  Today at home plate, the people of Detroit will gather to unveil one \nof eleven new stamps commemorating Baseball's Legendary Playing Fields. \nOf those eleven ballparks, only four still stand, and one is right in \nDetroit, where baseball was the pastime at The Corner of Michigan and \nTrumbull for more than a century.\n  The history of this stadium is in so many ways the history of our \ncity. The spirit of hard work and determination that has always defined \nDetroit revealed itself early. When the Great Depression hit Detroit \nharder than most American cities, it was the 1935 World Champion \nTigers--and the renowned ``G-Men'': Charlie Gehringer, Goose Goslin, \nand Hank Greenberg--who renewed the hopes of an entire city. Detroit \nwould forever after be the City of Champions, with four World Series \ntitles to prove it.\n  When the riots and ruin of 1967 left deep scars of division across \nour city, it was the 1968 World Champion Tigers led by Al Kaline, \nWillie Horton, Bill Freehan, Denny McLain and Mickey Lolich who led one \nof the greatest comebacks in baseball history and who, in their \nunforgettable victory, united us to celebrate as one city.\n  It is no exaggeration to state that the heroes of Tiger Stadium also \npointed us to a better America. By the time the prize fighter Joe Louis \ntriumphed over Bob Paster in then-Briggs Stadium in 1939, he was more \nthan a hometown hero from the East Side, he was a national hero and a \nsymbol to all people of all races. Even today, I almost weep thinking \nof ``Hammerin' Hank'' Greenberg's grand slam in 1945 that put the \nTigers in the Series and for what that one swing of the bat meant. When \nNelson Mandela spoke to a massive rally in Tiger Stadium a decade ago, \nhis words rung out past the rafters to every American on the endurance \nand inspiring power of the human spirit.\n  In this City of Champions, the names and feats of champions echo \nstill. Here is where the three time NFL champion Detroit Lions played \nfor more than three decades. Here is where the legends of baseball's \nGolden Age took to the field in the unforgettable 1941 All-Star Game--\nBob Feller, Joe DiMaggio, and Ted Williams. Here is where the Tigers \nearned three divisional championships, nine pennants, and those four \nWorld Series titles. Here is the where the Tiger greats were born, the \neleven Hall of Famers: Sparky Anderson, Ty Cobb, Mickey Cochrane, Sam \nCrawford, Hank Greenberg, Hugh Jennings, Al Kaline, George Kell, Heinie \nManush, Hal Newhouser, and Charlie Gehringer. And one more Hall of \nFamer, broadcaster Ernie Harwell, made sure that when we couldn't \nphysically be at Michigan and Trumbull, the sights and sounds of the \nballpark were part of our lives.\n  This house of heroes may have been built on the shoulders of giants, \nbut someone else sustained it, the fans. If ever a community has \nunified around a place, Detroiters came together at The Corner. In this \ncity of immigrants, attending a game there became an American rite of \npassage. The language of Tiger Stadium, as the Detroit News once put \nit, was not Polish or Armenian or Ukranian, it was baseball. \nGenerations of parents brought their children to those sun-drenched \nbleachers. Years later, those grown children brought their own children \nto Tiger Stadium. I know because like many Detroiters I still call the \nold ballpark the place of my youth, a place where our parents took us \nand where I took my daughters and granddaughter.\n  To this day I remember my father leading me through the corridors to \nsee Game 1 of the 1945 World Series. Through all my visits back through \nall the years since, I have never forgotten the sights, smells and \nsounds of that day and the unique character of that park. There was the \nsight of heroes--like Hal Newhouser--who I had only imagined while \nlistening to the radio and could now virtually reach out and\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\ntouch. That is, when he wasn't obscured by one of the much-beloved \nposts that always caused so many of us to strain our necks. There was \nthe smell of the popcorn, the peanuts and the hot dogs. And there were \nthe unforgettable sounds the crack of the bat, and the roar of a \nhometown crowd.\n  Like many Detroiters, my feelings on this occasion are best captured \nby the words spoken by Al Kaline about his first day at Tiger Stadium. \nHe said, ``As I was walking under the corridors trying to find the \nlocker room, I took a peek right behind home plate. I walked out, the \nsun was shining beautifully, and I thought, 'Man, I never saw anything \nso pretty in my life.' ''\n  While over the years, the name may have changed, the address for \nbaseball in Detroit was the same the Corner of Michigan and Trumbull. \nIt is still one of oldest ballparks in one of the oldest cities in \nAmerica. In it we feel our hometown pride in a national landmark. Our \ncity. Our ballpark. The new commemorative stamp to be unveiled today \ncelebrates their common spirit, and it gives me great pride today to \njoin the people of Detroit, in praise of both.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/27/senate-section/article/S6988-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING KAREN KITZMILLER\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a very \nspecial Vermonter, and a good friend, Karen Kitzmiller. Karen, at the \nyoung age of 53, lost her long battle with breast cancer on May 20 of \nthis year. In East Montpelier the following Saturday, I joined hundreds \nof family, friends, colleagues, and admirers who gathered together to \nshare their memories of Karen, and to honor her life.\n  For the past 11 years Karen Kitzmiller served as Montpelier's \nDemocratic State representative in the Vermont Legislature. Her \nlegislative achievements were many, but most outstanding was her work \non the House Health and Welfare Committee. Karen was a determined \nadvocate and principled leader on behalf of the health and well-being \nof Vermonters. She fought to prevent tobacco companies from targeting \nchildren with advertisements designed to encourage youth smoking. To \nhelp patients appeal coverage denials by health maintenance \norganizations, Karen dedicated her efforts to the establishment of \nVermont's health care ombudsman. She devoted considerable energies to \nthe provision of health care coverage for the uninsured. This spring, \nafter almost four years of effort, she witnessed the Governor sign \nlegislation to ensure that uninsured patients who volunteer to \nparticipate in cancer treatment clinical trials are provided with \nhealth care coverage.\n  Karen was diagnosed with cancer more than four years ago, and yet \nthrough it all, she did not give up her work on behalf of Vermonters. \nShe continued to serve in the Legislature, she leant her experience as \na cancer survivor in efforts to promote awareness about the importance \nof support groups, and she helped to establish the annual Breast Cancer \nConference in Burlington. These are just a few of the lasting \ncontributions that will serve as a tribute to Karen's life for years to \ncome.\n  Karen leaves behind a loving family--her husband, Warren, and two \ndaughters, Amy and Carrie. Amy is a student at the University of \nVirginia, studying government and women's studies, and Carrie is a \nstudent at the University of Pennsylvania studying at the School of \nArts and Sciences. I had the privilege of sponsoring Amy as a Senate \nPage in 1996 and as an intern in my Montpelier office in the summer of \n2000. They are both bright young women.

The actions of these individuals and groups \nthreaten the peace in or diminish the security and stability of the \nWestern Balkans, undermine the authority, efforts, and objectives of \nthe United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and \nother international organizations and entities present in those areas \nand the wider region, and endanger the safety of persons participating \nin or providing support to the activities of those organizations and \nentities, including United States military forces and Government \nofficials. In order to deal with this threat, I have issued an \nExecutive order blocking the property and interests in property of \nthose persons determined to have undertaken the actions described \nabove.\n  The Executive order prohibits United States persons from \ntransferring, paying, exporting, withdrawing, or otherwise dealing in \nthe property or interests in property of persons I have identified in \nthe Annex to the order or persons designated pursuant to the order by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState. Included among the activities prohibited by the order are the \nmaking or receiving by United States persons of any contribution or \nprovision of funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of any \nperson designated in or pursuant to the order. In the Executive order, \nI also have made a determination pursuant to section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA \nthat the operation of the IEEPA exemption for certain humanitarian \ndonations from the scope of the prohibitions would seriously impair my \nability to deal with the national emergency. Absent such a \ndetermination, such donations of the type specified in section \n203(b)(2) of IEEPA could strengthen the position of individuals and \ngroups that endanger the safety of persons participating in or \nproviding support to the United Nations, NATO, and other international \norganizations or entities, including U.S. military forces and \nGovernment officials, present in the region. The Secretary of the \nTreasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to \nissue regulations in exercise of my authorities under IEEPA to \nimplement the prohibitions set forth in the Executive order. All \nFederal agencies are also directed to take actions within their \nauthority to carry out the provisions of the order, and, where \nappropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner \nof the measures taken.\n\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive order I have issued. The order \nwas effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 27, 2001.\n  I have issued the order in response to recent developments in the \nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, southern Serbia, and elsewhere \nin the\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\nWestern Balkans region where persons have turned increasingly to the \nuse of extremist violence, the incitement of ethnic conflict, and other \nobstructionist acts to promote irredentist or criminal agendas that \nhave threatened the peace in and the stability and security of the \nregion and placed those participating in or supporting international \norganizations, including U.S. military and government personnel, at \nrisk.\n  In both Macedonia and southern Serbia, individuals and groups have \nengaged in extremist violence and other acts of obstructionism to \nexploit legitimate grievances of local ethnic Albanians. These groups \ninclude local nationals who fought with the Kosovo Liberation Army in \n1998-99 and have used their wartime connections to obtain funding and \nweapons from Kosovo and the ethnic Albanian diaspora. Guerrilla attacks \nby some of these groups against police and soldiers in Macedonia \nthreaten to bring down the democratically elected, multi-ethnic \ngovernment of a state that has become a close friend and invaluable \npartner of NATO. In March 2001, guerrillas operating on the border \nbetween Kosovo and Macedonia attempted to fire upon U.S. soldiers \nparticipating in the international security presence in Kosovo known as \nthe Kosovo force (KFOR). Guerrilla leaders subsequently made public \nthreats against KFOR.\n\n  In southern Serbia, ethnic Albanian extremists have used the Ground \nSafety Zone (GSZ), originally intended as a buffer between KFOR and \nFRY/Government of Serbia ((FRY/GoS) forces, as a safe haven for staging \nattacks against FRY/GoS police and soldiers. Members of ethnic Albanian \narmed extremist groups in southern Serbia have on several occasions \nfired on joint U.S.-Russian KFOR patrols in Kosovo. NATO has negotiated \nthe return of FRY/GoS forces to the GSZ, and facilitated negotiations \nbetween Belgrade authorities and ethnic Albanian insurgents and \npolitical leaders from southern Serbia. A small number of the extremist \nleaders have since threatened to seek vengeance on KFOR, including U.S. \nKFOR.\n  Individuals and groups engaged in the activities described above have \nboasted falsely of having U.S. support, a claim that is believed by \nmany in the region. They also have aggressively solicited funds from \nUnited States persons. These fund-raising efforts serve to fuel \nextremist violence and obstructionist activity in the region and are \ninimical to U.S. interests. Consequently, the Executive order I have \nissued is necessary to restrict any further financial or other support \nby United States persons for the persons designated in or pursuant to \nthe order. The actions we are taking will demonstrate to all the \npeoples of the region and to the wider international community that the \nGovernment of the United States strongly opposes the recent extremist \nviolence and obstructionist activity in Macedonia and southern Serbia \nand elsewhere in the Western Balkans. The concrete steps we are \nundertaking to block access by these groups and individuals to \nfinancial and material support will assist in restoring peace and \nstability in the Western Balkans region and help protect U.S. military \nforces and Government officials working towards that end.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act and the \nRailway Labor Act to prevent discrimination based on participation in \nlabor disputes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I, along with 15 of my colleagues are \nintroducing a bill today that addresses an issue we haven't talked \nenough about in the Senate in recent years--but it's a critically \nimportant issue that we cannot continue to ignore.\n  I'm talking about workers' rights--specifically the erosion of a \nworker's fundamental right to strike, to protect that right.\n  Today, we are introducing the Workplace Fairness Act. This may sound \nfamiliar to many of my colleagues here in the Senate. It was a bill my \ngood friend and former colleague Senator Howard Metzenbaum from Ohio \nintroduced in the 102nd and 103rd congress.\n  The Workplace Fairness Act would amend the National Labor Relations\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\nAct and the Railway Labor Act by prohibiting employers from hiring \npermanent replacement workers during a strike. It would also make it an \nunfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to allow a striking \nworker who has made an unconditional offer to return to go back to \nwork.\n  Why do we need this legislation?\n  Because right now, a right to strike is a right to be permanently \nreplaced--to lose your job. Every cut-rate, cutthroat employer knows \nthey can break a union if they are willing to play hardball and ruin \nthe lives of the people who have made their company what it is. In my \nown state of Iowa--Titan Tire Company out of Des Moines, is trying to \ndrive out the union workers with permanent replacements--the union has \nbeen on strike for three years now.\n  Over the past two decades, workers' right to strike has too often \nbeen undermined by the destructive practice of hiring permanent \nreplacement workers. Since the 1980s, permanent replacements have been \nused again and again to break unions and to shift the balance between \nworkers and management.\n  Titan Tire just outside is just one of many examples.\n  On May 1, 1998, the 650 members of the United Steelworkers of \nAmerica, Local 164, who work in Des Moines Titan Tire plant, were \nforced into an Unfair Labor Practice Strike.\n  During the contract negotiations preceding this strike, Titan \nInternational Inc. President and CEO, Morry Taylor, attempted to \neliminate pension and medical benefits and illegally move jobs and \nequipment out of the plant. He also forced employees to work excessive \nmandatory overtime, sometimes working people as many as 26 days in a \nrow without a day off.\n  Well, the membership decided that Titan's final offer was impossible \nto accept, and they voted to strike. Two months later, in July, 1998, \nTitan began hiring permanent replacement workers.\n  During the past three years, approximately 500 permanent replacement \nworkers have been hired at the Des Moines plant. And little or no \nprogress has been made toward reaching a fair settlement. In fact on \nApril 30, 2000, the day before the second anniversary of the Titan \nstrike, Morrie Taylor predicted that the strike would never be settled.\n  Workers deserve better than this. Workers aren't disposable assets \nthat can be thrown away when labor disputes arise.\n  When we considered this legislation in 1994, the Senate labor and \nHuman Resources Committee heard poignant testimony about the emotional \nand financial hardships caused by hiring permanent replacement workers. \nWe heard about workers losing their homes; going without health \ninsurance because of the high costs of COBRA coverage; feeling useless \nwhen they were permanently replaced after years of loyal service.\n  The right to strike--which we all know is a last resort since no \nworker takes the financial risk of a strike lightly--is fundamental to \npreserving workers' rights to bargain for better wages and better \nworking conditions. Without the right to strike, workers forgo their \nfair share of bargaining power.\n  Permanent striker replacement not only affects the workers who were \nreplaced. It affects other workers in competing companies. When one \nemployer in an industry breaks a union, hires permanent replacements, \nand cuts salaries and benefits, it affects all the other companies in \nthe industry. Now they either have to find a way to compete with the \nlow-wages and shoddy benefits of a cut-rate, cut-throat business--or \nthey have to follow suit.\n  Also, workers faced with being replaced are forced to make a choice. \nThey can either stay with the union and fight for their jobs, or they \ncan cross the picket line to avoid losing the jobs they've held for ten \nor twenty or thirty years.\n  Is this a free choice, as some of our colleagues would suggest? Or is \nthis blackmail that takes away the rights and the dignity of the \nworkers of this country? What does it mean to tell workers, ``you have \nthe right to strike''--when we allow them to be summarily fired for \nexercising that right?\n  In reality, there is no legal right to strike today. And because \nthere is no legal right to strike, there is no legal right to bargain \ncollectively. And since there is no legal right to bargain \ncollectively, there is no level playing field between workers and \nmanagement.\n  In other words, Management gets to say that you must bargain on their \nterms--or find some other place to work. If you're permanently \nreplaced, that means you're out of work; you lose all your pension \nrights; you lose your seniority; you lose your job forever.\n  How did this happen? We've got to go back to the 1930's for the \nanswer.\n  In response to widespread worker abuses--and union busting--Congress \npassed the National Labor Relations Act--the Wagner Act--in 1935 and it \nwas signed into law by President Roosevelt. The Wagner Act guarantees \nworkers the right to organize and bargain collectively and strike if \nnecessary. It makes it illegal for companies to interfere with these \nrights. In fact, it specifies the right to strike and states: `Nothing \nin this act--except as specifically provided herein--shall be construed \nso as to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to \nstrike.'\n  In 1938, the Supreme Court dealt the Wagner Act a mortal blow in the \ncase National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) versus Mackay Radio and \nTelegraph Co. In that case, the Court said that Mackay Radio could hire \npermanent replacement workers for those engaged in an economic strike.\n  There are two types of strikes: economic and unfair labor practices. \nEmployers must rehire employees in unfair labor practice strikes. The \nNLRB determines if the strike is economic or based on unfair labor \npractices. Unions cannot know in advance whether NLRB will rule that \ntheir employer has engaged in unfair labor practices. So any employee \nparticipating in a strike runs a risk of permanently losing his or her \njob.\n  What's interesting is that following the Court's ruling, companies \ndid not take advantage of this loophole until the 1980s. Before then, \nthey recognized that doing that would upset this level playing field. \nFor almost 40 years, management rarely hired permanent replacements.\n  That began to change in the 1980s. Since then, hiring permanent \nreplacements has become a routine practice to break unions and shift \nthe balance between workers and management.\n  Again, the Workplace Fairness Act would restore the fundamental \nprinciple of fair labor-management relations--the right of workers to \nstrike without having to fear losing their jobs.\n  Permanent striker replacement keeps us from moving forward as a \nnation into an era of high-wage, high-skilled, highly productive jobs \nin the global marketplace. Without the right to strike, workers' rights \nwill continue to erode. The result will be fewer incentives and less \nmotivation to produce good work, and companies will also suffer with \nless quality in their products.\n  Obviously, this legislation won't be adopted this year. But we are \nintroducing it today to signal my intent on raising it and other \nfundamental labor law reforms in the next session of Congress. It's \ntime for us to level the playing field for hard-working Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend \nSenator Harkin as an original cosponsor of the Workplace Fairness Act \nof 2001. This measure, along with the ``Right to Organize Act of \n2001,'' which I introduced yesterday, are two of the most important \npieces of legislation that will come before the Senate this year.\n  Together, these measures strengthen workers' rights to organize, to \njoin a union, and to advocate for fair collective bargaining and fair \nagreements. Together, these measures produce the basic platform for \nhealthy economies, healthy communities, and healthy families.\n  Specifically, the Striker Replacement Act is designed to combat an \nunfair labor practice which strikes at the very heart of the collective \nbargaining process in this country: the permanent replacement of \nstriking workers. The goal of this Act is to restore the labor-\nmanagement balance in today's workplace by preventing the fundamental \nright to strike from being transformed into a right to be fired.\n  The record shows that permanent replacement of striking workers has \nbeen used increasingly over the years. Private sector employers, \nemboldened by the Reagan Administration's permanent replacement of \nstriking Federal employees in the early 1980's, began to use the \npermanent replacement of striking workers as a means of abrogating \ncollective bargaining agreements and bringing in new hires often \nscreened for their anti-union biases.\n  The process is fairly simple: require major and unreasonable \nconcessions of a union; force them to strike; permanently replace them \nwith workers unsympathetic to the union; and move to decertify the \nunion. This should be called what it is: outright union busting. And it \nshould not be tolerated.\n  The purpose of the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations \nAct was to respond to the persistent--and sometimes violent--denial by \ncertain employers of the right to organize and bargain collectively. \nThe resulting strikes and other forms of industrial unrest in the \n1930's were held by the courts to have severely burdened free and open \ncommerce across the country. As a result, the Railway Labor Act and the \nNational Labor Relations Act were passed, guided by two fundamental \nprinciples: 1. Employees have a right to pursue their interests \ncollectively without fear of employer reprisals, and 2. Questions about \nrepresentation must be separated from substantive issues in dispute. \nGovernment-supervised procedure should be established to ensure fair \nrepresentation; while collective bargaining should be the forum for \nsettling the remaining substantive disputes.\n  This system and these principles are sound. Workers have a right to \norganize without being retaliated against for exercising that right. \nAnd they have a right to negotiate wages, benefits, and other items \nthrough collective bargaining.\n  But these principles only work if the right to strike, in the words \nof the National Labor Relations Act, is not ``interfered with or \nimpeded or diminished in any way.'' In 1938, the Supreme Court in the \nMackay Radio case cut a huge swath through these guiding principles by \ncreating the striker replacement doctrine. Under this doctrine, \naffirmed in subsequent decisions, such as Belknap v. Hale (1983) and \nTWA v. IFFA (1989), even though it is unlawful to fire a striking \nworker, it is not unlawful to permanently replace him or her.\n  The distinction between firing and permanent replacement, is \nludicrous--and it is untenable. The central practical reality--as any \nman or woman who has exercised his or her right to strike and has paid \nthe consequences can tell you--in either case, whether it is called a \nfiring or a permanent replacement--the employee loses their job because \nhe or she has exercised the right to strike. That's the reality. That's \nthe harsh reality.\n  The measure we are introducing today is a simple one. It does two \nthings: 1. It amends the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway \nLabor Act to prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacement \nworkers during a strike, or giving employment preference to cross over \nemployees, and 2. It makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \nto refuse to allow a striking worker to return to work if that worker \nhas unconditionally offered to return to work.\n  It's that simple. These are fundamental protections. These are \nprotections that are part of the basic compact with the American worker \ncreated by the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act. \nIt is long past time that workers seeking to better their lives, their \nfamilies, and their communities are given access to a collective \nbargaining process that is fair and even-handed. It is long past time \nthat workers be allowed to advocate for reasonable terms and conditions \nof their employment without fear of devastating retribution.\n  Finally, this measure not only meets the needs of workers, their \nfamilies, and their communities, it also serves the interest of our \nnation in a global economy. As others have pointed out, if we are to \nremain strong and competitive as a nation, we must develop a highly \nmotivated and skilled workforce and we must create stable worker-\nemployer relationships that are based on mutual respect and a mutual \ncommitment to a joint economic enterprise. This will only happen if we \nlevel the playing field and support a just, sound, and effective \ncollective bargaining process.\n  This measure, the Workplace Fairness Act, is one key to achieving \nthese goals. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1108. A bill to authorize the transfer and conveyance of real \nproperty at the Naval Security Group Activity, Winter Harbor, Maine, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President. I rise today with my colleague from Maine \nto introduce legislation facilitating the land conveyance at Winter \nHarbor, ME.\n  First, may I note that this bill is the product of countless hours of \nhard work and deliberation by the communities it affects--Winter Harbor \nand Gouldsboro--the State of Maine, and the Maine Delegation. I would \nlike to thank those involved: Chairmen Stan Torrey and Tom Mayor and \nmembers of the Gouldsboro and Winter Harbor Base Reuse Committees; Jean \nMarshall, the Defense Conversion Coordinator for Eastern Maine \nDevelopment; Linda Pagels and Roger Barto, Town Managers for Gouldsboro \nand Winter Harbor; and Commander Edwin Williamson, Commanding Officer \nof Naval Security Group Activity Winter Harbor, for their efforts in \ncrafting legislation that all concerned can support.\n  The Navy has been a strong and supportive presence in the Winter \nHarbor region since the establishment of their facility over 80 years \nago. What started as one man's patriotic efforts in World War I to \nestablish a radio station for transatlantic communications developed \ninto a complex network of sophisticated equipment that became Winter \nHarbor Naval Security Group Activity. Throughout the two World Wars and \nsubsequent Cold War, the men and women stationed at Winter Harbor \nprovided invaluable services in our Nation's defense.\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\n  Maine and the Navy have always had a special relationship, and that \nrelationship extended to Winter Harbor. The base and community embraced \none another and developed a good neighbor relationship seldom seen \nbetween a military installation and the surrounding community. For both \nsides, it was truly a win-win situation. The sailors and their families \nenjoyed the hospitality of Maine while the towns of Winter harbor and \nGouldsboro economically benefited from the Navy's presence.\n  Unfortunately, the advent of new technology has made the equipment \nand mission of Winter Harbor obsolete. With the announcement that the \nWinter Harbor Naval Activity would close in June 2002, the communities \nbegan the laborious process of planning for life without the good \nneighbors of Winter Harbor NSGA.\n  With this base closing, Maine will lose an economic base it has \ndepended on for over 80 years. At its high point, Winter Harbor had \napproximately 250 sailors, 140 civilian employees, and their family \nmembers in residence and the base became an economic focal point for \nthe region with an estimated $11 to $15 million being contributed to \nthe local economy on an annual basis.\n  To offset this impending loss, the towns applied for and received a \nsmall Economic Development Administration Defense Conversion Planning \nGrant in the amount of $200,000. While these funds proved crucial to \nthe start of the reuse process, many needs still remain unmet. This \nlegislation is intended to address some of those needs and to minimize \nthe financial consequences of the base closure.\n  The towns of Winter Harbor and Gouldsboro are not looking for \ncharity. As you will see, this legislation's intent is to reimburse the \ntowns for infrastructure improvements made at the Navy's behest and to \nprovide the means for the region to restore its economic viability.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Maine Delegation has been working with \nthe local communities, the State, Navy, and National Park Service to \ndevelop a comprehensive plan for reuse of the property and facilities. \nThe primary facilities at Winter Harbor are located on a beautiful and \nbreathtaking portion of the Maine coastline known as Schoodic Point. \nOnce the base closes, this legislation dictates that the Schoodic Point \nproperty will shift to the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction \nfor inclusion in Acadia National Park.\n  In preparation for this property transfer, the National Park Service \nhas initiated a plan to establish a Research and Education Center at \nthe site. This center will host educational programs and private and \npublic research facilities, becoming a source for meaningful employment \nand economic generation for the communities. However, the National Park \nService effort will not be achieved overnight and, like all programs, \nrequires adequate funding.\n  As such, this legislation was drafted to include financial provisions \nto ease and expedite this transition as well as to reimburse the \ncommunity for local services and infrastructure improvements.\n  In closing, I would like to thank all of those in the local \ncommunities, the State of Maine, the Navy, and the National Park \nService and, of course, my colleagues from the Maine Delegation for \ntheir assistance in crafting this legislation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this initiative and allow the good people of Winter Harbor and \nGouldsboro to make the most of this unique base reuse opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1108\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Amounts so credited shall be merged with funds \n     in the appropriation or account to which credited, and shall \n     be available for the same purposes, and subject to the same \n     conditions and limitations, as the funds with which merged.\n       (f) Reimbursement for Environmental and Other \n     Assessments.--(1) The Secretary of the Navy may require each \n     recipient of real property conveyed under subsection (b) to \n     reimburse the Secretary for the costs incurred by the \n     Secretary for any environmental assessment, study, or \n     analysis carried out by the Secretary with respect to such \n     property before completing the conveyance under that \n     subsection.\n       (2) The amount of any reimbursement required under \n     paragraph (1) shall be determined by the Secretary, but may \n     not exceed the cost of the assessment, study, or analysis for \n     which reimbursement is required.\n       (3) Section 2695(c) of title 10, United States Code, shall \n     apply to any amount received by the Secretary under this \n     subsection.\n       (g) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the real property transferred under subsection \n     (a), and each parcel of real property conveyed under \n     subsection (b), shall be determined by a survey satisfactory \n     to the Secretary of the Navy.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Snowe, today in introducing this \nlegislation, the Naval Security Group Activity at Winter Harbor \nConveyance Act. This conveyance legislation will authorize the transfer \nof land, which has been under the control of the Naval Security Group \nfor some seventy plus years back to the Department of the Interior, and \nto the State, ultimately to be put to good use by our local \ncommunities.\n  Over the past seven decades, the Navy has performed a key national \nsecurity mission called Classic Wizard at Winter Harbor. The Navy has \nplayed a significant role in the economic development of the local \ncommunities as Maine residents and Navy personnel have supported this \nmission. As the requirement for the Classic Wizard mission at Winter \nHarbor is coming to an end, and as technology advances, this naval \nactivity will be ending its ties to the base in the summer of 2002.\n  While the Navy will be missed, it has worked hand-in-hand with me and \nthe other members of the Maine delegation, the Department of Interior, \nNational Park Service, and our local communities in creating a viable \neconomic development and reuse plan for the naval base and its \nassociated property.\n  As part of its reuse plan for the site, the National Park Service has \nproposed developing a research and education center at the Schoodic \nPoint. The center would accommodate and promote a variety of research \nactivities including wildlife genetics and serve as a base for \npermanent and visiting scientists to conduct interdisciplinary \nresearch.\n  I worked with the National Park Service in the development of its \nproposal, and I have offered to help make the concept a reality. Maine \nGovernor Angus King shares my support for the proposed research and \nlearning center and has expressed the State's willingness to work as a \npartner in the effort to establish a wildlife genetics laboratory at \nthe center. We believe that such a laboratory would generate good jobs \nand promote the region's economy. The work done at Schoodic Point also \nwould compliment the world class research underway at other area \nfacilities in the area such as The Jackson Laboratory, the Mount Desert \nIsland Biological Laboratory, and the University of Maine's Cooperative \nAquaculture Research Center.\n  The National Park Service's proposed reuse of the peninsula also \nincludes an educational component that would promote the public's \nunderstanding of the important natural and cultural resources that are \na part of our national park system. Moreover, those who have visited \nSchoodic would agree that the remarkably beautiful 100 acres are worthy \nof being a part of Acadia National Park, one of our Nation's greatest \nnatural treasures.\n  It is important for the Federal Government to lend a hand to \ncommunities that are struggling to cope with the adverse effects of a \nbase closure. Our legislation, which was developed in consultation with \nthe local communities, the State, the Department of the Interior and \nthe Navy, provides the options and opportunities that the region needs \nto move beyond the loss of the Naval Security Group Activity at Winter \nHarbor. I will work to secure approval of this bill by the Senate Armed \nServices committee and the full Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 1110. A bill to require that the area of a zip code number shall \nbe located entirely within a State, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to announce the introduction of a \nbill that would help preserve the identity of American communities that \nhave struggled with the United States Postal Service to acquire their \nown, individual zip codes. The bill would do this by prohibiting the \nPostal Service from extending zip codes across State boundaries.\n  This bill was introduced in response to concerns raised by the \ncommunity of Alta, WY. Alta is a small, rural town situated next to the \nWyoming-Idaho border at the western base of the Grand Teton Mountains. \nBecause of treacherous travel conditions to the east of Alta, the \nPostal Service made the decision to serve Alta residents out of the \npost office in neighboring Driggs, ID. Alta is isolated from other \nparts of Wyoming and it simply would be too dangerous to require the \nPostal Service to cross the Teton mountain range in the winter to \ndeliver mail to Alta. In providing this service, however, the post \noffice has not provided Alta residents their own zip code at the Driggs \npost office, but has required them to use the Driggs zip code even \nthough Alta residents live in an entirely different State.\n  While this may not seem like a big deal on its face, there are a \nnumber of technical complications that arise in the lives of Alta \nresidents because the Postal Service has not been willing to extend the \ncourtesy of an Alta zip code.\n  By requiring Alta residents to use the Driggs zip code, the Postal \nService has created a lot of confusion for Alta residents who attempt \nto conduct business with mail order companies. What sales tax do they \npay? Idaho or Wyoming? Although the Postal Service maintains that zip \ncodes are not used to identify specific locations, other companies use \nzip codes as an important location code that is necessary to adequately \nconduct their business. Sales tax is often programmed by zip code, so \nare car insurance rates, life insurance, homeowner's insurance, even \nour Federal and State income taxes use zip codes as an indicator of \nwhen and where to pay taxes.\n  The requirements of this bill will not be onerous for the Postal \nService to implement. It will not require the service to build new \nfacilities or even to change its method of operations. All it will do \nis require the Postal Service to identify those communities whose mail \nservice crosses State boundaries and to assign them the necessary \nidentification number that they need to provide the rest of the world a \nclear and concise description of where they live and who they are.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this most important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Allard, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Burns, Ms. Collins, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mr. Helms, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr.\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\n        Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Thomas, and \n        Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1111. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to authorize the National Rural Development Partnership, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Conrad to \nintroduce the National Rural Development Partnership Act of 2001--a \nbill to codify the National Rural Development Partnership, NRDP or the \nPartnership, and provided a funding source for the program, I am \npleased that Senators Allard, Baucus, Bingaman, Burns, Collins, Crapo, \nDaschle, Dayton, Dorgan, Enzi, Gramm, Grassley, Hagel, Helms, \nHutchison, Jeffords, Johnson, Kennedy, Kerry, Leahy, Lugar, Mikulski, \nMurray, Ben Nelson, Reed, Roberts, Sarbanes, Bob Smith, Gordon Smith, \nThomas, and Wellstone are joining us as original cosponsors.\n  The Partnership was established under the Bush administration in \n1990, by Executive Order 12720. Although the partnership has existed \nfor ten years, it has never been formally authorized by Congress. The \ncurrent basis for the existence of the partnership is found in the \nConsolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 and the Rural \nDevelopment Policy Act of 1980. In addition, the conference committee \nreport on the 1996 federal farm bill created specific responsibilities \nand expectations for the partnership and State rural development \ncouncils, SRDCs.\n  The partnership is a nonpartisan interagency working group whose \nmission is to ``contribute to the vitality of the Nation by \nstrengthening the ability of all rural Americans to participate in \ndetermining their futures.'' The NRDP and SRDCs do something no other \nentities do: facilitate collaboration among federal agencies and \nbetween Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal governments and \nthe private and non-profit sectors to increase coordination of programs \nand services to rural areas. When successful, these efforts result in \nmore efficient use of limited rural development resources and actually \nadd value to the efforts and dollars of others.\n  On March 8, 2000, the Subcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and \nRural Revitalization, which I chaired, held an oversight hearing on the \noperations and accomplishments of the NRDP and SRDCs. The subcommittee \nheard from a number of witnesses, including officials of the U.S. \nDepartments of Agriculture, Transportation, and Health and Human \nServices, State agencies, and private sector representatives. The \nhearing established the need for some legislative foundation and \nconsistent funding. The legislation we introduced last year and are \nreintroducing this Congress accomplishes just that.\n  This legislation formally recognizes the existence and operations of \nthe partnership, the National Rural Development Coordinating Committee, \nNRDCC, and SRDCs. In addition, the legislation gives specific \nresponsibilities to each component of the Partnership and authorizes it \nto receive congressional appropriations.\n  Specifically, the bill formally establishes the NRDP and indicates it \nis composed of the NRDCC and SRDCs. NRDP is established for empowering \nand building the capacity of rural communities, encouraging \nparticipation in flexible and innovative methods of addressing the \nchallenges of rural areas, and encouraging all those involved in the \npartnership to be fully engaged and to share equally in decisionmaking. \nThis legislation also identifies the role of the Federal Government in \nthe partnership as being that of partner, coach, and facilitator. \nFederal agencies are called upon to designate senior-level officials to \nparticipate in the NRDCC and to encourage field staff to participate in \nSRDCs. Federal agencies are also authorized to enter into cooperative \nagreements with, and to provide grants and other assistance to, State \nrural development councils, regardless of the form of legal \norganization of a State rural development council.\n\n  The composition of the NRDCC is specified as being one representative \nfrom each Federal agency with rural responsibilities, and governmental \nand non-governmental for-profit and non-profit organizations that elect \nto participate in the NRDCC. The legislation outlines the duties of the \ncouncil as being to provide support to SRDCs; facilitate coordination \namong Federal agencies and between the Federal, State, local and tribal \ngovernments and private organizations; enhance the effectiveness, \nresponsiveness, and delivery of Federal Government programs; gather and \nprovide to Federal agencies information about the impact of government \nprograms on rural areas; review and comment on policies, regulations, \nand proposed legislation; provide technical assistance to SRDCs; and \ndevelop strategies for eliminating administrative and regulatory \nimpediments. Federal agencies do have the ability to opt out of \nparticipation in the council, but only if they can show how they can \nmore effectively serve rural areas without participating in the \npartnership and council.\n  This legislation provides that states may participate in the \npartnership by entering into a memorandum of understanding with USDA to \nestablish an SRDC. SRDCs are required to operate in a nonpartisan and \nnondiscriminatory manner and to reflect the diversity of the States \nwithin which they are organized. The duties of the SRDCs are to \nfacilitate collaboration among government agencies at all levels and \nthe private and non-profit sectors; to enhance the effectiveness, \nresponsiveness, and delivery of Federal and State Government programs; \nto gather information about rural areas in its State and share it with \nthe NRDCC and other entities; to monitor and report on policies and \nprograms that address, or fail to address, the needs of rural areas; to \nfacilitate the formulation of needs assessments for rural areas and \nparticipate in the development of the criteria for the distribution of \nFederal funds to rural areas; to provide comments to the NRDCC and \nothers on policies, regulations, and proposed legislation; assist the \nNRDCC in developing strategies for reducing or eliminating impediments; \nto hire an executive director and support staff; and to fundraise.\n  As I have stated before, this legislation authorizes the partnership \nto receive appropriations as well as authorizing and encouraging \nfederal agencies to make grants and provide other forms of assistance \nto the partnership and authorizing the partnership to accept private \ncontributions. The SRDCs are required to provide at least a 33-percent \nmatch for funds it receives as a result of its cooperative agreement \nwith the Federal Government.\n  As you know, too many parts of rural America have not shared in the \nboom that has brought great prosperity to urban America. We need to do \nmore to ensure that rural citizens will have opportunities similar to \nthose enjoyed by urban areas. To do so, we do not necessarily need new \ngovernment programs. Instead, we must do a better job of coordinating \nthe many programs available from USDA and other Federal agencies that \ncan benefit rural communities. With the passage of this legislation, \nthe NRDP and SRDCs will be better situated to provide that much needed \ncoordination.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Larry Craig \nand 31 of our colleagues today in the introduction of the National \nRural Development Partnership Act of 2001. This bill is similar to S. \n3175 which Senator Craig and I sponsored last year during the 106th \nCongress. I am pleased that so many members from both sides of the \naisle have recognized the importance of this measure by agreeing to \njoin as original cosponsors.\n  The National Rural Development Partnership had its origin in \nExecutive Order 12720, issued by President George H. Bush in 1990. \nThrough the issuance of this order, the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nwas assigned the responsibilities of creating the partnership and \nproviding assistance to States that wish to form rural development \npartnerships. The intent of the legislation is the same. At least 40 \nStates have now formed partnership councils to coordinate rural \ndevelopment activities of Federal, State, local, and tribal governments \nwith private and non-profit organizations, to address community and \neconomic development needs, and to coordinate community and job \nbuilding activities in rural areas. The funding for these activities \nhas been voluntary from various Federal agencies, including the \nDepartments of Health and Human Services, Labor, Transportation, \nVeterans, and state\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\nagencies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has historically provided \nthe largest single amount.\n  The needs of rural America are great. The demands on the Federal \nbudget are also great. If we are to make optimum use of hard-to-find \nFederal, State, local, and private resources in rural areas, it is \nimperative that we find ways to coordinate development activities. This \nlegislation does that. It formally authorizes National Rural \nDevelopment Councils and also authorizes appropriations for this \nprogram.\n  The existing partnerships are doing an outstanding job in \ncoordinating activities to enhance the quality of life and to build \njobs in areas that have historically lacked high paying opportunities. \nWhile we recognize the continuing importance of the agriculture \nindustry in many States, especially a State like North Dakota, we \nrecognize that, unless we diversify our economy, we will continue to \nsee out migration from the rural areas into the already crowded \nmetropolitan areas of our country.\n  Again, I am pleased to join this bipartisan effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself,Mr. Chafee, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Johnson, and \n        Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1112. A bill to provide Federal Perkins Loan cancellation for \npublic defenders; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I rise with Senator Chafee to \nreintroduce legislation to include full-time public defense attorneys \nin the Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation Forgiveness Program for law \nenforcement officers. This bill would provide parity to public defense \nattorneys and uphold the goals set forth by the Supreme Court to \nequalize access to legal resources. Senators Feinstein, Bingaman, \nAkaka, Kerry, Sarbanes, Johnson, and Inouye are original cosponsors of \nthis bipartisan bill. Representative Tom Campbell of California \nintroduced a companion bill in the House in the 106th Congress.\n  Under section 465(a)(2)(F) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, a \nborrower with a loan made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program is \neligible to have the loan canceled for serving full-time as a law \nenforcement officer or correction officer in a local, State, or Federal \nlaw enforcement or corrections agency. While the rules governing \nborrower eligibility for law enforcement cancellation have been \ninterpreted by the Department of Education to include prosecuting \nattorneys, public defenders have been excluded from the loan \nforgiveness program. This policy must be amended.\n  Like prosecutors, public defense attorneys play an integral role in \nour adversarial process. This judicial process is the most effective \nmeans of getting at truth and rendering justice. The United States \nSupreme Court in a series of cases has recognized the importance of the \nright to counsel in implementing the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a \nfair trial and the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause requiring \ncounsel to be appointed for all person accused of offenses in which \nthere is a possibility of a jail term being imposed.\n  Absent adequate counsel for all parties, there is a danger that the \noutcome maybe determined not by who has the most convincing case but by \nwho has the most resources. The Court rightly addressed this possible \nmiscarriage of justice by requiring counsel to be appointed for the \naccused. Public defenders fill this Court mandated role by representing \nthe interests of criminally accused indigent person. they give indigent \ndefendants sufficient resources to present an adequate defense, so that \nthe public goal of truth and justice will govern the outcome.\n  The Department of Education's interpretation of the statute to \ninclude public defenders from the loan forgiveness program undermines \nthe goals set forth by the Supreme Court to equalize access to legal \nresources. It creates an obvious disparity of resources between public \ndefenders and prosecutors by encouraging talented individuals to pursue \npublic service as prosecutors but not as defenders. The criminal \njustice system works best when both sides are adequately represented. \nThe public interest is served when indigent defendants have access to \ntalented defenders. One of the ways to facilitate this goal is by \ngranting loan cancellation benefits to defense attorneys.\n  Moreover, public defense attorneys meet all the eligibility \nrequirements of the loan forgiveness program as set forth in current \nFederal regulations. They belong to publicly funded public defender \nagencies and they are sworn officers of the court whose principal \nresponsibilities are unique to the criminal justice system and are \nessential in the performance of the agencies' primary mission. In \naddition, like prosecuting attorneys, public defenders are law \nenforcement officers dedicated to upholding, protecting, and enforcing \nour laws. Without public defense attorneys, the adversarial process of \nour criminal justice system could not operate.\n  I urge my colleague to join me, Senator Chafee, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Akaka, Senator Kerry, Senator Sarbanes, \nSenator Johnson, and Senator Inouye in supporting the goal of equalized \naccess to legal resources, as set forth in the Constitution and \nelucidated by the Supreme Court, by providing parity to public \ndefenders and allowing them to join prosecutors in receiving loan \ncancellation benefits.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FEDERAL PERKINS LOAN CANCELLATION FOR PUBLIC \n                   DEFENDERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Education has issued clarifications \n     that prosecuting attorneys are among the class of law \n     enforcement officers eligible for benefits under the Federal \n     Perkins Loan cancellation program.\n       (2) Like prosecutors, public defenders also meet all the \n     eligibility requirements of the Federal Perkins Loan \n     cancellation program as set forth in Federal regulations.\n       (3) Public defenders are law enforcement officers who play \n     an integral role in our Nation's adversarial legal process. \n     Public defenders fill the Supreme Court mandated role \n     requiring that counsel be appointed for the accused, by \n     representing the interests of criminally accused indigent \n     persons.\n       (4) In order to encourage highly qualified attorneys to \n     serve as public defenders, public defenders should be \n     included with prosecutors among the class of law enforcement \n     officers eligible to receive benefits under the Federal \n     Perkins Loan cancellation program.\n       (b) Amendment.--Section 465(a)(2)(F) of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087ee(a)(2)(F)) is amended \n     by inserting ``, or as a full-time public defender for \n     service to a local or State government, or to the Federal \n     Government (directly or by a contract with a private, \n     nonprofit organization)'' after ``agencies''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to--\n       (1) loans made under part E of title IV of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965, whether made before, on, or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) service as a public defender that is provided on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this section or the amendment \n     made by this section shall be construed to authorize the \n     refunding of any repayment of a loan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1113. A bill to amend section 1562 of title 38, United States \nCode, to increase the amount of Medal of Honor Roll special pension, to \nprovide for an annual adjustment in the amount of that special pension, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition at this time to \ncomment on legislation that I have introduced today to increase the \nspecial pension that is available to Medal of Honor recipients, and to \nprovide for automatic adjustments in that special pension to reflect \nannual increases in the cost of living. When the Congress enacted the \nMedal of Honor pension, it stated, in the 1916 Senate Report, Report \nNo. 240, 64th Congress, accompanying enactment, that the special \npension was then necessary to serve as a ``recognition of superior \nclaims on the gratitude of the country,'' and to ``reward . . . in a \nmodest way startling deeds of individual daring and audacious heroism \nin the face of mortal danger when war is on.'' The legislation that I \nhave introduced today has the same two purposes: to recognize, and to \nreward, the ``startling deeds of\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\nindividual daring and audacious heroism'' to which every Medal of Honor \nrecipient can lay claim.\n  No one can question that Medal of Honor recipients deserve the \nNation's respect and gratitude. And no one could question a limited \ngovernment pension is a proper sign of that respect and gratitude. I am \nconcerned that some of the 149 surviving Medal of Honor recipients, \nthere are only 149 such people among us, may struggle to make financial \nends meet, notwithstanding the availability of the pension. The current \n$600 monthly amount is simply too small, in my estimation, to afford a \nminimum standard of living for our Nation's heroes given their \nexpenses.\n  In 1997, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society suggested that the \nMedal of Honor pension level be set at $1,000 per month and that the \nlevel of the pension be adjusted thereafter on an annual basis to \nreflect increases in the annual cost of living. At that time, the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which I then had the privilege \nof chairing, succeeded in securing an increase in the pension from $400 \nto $600 per month, but we were not successful in persuading the House \nto approve an ``indexation'' feature. I believe a compelling argument \ncould be made then, and still can be made now, to grant the entire \nincrease suggested by the Congressional Medal of Honor Society and to \napprove the indexing of the benefit. I am pleased to offer legislation \nto that effect today.\n  Many Medal of Honor recipients, out of a sense of duty and \npatriotism, make frequent trips to provide accounts of their act of \nvalor and, more importantly, to speak of the lessons learned in battle \nand the vigilance that freedom requires to this day. Countless young \nAmericans have benefitted by the example of these most distinguished \nrole models. Often, the expenses associated with these excursions are \nborne by the medal of Honor recipients themselves, men who, we must \nremember, emerged from, and, in most cases, returned to, the ordinary \ncitizenry from whom America has always drawn her warriors. Testimony \noffered by AMVETS at a Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing on July 25, \n1997, confirmed that the majority of Medal of Honor recipients live \nonly on their social security benefits, supplemented by the Medal of \nHonor pension, giving them an average monthly income of only $1,600. It \nis unconscionable to think that we, as a country, can allow them to \nlive so close to the poverty line.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me, once again, to show our \ngratitude to the recipients of our Nation's highest honor. Let us show \nthem--in this minor way--how grateful America truly is for their \nwonderful example.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1113\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASE AND ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT OF MEDAL OF HONOR \n                   ROLL SPECIAL PENSION.\n\n       (a) Increase in Amount.--Subsection (a) of section 1562 of \n     title 38, United States Code, is amended by striking ``$600'' \n     and inserting ``$1,000, as adjusted from time to time under \n     subsection (e),''.\n       (b) Annual Adjustment.--That section is further amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Effective as of December 1 each year, the Secretary \n     shall increase the amount of monthly special pension payable \n     under subsection (a) as of November 30 of such year by the \n     same percentage that benefit amounts payable under title II \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) are \n     increased effective December 1 of such year as a result of a \n     determination under section 215(i) of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n     415(i)).''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--(1) Except as provided in paragraph \n     (2), the amendments made by this section shall take effect on \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply with \n     respect to months that begin on or after that date.\n       (2) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall not make any \n     adjustment under subsection (e) of section 1562 of title 38, \n     United States Code, as added by subsection (b) of this \n     section, in 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1114. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nthe amount of educational benefits for veterans under the Montgomery GI \nBill; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition at this time to \ncomment briefly on legislation that I am introducing today to increase \neducational benefits paid to veterans under the Montgomery GI bill, \nMGIB. This bill is the same as a bill, H.R. 1291, that was passed by \nthe House, under the leadership of the chairman of the House Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, Representative Chris Smith, on June 19, 2001, by \na vote of 416-0. I introduce the same legislation here in the Senate, \nand I urge my colleagues to join with me to complete the task of \nincreasing veterans' Montgomery GI bill benefits.\n  This legislation, once it is fully phased in over a three year \nperiod, would increase the basic monthly benefit paid to veterans with \nat least three years of service who have returned to school from $650 \nto $1,100. With this 85 percent increase in MGIB benefits, the largest \npercentage increase in the history of the Montgomery GI bill, a veteran \nwith three years of service would be able to afford the average cost of \ntuition, fees, books, and room and board at a four-year public college \nor university, and still have money left over for transportation \nexpenses or other personal expenses. The legislation would provide \ngreater educational freedom for veterans who are constrained by the \ncurrent benefit amount; it would open up the possibility of attendance \nat more expensive universities. And it would promote the national \nsecurity interests of the United States by providing a substantial \ninducement for young men and women to serve in the military.\n  When I became chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nat the start of the 105th Congress in 1997, I committed to increasing \nMGIB benefits which, due to budget constraints, had been woefully \ninadequate. I am pleased to report that that picture has changed; the \nbasic MGIB benefit has increased by 52 percent from $427 to 650 per \nmonth, and in addition, service members now have the opportunity to \n``buy-up'' an additional $150 in monthly benefits, bringing the total \nlevel of available benefits to $800 per month, an increase of 87 \npercent since 1997. Despite this significant progress, however, I \nremain concerned that the benefit usage rate among young veterans is \ntoo low, and that it may not yet be a sufficient inducement to assist \nthe Department of Defense in recruiting high quality young men and \nwomen to serve in the military.\n  Of the young veterans eligible for MGIB benefits, only 57 percent \nchoose to avail themselves of this extraordinary opportunity. According \nto a recent report by the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, a \nsignificant reason for this relatively low usage rate is the inadequacy \nof the benefit amount. MGIB benefits have simply not kept pace with \nrising education costs. As a consequence, veterans who use the benefit \nmust compromise on the educational programs they select; a low \npercentage of MGIB users, only 12 percent, attend private institutions, \nand a relatively high percentage of MGIB users, 27 percent, enroll in \ntwo-year college programs. Now I do not undervalue the role, \ncontributions, or quality of our two-year colleges. The fact is, \nhowever, that many veterans who would choose to attend four-year \ninstitutions, even public institutions, cannot afford to do so with the \ncurrent level of benefits. My legislation would move us closer to the \nday when the only limitation on veterans' educational choice would be \ntheir own interests and aspirations.\n  One of the primary purposes of the MGIB is to assist the Department \nof Defense, DOD with service member recruitment. When DOD asked new \nrecruits in 1997 to list the reasons they joined the military, money \nfor college ranked second only to ``a chance to better myself in life'' \namong the answers given. Even so, tight labor market and the \navailability of other Federal education aid have resulted in DOD \ndifficulty in meeting recruiting goals. The Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Force Management Policy reports that a benefit level ``of \napproximately $1,000 per month . . . would increase high-quality \naccessions without having a negative impact on reenlistments. . . .'' \nThus, my proposed legislation, which would, in phases, increase\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\nthe monthly benefit to $1,100, is consistent with DOD's position that \nincreased MGIB benefits are necessary for it to attract high-quality \nrecruits.\n  Attracting high-quality young men and women into the military is not \nonly in the interest of the Department of Defense, it is in the \nnational interest of all of our citizens. The United States Commission \non National Security/21st Century, chaired by our former colleagues, \nSenators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman, recently called on Congress to \nenhance national security by ``significantly enhanc[ing] the Montgomery \nGI Bill'' by providing a benefit that would pay for the average \neducation costs of four-year U.S. colleges. The Commission emphasized \nthat the ``GI bill is both a strong recruitment tool and, more \nimportantly, a valuable institutional reward for service to the nation \nin uniform.'' I thank the Commission for recognizing the important role \nthe GI bill has played, and will continue to play, in ensuring the \nsecurity of our country.\n  I commend the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nRepresentative Chris Smith, who has taken the lead on this issue in the \nHouse during this first year of his chairmanship.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto making progress toward the goal of eliminating tuberculosis, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator Hutchison, and Senator Corzine \nin introducing the Comprehensive Tuberculosis Elimination Act. This \nbipartisan legislation will provide enhanced authority and greater \nresources to State, local and Federal health officials to do all they \ncan to combat this deadly infectious disease in our country.\n  Tuberculosis is the world's leading infectious killer. Its growth has \nbeen propelled by the global HIV epidemic, and multi-drug resistant \nstrains have become increasingly prevalent around the world. The World \nHealth Organization estimates that more than one-third of the world's \npopulation is infected with tuberculosis. Every year, there are 8 \nmillion new cases of active tuberculosis and 2 million deaths from \ntuberculosis. This disease causes more deaths among women worldwide \nthan all other causes of maternal death combined.\n  These harrowing statistics illustrate the truth behind the saying \nthat diseases know no borders. Senators Inouye, Stevens, and Hutchison \nand I have already introduced the Stop TB Now Act, which focuses on \ninternational tuberculosis control. The bill we are introducing today \nwill deal with tuberculosis in our own country. Only through enactment \nof both of these measures can we be sure of defeating this readily \ntreatable and preventable disease.\n  Today's bill is intended to fulfill the recommendations of the \nlandmark report issued by the Institute of Medicine last year, entitled \n``Ending Neglect: The Elimination of Tuberculosis in the United \nStates.'' Our measure will create a national plan for the eradication \nof tuberculosis. It will enhance tuberculosis-related research, \neducation and training through the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. It will also expand support for vaccine research and for \ninternational tuberculosis research through the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  In the United States, tuberculosis has been going through what the \nInstitute of Medicine calls ``recurrent cycles of neglect'' by public \nhealth authorities, ``followed by resurgence'' of the disease. In the \nlate nineteenth century, tuberculosis was one of the leading causes of \ndeath in America. As cities swelled with waves of European immigration, \nmillions of individuals and families were forced into overcrowded \ntenements and unhealthy workplaces. Many fell victim to outbreaks of \ndeadly infectious diseases. In 1886, the leading cause of death among \ninfants was tuberculosis, followed by infant diarrhea.\n  Although medical science and public health were in their infancy in \nthose days, the need to combat tuberculosis was clear even then. In \n1882, Robert Kock first isolated the organism that causes this disease, \nproviding physicians and scientists with a microbial foundation for \nscience-based public health action. In the early twentieth century, \nhealth advocates and physicians formed an association dedicated to \nfighting tuberculosis, which today is the American Lung Association. \nTheir work helped to bring about more sanitary living conditions and \nworkplaces for the poor, stronger public health laws, and the use of \nsanatoriums to treat people with tuberculosis.\n  In this century, the possibility of actually eradicating tuberculosis \narose following the development of effective antibiotics in the 1950s. \nBut the country failed to capitalize on scientific opportunities or \nundertake the kind of broad public health campaign that we undertook so \nsuccessfully against polio. As a result, scientific interest and public \nhealth funding for tuberculosis control waned in the following decades. \nAfter years of decline, specific Federal funding for tuberculosis \ncontrol was actually eliminated in 1972.\n  Our country paid the price for this complacency in the 1980s. A \nresurgence of cases and an alarming growth in the prevalence of drug-\nresistant tuberculosis strains challenged public health and shook the \nconfidence of experts. Through great effort and difficulty, we renewed \nour national commitment to fighting tuberculosis. But the effort took \nlonger than necessary, and the Nation suffered needless deaths and \nillness as we worked to bring the number of new tuberculosis cases to \nits current, all-time low.\n  Today, we have a historic opportunity to eradicate tuberculosis in \nthe United States. We have a generation of public health officials who \nhave lived through and successfully combated the recent resurgence of \nthe disease. And we have expert recommendations from both the Federal \nAdvisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis and the Institute \nof Medicine to guide our efforts.\n  This legislation is supported by leading public health organizations, \nincluding the American Lung Association, the American Thoracic Society, \nthe National Coalition to Eliminate Tuberculosis and RESULTS \nInternational. Its enactment can be an essential in achieving to \nfulfilling this important and long overdue public health goal, and I \nurge the Senate to approve it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, and Mr. Corzine):\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\n  S. 1116. A bill amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide \nincreased foreign assistance for tuberculosis prevention, treatment, \nand control; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Stevens, Senator Kennedy, Senator Hutchison, and Senator \nCorzine, to introduce the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act of 2001, a bill \nthat responds to the dire need of the United States and the rest of the \nworld to stop the terrible infection that is threatening citizens in \nevery country of the world.\n  Tuberculosis is the biggest killer of young women and people with \nAIDS in the world today, and two million people will die of \ntuberculosis this year alone. Although tuberculosis is preventable and \ntreatable, last year there were more than 17,000 new cases of \ntuberculosis in the U.S. Among these cases were new strains of \ntuberculosis that are resistant to many traditional antibiotics that \nwere very successful in the past. Due to its infectious and resistant \nnature, tuberculosis cannot be stopped at national borders, and \nvirtually every international airport in the U.S. therefore is a port \nof entry for carriers of tuberculosis. Thus, it will be impossible to \ncontrol tuberculosis in the U.S. until we control it worldwide.\n  Because of this dire situation, we are introducing the ``Stop \nTuberculosis Now Act,'' which calls for a U.S. investment in \ninternational tuberculosis control of $200 million in 2002, with a \nfocus on expanding the proven, low cost direct observation therapy \nsystem, DOTS, tuberculosis treatment for countries with high rates of \ntuberculosis infection. DOTS tuberculosis treatment involves a health \nworker observing and ensuring tuberculosis patients take their \nprescribed medication that is needed to stop a tuberculosis infection \nsuccessfully. The current projection for implementing an international \ntuberculosis treatment program is $1 billion. The U.S. share of this \nprogram would be $200 million. This is a small price to pay in order to \nstop this terrible infectious disease which brings such misery and \ndeath, to the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n  This bill would amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and declare \nthat a major objective of the U.S. foreign assistance program is to \ncontrol tuberculosis. Congress would designate the World Health \nOrganization and other health organizations to develop and implement a \ncomprehensive tuberculosis control program, including expanding the use \nof the strategy of DOTS tuberculosis treatment method and strategies to \naddress multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. The particular focus of this \nprogram would be in countries with the highest rates of tuberculosis \ninfection. The program would set as goals the cure of at least 95 \npercent of tuberculosis cases detected and the reduction of \ntuberculosis related deaths by 50 percent, by December 31, 2010.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the test the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1116\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Tuberculosis (TB) Now \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1)(A) Tuberculosis is one of the greatest infectious \n     causes of death of adults worldwide, killing 2,000,000 people \n     per year--one person every 15 seconds.\n       (B) Globally, tuberculosis is the leading cause of death of \n     young women and the leading cause of death of people with \n     HIV/AIDS.\n       (2) An estimated 8,000,000 individuals develop active \n     tuberculosis each year.\n       (3) Tuberculosis is spreading as a result of inadequate \n     treatment and it is a disease that knows no national borders.\n       (4) With over 40 percent of tuberculosis cases in the \n     United States attributable to foreign-born individuals and \n     with the increase in international travel, commerce, and \n     migration, elimination of tuberculosis in the United States \n     depends on efforts to control the disease in developing \n     countries.\n       (5) The threat that tuberculosis poses for Americans \n     derives from the global spread of tuberculosis and the \n     emergence and spread of strains of multi-drug resistant \n     tuberculosis (MDR-TB).\n       (6) Up to 50,000,000 individuals may be infected with \n     multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.\n       (7) In the United States, tuberculosis treatment, normally \n     about $2,000 per patient, skyrockets to as much as $250,000 \n     per patient to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and \n     treatment may not even be successful.\n       (8) Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis kills more than one-\n     half of those individuals infected in the United States and \n     other industrialized nations and without access to treatment \n     it is a virtual death sentence in the developing world.\n       (9) There is a highly effective and inexpensive treatment \n     for tuberculosis. Recommended by the World Health \n     Organization as the best curative method for tuberculosis, \n     this strategy, known as directly observed treatment, short \n     course (DOTS), includes low-cost effective diagnosis, \n     treatment, monitoring, and recordkeeping, as well as a \n     reliable drug supply. A centerpiece of DOTS is observing \n     patients to ensure that they take their medication and \n     complete treatment.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION, TREATMENT, \n                   AND CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Additional Prevention, Treatment, and Control.--Section \n     104(c)(7)(A) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2151b(c)(7)(A)) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by adding at the end before the \n     semicolon the following: ``, by expanding the use of the \n     strategy known as directly observed treatment, short course \n     (DOTS) and strategies to address multi-drug resistant \n     tuberculosis (MDR-TB) where appropriate at the local level, \n     particularly in countries with the highest rate of \n     tuberculosis''; and\n       (2) in clause (ii)--\n       (A) by inserting after ``the cure of at least 95 percent of \n     the cases detected'' the following: ``by focusing efforts on \n     the use of the directly observed treatment, short course \n     (DOTS) strategy or other internationally accepted primary \n     tuberculosis control strategies''; and\n       (B) by striking ``and the cure'' and inserting ``the \n     cure''.\n       (b) Funding Requirement.--Section 104(c)(7) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(c)(7)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C); \n     and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:\n       ``(B) In carrying out this paragraph, not less than 75 \n     percent of the amount appropriated pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations under subparagraph (D) shall \n     be used for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis for \n     at-risk and affected populations utilizing directly observed \n     treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy or other \n     internationally accepted primary tuberculosis control \n     strategies developed in consultation with the World Health \n     Organization (WHO), including funding for the Global \n     Tuberculosis Drug Facility of WHO's Stop TB Partnership.''.\n       (c) Annual Report.--Section 104(c)(7) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(c)(7)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) (as redesignated by \n     this Act) as subparagraph (D); and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following:\n       ``(C) In conjunction with the transmission of the annual \n     request for enactment of authorizations and appropriations \n     for foreign assistance programs for each fiscal year, the \n     President shall transmit to Congress a report that contains a \n     summary of all programs, projects, and activities carried out \n     under this paragraph for the preceding fiscal year, including \n     a description of the extent to which such programs, projects, \n     and activities have made progress to achieve the goals \n     described in subparagraph (A)(ii).''.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--Subparagraph (D) of \n     section 104(c)(7) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2151b(c)(7)), as redesignated by this Act, is amended \n     by striking ``$60,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2001 \n     and 2002'' and inserting ``$60,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 \n     and $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2002''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1117. A bill to establish the policy of the United States for \nreducing the number of nuclear warheads in the United States and \nRussian arsenals, for reducing the number of nuclear weapons of those \ntwo nations that are on high alert, and for expanding and accelerating \nprograms to prevent diversion and proliferation of Russian nuclear \nweapons, fissile materials, and nuclear expertise; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, when Winston Churchill addressed the \nstudent body at Westminister College in 1946, he declared to the United \nStates that ``with primacy of power is also joined an awe-inspiring \naccountability to the future . . . you must not only feel the sense of \nduty done, but also the anxiety lest you fall below that level of \nachievement.'' Over the course of the cold war, we did not fail in our \nduty, nor should we in the new century.\n  In the same speech he laid before the whole world the rhetoric that \nwould define the cold war. In describing the Sphere of Soviet dominance \nin Eastern Europe, Mr. Churchill described an Iron Curtain which the \nancient capitals of Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest were\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\nheld. With the fall of communism in the early part of the last decade, \nthe United States has had to re-shape its review of Eastern Europe. No \nlonger do we view the countries of Poland, the Czech Republic, or \nHungary as isolated adversaries, but as partners in the very alliance \nthat carried us through the cold war. In the same way that we have \nlooked to reforming our relationship with the countries of the old \nWarsaw Pact we must find new ways to view Russia. It is difficult to \nfathom that in the 21st century we view Russia as a declared ally on \nthe world stage while maintaining a nuclear posture at home which \ntreats her as an enemy. It is time that we transform our nuclear \ndoctrine from one that reflects the thinking of the cold war to one \nthat fits in the context of the 21st century and addresses what is \nperhaps the greatest threat to our security.\n  When President Bush met with Mr. Putin a few weeks ago, he expressed \nthat the United States and Russia can find a ``common position'' on a \n``new strategic framework''. President Bush declared that the two \ncountries are friends and that it is time for the U.S. and Russia to \nact that way. In context of this historic meeting, it is time that we \n``work together to address the world as it is, not as it used to be, it \nis important that we not only talk differently, we must also act \ndifferently.''\n  I rise today to introduce legislation that would direct the President \nto seek in his own words: `` . . . a broad strategy of active non-\nproliferation . . . to deny weapons of terror from those seeking to \nacquire them . . . and to work with allies and friends who wish to join \nus to defend against the harm they, WMD can inflict''\n  The Nuclear threat Reduction Act of 2001, NTRA, would make it the \npolicy of the United States to reduce the number of nuclear warheads \nand delivery systems held by the U.S. and Russia through bilateral \nagreements. These reductions should fall to the lowest possible number \nconsistent with national security. It would enable the President to \nreduce our nuclear stockpile while negotiating such reductions with the \nRussians that are transparent, predictable and verifiable. To do such a \nthing would be a mark of principled leadership. It would acknowledge \nthat it is no longer necessary to maintain large stockpiles of nuclear \narms by the United States and Russia and that to continue to do so \nwould be unacceptable.\n  On May 23,2000 President Bush stated ``The premises of cold war \ntargeting should no longer dictate the size of our arsenal.'' I could \nnot agree with the President more. The current level of nuclear weapons \nmaintained by the United States comes at a great cost to ourselves \nfinancially and poses a significant threat to our security. The level \nof nuclear protection that we maintain forces the Russians to keep a \nsimilarly robust force which they cannot afford. The crumbling \ninfrastructure of the Russian Military continually raises the risk of \naccidental launch or greater proliferation. Indeed, the legislation \nbeing considered today would ensure that once parts of the Russian \narsenal are dismantled, they will be kept safe, they will be accounted \nfor, and they will eventually be destroyed.\n  The savings from reducing our nuclear arsenal are substantial. A \nrecent CBO report estimated that $1.67 billion could be saved by \nretiring 50 MX Peacekeeper missiles by 2003. We could use this money to \naddress shortfalls in our conventional capabilities. Additionally, we \ncan devote more funds to meeting the asymmetrical threats that will \nface us in the future. To invest in deterrents to cyberwarfare and to \naugment spending on homeland defense would be the best way to transform \nour thinking and spending from the Cold War to the twenty-first \ncentury.\n  In addition to this, the Nuclear Threat Reduction Act would encourage \nthe U.S. and Russia to take their systems off of high-alert status. In \nthe context of the cold war, such a strategy was necessary to ensure \nour security, but it no longer applies to present conditions.\n  The Nuclear Threat Reduction Act would also embolden existing \nDepartment of State, Energy, and Defense programs that seek to contain \nexisting nuclear weapons material and expertise in Russia. The economic \nsituation in Russia makes it more and more likely that a rouge state \nwill acquire the means to manufacture nuclear weapons. This could come \nthrough the distribution of nuclear material or the exodus of Russian \nscientists. Our former colleague Sen Nunn put it best when he said ``We \ndare not risk a world where a Russian scientist can take care of his \nchildren by endangering ours.'' The cost to the United States is \nminuscule compared to the threat of nuclear proliferation. Work on this \nserious issue has already been addressed by the Nunn-Lugar bill, but it \nis time that we further our efforts.\n  In January of this year, a task force headed by Howard Baker and \nLloyd Cutler issued a report calling the proliferation of the Russian \nnuclear stockpile ``The most serious threat to national security we \nface today''. The Baker-Cutler Task Force strongly endorsed existing \nnon-proliferation programs and suggested that their goals could be \nachieved in 8-10 years if they are fully funded. Increased support for \nthese programs will certainly bring them more in line with the \nimmediacy and scope of the dangers that they address.\n  The NTRA requires the President to formulate and submit to Congress a \nstrategic plan to secure and neutralize Russia's nuclear weapons and \nweapons-usable materials over the next eight years. The plan would have \nto include the administrative and organizational reforms necessary to \nprovide effective coordination of these programs and to reflect the \npriority that the President attaches to them. The President himself has \nadvocated such a strategy and I call on him to implement it.\n  Finally, the NTRA requires the President to submit a report to \nCongress on the feasibility of establishing a ``debt for security'' \nprogram with Russia. Under this concept, a portion of Russia's debts to \nvarious major powers would be forgiven in exchange for a Russian \ncommitment to devoting those funds to non-proliferation activities. If \nsuccessful, such a program could significantly help Russia's secure, \naccount for, and neutralize its weapons materials.\n  In closing, The Nuclear Reduction Act of 2001 would help us fulfill \nthe duty that comes with being the world's last remaining super power. \nBy preventing the spread of nuclear materials and technology, reducing \nthe nuclear stockpiles of the United States and Russia, and by taking \nour missiles off of high-alert status, we can fulfill that duty. I ask \nthe other Members of the Senate to join me in support of this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/27/senate-section/article/S7002-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 819.

PREEMPTION; STATE FLEXIBILITY; CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Continued Applicability of State Law With Respect to \n     Health Insurance Issuers.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), this title shall \n     not be construed to supersede any provision of State law \n     which establishes, implements, or continues in effect any \n     standard or requirement solely relating to health \n     insurance issuers (in connection with group health \n     insurance coverage or otherwise) except to the extent that \n     such standard or requirement prevents the application of a \n     requirement of this title.\n       (2) Continued preemption with respect to group health \n     plans.--Nothing in this title shall be construed to affect or \n     modify the provisions of section 514 of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 with respect to group \n     health plans.\n       (3) Construction.--In applying this section, a State law \n     that provides for equal access to, and availability of, all \n     categories of licensed health care providers and services \n     shall not be treated as preventing the application of any \n     requirement of this title.\n       (b) Application of Substantially Compliant State Laws.--\n       (1) In general.--In the case of a State law that imposes, \n     with respect to health insurance coverage offered by a health \n     insurance issuer and with respect to a group health plan that \n     is a non-Federal governmental plan, a requirement that \n     substantially complies (within the meaning of subsection (c)) \n     with a patient protection requirement (as defined in \n     paragraph (3)) and does not prevent the application of other \n     requirements under this Act (except in the case of other \n     substantially compliant requirements), in applying the \n     requirements of this title under section 2707 and 2753 (as \n     applicable) of the Public Health Service Act (as added by \n     title II), subject to subsection (a)(2)--\n       (A) the State law shall not be treated as being superseded \n     under subsection (a); and\n       (B) the State law shall apply instead of the patient \n     protection requirement otherwise applicable with respect to \n     health insurance coverage and non-Federal governmental plans.\n       (2) Limitation.--In the case of a group health plan covered \n     under title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     of 1974, paragraph (1) shall be construed to apply only with \n     respect to the health insurance coverage (if any) offered in \n     connection with the plan.\n       (3) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (A) Patient protection requirement.--The term ``patient \n     protection requirement'' means a requirement under this \n     title, and includes (as a single requirement) a group or \n     related set of requirements under a section or similar unit \n     under this title.\n       (B) Substantially compliant.--The terms ``substantially \n     compliant'', substantially complies'', or ``substantial \n     compliance'' with respect to a State law, mean that the State \n     law has the same or similar features as the patient \n     protection requirements and has a similar effect.\n       (c) Determinations of Substantial Compliance.--\n       (1) Certification by states.--A State may submit to the \n     Secretary a certification that a State law provides for \n     patient protections that are at least substantially compliant \n     with one or more patient protection requirements. Such \n     certification shall be accompanied by such information as may \n     be required to permit the Secretary to make the determination \n     described in paragraph (2)(A).\n       (2) Review.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall promptly review a \n     certification submitted under paragraph (1) with respect to a \n     State law to determine if the State law substantially \n     complies with the patient protection requirement (or \n     requirements) to which the law relates.\n       (B) Approval deadlines.--\n       (i) Initial review.--Such a certification is considered \n     approved unless the Secretary notifies the State in writing, \n     within 90 days after the date of receipt of the \n     certification, that the certification is disapproved (and the \n     reasons for disapproval) or that specified additional \n     information is needed to make the determination described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (ii) Additional information.--With respect to a State that \n     has been notified by the Secretary under clause (i) that \n     specified additional information is needed to make the \n     determination described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary \n     shall make the determination within 60 days after the date on \n     which such specified additional information is received by \n     the Secretary.\n       (3) Approval.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall approve a \n     certification under paragraph (1) unless--\n       (i) the State fails to provide sufficient information to \n     enable the Secretary to make a determination under paragraph \n     (2)(A); or\n       (ii) the Secretary determines that the State law involved \n     does not provide for patient protections that substantially \n     comply with the patient protection requirement (or \n     requirements) to which the law relates.\n       (B) State challenge.--A State that has a certification \n     disapproved by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) may \n     challenge such disapproval in the appropriate United States \n     district court.\n       (C) Deference to states.--With respect to a certification \n     submitted under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give \n     deference to the State's interpretation of the State law \n     involved and the compliance of the law with a patient \n     protection requirement.\n       (D) Public notification.--The Secretary shall--\n       (i) provide a State with a notice of the determination to \n     approve or disapprove a certification under this paragraph;\n       (ii) promptly publish in the Federal Register a notice that \n     a State has submitted a certification under paragraph (1);\n       (iii) promptly publish in the Federal Register the notice \n     described in clause (i) with respect to the State; and\n       (iv) annually publish the status of all States with respect \n     to certifications.\n       (4) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed as preventing the certification (and approval of \n     certification) of a State law under this subsection solely \n     because it provides for greater protections for patients than \n     those protections otherwise required to establish substantial \n     compliance.\n       (5) Petitions.--\n       (A) Petition process.--Effective on the date on which the \n     provisions of this Act become effective, as provided for in \n     section 401, a group health plan, health insurance issuer, \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee may submit a petition \n     to the Secretary for an advisory opinion as to whether or not \n     a standard or requirement under a State law applicable to the \n     plan, issuer, participant, beneficiary, or enrollee that is \n     not the subject of a certification under this subsection, is \n     superseded under subsection (a)(1) because such standard or \n     requirement prevents the application of a requirement of this \n     title.\n       (B) Opinion.--The Secretary shall issue an advisory opinion \n     with respect to a petition submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     within the 60-day period beginning on the date on which such \n     petition is submitted.\n       (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) State law.--The term ``State law'' includes all laws, \n     decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having \n     the effect of law, of any State. A law of the United States \n     applicable only to the District of Columbia shall be treated \n     as a State law rather than a law of the United States.\n       (2) State.--The term ``State'' includes a State, the \n     District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, \n     American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, any political \n     subdivisions of such, or any agency or instrumentality of \n     such.\n       On page 132, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 203.
