Mr. President, we have many important issues to consider in \nthe limited time left in our legislative calendar, and therefore it is \nimportant we decide what our priorities must be.\n  President Bush has focused, in recent weeks, on Iraq, announcing his \nplans to send American troops there to accomplish the goal of a regime \nchange. We have focused on the situation in Iraq now for about 3 weeks, \nor maybe more.\n  During the Presidency of his father, I was the first Democrat to \nannounce publicly I would support the invasion in Desert Storm. I have \nno regret having done that. But there are, at this time, a number of \nquestions that I think must be answered.\n  I expressed personally to the President on Wednesday in the White \nHouse that I thought there was a model to follow. It is a model that \nwas created by President Bush, his father, and that model is one where \nthere is support from the United Nations, the world community. The \npeople of this country supported the action President Bush had taken, \nand the Congress supported that action. That is a model that I think is \none of success.\n  There have been some in the administration who have said we don't \nneed help. I am happy to see the President has reached out to the Prime \nMinister of Great Britain and met with him Saturday at Camp David. \nToday he is going to meet with the President of France. That is \nimportant. He needs to do that.\n  But we have to be very careful--and that is an understatement--in \nsending men and women into battle. We have about 12,000 or 13,000 \ntroops stationed in Nevada at Nellis Air Force, Fallon Naval Air \nTraining Center, and at the Hawthorn Ammunition Depot.\n  I want to make sure these people and others who serve in the Armed \nForces are sent to do the right thing. I think we have to be very \ncareful in what we are doing in this instance. I don't know what \nvalidity should be placed on it but certainly some. One American \ninspector was quoted in all the national press today as saying Saddam \nHussein does not have the ability at this time to do anything regarding \nweapons of mass destruction. A case has to be made for that.\n  I am certainly standing by with an open mind, looking forward to \nwhatever the President and his people bring forward. But I think the \nburden of proof is that we have to have a case made to us.\n  We represent the American people, as does the President. We are \nseparate branches of Government, but they are equal in nature. We have \na role to fill. He has a role to fill. And to this point, there have \nnot been Members of Congress--Democrats or Republicans--convinced that \nwould be the right thing to do.\n  I think we all have open minds. The American people all have open \nminds, and we want to do the right thing.\n  I repeat for the third time today: I am willing to listen to the \nPresident. I have listened to the President. I have a record--I am not \nembarrassed--about supporting his father. I am not a big fan of the War \nPowers Act. I felt that way in the House; I feel that way in the \nSenate. This is more than the War Powers Act. This is a situation where \nwe must have the support of the international community, at least some \nin the international community, and we must have the support of the \nAmerican people. The President must have our support before there is an \nincursion into Iraq.\n  I acknowledge that Saddam Hussein is a bad person. He has gassed his \nown people. He has killed his own blood. He is a vicious, evil man. I \nam ready to do whatever is necessary to protect the American people and \nbring about stability. But we have to wait until those different \nrequirements are met before we do that.\n  In the meantime, we cannot be Johnny one-note. We have to do what is \nnecessary to be done in Iraq but also understand the American people \nface a tremendous domestic crisis. The economy continues to struggle. \nThe American people are concerned about losing jobs, investment, \nretirement savings. America's slumping economy has severely impacted \nworking families and retirees.\n  Two of the major economic concerns we in Nevada have are that we have \nto be convinced our pensions are safe and that the cost of health care \nis debated, including prescription drugs. We passed strong legislation, \nled by the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, regarding corporate \naccountability. We will soon take up pension protection to provide \nadditional security for American workers and retirees. Earlier this \nsummer the Senate passed the greater access to affordable \npharmaceuticals legislation. It didn't do everything I think should be \ndone, but it did take some important first steps.\n  It didn't do a lot to deal with the Medicare prescription drug \nprogram. We should have as a component of Medicare prescription drugs. \nIt is not right that seniors are struggling. It is not right that we, \nthe only superpower in the world, have a medical program for senior \ncitizens that does not include prescription drugs, even though the \naverage senior citizen has 18 prescriptions filled every year. We need \nto take care of that.\n  The legislation we did pass, the greater access to affordable \npharmaceuticals, would lower prescription drug prices because it would \nstop pharmaceutical company abuses that prevent generic drug \ncompetition. It would allow pharmacists, wholesalers, and consumers to \nimport prescription drugs from Canada at a lower price than they can \nfind in the United States, and it would allow States to extend Medicare \nrebates and discounts for prescription drugs to residents who don't \nhave drug coverage--not everything, but certainly it is a step in the \nright direction.\n  I have previously shared the stories of Nevadans struggling to pay \nfor prescription drugs they need to stay healthy and to live quality, \npain-free lives. The legislation the Senate passed will help make \nlifesaving and life-enhancing medicines more affordable and thus more \naffordable to Nevadans and all Americans. Unless we enact the Schumer-\nMcCain bill this year, consumers will not get any relief from the \nskyrocketing cost of drugs. The Senate has passed this important \nlegislation. Now Americans are looking to the House to do likewise. \nWithout this bill, drug prices will continue to drain the budget of \neveryone--the elderly, the uninsured, State governments, employers, \nlabor unions, and other groups--all because brand-name drug companies \nhave abused loopholes in the law and have profited handsomely.\n\n  The average price paid for a prescription for brand-name drugs is \nthree times the prescription price of generics. This means the average \nconsumer pays about $45 more for each brand-name prescription. The \nsavings that this legislation we passed provides will really add up.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would \nsave American consumers about $60 billion over the next 10 years. The \npublic has demanded action on the high cost of drugs. They are going \nup. This is supported by patient groups, employers, and insurance \ncompanies alike. They believe it is not the answer but one of the \nanswers to end drug company abuses and close legal loopholes the \nindustry exploits to block competition and keep drug prices \nartificially high.\n  Just as we decided to close the accounting loopholes abused by Enron \nand WorldCom, we need to finish the job and close the loopholes in our \ndrug patent laws exploited by the big pharmaceutical companies.\n  I believe it is time for the House leadership to join us in ending \nthese abuses that hurt patients every day.\n  I also told the President on Friday that when he gave a speech last \nweek to a group of labor people in Pennsylvania saying: I am not for \nthe trial\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\nlawyers; I am for the hard hats. I want to pass terrorism insurance, \nand that way we will create jobs--I told President Bush on Wednesday: \nIf you want that legislation which you have talked about passed, you \nhave to realize that you have to come out and get off this kick of \nhaving tort reform in addition to this terrorism insurance.\n  I said: Your friend, the Republican Governor of Nevada, Kenny Guinn, \napproached that in the right way. He called a special session of the \nlegislature which ended about a month ago. The purpose of that special \nsession was to do something about the increasing cost of malpractice \ninsurance. The legislature met. They set certain limits on what you \ncould get for pain and suffering. As a result of that, people walked \naway happy. That is where tort reform should take place, on the State \nlevel. Even if those people who believe in more tort reform want to do \nit, they can't do it on this terrorism insurance. I think it is a game \nbeing played; they really don't want terrorism insurance. They want to \nuse tort reform as an excuse. That is one of the issues that is left \npending, terrorism insurance.\n  They fought us every step of the way--they, the minority, fought us \nevery step of the way. If the President really wants that, he needs to \ndeal with the minority and allow this conference to be completed.\n  We need to do something about the bankruptcy bill. This has been \ngoing on for years, as the Presiding Officer, who was the architect of \nthat legislation, knows. All the issues, we were told, had been \nresolved. This has been held up for about a year because of the people \nwho are not in touch with--I don't mean this as not mentally competent, \nbut not in touch with reality, in that how could you hold up \nlegislation as important as this bankruptcy reform because of a \nprovision we passed over here that said if you are an organization that \ngoes to a clinic and trashes it, put this terrible smelling acid on it \nso that you have to really tear the place down and rebuild it, those \npeople cannot discharge these acts in bankruptcy. That seems totally \nfair to me. But they are off on this abortion kick that somehow people \nwho do something bad to these reproductive clinics--whether or not you \nagree with abortion, people should have to obey the law. You should not \nhave the right to trash a place such as that so that it has to be torn \ndown and totally refurbished and say I can file bankruptcy and just \ndischarge it. No.\n\n  We thought it had been resolved a couple weeks ago. Obviously not. \nAll the banks and all the others interested in bankruptcy reform should \nunderstand that is the only problem and the only reason we are not \ngetting the bankruptcy legislation passed. That is a shame. The House \nshould let us do that, just as they should let us do the antiterrorism \nlegislation. It doesn't end there.\n  A lot of legislation is being held up; for example, our \nappropriations bills. We have 13 appropriations bills we must pass \nevery year. We cannot complete work on those until the House does it \nbecause you lose the ability to object because an amendment is not \ngermane. When the bill is brought from the House, they won't pass that. \nWhy? We are under this legislative delusion that suddenly all this \nfinancial stuff is going to work out.\n  We have less than 20 days before this legislative session ends and \nthey are still playing around. They never had a committee meeting on \nthe Labor-HHS bill. It deals with the National Institutes of Health and \nso many other issues. It is a huge appropriations bill, extremely \nimportant for us. But the House is afraid to move on it because the \nPresident said he is only going to allow a certain amount of money to \nbe spent there.\n  If that is exceeded, he will veto it. I say let's call him on that. \nLet him veto these important programs such as the National Institutes \nof Health. It is a little hard to do that when he and the \nadministration have single-handedly destroyed the economy. Last year at \nthis time we had a surplus of about $7.4 trillion for the next 10 \nyears. That surplus is gone because of these tax cuts--well, about 25 \npercent of it is due to the war. The rest of it is due to the tax cuts \nand the bad economic policies. We have no surplus anymore.\n  So it seems to me what the President is trying to do is to create the \nillusion that he is fiscally responsible by not allowing us to pass our \nappropriations bills. In fact, what he will probably do in the \nmultitrillion-dollar budget is that we will pass the appropriations \nbills, and he will probably veto a couple to say he is fiscally \nconservative, and all the problems are because of the prolific spending \nof the Congress, which is certainly not true. It appears that is what \nis happening.\n  The economy is in shambles. We are not having appropriations bills \nworked upon. It is just too bad. Because of the election that took \nplace 2 years ago in Florida, we needed election reform. Senator Dodd \nworked night and day getting election reform passed in the Senate. It \nis held up in the House. We cannot complete the conference.\n  I am very disappointed in what is happening. I think the \nadministration is focused on the wrong things. I should say the wrong \nthing this time. They have tunnel vision on Iraq. I think everybody in \nthe Senate has an open mind as to what we should do on Iraq. We can \nalso focus on the domestic problems in this country, but we are not \ndoing that. I think it is too bad. It is harmful to this country and it \nis certainly harmful to our getting work done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to speak in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, this week, which will be one Americans \nremember for a long time as the anniversary of the September 11 attacks \nof last year, a lot of second-guessing has been going on about what we \nmight have done differently. Part of that is based on the fact that \nthere was a lot of evidence that the United States should have been \nprepared to deal with the kind of attack that occurred, even if not at \nthat precise time and place.\n  I think history will show, notwithstanding all of the evidence, it \nwould have been very difficult for us to actually defend against those \nattacks, but it should not dissuade us from acting on similar evidence \nin the future.\n  I fear there is another situation developing which, both because we \nare focused on the war on terror and because it presents us with some \nunpleasant choices about what to do, is creating a similar situation \nwhere there is evidence that we should be paying attention to a \nproblem, but either because we do not want to deal with it or because \nthere is a lack of consensus about how to deal with it, the United \nStates is not taking adequate precautions or taking adequate steps to \ndeal with the situation.\n  What I have in mind is a concern that has been now discussed in two \nvery recently released Government reports on the threat that is posed \nby the nation of China against the United States.\n  The first, produced by the congressionally-mandated United States-\nChina Security Review Commission, offers a sobering analysis of the \nnational security implications of the economic relationship between our \ntwo countries. It flatly states that trade alone has failed to bring \nabout serious political change in China.\n  The second, the Defense Department's annual report on the military \npower of the People's Republic of China, paints an unsettling picture \nof China's military buildup, the main objective of which is to prepare \nthat country for a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait, and to \ncounter potential U.S. intervention in the conflict.\n  Proponents of unconditional engagement with China opine that the \nChinese people's access to the Internet, modern telecommunications, and \nfree trade will make that country a more free and open society. They \nsuggest that entrenched vestiges of the Communist system will \neventually fade away as new leaders, who are committed to capitalism, \ntake the reins of\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\npower. In other words, economic freedom will invariably translate into \npolitical freedom, and democracy will be the clear result.\n  But, particularly with the release of these two reports, it seems \nmore and more clear that China's willingness to engage in the world \neconomy has not translated into evolution toward democracy. Indeed, the \nUnited States-China Security Review Commission concluded that:\n\n     . . . Trade and economic liberalization have not led to the \n     extent of political liberalization much hoped for by U.S. \n     policymakers. The Chinese government has simultaneously \n     increased trade and aggressively resisted openness in \n     politically sensitive areas such as the exercise of \n     religious, human, and worker rights.\n\n  Consider, for example, Chinese Government control over the Internet. \nWhile many expected that access to the Internet would facilitate the \ninflux of Western ideas and values, the Commission stated that those \nhopes ``have yet to be realized.'' Indeed, Beijing has passed sweeping \nregulations in the past two years that prohibit news and commentary on \nInternet sites in China that is not state-sanctioned. The Commission \nnoted that China has even convinced American companies like Yahoo! to \nassist in its censorship efforts, and others, like America Online, to \nleave open the possibility of turning over names, e-mail addresses, or \nrecords of political dissidents if the Chinese government demands them.\n  It is impossible to predict China's future. That country has embarked \non an uncertain path, opening its economy while simultaneously \nattempting to strengthen the Communist Party's political and social \ncontrol. The consequences, given that Chinese policies run directly \ncounter to U.S. national security interests, are potentially grave. \nThus, the Commission established benchmarks against which Beijing's \nfuture progress can be measured, including China's proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction; its cozy relationships with terrorists \nstates like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea; its bellicose posture toward \nTaiwan; and its pursuit of asymmetric warfare capabilities to counter \nU.S. military capabilities.\n  China's proliferation of technology and components for ballistic \nmissiles and weapons of mass destruction to terrorist-sponsoring \nstates--including North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, and Sudan--is \nof serious concern. The Commission found that, despite numerous \nbilateral and multilateral pledges to halt that proliferation, \n``Chinese proliferation and cooperation with [such] states has \ncontinued unabated.''\n  Just in the past year, the administration has sanctioned Chinese \nentities three times for their proliferation to Iran of equipment and \nmaterials used to make chemical and biological weapons. Yet these \nsanctions are unlikely to curb China's proliferation activities. As the \nCommission concludes, ``Current U.S. sanctions policies to deter and \nreform Chinese proliferation practices have failed and need immediate \nreview and overhaul.''\n  The Commission recommended that the United States expand the use of \neconomic sanctions to apply against entire countries, rather than just \nindividual entities. Suggested sanctions include import and export \nlimitations, restrictions on the access of foreign entities to American \ncapital markets, restrictions on direct foreign investments in an \noffending country, and restrictions on science and technology \ncooperation.\n  I should note that these measures are very similar to those proposed \nby my distinguished colleague from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, in 2000 \nduring the debate on granting China permanent normal trade status. His \namendment, which I strongly supported, was rejected by this body.\n  As to Taiwan, Beijing is deadly serious about pursuing unification--\nthrough force, if necessary--with our long-standing, democratic ally. \nThe Chinese military is actively pursuing capabilities and strategies \nthat it would need to accomplish that task, and according to the \nCommission, it is believed that the military has been directed to have \nviable options to do so by 2005 to 2007.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat that: It is believed that the Chinese \nmilitary has been directed by the Communist leadership to be prepared \nto move against Taiwan by 2005 to 2007. If there is one sentence in \nthis report that ought to serve as a wake-up call, this is it.\n  What is so significant about that time-frame is that, during those \ntwo years, a number of factors fall in line. First of all, the Defense \nDepartment has projected that the balance of power across the Taiwan \nStrait will shift toward China by 2005. Second, it is estimated that \nour theater missile defense system, which China fears we will share \nwith Taiwan, will be up and running by 2007. Finally, it is estimated \nthat China's myriad conventional weapons recently purchased from \nRussia--including submarines, fighter jets, and air-to-air missiles--\nwill become fully operational within that 2-year period.\n\n  Indeed, the Defense Department, in its report, concluded that China's \n``ambitious military modernization casts a cloud over its declared \npreference for resolving differences with Taiwan through peaceful \nmeans.'' The Pentagon observes that, over the past year, Beijing's \nmilitary exercises have taken on an increasingly real-world focus aimed \nnot only at Taiwan, but also at increasing the risk to U.S. forces and \nto the United States itself in any future Taiwan contingency.\n  The Defense Department warns that China's ``military training \nexercises increasingly focus on the United States as an adversary.'' \nIts military modernization concentrates on weapons that could cripple \nour military strength, including anti-ship missiles to counter our \nnaval fleet and cyber-warfare to disrupt our infrastructure. Beijing is \nalso modernizing its ballistic missile program, improving its missile \nforce across the board both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beijing \ncurrently has about 20 inter-continental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, \ncapable of targeting the United States, is projected to add up to 40 \nlonger-range, road-mobile missiles by 2010.\n  In light of the Pentagon's conclusions, it is more important than \never that the United States provide Taiwan in a timely manner with the \nequipment and training it needs to defend itself against a potential \nChinese attack. That training should include joint operational \ntraining, which would facilitate an allied U.S.-Taiwan response to an \nattack on Taiwan by China. Taiwan is currently outnumbered 10 to 1 in \ncombat aircraft, 2 to 1 in ships, 60 to 4 in submarines, and its air \nforce is beginning to lose its qualitative edge over China.\n  The United States should also expand and multilateralize its security \nrelationships with Taiwan and other allies in East Asia to deter \npotential Chinese aggression. No doubt China is a very different \ncountry than the former Soviet Union, but there is something to be said \nfor the deterrent factor that comes with a NATO-like coalition. As \nPresident Bush stated during his campaign, ``We should work toward a \nday when the fellowship of free Pacific nations is as strong and united \nas our Atlantic partnership . . .''\n  Additionally, the United States needs to develop and deploy missile \ndefenses at the earliest possible date. I am pleased that President \nBush recognizes the importance of having such a defensive system, and \nhas made it a top priority among our military objectives.\n  What is frustrating is that the United States continues to play a \nfacilitating role in China's military buildup and its proliferation of \ndual-use technologies--technologies that have civilian and military \nuses--to rogue states. China's buildup and its proliferation both harm \nU.S. national security. The United States China Security Review \ncommission agreed with the conclusion of the 1998 Rumsfeld Commission \nthat:\n\n       The U.S. has been and is today a major, albeit \n     unintentional, contributor to the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction [through] foreign student training in the \n     U.S., by wide dissemination of technical information, by the \n     illegal acquisition of U.S. designs and equipment, and by the \n     relaxation of U.S. export control policies.\n\n  Our progressive relaxation of controls on the export of high \nperformance computers is just one example. These computers can assist \nChina in its efforts to rapidly design modern nuclear weapons and their \ndelivery systems.\n  Our lax controls over the export of these computers allow China to \nlegally obtain U.S. technology that helps to improve its military \ncapabilities. Indeed, the Commission concluded that,\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\ndespite the existence of nominal controls, most high performance \ncomputers are no longer licensed and monitored.\n  Not only is China using U.S. technology to build its own military \ncapabilities, it is transferring this technology to countries that \nsupport international terror networks. The China Commission found that:\n\n       Chinese firms have provided dual-use missile-related items, \n     raw materials, and/or assistance to Iran, North Korea, and \n     Libya.\n\n  Chinese companies have also exported substantial dual-use \ntelecommunications equipment and technology to countries like Iraq. \nMedia reports indicate that the Chinese firm Huawei Technologies--an \nimportant player for many U.S. firms who want to reach the Chinese \ntelecom and data communications market--assisted Iraq with fiber-optics \nto improve its air-defense system. This was not only a violation of \nU.N. sactions, it also greatly increased the danger to U.S. and British \npilots patrolling the no-fly zones.\n  Despite the serious concerns of some policymakers, Members of this \nbody, and others about the national security implications of transfers \nof such technology to China, the Senate, in September 2001, passed S. \n149, the Export Administration Act. If enacted, this legislation would \nsignificantly relax our export control regulations and make it far \neasier for China to obtain sensitive U.S. technology. it would \ndecontrol a number of items--including electronic devices used to \ntrigger nuclear weapons and materials used to build missiles and \nproduce nuclear weapons fuel--by giving these items ``mass market \nstatus.''\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that, as the anniversary of September 11 \napproaches, the administration and Congress recognize the potential \ndanger of allowing business interests to continue to trump our national \nsecurity needs. I am a strong proponent of free trade and open markets. \nBut our national security should not be sacrificed for potential \ncommercial gain. The federal government's first responsibility is the \nprotection of the American people.\n  How the United States chooses to manage its relationship with China \nwill have a far-reaching impact on our long-term national security. As \nthat country continues to play a more prominent role on the world \nstage--no doubt a product of its economic liberalization--it is \nimperative that U.S. policy appropriately address not only our trade \nrelationship, but also the threat posed by China to U.S. national \nsecurity. Our actions should be based not on wishes, but on facts--even \nif they are unpleasant.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8339-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8339-S8340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRIORITIZING ISSUES\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will talk a little about the issue we \nare currently dealing with in this Chamber, which is the Interior \nappropriations bill. It is a bill that is very important to those of us \nfrom the West. Being from Wyoming, it is a particularly interesting and \nimportant issue.\n  I listened to the assistant majority floor leader talk a little this \nmorning about the importance of moving on with the issues we have \nbefore us. He enumerated the very many issues he considers apparently \nto be of primary importance. We are going to have to move forward, but \nwe are going to have to make some priorities. We obviously do not have \na great deal of time.\n  Many of the issues the Senator from Nevada mentioned are issues that \nhave been around for a long time, without much push from the leadership \nto do anything about them until now. I hope we do not find ourselves \ndealing with too many issues and dealing with them insufficiently.\n  I hope we set priorities for where we are going to spend the rest of \nour time. My reaction is we need a little less talk and a lot more \naction.\n  With regard to Interior, for those of us in the West, one of the \nissues--especially in the case of Wyoming--is that half of our State is \nFederal land and managed, to a large extent, by those agencies that are \nfunded in the Interior bill. This is a bill of about $19.5 billion, \nwhich is a little more than last year but generally about the same.\n  It is interesting that these agencies do create some revenues, mostly \nthrough royalties and minerals. About $6 billion worth of revenue comes \nfrom these activities.\n  The Bureau of Land Management handles a great deal of the land in our \nState. It has a great deal to do with multiple use. It has a great deal \nto do with our opportunity to go ahead and use those lands for the \nvarious kinds of activities that are good for the local economy, good \nfor the Nation, and good for energy, for example, and at the same time \nprotect the environment, which is also key to what we are doing.\n  I will comment further on PILT, payment in lieu of taxes. When a \ncounty could have as much as 80 percent of the land controlled and \nowned by the Federal Government, they have a real problem with tax \nrevenues. Those lands would be earning revenue if they were in Maryland \nand owned privately. When they are owned by the Federal Government, \nthere is no tax revenue. That is what the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nProgram is designed to do.\n  We also have the Wild Horse and Burro Program. We all want to \npreserve wild horses. They are spread over the country--some in Nevada, \nsome in Wyoming, some in other States. However, we have a problem with \noverpopulation. It is an issue that exists with most wild critters. No \none wants to do anything in particular to hold down the numbers. In the \npast, the numbers grew until there was not enough food and they starved \nto death. We do not want to do that. There has to be a particular \nnumber of wild horses, or elk, whatever, that can thrive; there is only \nso much vegetation for a certain number. Beyond that we have to do \nsomething. It is not an easy issue but we must deal with it. That is \nimportant.\n  The Forest Service is one of our national treasures. We need to \npreserve the Forest Service; we need to preserve the forests. We have \ndone a good job. This year has been extremely difficult when it comes \nto wildfires. We have lost 6 million acres. We are faced with the \nquestion of how to better prepare and eliminate some of those fires. \nThere are programs out there. The administration has one now that will \nbe included in an amendment to this bill that allows thinning and \nallows ways to avoid fires rather than putting our energy into fighting \nfires.\n  I grew up next to the national forests in Wyoming. We were halfway \nbetween Cody, WY, and Yellowstone Park. It is a beautiful area with a \ngreat many trees and occasional threats from fires. There are cabins \nand buildings. We have a plan, if we could implement it, to hopefully \navoid some of the fires.\n  The National Park System is one of the big activities in the Interior \nDepartment. We have 385 national parks in this country. Some are large. \nIn Wyoming, we have Yellowstone, the oldest and largest park in the \ncountry. We have had a chronic problem of maintaining the \ninfrastructure of the parks. They have millions of visitors, generally \non a seasonal basis, during a relatively short time. The administration \nhas promised to put $4.5 million into infrastructure so we can keep the \nparks available for people to enjoy and visit. That is our \nresponsibility. The Interior dollars are very important.\n  Other activities of concern include the Fish and Wildlife Service, \nmining, as well as some research on energy and fossil technology and \nclean coal technology. Along with that is the U.S. Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. We are providing the best service we can to Native Americans. \nWe are providing an opportunity for them to continue to begin to build \nas strong an economy as possible.\n  For a moment I will talk about the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. \nThe Senate appropriates approximately $220 million for that PILT \nProgram--more than it has ever received. We have not yet reached the \nappropriation to be equivalent to the authorization. Nevertheless, we \nhave made some progress. This year, 67 of my colleagues joined in a \nrequest to increase PILT to help more than 2000 counties and local \ngovernments. When there is a county that has anywhere from 50 to 90 \npercent Federal lands, it is up to the county to provide the services \nnecessary--whether it be law enforcement, fire, whatever. Those are \ncounty responsibilities. Therefore, there needs to be some revenues \nfrom the land. That is what these payments are about. We are moving \ntoward that. I thank the committee for moving as they have toward\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nreaching the authorization of the funds available. Certainly that \nauthorization is not totally enough to fill all the needs, but it is an \nimprovement over the past.\n\n  This also gives an opportunity for those counties to create their own \nfinancial structure, much of which often is tourism, which, again, is \ncostly. I thank the committee for what they have done with respect to \npayments in lieu of taxes to the counties. I hope we are able to \ninclude that. Our allocation is larger than the House and we need to \nbring that up so we have a satisfactory arrangement.\n  In the West we have had 3 years of very low rainfall, actual drought. \nIt is very difficult. In Washington, it is normal to have 50 inches of \nrain a year. In Wyoming, it is more likely to be an average of 16 or 17 \ninches. It is a low precipitation area at best. Therefore, we irrigate. \nIrrigation water generally comes from reservoirs, from the runoff of \nsnowfall that is captured in the mountains and let down during the \nsummer. We have had relatively slow snowfall over the last several \nyears and therefore our reservoirs are getting low and have been very \nlow this year. We have had, certainly, a bona fide drought problem--not \nonly in Wyoming but all through the area, including the Dakotas and \ndown. There has been a great deal of discussion about it. On the \nAgriculture Committee we talked about that a great deal. The \nAgriculture Committee bill as prepared does not deal with drought. We \nthink they will get support in the area of crops, but it is based \nprimarily on loans after the product is sold. If you did not produce a \nproduct, there is nothing there. That is why we need to have disaster \nassistance. There will be less spending in the Agriculture bill because \nthere will be less crops grown--with a higher price because there are \nless--but many farmers and ranchers will not produce a crop.\n  We should offset some of that to the farm bill spending. Whether we \noffset it or not, the fact is there will be less money spent in that \narea than could be spent. Therefore, what we spend here could replace \nwhat was there. I hope that is the approach we take.\n  We should have some limitation on how much we have there, but, \nindeed, it is a big issue and it will be a $5.5 billion issue to be \nable to deal with the losses that agriculture has suffered.\n  I hope, too, we do not simply focus on farm crops. Again, in my \nState, the biggest agricultural area is livestock. Livestock people \nhave suffered as well. What has happened is there is no grass for \ngrazing where the cattle are on private lands. In some cases where \nthere has been grazing allowed, in the forests or BLM, Federal lands, \nthere has not been a sufficient amount of grass. Ranchers have had to \nsell cattle because they have not had the feed and will not have the \nfeed this winter.\n  When we do talk about agriculture, the idea often--particularly in \nsome Midwestern States--is that just refers to farmers. I want to tell \nyou it is farmers, but it is also those who raise livestock, cattle, \nand sheep. People who are in that business need to be recognized as \nwell, in terms of what we do here to help the agricultural industry \nduring the drought. We will be dealing with that. We will come back to \nit.\n  I say again I hope we can set some priorities for the relatively \nlimited amount of time left of this Congress. I hope that we select \nthose items that are timely, that need to be done. I understand when we \ncome to the end of a session everybody has ideas of things that they \nwould liked to have happened that did not happen, but we are not going \nto be able to do all those things. So what we have to do collectively \nis show some leadership as to which of those issues should be dealt \nwith. Then we can do that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MARRA, OF FLORIDA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n          DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 1 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session and \nproceed with the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 889, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read that nomination of Kenneth A. Marra, of \nFlorida, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District \nof Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I do believe that Judge Kenneth Marra \nwill be confirmed to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District \nof Florida. I have heard of no opposition. This is a judge who got \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which \nusually guarantees a confirmation on the floor. When that happens, the \nDemocratic-led Senate will confirm its 74th judicial nomination made by \nPresident George W. Bush. This will also be the 25th judicial emergency \nvacancy that we have filled since I became chairman last summer, and \nthe 18th since the beginning of this year.\n  The confirmation of Judge Marra will bring additional resources to \nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Judge \nMarra was nominated to fill a new position Congress created by statute \nto address the large caseload, particularly the immigration and \ncriminal cases, facing the Federal court in Florida. He is one of three \nFederal judicial nominations on the Senate Calendar for action.\n  I recall during the past administration, the Clinton administration, \nwe all worked very hard in cooperation with Senator Graham and Senator \nMack to ensure that the Federal court in Florida had its vacancies \nfilled promptly with consensus nominees. Due to the bipartisan \ncooperation between one Democrat Senator and one Republican Senator and \na Democratic President, the Senate was able to confirm 22 judicial \nnominees from Florida, including 3 nominees to the Eleventh Circuit. \nBut it is unfortunate that this tradition of cooperation, coordination, \nand consultation has not continued with the current administration.\n  By my recollection, it was only the nomination of Judge Rosemary \nBarkett of the Florida Supreme Court to the Eleventh Circuit that \ngenerated any significant controversy or opposition. I do recall that \nshe was strongly\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\nopposed by a number of Republican Senators because they did not agree \nwith her judicial philosophy. Those voting against her included \nSenators Hatch, Grassley, McConnell, Specter, and Thurmond, as well as \nSenators Lott, Nickles, and Hutchison of Texas. They have an absolute \nright to do that, of course. I respect that right. Judge Barkett \nreceived the highest rating of the ABA, ``well qualified,'' and yet 36 \nRepublicans voted against her confirmation, even though she had the \nstrong bipartisan support of her home State Senators. Recent claims by \nsome that it is unprecedented to vote against a judicial nominee with a \n``well qualified'' rating and to vote against her based on her judicial \nphilosophy thus ring hollow.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the way the administration has dealt with \nSenators Graham and Nelson now. But it is a tribute to Senator Graham \nand Senator Nelson that we have made the progress we have had. They \ncould very easily have exercised their right as Senators and refused to \naccept the nominees of President Bush. Of course, they would go no \nfurther under the blue-slip policy that both Republicans and Democrats \nstrongly support. But they have been more than gracious in their \nwillingness to support these nominees. That is why they have gone \nthrough.\n  This Democratic-led Senate has expeditiously moved President Bush's \njudicial nominees. We have worked hard to provide bipartisan support \nfor the White House's nominations in spite of an almost unprecedented \nlack of willingness on the part of the White House to work with us.\n  In fact, I have been here 26 years: During the terms of President \nFord, President Carter, President Reagan, President George Herbert \nWalker Bush, President Clinton, and now President George W. Bush. This \nadministration is the least willing of any White House during all that \ntime--Republican or Democrat--to work with the Senate on judicial \nnominations. But even without that cooperation, even with the \nunprecedented lack of cooperation, we are making progress.\n\n  I would like to discuss the progress we have made. This chart shows \nwhat has happened in the 15 months the Democrats have controlled the \nSenate. Contrast that to the Republicans' first 15 months when they \ncontrolled the Senate. In less than 15 months of Democratic control of \nthe committee, we have held more hearings for more nominees, voted on \nmore nominees in committee, and confirmed more nominees than the \nRepublicans did in their first 15 months of control of the committee in \n1995 and 1996.\n  We have confirmed more of President George W. Bush's Federal trial \ncourt nominees in less than 15 months than were confirmed in the first \n2 years of his father's Presidency. In fact, we confirmed more in the \nfirst 15 months than the Republicans were willing to confirm in their \nlast 30 months.\n  I mention this because there seems to be some idea that somehow the \nDemocratic-led Senate is holding up judges. I think most of the \nPresidents with whom I have served would have been delighted to have \nhad a Senate as cooperative as we have been.\n  Let me repeat that. In 15 months, Democrats have done more on \njudicial confirmations than Republicans did in 30 months.\n  They, on the other side, do not want to compare our record of \naccomplishment in evaluating judicial nominees with theirs in their \nprior 6\\1/2\\ years of control. They do not want to own up to their \ndelay and defeat through inaction of scores of judicial nominees during \nthe last administration.\n  All too often the only defense of their record we hear is the claim \nthat President Clinton ultimately appointed 377 judicial nominees, 5 \nfewer than President Reagan. This statement overlooks the fact that the \nRepublicans only allowed 245 of President Clinton's judicial nominees \nto be confirmed. That averages, incidentally, to about 38 confirmations \nper year during their 6\\1/2\\ years of control. We confirmed 74 judicial \nnominees in less than 15 months, including 13 to the circuit courts. I \nbelieve we have reported 80 out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I mention this because of the persistence of the myth of inaction in \nface of such in the face of such a clear record of progress by \nDemocrats. After a while, if someone keeps distorting the facts, if \nsomeone keeps stating things that are not true, people actually come to \nbelieve it is true. I am reminded of what Adlai Stevenson once said. I \nwill quote him:\n\n       I have been thinking that I would make a proposition to my \n     Republican friends . . . that if they will stop telling lies \n     about the Democrats, we will stop telling the truth about \n     them.\n\n  The truth is, of course, as these charts show, that we have a pretty \ngood record of accomplishment despite the lack of cooperation from the \nadministration.\n  With today's vote, the Democratic-led Senate will confirm its 74th \njudge--exceeding the number of circuit and district court nominees \nconfirmed in the last 30 months of Republican control of the Senate. We \nhave done more than Republicans did, and we have done it in less than \nhalf the time.\n  We have confirmed more of this President's nominees, both circuit and \ndistrict court nominees, in less than 15 months, than were confirmed in \nthe comparable 15 months of the first term of former President Reagan, \nthe first President Bush, and President Clinton.\n  Let's take a look at what has happened in the first 15 months. With \ntoday's vote, the Democratic-led Senate has confirmed 74 of this \nRepublican President's judicial nominees in less than 15 months.\n  Under President Reagan--and incidently, I might point out, he had a \nSenate of his own party--there were 54 confirmation in the first 15 \nmonths. Under George H. W. Bush, there were 23; for the first 15 months \nof President Clinton, 45. Incidentally, that is with a Senate under the \ncontrol of his own party. And now, in 15 months, under President George \nW. Bush, we have had 74 judicial confirmations--74. By any standard you \nwant, here is a case where a different party than the President has \ncontrolled the Senate, and we have done more than was done for \nPresident Reagan when his own party controlled the Senate, for \nPresident Bush when another party controlled the Senate, for President \nClinton when we, the Democrats, controlled the Senate.\n  It shows we can move and will move, and we have been doing that \nnotwithstanding the fact that there has been less cooperation from the \nWhite House than I have seen with either Democratic or Republican \nPresidents in 26 years in the Senate. It is unfortunate.\n  President Bush will probably get a record number of his judges \nthrough at the current pace of confirmations. But I have to think how \nmuch better it could be done with less rancor and with even a modicum \nof cooperation. We have acted fairly and expeditiously notwithstanding \nthe fact that Democrats have felt very concerned that for year after \nyear after year after year in many of the circuit courts of this \ncountry, Republicans refused to even hold hearings for the nominees, \neven though they had the highest ratings of the American Bar \nAssociation. They would not even hold hearings, to say nothing about \nhaving a vote.\n  Then when the Republicans came in, suddenly there was an emergency; \nthey had to fill the vacancies in those circuits. Their obstruction \ncreated the problem. But notwithstanding that, in many of those cases \nwhere Democrats were not allowed to even have a hearing year after year \nafter year, we have in the last 15 months moved forward with hearings \nand votes, and positive votes, on the vast majority of his judicial \nnominees.\n  I have no idea what political game is being played at the White \nHouse. I know the people are very nice. Judge Gonzalez is a very nice, \nvery polite person. He is charming to be with. But the cooperation is \nnot there. The President is very nice, very charming. But the \ncooperation is not there. We could do far better if they would just \npick up the phone and call the last three people from the last three \nRepublican administrations--they do not even have to call a Democratic \nadministration--and see how well this could be done.\n  As the distinguished ranking member, my good friend from Utah, knows, \nI went down several times and worked with the Clinton White House so \nthey could have cooperation with, and they did cooperate with, \nRepublican Senators in moving through judges. I would hope that with \nthat precedent in mind, some might do the same.\n  Democrats have reformed the process for considering judicial nominees \nto\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\nensure bipartisan cooperation and greater fairness. For example, we \nhave ended the practice of secretive, anonymous holds that plagued the \nperiod of Republican control, when any Republican Senator could hold \nany nominee from his or her home state, his or her own circuit or any \npart of the country for any reason, or no reason, without any \naccountability. We have returned to the Democratic tradition of \nregularly holding hearings, every few weeks, rather than going for \nmonths without a single hearing. In fact, we have held 23 judicial \nnominations hearings in our first 13 months, an average of almost two \nper month.\n  In contrast, during the six and one-half years of Republican control, \nthey went 30 months without holding a single judicial nominations \nhearing. By holding 23 hearings for 84 of this President's judicial \nnominees, we have held hearings for more circuit and district court \nnominees than in 20 of the last 22 years during the Reagan, first Bush, \nand Clinton Administrations.\n  As this chart shows, we have held more hearings for President Bush's \njudicial nominees in less than 15 months than were held in 15 months \nfor any of the past three Presidents. In the first 15 months of the \nfirst term of President Reagan, 17 judicial nominations hearings were \nheld. In the first 15 months of President George H.W. Bush's term, 11 \nhearings were held. And, in the first 15 months of President Clinton's \nfirst term, 14 judicial nominations hearings were held. In contrast, we \nhave held 23 hearings in less than 15 months. That is almost as many as \nwere held in the first 15 months of the terms of the first President \nBush and President Clinton combined. We have more than exceeded the \nnumber of hearings held in the last 30 months of Republican control of \nthe Senate, when they held only 15 hearings.\n  While some complain that a handful of circuit court nominees have not \nyet had hearings, they fail to acknowledge that Democrats have held \nhearings for more of President Bush's circuit court nominees, 18, than \nin any of the six and one-half years in which the Republicans \ncontrolled the Committee before the change in majority last summer. \nRepublicans have utterly failed to acknowledge this fairness and \nprogress under the Democratic majority. The myth of obstruction of \njudicial nominees fits their political strategy better than the truth.\n  The years of Republican inaction on a number of circuit court \nvacancies has made it possible for Democrats to have several \n``firsts,'' or astounding accomplishments in addressing judicial \nvacancies. For example, we held the first hearing for a nominee to the \nSixth Circuit in almost five years (that is more than one full \npresidential term) and confirmed her, even though three of President \nClinton's nominees to the Sixth Circuit never received a hearing or a \nvote. We held the first hearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee in seven \nyears (including the entire period of Republican control of the Senate) \nand confirmed her last year, while three of President Clinton's Fifth \nCircuit nominees never received hearings or votes on their nominations. \nWe held the first hearing on a Tenth Circuit nominee in six years, and \nwe have confirmed two of President Bush's nominees to the Tenth \nCircuit, while two of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit \nnever received hearings or votes. We held the first hearing for a \nFourth Circuit nominee in three years, for Judge Roger Gregory, and the \nfirst hearing for an African American nominee to that court in United \nStates history, even though Judge Gregory and four other nominees to \nthat circuit (including three other African Americans) never received \nhearings or votes during Republican control of the Senate. These are \njust a few examples of the historic accomplishments of the Democratic-\nled Senate which debunk Republican myths that Democrats caused the \nvacancy crisis, are delaying judicial appointments or have been \nretaliating for years of obstruction on circuit court vacancies by \nRepublicans.\n  There were only 16 circuit court vacancies when Republicans took over \nthe Senate in January 1995. Unfortunately, from January 1995 until \nRepublicans relinquished control and allowed the Judiciary Committee to \nbe reorganized in the summer of 2001, circuit court vacancies more than \ndoubled from 16 to 33. Republicans executed a partisan political \nstrategy to hold vacancies open on the circuits for a Republican \npresident to fill. It would certainly have been easier and less work \nfor Democrats to retaliate for the unfair treatment of the last \nPresident's circuit court nominees. We did not. We have been, and will \ncontinue to be, more fair than the Republican majority was to President \nClinton's judicial nominees.\n\n  Here is another chart that shows that more of President Bush's \njudicial nominees have been given committee votes than the nominees of \nprior presidents. Unlike my Republican predecessor, I have scheduled \nhearings and votes on district and circuit court nominees whom I do not \nsupport. The Judiciary Committee has voted on 82 judicial nominees and \nfavorably reported 80. In less than 15 months, we have voted on more of \nPresident Bush's district and circuit court nominees than were voted on \nin the first 15 months of any of the past three Presidents. Moreover, \nwe have voted on more nominees in less than 15 months than were voted \non in the first 15 months of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush \ncombined, or Presidents George H.W. Bush and Clinton combined. We have \neven voted on more nominees in less than 15 months than were voted on \nin the last 30 months of Republican control of the Senate, when 73 \nnominees were voted on by the Committee.\n  Because we have moved quickly and responsibly, the number of \nvacancies is not at the 153 mark it would be had we taken no action. \nVacancies have been reduced to 79 and are headed in the right \ndirection. On July 10, 2001, with the reorganization of the Senate, we \nbegan with 110 vacancies. When Republican gained control of the Senate \nin 1995 the federal judicial vacancies numbered 65. The vacancies \nincreased during their six and one-half years to more than 110. Under \nthe Democratic majority, by contrast, the number of vacancies is being \nsignificantly reduced. Despite the large number of additional vacancies \nthat have arisen in the past year, with the 61 district court \nconfirmations we have as of today, we have reduced district court \nvacancies to 50, almost to the level it was at when Republicans took \nover the Senate in 1995.\n  In fact, when we adjourned for the August recess we had given \nhearings to 91 percent of this President's judicial nominees who had \ncompleted their paperwork and who had the consent of both of their \nhome-State Senators. That is, 84 of the 92 judicial nominees with \ncompleted files had received hearings.\n  When we held our most recent hearing on August 1, we had given \nhearings to 66 district court nominees and we had run out of district \ncourt nominees with completed paperwork and home-State consent. Only \ntwo district court nominees were eligible for that hearing. This is \nbecause the White House changed the process of allowing the ABA to \nbegin its evaluation prior to nomination. This change has cost the \nfederal judiciary the chance over the last year to have 12 to 15 more \ndistrict court nominees on the bench and hearing cases, because now the \nABA can only begin its evaluation once the nomination is submitted to \nthe Senate. The ABA also must wait until the Administration provides \nthe Senate with the nominee's public questionnaire, and lately the \nnominees' documents have been arriving on a delayed basis, as well. \nIndeed, many of the two dozen nominations most recently received will \nlikely not get hearings before adjournment this year in large measure \nbecause the White House unilaterally changed the process for \nconsideration and has built additional delays into it.\n  In January I had proposed a simple procedural adjustment to allow the \nABA evaluation to begin at the same time as the FBI investigation, as \nwas the practice in past Republican and Democratic Administrations over \n50 years. Had this proposal been accepted, I am confident there would \nbe more than a dozen fewer vacancies in the federal courts. Instead, \nour efforts to increase cooperation with the White House have been \nrebuffed. We continue to get the least cooperation from any White House \nI can recall during my nearly three decades in the Senate. Yet, even \nwith such lack of cooperation from the White House, the Senate has set \nan impressive rate of confirming judicial nominees.\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n  Here is another chart that shows how Democrats have dramatically \nreduced the time between nomination and confirmation of circuit court \nnominees. Since the Democrats assumed the majority last July, the \naverage time to confirm circuit court nominees has been drastically \nreduced to 147 days, from a high during the most recent years of \nRepublican control of 374 days. We have reduced the average time from \nnomination to confirmation to two-and-a-half times less than the \naverage time to confirmation during Republican control during the 106th \nand 105th Congresses when it took an average of 374 and 314 days, \nrespectively, to confirm President Clinton's circuit court nominees.\n  The Judiciary Committee has reported two more circuit court nominees \nfavorably to the Senate. We have held hearings on 18 circuit court \nnominees and the Judiciary Committee has already voted on 17 of those \n18 nominees.\n  In spite of the obstacles the White House has put in the way of their \nown nominees through their lack of consultation and cooperation, we \nhave been able to have a productive year while restoring fairness to \nthe judicial confirmation process. I regret that the White House has \nchosen the strident path that it has with respect to judicial \nnominations, especially to the circuit courts. As several Senators \nnoted last week, the Administration does not have carte blanche to \ninsist on an ideological takeover of the Courts of Appeals with \nactivist ultra-conservative nominees intended to tip the balance in \ncircuits around the country. The total number of district and circuit \ncourt confirmations now stands at 74, and there remain a few weeks left \nin this session. So while we have been working hard and productive, the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate have not become a rubber stamp.\n  I am proud of the efforts of the Senate to restore fairness to the \njudicial confirmation process over this time. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee is working hard to schedule hearings and votes on additional \njudicial nominees, but it takes time to deal with a mess of the \nmagnitude we inherited. I think we have done well by the federal courts \nand the American people, and we will continue to do our best to ensure \nthat all Americans have access to federal judges who are unbiased, \nfair-minded individuals with appropriate judicial temperament and who \nare committed to upholding the Constitution and following precedent.\n  When the President sends judicial candidates who embody these \nprinciples, they will move quickly, but when he sends controversial \nnominees whose records demonstrate that they lack these qualities and \nwhose records are lacking we will take the time needed to evaluate \ntheir merits and to vote them up or down.\n  I would like to thank the Members of the Judiciary Committee who have \nlabored long and hard to evaluate the records of the individuals chosen \nby this President for lifetime seats on the federal courts. The \ndecisions we make after reviewing their records will last well beyond \nthe term of this President and will affect the lives of the individuals \nwhose cases will be heard by these judges and maybe millions of others \naffected by the precedents of these decisions of these judges.\n  Before anyone takes for granted how fairly Democrats have treated \nthis President's judicial nominees, receiving up or down votes, they \nshould take a look at how poorly judicial nominees were treated during \nthe 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate. In all, several \ndozen judicial nominees of President Clinton never received a hearing \nor a vote.\n  When confronted with this, Republicans often lament that about 50 of \nthe first President Bush's judicial nominees did not get a hearing \nbefore the end of the session in Congress in 1992. What they \nconsistently fail to mention about this, however, is quite revealing. \nThat year, the Senate confirmed more of President George H.W. Bush's \njudicial nominees than in any year of his presidency. He had 66 \njudicial nominees confirmed that year, but the Senate simply could not \nget to the other 53 nominees he submitted in response to the creation \nof dozens of new judgeships. So, even though some of his nominees were \nreturned, the Senate confirmed a substantial number, 66, of his \njudicial nominees in the 10 months they were in session that year, \nwhich was an election year, by the way.\n  Perhaps coincidentally, 66 is the highest number of judicial \nconfirmations in one year that Republicans ever allowed President \nClinton to reach. They averaged 38 judicial confirmations per year. In \nthe last two years of the Clinton Administration, Republicans allowed \nonly 33 and 39 judges to be confirmed, respectively in 1999 and 2000. \nPresident George H.W. Bush had 66 confirmations in his last year of \noffice, an election year. In President Clinton's last year in office \nonly 39 judges were confirmed, during Republicans control. In 1996, \nRepublican allowed only 17 judges to be confirmed, none to the circuit \ncourts. In those two election years combined Republicans allowed only \n56 confirmations. In 1992, an election year, Chairman Biden pushed \nthrough 66 confirmations.\n  Unlike Democrats in 1992, Republicans cannot honestly claim that they \nmoved a substantial number through but could not get to them all. \nConfirming only 39 judicial nominees in 2000 and returning more than \nthat, 41, in that year alone, simply does not compare with what \nhappened in 1992 when Democrats worked hard to move through 66 of the \nfirst President Bush's judicial nominees in the space of 10 months. If \n66 was such an easy number to reach, why did Republicans reach that \nlevel only once in six years of control? The answer is easy. They did \nnot want to do so. I think Republicans wanted to ensure that they never \ntreated President Clinton better than the best year of former President \nBush (his last year) and they wanted to ensure that President Clinton \ndid not beat President Reagan's number of confirmations, as a matter of \npartisan pride.\n  Had Republicans kept up the pace of confirmation set by Democrats in \nthe first President Bush's last year and the first two years of the \nClinton Administration, President Clinton would have appointed \nsubstantially more than the 377 judges who were ultimately confirmed in \nhis two terms as president, and the Democratic-led Senate Judiciary \nCommittee would not have begun last July with 110 vacancies. \nIronically, perhaps, Democrats have been so fair to President George W. \nBush, despite the past unfairness of Republicans, that if we continue \nat the current pace of confirmation and vacancies continue to arise at \nthe same rate, then Bush will appoint 227 judges by the end of his \nterm. If he were elected to a second term, at the current pace, he \nwould amass 454 judicial confirmations, dramatically more than \nPresident Reagan, who Senator Hatch often calls the all-time champ. \nThis, too, demonstrates how fair Democrats have been. Perhaps some may \nsay we have been foolishly fair, given how Democrats were treated in \nthe past. We have exceeded the pace set in 1992, 1993 and 1994, with 74 \nconfirmations to date in little more than a year.\n  In fact, when we adjourned for the August recess we had given \nhearings to 91 percent of this President's judicial nominees who had \ncompleted their paperwork and who had the consent of both of their \nhome-State Senators. That is, 84 of the 92 judicial nominees with \ncompleted files had received hearings.\n  Any way you look at the numbers, raw numbers or percentages, \ncomparisons with the prior six years of Republican control or with \nprior Congresses and Republican presidents, the Democrats have done \nmore in less time. We have been more fair by far. Yet we have been \nunfairly labeled as obstructionist because we have not been able to \nhave hearings for every single judicial nominee in the short period we \nhave been in the majority. This President still has over two years left \nin his term.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to respond to some of the \namazing assertions made by my distinguished colleague and friend from \nVermont. Of course, I do so with some trepidation because each time we \nhave a back and forth like this one, I help my colleague further the \nimpression that he is out to create and that he has done a good job of \ncreating, especially with the press.\n  The impression my colleague is seeking to create is that both sides \ncome to\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\nthe table with unclean hands in the matter of confirmations. It is a \nfalse impression and it provides a smokescreen of the stark reality of \nthe poor performance of the Judiciary Committee this past year and \nduring this session.\n  Naturally, my friend takes pride in his accomplishments this year, \nbut not all of them. Let me list a few he misses. President Reagan took \npride in nominating the first woman to the Supreme Court. My Democrat \ncolleagues have now presided over the ``Borking'' of the first woman in \nhistory, and one of the leading women jurists in this country, \nPriscilla Owen.\n  My colleague has also set a new record for a Judiciary Committee \nchairman. He has voted in 1 year against more judicial nominees than \nany chairman in the 212 years of the Republic. Moreover, most of my \nDemocrat colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have voted against more \njudicial nominees in this last one year than I have in my 26 years on \nthe Judiciary Committee. I voted against only one Clinton nominee, only \none, but as painful as that was, I did it standing straight for all to \nsee in the disinfectant light of the Senate floor, not in the shadows \nof a committee vote.\n  Also, in rejecting Justice Owen, my Democrat colleagues rejected for \nthe first time in history a nominee who has received the American Bar \nAssociation's unanimous rating, highest rating of well qualified, the \nrating that earlier this year they announced to be the gold standard \nfor judicial nominees and which, of course, they now criticize because \nthe independent body has rated President Bush's nominees as highly \nqualified as any we have ever seen.\n  In other words, Priscilla Owen, who had the support of both home \nState Senators, which is a requisite for consideration by the \nCommittee, who had the highest rating given by the American Bar \nAssociation for a judicial nominee, who is a supreme court justice in \nTexas, and who, by anybody's measurement who is fair, is in the \nmainstream of American jurisprudence, was dumped unceremoniously in the \ncommittee by a 10-to-9 party vote, a partisan party vote at that, and \nwithout giving her nomination the chance of being brought up on the \nfloor of the Senate where I believe she would have passed, if not \noverwhelmingly, certainly comfortably.\n  I have heard my colleague from Vermont defend against that by listing \nthe 42 judicial nominees who did not get confirmed by the end of the \nClinton administration. He doesn't point out that there were 54 \nnominees left hanging at the end of the first Bush administration when \nthey were in charge. And he does not explain that most, if not all, of \nthe nominees left hanging at the end of the Clinton administration, \nhowever qualified, did not progress because either they were nominated \ntoo late or did not have their home state Senators' support or had \nother problems that we cannot address.\n  In an attempt to cloud up the rejection of Justice Owen's nomination, \nI have also heard my colleagues point to the Clinton judges from Texas \nin particular who never got a hearing. One said at the Owen hearing \nthat I did not give them a hearing. It was a very unfair \ncharacterization, and I will respond to it now.\n  As my friend knows well enough, neither of those nominees had the \nsupport of their home state Senators. This prevented me, and would have \nprevented the distinguished Senator from Vermont, if he were in my \nshoes, from scheduling a hearing for them. In part, this was because \nPresident Clinton ignored the Texas Senators and the Texas nominating \ncommission in making those nominations. The practice of honoring the \nhome State Senators is not one I put in place; it was put in place \nunder Democrat leadership of the committee, and appears agreeable to \nboth parties.\n\n  Today, Democrat Senators from the States of North Carolina, \nCalifornia, and Michigan have prevented the Judiciary Committee from \nholding hearings on six of President Bush's original Circuit Court of \nAppeals nominees who were nominated a year and a half ago, some of the \ngreatest nominees I have seen in the whole time I have been in the \nSenate and on the Judiciary Committee, now 26 years.\n  I know there are those who seem to justify wrong in childlike fashion \nwith the intellectual crutch of, ``They did it, too.'' Let me say that \nwe Republicans have never done what was done to Justice Owen. I can't \nthink of anything in history that compares to that. Some Democrats have \nattempted to leave the impression that Republicans have unclean hands \nso as to soften the scrutiny of what was done to Justice Owen. The \nAmerican people will see through this.\n  But let me assure you, none of those nominees who did not get \nhearings would trade places with Charles Pickering of Mississippi or \nPriscilla Owen of Texas. It is beyond peradventure that they would \nprefer to be ghosts of nominations past than called racists, unjustly \ncalled racists, and have their fine records of public service soiled by \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  I am heartened to know that beyond the overwhelming support from her \nhome State of Texas and scores of op-eds written across the country in \nsupport of the Owen nomination, Justice Owen's nomination to the Fifth \nCircuit has received editorial support from over 24 newspapers \npublished across the Nation and across the political spectrum. I have \npreviously submitted these for the Record.\n  Prior to the vote in Committee, only three newspapers, in fact--in \nNew York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco--had come out firmly against \nthe nomination.\n  I am heartened by this national support not just for the sake of \nJustice Owen, but because at her hearing I expressed alarm at the \nefforts of some to introduce ideology into the confirmation process. I \nam heartened that editorial and op-ed writers across the country \nreflect not only support for Justice Owen but also the near universal \nrejection of this misguided effort to make the independent Federal \njudiciary a mere extension of Congress and less than the independent, \ncoequal branch it was intended to be.\n  Let me respond further to my good friend from Vermont. He is right \nthat in this session so far the Senate has confirmed 73 judges. There \nis much eagerness in my friend's voice asserting that this number \ncompares favorably to the last three sessions of Congress during which \nI was chairman.\n  Although I am flattered to hear my record used as the benchmark for \nfairness, I am afraid this does not make for a fair comparison because \nI was never chairman during any of President Clinton's first 2 years in \noffice.\n  Let me repeat that. I was never chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nduring any President's first 2 years in office. I am glad to say, \ntherefore, that the proper comparison is not, as they say, about me.\n  My colleague speaks of the last 15 months when I was chairman, but \nthis compares apples to oranges.\n  During President Clinton's first Congress, when Senator Biden was the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senate confirmed 127 judicial \nnominees. And Senator Biden achieved this record despite not receiving \nany nominees for the first 6 months--in fact, Senator Biden's first \nhearing was held on July 20 of that year, more than a week later than \nthe first hearing of this session, which occurred on July 11, 2001. \nClearly, getting started in July of year one is no barrier to the \nconfirmation of 127 judges by the end of year two. But we have \nconfirmed only 73 nominees in this session.\n  Senator Biden's track record during the first President Bush's first \ntwo years also demonstrates how a Democrat-led Senate treated a \nRepublican President. Then-Chairman Biden presided over the \nconfirmation of all but 5 of the first President Bush's 75 nominees in \nthat first two-year session. Chairman Thurmond's record is similar. The \ncontrast to the present could hardly be starker.\n  Mr. President, we are about to close President Bush's first 2 years \nin office having failed the standards set by Chairmen Biden and \nThurmond. That is nothing over which to be proud. We still have 80 \nvacancies on the courts, and 32 emergency vacancies.\n  Mr. President, one final point about Justice Owen. Much of the \nopposition against her was driven by interest groups that advocate for \nthe right to abortion. Yet in Justice Owen we had the first nominee we \nhave considered this session who has, as a judge, read those cases, \ncited them, quoted them, applied them and followed them. She did, \nhowever, interpret the new Texas parental notice law and sought in one\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\nparticular case to make it rarer to bypass than some of her colleagues \non the court, although the Texas Supreme Court agreed in most all other \nrespects.\n  Of course, the charge that she is a judicial activist was a cynical \ntrick of words from Washington special interest lobbyists who have made \ntheir careers taking positions without letting the words of the \nConstitution stand between them and their political objectives.\n\n  Why did they oppose her? Ironically enough, they are doing so because \nthey do not like the Texas statute requiring parental notice in cases \nof abortions for children. Justice Owen voted to give the statute some \nmeaning. Justice Owen's opponents think a minor should always be able \nto avoid the Texas Legislature's standards. It is the groups allied \nagainst Justice Owen who are the judicial activists, the ones who are \nlooking to achieve in the courts an outcome that is at odds with the \nlaw passed by the elected legislators.\n  Let's be clear that the opposition to Justice Owen was all about \nabortion. But in Justice Owen's case, it was not that she opposed \nabortion rights--no decision of hers ever denied that right. I fear \nthat the opposition to Justice Owen is not about abortion rights \nexactly, but something much more insidious--it was not about abortion \nrights exactly but about abortion profits.\n  Simply put, the abortion industry is opposed to parental notice laws \nbecause they place a hurdle between them and their clients--not the \ngirls who come to them, but the adult men who pay for the abortions. \nThese adult men, whose average age rises the younger the girl is, are \neager not to be disclosed to parents, sometimes living down the street. \nAt $1,000 per abortion and nearly 1 million abortions per year, the \nabortion industry is as big as any corporate interest that lobbies in \nWashington. They not only ignore the rights of parents to hide their \nyoung daughters' abortions, they also protect sexual offenders and \nstatutory rapists.\n  And who are the lobbyists for the abortion industry? Exactly the same \ncast that has launched an attack on Justice Owen. One wonders, as \ncolumnist Jeff Jacoby did in the Boston Globe, who are the extremists \non this issue, who is out of the mainstream? Not Justice Owen--82 \npercent of the American people favor consent and notice laws such as \nJustice Owen interpreted--86 percent in Illinois.\n\n  I will say it again, while my colleagues continue in general to apply \nan abortion litmus test, the assault against Justice Owen was not about \nabortion rights, it was about abortion profits. It is not about a \nwoman's right to an abortion, it is about assailing parental laws that \nthreaten the men who pay for abortions. It is whether parents should at \nleast know, not even consent to, but just know, when a minor child is \nhaving an abortion paid for by an adult.\n  Let's speak truth to power. Justice Owen was picked to be opposed \nbecause she is a friend of President Bush from Texas. She was opposed \nby an axis of profits. This axis of profits combines the money of trial \nlawyers and the abortion industry to fund the Washington special \ninterest groups, and spreads its influence to the halls of power in \nWashington and in State courts across this country.\n  The Opposition against Justice Owen was intended not only to have a \nchilling effect for women jurists that will keep them from weighing in \non exactly the sorts of cases that most invite their participation and \ntheir perspectives as women, but also on all judges in all State courts \nwho rule on cases the trial lawyers want to win and cash in on.\n  When my colleagues voted against her, they chose to besmirch a model \nyoung woman from Texas, who grew up, worked hard and did all the right \nthings--including repeatedly answering the call of public service at \nsacrifice of personal wealth and family. My Democrat colleagues voted, \nin effect, against the American promise of fairness.\n  This is a young woman who gave up a lucrative career to give public \nservice on the Texas Supreme Court, and who deserves to be on the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Such a vote should have taken place in the light of this Senate \nfloor, but the American people will hear of the result notwithstanding \nthe shadows.\n  I only hope the American people will repair the damage done to the \nConstitution when they vote in November.\n  I have reviewed Mr. Marra's distinguished career and I can say, \nwithout hesitation, that he will be an excellent addition to the \nprestigious Southern District of Florida.\n  Mr. Marra comes to the federal bench with a unique and extremely \nuseful qualification: Judge Marra is a former Social Studies teacher at \nElmont Memorial High School in Elmont, New York. After teaching high \nschool for several years, Judge Marra inexplicably decided to change \ncareer paths and went to law school, graduating from Stetson University \nCollege of Law in 1977. He then went to work for the United States \nDepartment of Justice as part of its honor law graduates program. While \nat the Department of Justice, he was involved in litigation which \nsought to protect the land, water and mineral rights of Native \nAmericans from encroachment and to regain such resources that had been \nwrongfully lost over the years.\n  After three years with the Department of Justice, Judge Marra joined \nthe law firm of Wender, Murase & White of Washington, D.C., where he \nwas involved in patent and trademark litigation, corporate law and \nlitigation in the area of federal Indian law.

The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am sure it was inadvertent that when \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah was talking about the editorials \nagainst the nominee, Priscilla Owen, he said there were only three \nagainst.\n  I refer, for example, to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and I will \nquote from it and then put the whole editorial in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that articles in opposition to her be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 4, 2002]\n\n                            The Wrong Judge\n\n       Priscilla Owen, President Bush's latest nominee to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, has \n     been at times so eager to issue conservative rulings in cases \n     before her on the Texas Supreme Court that she has ignored \n     statutory language and substituted her own views. This \n     criticism comes not from the ``special interest groups'' she \n     has charged with misstating her record, but from Alberto \n     Gonzales, President Bush's own White House counsel. Mr. \n     Gonzales, who served with Justice Owen on the Texas high \n     court, once lambasted her dissent in an abortion case for \n     engaging in ``unconscionable . . . judicial activism.'' Mr. \n     Gonzales says today that he nonetheless supports the \n     elevation of Justice Owen. We do not.\n       In choosing a nominee for the Fifth Circuit--the powerful \n     federal appeals court for Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana--\n     President Bush has looked to the extreme right wing of the \n     legal profession. Even on Texas' conservative Supreme Court, \n     Justice Owen has distinguished herself as one of the most \n     conservative members. A former lawyer for the oil and gas \n     industry, she reflexively favors manufacturers over \n     consumers, employers over workers and insurers over sick \n     people. In abortion cases Justice Owen has been resourceful \n     about finding reasons that, despite United States Supreme \n     Court holdings and Texas case law, women should be denied the \n     right to choose.\n       Justice Owen's views are so far from the mainstream that, \n     on those grounds alone, the Senate should be reluctant to \n     confirm her. But what is particularly disturbing about her \n     approach to judging is, as Mr. Gonzales has identified, her \n     willingness to ignore that text and intent of laws that stand \n     in her way. In an important age discrimination case, Justice \n     Owen dissented to argue that the plaintiff should have to \n     meet a higher standard than Texas law requires.\n       Justice Owen has also shown a disturbing lack of \n     sensitivity to judicial ethics. She has raised large amounts \n     of campaign contributions from corporations and law firms, \n     and\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\n     then declined to recuse herself when those contributors have \n     had cases before her. And as a judicial candidate, she \n     publicly endorsed a pro-business political action committee \n     that was raising money to influence the rulings of the Texas \n     Supreme Court.\n       After the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Judge Charles \n     Pickering, another far-right choice, for a seat on the Fifth \n     Circuit earlier this year, the Bush administration declared \n     that it would not be intimidated into choosing more centrist \n     nominees. Sadly, the administration has lived up to its \n     threat. In this dispute the Senate is right: the \n     administration should stop trying to use the judiciary to \n     advance a political agenda that is out of step with the views \n     of most Americans.\n       Justice Owen is a choice that makes sense for Justice \n     Department ideologues who want to turn the courts into a \n     champion of big business, insurance companies and the \n     religious right. But the American people deserve better. \n     Justice Owen's nomination should be rejected.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, July 23, 2002]\n\n                        Ideologues All in a Row\n\n       Last year President Bush eliminated the American Bar Assn. \n     from the process of vetting potential judicial nominees, a \n     role it performed ably and in a nonpartisan way for the nine \n     presidents before him. Now he relies on the ideological tests \n     of the very conservative Federalist Society.\n       Not surprisingly, the men and women who pass this rigid \n     test look remarkably alike on the bench. They often side with \n     business in disputes involving employee rights, consumers and \n     the environment. They strongly oppose abortion, and their \n     opinions reveal a strong streak of judicial activism dressed \n     up as traditional principle.\n       Priscilla Owen is among them. A protege of Bush confident \n     Karl Rove, who engineered her 1994 election to the Texas \n     Supreme Court, Owen is a nominee to a seat on the U.S. 5th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. She comes before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee today to defend a record of indifference \n     to the problems of most Americans.\n       Senators should ask her why, for example, she voted to \n     reverse a jury verdict in favor of a woman who had sued her \n     health insurance company for refusing necessary surgery to \n     remove her spleen and gallbladder. Her colleague on the Texas \n     high court, Alberto Gonzales, now Bush's top legal advisor, \n     dissented, writing that Owen's decision turned the legal \n     standard in that case ``on its head.''\n       Gonzales, a solid conservative himself, also took issue \n     with Owen in an abortion case that should draw tough \n     questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairwoman \n     of today's hearing. Texas law allows pregnant teenagers in \n     some instances to seek permission from a judge to have an \n     abortion without their parents' consent. Owen has staunchly \n     opposed such ``judicial bypasses.'' In one case, Gonzales, \n     wrote, Owen's opinion would have ``create[d] hurdles that \n     simply are not found in the . . . statute'' and would be ``an \n     unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' in other cases, \n     her colleagues have accused her of ``inflammatory rhetoric.''\n       For all this, Owen's nomination puts Feinstein in a tough \n     spot. She was chairwoman last March when the Judiciary \n     Committee rejected Charles Pickering, another Bush pick for \n     the 5th Circuit. She is anxious to avoid being labeled \n     obstructionist. But given her repeated calls for mainstream \n     nominees, not to mention her long support for abortion \n     rights, Feinstein should vote no, and so should her \n     colleagues.\n       Although it is now one of the most conservative appellate \n     federal courts, the 5th Circuit has a long and honorable \n     history--defending civil rights during the 1960s and the \n     rights of asbestos workers, systematically deceived and \n     injured by their employers, in the 1970s. Owen would add \n     nothing positive to that legacy.\n       Americans want independent, common-sensical and capable \n     judges, not those whose political ideology--from either \n     direction--wins them a nomination. As long as Bush continues \n     to exclude the American Bar Assn. from the nomination \n     process, he should not be surprised that his choices draw \n     fire.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Antonio Express-News, July 21, 2002]\n\n                  Bush Court Choice Should Be Rejected\n\n       Once competency is established, the most important \n     qualification for a judge is commitment to following the law \n     as it is written--regardless of personal philosophy.\n       Justice Priscilla Owen is clearly competent, but her record \n     demonstrates a results-oriented streak that belies \n     supporters' claims that she strictly follows the law.\n       Because of Owen's record as a member of the Texas Supreme \n     Court, the Senate Judiciary Committee should reject her \n     nomination to sit on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Her most infamous opinions involve cases in which minors \n     were seeking a legal bypass allowing them to get an abortion \n     without parental consent.\n       In those cases, she consistently landed in a small court \n     minority that opposes such bypasses, while a majority of her \n     fellow judges on an all-Republican court upheld the law as \n     legislators wrote it.\n       Former Justice Al Gonzales clearly pointed that out. In an \n     opinion that countered a dissent she supported, he wrote: \n     ``To construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to \n     eliminate bypasses, or to create hurdles that simply are not \n     to be found in the words of the statute, would be an \n     unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n       Now serving as President Bush's White House counsel, \n     Gonzales is defending his former state court colleague. \n     However, opinions she wrote in the parental consent cases \n     show a clear line between strict constructionist judges and \n     activists.\n       Owen, who remains on the state's high court, is an \n     activist.\n       In recent years, judicial nomination struggles on Capitol \n     Hill have become a game, played by both parties, or petty \n     obstructionism.\n       The Senate should not block a judicial nominee simply \n     because he or she is more conservative or more liberal than \n     the Senate's majority party.\n       It also should not engage in petty personal attacks. But \n     concerns about Owen go to the heart of what makes a good \n     judge.\n       When a nominee has demonstrated a propensity to spin the \n     law to fit philosophical beliefs, it is the Senate's right--\n     and duty--to reject that nominee.\n       A hearing on Owen's nomination is set for this week.\n       Although Owen should be rejected for a lifetime \n     appointment, the Democrat-controlled Senate should have given \n     her a hearing long ago. Bush nominated Owen on May 9, 2001.\n       Owen and the president were owed better treatment. Even \n     nominees who are destined for rejection deserve timely \n     consideration, and the Democrats should pick up the pace in \n     considering Bush's judicial picks.\n       During his years as Texas governor, Bush did a masterful \n     job of selecting quality, moderate judges. But his decision \n     to nominate Owen is a disappointment.\n       We urge Bush to take more care in future nominations and \n     return to his previous policy of nominating judges who \n     believe in the law more than any ideological agenda.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, July 23, 2002]\n\n                      Feinstein's Decisive Moment\n\n       Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., faces a momentous \n     decision. Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold \n     hearings on Priscilla Owen, the president's candidate for a \n     lifetime appointment to the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Fifth Circuit. With the committee divided along party \n     lines, Feinstein could cast the decisive vote.\n       When George W. Bush became president, he excoriated \n     judicial activism and vowed to nominate justices who \n     interpret the law, instead of trying to rewrite it.\n       Priscilla Owen simply does not satisfy the president's own \n     criteria for this position. According to a report issued by \n     People For the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, Owen \n     has demonstrated a disturbing pattern of overruling the law \n     when it clashes with her conservative ideology.\n       In one case, for example, Owen's dissenting decision would \n     have effectively rewritten a key Texas civil rights law by \n     making it more difficult for employees to prove \n     discrimination. Her colleagues on the bench--mostly Bush \n     appointees--wrote that her ruling ``defies the Legislature's \n     clear and express limits on our jurisdiction.''\n       With respect to reproductive rights, Owen advocated a far \n     more restrictive interpretation of the Texas law that allows \n     a minor to obtain an abortion without parental notification. \n     Her dissent prompted then-Justice Alberto Gonzales, now the \n     White House counsel, to write that her opinion constituted \n     ``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' Gonzales, \n     naturally, now expresses the White House party line, hailing \n     Owen's integrity and ability. ``I'm confident she will follow \n     the law as defined by the Supreme Court,'' Gonzales was \n     quoted as saying in the San Antonio Express-News.\n       But close observers of her Texas record are less confident \n     of her objectivity. Danielle Tierney, a Planned Parenthood \n     spokeswoman from Texas, said Owen has ``a record of active \n     opposition to reproductive and women's rights.''\n       Owen has also tried to finesse laws that protect public \n     information rights, the environment, and jury findings.\n       The point is, Owen has created a strong record of \n     ``rewriting'' the law when it does not match her conservative \n     convictions.\n       This is why it is vital that Feinstein reject this \n     nomination.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, July 16, 2002]\n\n            Justice Owen: Perpetrator or Victim of Politics?\n\n\n         her activism has been extreme, even by texas standards\n\n                          (By Craig McDonald)\n\n       Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, who faces a \n     Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday on her nomination \n     to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, flunks the stated \n     judicial criteria of both President Bush and the Democratic \n     chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n       Although the president nominated Justice Owen, she flunks \n     his own pledge to appoint ``strict constructionists'' who \n     narrowly interpret laws rather than write opinions promoting \n     a political agenda. ``I want people on the bench who don't \n     try to use their position to legislate from the bench,'' Mr. \n     Bush has said. Yet Justice Owen's record on the Texas Supreme \n     Court is one of a judicial activist who seeks to make laws \n     from the bench.\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\n       Justice Owen also flunks the criteria of Senate Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, who has pledged to stop any \n     ``ideological court packing.'' Justice Owen's record has \n     established her as an ideological extremist out of the \n     mainstream--even on the all-conservative Texas Supreme Court.\n       Justice Owen's extreme opinions have mobilized a large \n     coalition of Texas organizations working to stop her \n     appointment. The groups fighting her nomination range from \n     the Texas chapter of the American Association of University \n     Women to the Women's Health and Family Planning Association. \n     They include the AFL-CIO, the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People, Planned Parenthood, the Texas \n     Civil Rights Project, the Texas Abortion Rights Action League \n     and others.\n       While each of those organizations has its own reasons for \n     opposing Justice Owen, my group--Texas for Public Justice--is \n     particularly troubled by the fact that she has amassed a body \n     of rulings that advance the agendas of the special interests \n     that bankrolled her judicial campaigns. Thirty-seven percent \n     of the $1.4 million that Justice Owen raised for her Supreme \n     Court campaigns came from donors with a direct stake in case \n     in her court.\n       Letting special interests bankroll judicial campaigns has \n     shattered public confidence in Texas courts. A 1999 Texas \n     Supreme Court poll found that 83 percent of Texans, 79 \n     percent of Texas lawyers and 48 percent of Texas judges say \n     campaign contributions significantly influence judicial \n     decisions. Commenting on the poll, U.S. Supreme Court Justice \n     Anthony Kennedy said, ``The law commands allegiance only if \n     it commands respect. It commands respect only if the public \n     thinks judges are neutral.''\n       Since Justice Owen joined the high court in 1995, she has \n     written and joined a slew of opinions that favor businesses \n     over consumers, defendants over plaintiffs and judges over \n     lawmakers and juries. A 1999 study by Austin-based Court \n     Watch found that individuals won just 36 present of their \n     cases during Justice Owen's tenure, compared to a win rate of \n     66 percent for businesses, 70 percent for insurers and 86 \n     percent for medical interests.\n       While all nine Texas Supreme Court justices are pro-\n     business conservatives, Justice Owen and Nathan Hecht became \n     an isolated bloc of extremist dissent about 1998. \n     Masquerading as ``strict constructionists,'' Justices Owen \n     and Hecht have promoted the interests of big business and the \n     far right with much less restraint than their fellow Texas \n     justices. That ultraconservative activism is all the more \n     disturbing, given that it mirrors the agenda of the top \n     donors to their judicial war chests.\n       In making lifetime appointments to federal appeals courts, \n     the president and the Senate can--and should--do better. \n     Justice Owen lacks criminal trial experience, has taken more \n     than $500,000 in judicial contributions from interests with \n     cases in her court and has produced a body of activist \n     opinions that are extremist--even by Texas standards.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Antonio Express-News, July 21, 2002]\n\n     Judge Owens Flunks Bush's Own ``Strict Constructionists'' Test\n\n                        (By Jan Jarboe Russell)\n\n       In a perfect world, there wouldn't be ``liberal'' judges or \n     ``conservative'' judges, there would just be good judges. \n     After all, if you ask ordinary people what they want in a \n     federal judge, what they want are judges who are fair, \n     learned and impartial, judges who have the ability to lay \n     aside their own political views and do their public duty.\n       Why then is it so darn hard to find these kind of plain-\n     and-simple judges? The answer, of course, is the dreaded P \n     word; politics. The ongoing battle in the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee over the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the 5th \n     U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is a perfect example of how \n     politics is making a certifiable mess of America's judicial \n     system.\n       In seven years on the Texas Supreme Court, the only way \n     moderate-thinking people in Texas survived Owen's relentless \n     ultra-conservative dissents was to toughen our stomachs and \n     take her many efforts to rewrite our state laws one day at a \n     time. This is a woman who has consistently ruled against \n     consumers, has routinely overturned decisions of juries, has \n     curtailed access to public records, and by anyone's measure \n     is an avid anti-abortion ideologue.\n       Mind you: the Texas Supreme Court is no bastion of \n     liberalism. The nine members of the court are 100 percent \n     pedigree Republican, but Owen was such a right-wing activist \n     she managed to earn the nickname ``Justice Enron'' for \n     accepting $8,600 in Enron campaign funds in one year--$1,000 \n     of it from Kenneth Lay himself--and turning around the next \n     and writing an opinion that saved Enron $225,000 in school \n     taxes.\n       As one of only nine states in the nation with the sorry \n     system of electing our judges with expensive campaigns paid \n     for by the very lawyers and businesses that come before these \n     judges for justice, Texas gets exactly the kind of justice we \n     deserve. In the case just mentioned, for example, Enron paid \n     for the privilege of robbing the public school children of \n     Spring, a Houston suburb, of their rightful share of taxes.\n       I don't expect President Bush to nominate judges to the \n     federal bench with whom I agree politically. But I do expect \n     Bush to nominate people to lifetime positions on the federal \n     bench who meet Bush's own standards of ``strict \n     constructionists,'' judges who will interpret rather than \n     write the law. Owen fails the Bush test.\n       In no less than a dozen cases in which the Texas Supreme \n     Court was asked to allow a pregnant teenager to bypass the \n     state's parental notification requirement and have an \n     abortion, Owen voted every time to deny the bypass and \n     created hurdles that were not written in the state's law. In \n     one case, when lawyers for a high school senior requested \n     that the court act quickly on the girl's request for \n     permission to bypass the notification requirement, Owen wrote \n     a dissent that asked: ``Why then the rush to judgment?'' The \n     girl was in the 15th week of pregnancy at the time.\n       Owen's rulings in these abortion notification cases were so \n     strident that Alberto Gonzales, now Bush's White House \n     counsel but then a member of the Texas Supreme Court, wrote \n     in a majority opinion that Owen and two other dissenting \n     justices were thwarting the clear intent of the law. To \n     accept their reasoning, he wrote, ``would be an \n     unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n       Gonzales finds himself in the role of reluctant cheerleader \n     for Owen. In a telephone interview from his office in the \n     West Wing the other day, Gonzales claimed that he never \n     accused Owen of judicial activism and believes she would be \n     an excellent judge. His opinion has written in black-and-\n     white only two years ago--he clearly called her dissent an \n     ``unconscionable act of judicial activism''--but maybe in his \n     struggle to find the gray, Gonzales meant that he thought all \n     of three of the judges were unconscionable. Who knows? \n     Politics makes people parse words very carefully.\n       Owen's political credentials are indeed impressive. She is \n     a protege of Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, \n     and it is Rove who is pushing her judicial nomination. But \n     politics should not be the primary measure of a judge's \n     ability to administer justice.\n       As much as it pains me to say it, Justice Enron should stay \n     put in Texas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Houston Chronicle, July 31, 2002]\n\n                  DiFi, Owen Would Be Very Odd Couple\n\n                            (By Cragg Hines)\n\n       Sen.

Feinstein is not about to help them divine the \n     oracle at the moment.\n       ``I've been giving it a great deal of thought,'' Feinstein \n     said this week as the Senate headed toward summer recess. \n     ``I'm not going to let my decision be known, but at an \n     appropriate time, I will.\n       ``What I've said, and I've taken this position, I think, \n     rather scrupulously, is that I don't make up my mind until \n     after the hearing.''\n       There was little in the hearing that should lead Feinstein, \n     or any senator, to believe that Owen is anything but the very \n     bright, very ideological, very driven hard-right jurist \n     revealed in her work over the last seven years on Texas' \n     highest civil court.\n       Finally, Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill, asked Owen directly \n     about her position on abortion.\n       ``My position is that Roe v. Wade has been the law of the \n     land for many, many years . . . ,'' Owen said, noting that \n     decision had been modified (and made more restrictive by \n     subsequent rulings). ``None of my personal beliefs would get \n     in the way of me applying that law or any other law.''\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\n       But Owen's record, in a series of recent abortion-related \n     cases, suggests otherwise. In all but one of the cases, Owen \n     sought to tweak and torture the Texas law to something not \n     intended by the Legislature.\n       Feinstein was listening to all of this and, one assumes, \n     took it on board. In case she didn't, an editorial in The Los \n     Angeles Times the morning of the hearing should have helped: \n     The work of Owen and similarly situated conservative jurists \n     ``reveal(s) a strong streak of judicial activism dressed up \n     as traditional principle.''\n       The home state newspaper parsed Feinstein's situation: She \n     also chaired the hearings earlier this year in which the \n     Judiciary Committee rejected Bush's nomination of Charles \n     Pickering of Mississippi for a seat on the 5th Circuit Court.\n       ``She is anxious to avoid being labeled obstructionist,'' \n     The Times said of Feinstein. ``But given the repeated calls \n     for mainstream nominees, not to mention her long support of \n     abortion rights, Feinstein should vote no, and so should her \n     colleagues.'' Feinstein said she weighs such opinion but that \n     it is not dispositive.\n       One piece of baggage Feinstein would like to discard in the \n     Owen matter is that her vote will have anything to do with a \n     business relationship that the senator's husband, Richard C. \n     Blum, has with Dr. James Leininger of San Antonio, a generous \n     supporter of Owen's judicial campaign.\n       ``I've never met (Leininger), talked with him, seen him, \n     heard from him--and that's that,'' Feinstein said. Nor, she \n     said, ``have I ever talked to my husband about this, nor has \n     he ever talked to me about it.''\n       So Feinstein should be able to vote against Owen with a \n     clear conscience.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In part, this article says:\n\n       Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy has held \n     hearings on 82 Bush judicial nominations, 80 of which have \n     been approved by the committee. Most of those nominees have \n     been pro-life conservatives whose performance on the bench \n     the committee still judged to be fair and professional. For \n     example, last week the committee unanimously reported on \n     President Bush's choice of Federal District Judge Reena Raggi \n     of New York for the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the \n     Second Circuit.\n\n  Parenthetically, I might add that Judge Raggi was originally \nappointed by President Ronald Reagan, a conservative Republican who \npromised to appoint only judges who satisfied his litmus test.\n\n       The American people appreciate balanced judging, and thanks \n     to the Senate Judiciary Committee, they're getting it.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Through constant repetition, conservatives have managed to \n     make a code phrase out of ``judicial activism,'' applying it \n     to rulings that in their mind go beyond the words in \n     legislation or the U.S. Constitution. But conservatives \n     themselves are hardly immune from the problem.\n       Case in point: Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, \n     rejected last week for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \n     by the Senate Judiciary Committee because of her record of \n     making law from the bench. The committee made the right \n     decision for the American people.\n       Owen's activist judging has gone so far beyond the statutes \n     enacted by the Texas Legislature that she was even criticized \n     by fellow conservatives on the state Supreme Court, including \n     Alberto Gonzales, who is now Bush's White House counsel.\n       On abortion, age and employment discrimination, insurance \n     and tax matters, the former corporate oil lawyer repeatedly \n     embellished the plain language of the law to rewrite it to \n     conform with her own ideological views. She also found ways \n     to side consistently with corporations, including Enron, \n     which contributed generously to her Supreme Court election \n     campaign.\n       President Bush has accused the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     of blind partisanship, but the facts don't bear that out. In \n     less than two years, the Democratic-controlled committee has \n     approved more Bush nominees for the federal bench than the \n     Republican-controlled Senate Committee did in six years with \n     President Clinton.\n       Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has held \n     hearings on 82 Bush judicial nominations, 80 of which have \n     been approved by the committee. Most of those nominees have \n     been pro-life conservatives whose performance on the bench \n     the committee still judged to be fair and professional. For \n     example, last week the committee unanimously confirmed Bush's \n     choice of Federal District Judge Reena Raggi of New York for \n     the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Nevertheless, Bush lashed out angrily at the Owen defeat: \n     ``I don't appreciate it one bit, and neither do the American \n     people.''\n       Quite the contrary, Mr. President. The American people \n     appreciate balanced judging, and thanks to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, they're getting it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute, with another minute to be given to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I was going to go into a quorum call for 5 or 6 minutes \nanyway. If the Senators would like 3 more minutes each or something, \nthat is fine. Otherwise, I will go into a quorum call.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, there was a suggestion made--I am sure \ninadvertent--by the distinguished Senator from Utah that it was \nunprecedented to see a nominee with a well-qualified rating be voted \nagainst. Actually, the Senator from Utah has voted against such a \nperson, like Judge Rosemary Barkett of Florida, as have a number of \nothers. But then there were a whole lot of others who we can say were \nnot voted against? Why? Because they were never allowed to have a vote \nduring Republican control of the Senate.\n  This is a partial list of nominees who never had a vote, but they had \nthe highest rating possible: H. Alston Johnson from the Fifth Circuit \nwas never given a hearing by the Republicans; James Duffy from the \nNinth Circuit was never given a hearing; Kathleen McCree Lewis from the \nSixth Circuit was never given a hearing or a vote; Judge James Lyons, \nfrom the Tenth Circuit, was never given a vote or a hearing; Allen \nSnyder, from DC, had a hearing but no vote; Judge Robert Cindrich, from \nthe Third Circuit, was never given a hearing or a vote; Judge Stephen \nOrlofsky, from the Third Circuit, was never given a hearing or a vote; \nJudge Andre Davis, from the Fourth Circuit, was never given a hearing \nor a vote; and Enrique Moreno, of the Fifth Circuit, was never given a \nhearing and never given a vote.\n\n  These are people with the highest possible rating from the ABA. \nRepublicans can say they never voted against them. Why? Because they \nwere never brought up and never given a vote. If they had been given a \nvote, they would have known where they stood.\n  My good friend from Utah, perhaps inadvertently, thought I was \ncomparing a time when he was not chairman. I do compare a time when he \nwas chairman. I will take the first 15 months that he was chairman with \na Democratic President.\n  The Democratic President nominees got 14 hearings in 15 months; the \nRepublican President nominees, under my chairmanship, got 23 hearings.\n  Nominees who received hearings under Republicans were 67; under the \nDemocrats with a Republican President, 84.\n  Nominees confirmed, 56; in the same period of time, it was 74 with \nus.\n  Nominees voted on in committee: They allowed 61 during that 15 \nmonths. We have had votes on 82 of this President's judicial nominees.\n  It is nice to say nominations are not being handled fairly. The fact \nis, if we used the Republican precedent as a mark of fairness, we would \nnot have to do anything else for the rest of the year because we are \nway beyond what they did.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 4 minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 7 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, again, the Senator from Vermont and I are \nfriends, but I totally disagree with what he has been saying. It is a \nsmoke screen.\n  Allow me to address the fate of nominees first sent up by the first \nPresident Bush. In fact, some pending today without a hearing who were \nnominated by the first President Bush nearly 10 years ago. These are \nnominees still on the list after 10 years that the Democrats have not \nallowed to come up: Terrence Boyle for the Fourth Circuit and John \nRoberts for the DC Circuit, considered one of the two or three greatest \nappellate lawyers in the country before the Supreme Court; Henry Saad \nfor the Sixth Circuit; Ronald Leighton for the Western District of \nWashington; and Richard Dorr for the Western District of Missouri. All \nfive of these nominees were nominated by the first President Bush, \nbetter than 10 years ago, but never received committee action at that \ntime. I hope they, too, will soon\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nreceive their long-awaited hearings and confirmation votes.\n  By the way, there were 42 left over at the end of the Clinton \nadministration. Nine of them were put up so late, there was no way \nanybody could have gotten them through. That brings us down to 33, and \nof the 33, there were others who did not have the support of both home-\nState Senators. There were those who, for one reason or another, could \nnot make it.\n  Contrast that when Bush 1 left office and the Democrats were in \ncontrol. There were 54 left over. That is 11 more than were left when \nPresident Clinton left office.\n  If you want to talk statistics, I can talk them all day long, and I \ncan tell you we have been much more fair than what we have seen in the \nfirst 2 years of the Bush 2 administration.\n  I suggest that instead of spending our time talking about the same \nsmall handful of Clinton nominees, we should focus on the ones pending \nbefore us today who never saw the light of day the last time the \nDemocrats controlled the Senate.\n  Justice Owen, for instance--and this is an important point--is \nliterally the first one in history who had the support of both-home \nState Senators, the highest rating of the American Bar Association, and \nwas voted down in committee and not even given a chance to have a vote \non the Senate floor.\n  Currently, there are 80 empty seats on the Federal judiciary. That is \na 9.3-percent vacancy rate, one of the highest in modern times. This \nmeans that 9.3 percent of all Federal courtrooms are presided over by \nan empty chair.\n  There are currently 21 nominees who are slated to fill positions \nwhich have been declared judicial emergencies by the Administrative \nOffice of the Courts. Of those, 11 are Circuit Court of Appeals \nnominees.\n  Only 5 of President Bush's first 11 circuit court nominees nominated \non May 9, 2001--a year and a half ago almost--have had hearings. In \nother words, the Judiciary Committee has taken no action whatsoever on \nnearly half of the circuit court nominations that have been pending for \nover 16 months.\n  There is no reason for this other than stall tactics. All of these \nnominees received qualified or well-qualified ratings from the American \nBar Association.\n  There were 31 vacancies in the Federal courts of appeals on May 9, \n2001, and there are 28 today. The Senate Democrats are trying to create \nan illusion of movement by creating great media attention and \ncontroversy concerning a small handful of nominees in order to make it \nlook like progress. But we are not making any progress in filling \ncircuit vacancies.\n  President Bush has responded to the vacancy crisis in the appellate \ncourts by nominating a total of 32 top-notch men and women to these \nposts--but the Senate is simply stalling them. Over the past year, the \nSenate has confirmed only 13. There are still 19 Circuit Court nominees \npending in Committee. By comparison, at the end of President Clinton's \nsecond year in office, we had confirmed 19 circuit judges and had 15 \ncircuit court vacancies.\n  There were only two Circuit Court nominees left pending in committee \nat the end of President Clinton's first year in office. In contrast, \nthere were 23 of President Bush's Circuit Court nominees pending in \nCommittee at the end of last year.\n  Some try to blame the Republicans for the vacancy crisis, but that is \nbunk. At the end of the 106th Congress when I was chairman, we had 67 \nvacancies in the Federal judiciary. During the past 9 months, the \nvacancy rate has been hovering right around 100. Today is at 80.\n  Some think that the point of ``advise and consent'' is to match \nstatistics from previous years. This rear-view-mirror driving is \nnonsense. The Senate has a duty to exercise its advice and consent, and \nit has done so on only 40 percent of President Bush's appellate court \nnominations so far this Congress. The question is not: How many judges \nshould we let President Bush have? The question is: Is the Senate \ngetting its work done?\n  The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which encompasses the states of \nMichigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, has only 8 of 16 seats filled, \nleaving that court half-empty. The President has nominated 8 \nindividuals to fill these vacancies, but only two have received a \nhearing, despite the fact that two of these nominees have been pending \nsince May 9, 2001.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is also \nfunctioning far below its normal capacity, with 4 out of 12 authorized \njudgeships currently vacant. Although the President nominated Miguel \nEstrada and John Roberts on May 9, 2001, to fill seats on this Court, \nthey have not yet been given a hearing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last year when the Republicans controlled \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, they did not hold one hearing on \nPresident Bush's nominees. We have done 82.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Judiciary \nCommittee for recognizing the needs of Florida and favorably reporting \nthe nomination of Judge Kenneth A. Marra.\n  Ken Marra, a skilled and respected Judge in Florida's Fifteenth \nCircuit, has been nominated to serve as a Federal judge in the busy \nSouthern District of Florida. If confirmed, he will fill a newly \ncreated and much needed judgeship position.\n  Judge Marra's solid qualifications make him an ideal candidate for \nservice on the Federal bench. A circuit judge since 1996, he currently \nserves in the Palm Beach County Court's civil, family and criminal \ndivisions. Before his tenure as a circuit judge, Judge Marra spent 16 \nyears practicing commercial litigation in Palm Beach County and \nWashington, DC. He also served as a trial attorney with the United \nStates Department of Justice.\n  Judge Marra is a graduate of the State University of New York at \nStony Brook and earned his law degree from the Stetson University \nCollege of Law in 1977. Before attending law school, the judge taught \nsocial studies to high school students in New York.\n  The strength of Judge Marra's nomination is evident from the strong \nsupport that he has earned from his local bar. When asked to comment on \nhis nomination for a January 4 Palm Beach Post article, Amy Smith, \npresident of the Palm Beach County Bar Association, said, ``He is an \nabsolutely perfect choice: impeccable background, extremely \nintelligent, consistently one of the highest rated judges in the \njudicial evaluations done here.'' Ms. Smith said Marra's judicial \ndemeanor ``is gracious and humble. The President couldn't have made a \nbetter choice.''\n  When the Palm Beach County Bar Association released its biennial \nsurvey of circuit and county judges earlier this spring, Judge Marra \nranked the highest in the neutrality and fairness category, with 63 \npercent of the attorneys rating him as ``outstanding.''\n  In Florida, Judge Marra submitted his application to a judicial \nnominating committee comprised of a diverse group of Floridians, who in \nturn recommended three candidates to the President for consideration. \nSenator Bill Nelson and I interviewed these candidates.\n  In summary, Mr. Marra is an intelligent, well-respected, and \nqualified candidate for the Federal bench.\n  I appreciate the Senate's consideration of Judge Marra's nomination \nand look forward to working with my colleagues to confirm additional \nnominees to Florida's Southern and Middle Districts, two of the largest \nand busiest judicial districts in the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Kenneth A. Marra, of Florida, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Southern District of Florida? The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the Senator from Maryland \n(Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I do not want to take an extended period of \ntime because I know the managers of the legislation are here and ready \nto go forward with the very important consideration of and amendments \nto the Homeland Security Department, but I must comment on action last \nweek of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Once again, Mr. President, there has been a tremendous miscarriage of \njustice by the Judiciary Committee. By a vote of 10 to 9, a unanimous, \npartisan block of Democrats--10 Democrats--voted against the nomination \nof Priscilla Owen, who had been nominated by the President to a seat on \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The way this nomination was handled is a cause for great concern as \nwell as the fact that, once again, the Senate will not have a chance to \nvote on a eminently qualified and experienced nominee to serve on the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am convinced that had her nomination \nbeen permitted to make it to the floor--as the Republican Majority in \nthe past allowed numerous controversial Democrat nominees to get to the \nfloor--Judge Owen would be approved by the full Senate and she would be \nconfirmed.\n  We always hear the arguments of those who say that there have been \nactions in the past where nominees who were qualified were not given \nvotes. However, during the time when I was majority leader I remember \nnumerous cases where despite the belief of many Senators on our side \nthat the nominees' views were far, far outside the mainstream, we still \npermitted their nominations to come to the floor. We did that because \nwhile we disagreed with their political and ideological views, it was \nstill hard to argue that they were not professionally qualified.\n  Mr. President, I specifically remember the nominations of Marsha \nBerzon, Richard Paez and Rosemary Barkett. Certainly, these nominees, \nwhile they were qualified, were in my opinion not near as qualified in \nthe legal profession as Priscilla Owen.\n  Berzon had had no judicial experience whatsoever. And a minority of \nthe ABA evaluation committee gave Berzon and Paez only a ``qualified'' \nrating whereas the ABA committee unanimously--unanimously--gave \nPriscilla Owen its highest rating of ``well qualified.''\n  Beyond professional qualifications, numerous Senators on this side of \nthe aisle also had severe concerns that Berzon, Paez, and Barkett were \nvery far out of the mainstream in light of their records which raised \nquestions for many Senators as to whether they should be confirmed.\n  Marsha Berzon had been a prominent ACLU and Labor Union lawyer who \nopposed parental consent laws for minors' to have abortions and had \nworked against the rights of individual workers in favor of the rights \nof unions. She was also a prominent and active member of the Brennan \nCenter for Justice that cranked out initiatives it characterized as \n``stand[ing] up to right-wing attacks on the judiciary.''\n  Richard Paez had written publicly of his belief that whenever judges \nfeel legislatures have failed to act, ``there's no choice but for the \ncourts to resolve the question that perhaps ideally and preferably \nshould be resolved through the legislative process.'' That is exactly \nthe kind of judicial activism that Priscilla Owen's critics have \nfalsely accused her of in order to give themselves an excuse for voting \nagainst her. Paez had also ruled as a district judge--prior to his \nconfirmation to the appeals court--that States and cities could not \noutlaw was aggressive and intimidating panhandling by the homeless \nbecause it would infringe on a panhandler's free speech rights.\n  Rosemary Barkett, while a Florida Supreme Court Justice, had argued \nfor overturning the death penalty of a man who had brutally murdered a \nyouth in Jacksonville and then sent a tape to the victim's mother \ndescribing the horrible details of the killing. An opinion signed by \nBarkett opposed the death arguing that the killing was ``a social \nawareness case . . . effectuated to focus attention on . . . racial \ndiscrimination.''\n\n  Nevertheless, despite the misgivings and question marks from an \nideology standpoint as to whether or not they should be confirmed, the \nRepublican majority permitted all three of these nominations to come to \nthe floor and be voted on by the full Senate and all three were \nconfirmed.\n  Now, in contrast to these three far left nominees, let me speak to \nPriscilla Owen's qualifications.\n  First of all, I am not one who thinks it is particularly important \nwhether the American Bar Association rates a nominee qualified or not. \nBut, of course, the ABA's judgment has been described by a number of \nleading Democrats as the gold standard in terms of evaluating a \nnominee's qualifications to serve in the Federal judiciary. Senator \nLeahy and senator Schumer described it that way in a March 16, 2001 \nletter to the President insisting that the ABA's role in the judicial \nconfirmation process had to be maintained.\n  However, that did not prevent them from voting against Priscilla Owen \nafter she received a ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar \nAssociation--the highest possible rating they could give and they gave \nit to her unanimously. This is also the first instance, I believe, that \nwe have had of a nominee rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation being defeated in the Judiciary Committee and\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\nthe Senate. So, from the standpoint of the American Bar Association, \nthis nominee certainly more than qualified.\n  Also, Mr. President, when you look at Judge Owen's record, it is \nclear that she has a long record of being outstanding not only \nacademically and intellectually, but also from the standpoint of \ncharacter, experience, and professionalism as well.\n  This is a nominee who has had a stellar legal career. She graduated \nwith honors from Baylor Law School and its undergraduate program and \nmade the highest score on the Texas bar exam the year she took it. She \nthen had a highly regarded legal practice with a leading law firm in \nTexas for 17 years. She then gave up her lucrative private sector \npractice to serve with distinction for the past eight years on the \nTexas State Supreme Court.\n  She was elected, in a contested race, as I understand it, and then \nreelected unopposed with over 80 percent of the vote. She still enjoys \noverwhelming community support. She has been publicly endorsed and \nsupported by Democrats and Republicans, including 15 former presidents \nof the Texas Bar Association. Every major newspaper in the state also \nsupports her.\n  Mr. President, there is no question this nominee is qualified by \nexperience, by education, and by the time that she spent in the Texas \nSupreme Court, where she has built up a very fine record of being a \nfair judge who has worked very hard in understanding the issues that \nhave been before her and in casting her votes on the supreme court.\n  Yet, last week, I was shocked to hear her described by Senator \nDaschle as not qualified. These are exact quotes: ``We will confirm \nqualified judges.'' ``Don't send us unqualified people.''\n  Whatever you may be able to say about might be wrong with this \nnominee--because maybe she is too conservative, or maybe on she did not \nmeet some litmus test from the liberal outside interest groups or \nbecause she didn't meet the test of a particular Senator--in no way \ncould you describe this nominee as not being qualified or as being \nunqualified.\n  I am very worried when we see this sort of pattern developing. There \nhave probably been very few nominees in the past to serve on the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals more qualified than this nominee by every \ncategory you might bring to bear.\n  Let me remind my colleagues on this point what the their gold \nstandard ABA's actual standards are. Let me quote what the ABA itself \nsays it looks at when it rates nominees.\n\n       The [ABA] Committee's evaluation criteria for federal \n     judicial nominations is directed solely to professional \n     qualifications: integrity, professional competence and \n     judicial temperament . . .\n       Integrity is self-defining. The nominee's character and \n     general reputation in the legal community are investigated, \n     as are his or her industry and diligence . . .\n       Professional competence encompasses such qualities as \n     intellectual capacity, judgment, writing and analytical \n     ability, knowledge of the law and breadth of professional \n     experience . . .\n       In investigating judicial temperament, the Committee \n     considers the nominee's compassion, decisiveness, open-\n     mindedness, courtesy, patience, freedom from bias and \n     commitment to equal justice under the law . . .\n\n  The ABA itself also notes that its standards are even higher for \nAppellate Court Nominees.\n\n       [T]he Committee believes that appellate court nominees \n     should possess an especially high degree of scholarship and \n     academic talent and an unusual degree of overall excellence.\n\n  Again, Mr. President, when the ABA applied these standards to \nPriscilla Owen they unanimously rated her ``well qualified.''\n\n       To merit a rating of ``Well Qualified'' the nominee must be \n     at the top of the legal profession in his or her legal \n     community, have outstanding legal ability, breadth of \n     experience, the highest reputation for integrity and either \n     have demonstrated, or exhibited the capacity for, judicial \n     temperament.\n\n  So it is a shame to characterize this nominee as somehow being \nprofessionally unqualified and it is a shame that the full Senate was \ndenied an opportunity to vote on her because of a partisan, straight \nparty-line vote of 10-9 with all Democrats voting against her.\n  Again, in my opinion, it reflects very poorly on the Senate, and I \nfear it will make it even more difficult for us to complete our work \nwhen we see these types of allegations leveled against such a fine \nnominee. It also puts even further into question the utility and \nnecessity of bothering to have the ABA evaluate judicial nominations \nwhen the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are going to put ideology \nfirst and a nominee's professional qualifications and ABA rating a far \nsecond.\n  Mr. President, I could not let that partisan and unwarranted vote in \nthe Judiciary Committee go unnoticed by the leader of the Republicans, \nand correct the public record regarding a nominee with such outstanding \nlegal credentials as Judge Owen. She is clearly qualified.\n  I would note in closing that the Washington Post in an editorial \npublished this past July 24 agreed with the President and Republicans \nwhen it said that:\n\n       Justice Owen is indisputably well qualified, having served \n     on a state supreme court for seven years and, prior to her \n     election, having had a well-regarded law practice.\n\n  I hope we will ultimately find a way for this nominee to be confirmed \nbefore all is said and done.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to add to what the distinguished \nRepublican leader has said. I have been in the Senate 18 years. This is \nthe best witness I have ever heard, not just for a judicial nomination \nbut for anything--an absolutely brilliant judge. She would have been \nconfirmed had she been reported to the Senate, even without a positive \nrecommendation.\n  I say to my friend, the leader, I worry about where we are, as well. \nI think we have crossed some kind of threshold here from which it is \ngoing to be very difficult to retreat from in the coming years.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, we are not going \nto always be in the minority, and they may have a President again, as \nregretful as that might be to some of us, and the shoe could be on the \nother foot. Do we really want to establish this kind of standard, that \nwe are prepared to vote down extraordinarily well qualified judges, who \nmay be liberal or conservative, simply because we are of the other \npersuasion?\n  I think it is a low point in the recent history of the Senate. And I \nam not sure where we go from here. But I do not believe I will ever \nview these nominations quite the same way as I did in the past.\n  I can say this: I would like to have a lot of my votes back, going \nback over the last 8 years--Ginsburg, Breyer--scores of nominees for \nthe circuit and district benches who I knew were far to the left of me, \nbut I believed it was the President's prerogative. The Democrats won \nthe election. It was the President's prerogative. And short of some \nkind of egregious failure to meet up to professional standards, it was \nnot my place to impose my view on the nominee.\n  So I think it was a sad day in the history of the Senate. I agree \nwith everything the Republican leader has had to say about this most \nunfortunate episode. I hope the President will not withdraw this \nnomination and will send it up again next year, and hopefully we will \nhave a Senate with a little more of an open mind to this truly \noutstanding nominee.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me just conclude my remarks with this, a \nquote from Senator Biden, a member of the Judiciary Committee for a \nlong time. Unfortunately, he was also recorded last week as voting \nagainst Judge Owen despite her excellent record and the ABA's highest \nrating. But when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am \nconvinced he worked hard at trying to be fair in the way the nominees \nwere considered under the previous President Bush.\n  But while on Judiciary Committee back in 1986 on the issue of \njudicial nominations he was quoted to this effect:\n\n       [Judicial confirmation] is not about pro-life or pro-\n     choice, conservative or liberal. It is not about Democrat or \n     Republican. It is about the intellectual and professional \n     competence to serve as a member of the third co-equal branch \n     of the Government.\n\n  I agree. Priscilla Owen met that criterion. She should have been \nconfirmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8352-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8352-S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n                HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4513\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Warner, \nI send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], for himself and \n     Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 4513.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 8, strike lines 1 through 3.\n       On page 9, strike lines 13 through 15.\n       On page 12, line 15, strike ``, with the Director,''.\n       On page 12, strike lines 18 through 26 and insert the \n     following:\n       (4) To make budget recommendations relating to the \n     Strategy, border and transportation security, infrastructure \n     protection, emergency preparedness and response, science and \n     technology promotion related to homeland security, and \n     Federal support for State and local activities.\n       On page 77, lines 22 and 23, strike ``, the Office,'' after \n     ``OSTP''.\n       On page 103, line 5, strike ``amended--'' and all that \n     follows through line 12 and insert the following: ``amended \n     in section 204(b)(1) (42 U.S.C. 6613(b)(1)), by inserting \n     `homeland security' after `national security,'.''.\n       On page 156, lines 15 and 16, strike ``, the Office,''.\n       On page 158, line 9, strike ``, the Office,''.\n       On page 162, line 11, strike ``and the Director''.\n       On page 162, line 17, strike ``and Office''.\n       On page 173, strike line 15 and all that follows through \n     page 197, line 19.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nstrike title II and title III and make conforming amendments.\n  Title II would create an office in the White House that would \ncoordinate the homeland security activities of the Federal Government. \nTitle III would require the new office and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to jointly produce a national strategy.\n  The administration opposes the creation of an office in the White \nHouse that would have a Senate-confirmed director with specific \nresponsibilities and authorities. The White House believes that such an \noffice would blur the lines of accountability and diffuse \nresponsibility, particularly since the White House already has an \noffice, the Office of Homeland Security, that is responsible for \ncoordinating the Federal Government's homeland security efforts.\n  The committee's proposed structure will also create confusion because \nsimilar functions will be performed by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, the Director of the Office of Homeland Security, and the \nDirector of the Office of Combating Terrorism, which is the National \nSecurity Council. With all these different offices, it will be \nextremely difficult to determine who is responsible. When a homeland \nsecurity issue arises, which official does the Congress hold \naccountable, the Secretary for Homeland Security or the proposed \nDirector of the Office for Combating Terrorism?\n  We should also recognize that statutorily creating an office in the \nWhite House impairs the President's flexibility and authority to \nstructure the Executive Office of the President to best meet his and \nthe Nation's needs. The President traditionally has had broad authority \nto structure the Executive Office as he sees fit. This proposal is an \ninfringement on that authority.\n  There certainly have been times when it has been necessary to create \nan interagency coordinating body in the White House. The creation of \nthe National Security Council is an excellent example of this.\n  However, this proposal goes too far. It gives the proposed office \nspecific responsibilities and authorities that tie the President's \nhands and limit his ability to mold the office to serve the needs of \nthe American public.\n  Another disconcerting aspect of this proposal is that it would \nrequire the director to be Senate confirmed. For the last year, the \nPresident has made it clear that he desires a confidential homeland \nsecurity adviser who would advise him on domestic security issues. He \ndoesn't want or need another Senate-confirmed official who would be \nrequired to testify before a congressional committee. We have such an \nindividual in the new Secretary that has been created. The President \nmust have his own advisers who work for him. I think he is entitled to \nthat.\n  Senator Warner, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, also expressed concern in a letter to the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, where he wrote:\n\n       The structure proposed by the Chairman would be redundant \n     of the structure that is already in place.\n\n  He further said that:\n\n       The budget review and certification authorities would \n     undercut the ability of several cabinet members, including \n     the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the \n     Director for the Central Intelligence, to carry out their \n     responsibilities. In the case of the Secretary of Defense, in \n     particular, the proposal would give the director of this new \n     office the ability to decertify; in essence, to veto the \n     defense budget. It would be unwise to give this authority to \n     an official who does not have to balance the many competing \n     needs of the Department of Defense.\n\n  Finally he said:\n\n       The drafting of a new comprehensive strategy for homeland \n     security is unnecessary. Legislating anything other than a \n     periodic review and update of this strategy would be \n     burdensome and would divert attention and resources away from \n     the administration's focus on homeland security.\n\n  Prior to the President's June 6 decision to support a Department of \nHomeland Security, I spoke in favor of a Senate-confirmed official that \nthe Congress could hold accountable. We now have that with the new \nSecretary, or soon will have with the new Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I see little value in creating this new office when such an office \nalready exists. Simply put, another office in the White House is \nredundant and unnecessary. Moreover, probably more importantly, there \nappears to be several negative consequences, potentially creating \nconfusion as to accountability, as to budget authority, and the \ncreation of a new homeland security strategy.\n  Therefore, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at the request of our colleague, Senator \nLieberman, I will be managing the debate on this particular amendment, \nan amendment for which I feel a strong parental relationship.\n  Shortly after the tragic events of September 11, with Senator \nFeinstein, I introduced legislation to establish such an office of \nterrorism within the White House in order to create a focal point for \ndecisionmaking and informing the President and the Congress of a \nnational strategy on how to combat what clearly was emerging as the \nmajor challenge to America's national security.\n  My good friend, Senator Thompson, has just suggested that events that \nhave occurred since that time, particularly the event of the President \ndeciding, after a long period of consideration, to support a \nstatutorily created Department of Homeland Security, had rendered \nirrelevant or, maybe even worse, redundant the idea of an office to \ncombat terrorism within the Presidency.\n  I disagree with that analysis and look forward to the debate which \nwill lay out the case of why these two agencies--a Department of \nHomeland Security and an office within the Office of the President--\nare, in fact, reinforcing in the same way that, in 1947, Congress found \nit appropriate to reorganize the previously distributed military, \ndistributed by the various services, Army, Navy, a newly emerging Air \nForce, into a single Department of Defense. But at the same time they \ndid that, in fact in the same legislation, they created the Office of \nNational Security Council. They found those two actions to be \nreinforcing, cohesive, and both contributing to the Nation's security.\n  I will attempt to make the case that the same is true for the action \nsuggested in the legislation before us.\n  I strongly support the creation of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the legislation before us today to do so. I wish to \ncommend our colleagues, Senator Lieberman and Senator Thompson, Senator \nLevin, Senator Cochran,\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\nas well as Senator Shelby, who serves with me on the Senate Committee \non Intelligence, for their leadership on this issue and for the wisdom \nwhich they have shown in the development of this specific legislation.\n  The establishment of a Department entrusted with the security of our \nhomeland, in my judgment, is a critical step to making our Nation \nsafer. The vicious terrorists who struck out on September 11 may have \nsucceeded in executing their plot, but they failed in achieving their \nmission.\n  America is sad; America is not afraid. We are alert, not panicked. We \nare firm in our resolve to orient ourselves to protect against future \nattacks; without altering the fundamental aspects of our life, we are \ncommitted to a strategy that will both protect us against our \nvulnerabilities here at home, while we take the war aggressively and \nsuccessfully to our enemies, wherever they might live.\n  The Department of National Homeland Security Act of 2002 makes \nnecessary changes in our governmental structure. It does so in a \nreasoned, careful way, preserving our constitutional liberties while \nincreasing the effectiveness of our security organization.\n  This legislation is consistent with our history where periodically we \nhave reexamined what our national priorities are and how the Federal \nGovernment should be organized to achieve those national priorities. A \nperfect example of this is the agency most affected by this \nlegislation--the U.S. Coast Guard, which will represent about 25 \npercent of all the personnel in the new Department.\n  The Coast Guard began in 1789, the same year that George Washington \nwas sworn in as President of the United States. At that time, it was \nknown as the United States Light House Service, and its primary \nfunction, as its name implies, was seeing that lighthouses were \noperational. The agency eventually merged with four others and assumed \na new role, and that was enforcing our customs laws, collecting \ntariffs. At that point, it was moved into the Department of the \nTreasury. Other than twice during World War I and again during World \nWar II, when the Coast Guard was transferred by Executive order to the \nNavy, it stayed in the Department of the Treasury until 1967, when its \nrole evolved yet again and it became seen as a maritime safety and \nsecurity agency.\n  The Coast Guard was transferred to the newly formed Department of \nTransportation. It has stayed in that Department since 1967. Today, the \nCoast Guard is recognized as a primary component of our Nation's \nhomeland security force. Thus, the recommendation in this legislation \nis that the Coast Guard in toto be transferred to the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I focus my remarks today on that portion of the bill which is the \nsubject of the amendment that has just been offered by Senator \nThompson, the amendment to delete from this legislation title II and \ntitle III, which would establish within the White House a national \noffice for combating terrorism. The need for a coordinator within the \nWhite House has been recognized by a number of blue ribbon commissions \nin the last several years. Here are recommendations from three of the \nmost prominent of those commissions.\n  The Gilmore Commission, chaired by the former Governor of Virginia, \nstated:\n\n       Recommendation No. 2: The next President should establish a \n     National Office for Combating Terrorism in the Executive \n     Office of the President, and should seek a statutory basis \n     for this office.\n\n  The Hart-Rudman Commission, chaired by two of our former colleagues, \nsaid this:\n\n       Strategic planning is largely absent within the United \n     States Government. . . . Across the Government, [a \n     coordinator] should be given a stronger hand in the budget \n     process. . . . Congress should develop mechanisms for a \n     comprehensive review of the President's counterterrorism \n     policy and budget.\n\n  The Bremer Commission, chaired by the distinguished Ambassador \nBremer, stated:\n\n       The President and the Congress should reform the system for \n     reviewing and funding departmental counterterrorism programs \n     to ensure that the activities and programs of various \n     agencies are part of a comprehensive plan.\n\n  In a recently released--in July of this year--Brookings Institution \nreport on the events since September 11, it was stated:\n\n       Whether Congress establishes the broad-ranging department \n     the Bush administration proposes or the more focused \n     Department we advocate, there will remain a need for White \n     House coordination. . . . By the administration's own \n     reckoning, more than 100 U.S. Government agencies are \n     involved in the homeland security effort. . . .\n\n  Continuing, the Brookings Institution report states:\n\n       There is a critical need to coordinate their actions with \n     those of [the Department of Homeland Security] and to develop \n     and implement a government-wide homeland security strategy.\n\n  As I indicated earlier, this concept of an office within the White \nHouse with the responsibility for coordinating efforts to combat \nterrorism was originally embodied in legislation I introduced with \nSenator Feinstein last fall and is based on the lack of any central \ncoordinating figure within our Government with a singular focus on \nterrorism.\n  We believed then--and with the creation of the new department, we \nbelieve now--that it is essential the sometimes-discordant group of \ndepartments and agencies with counterterrorism responsibilities must be \nbrought into harmony.\n  The creation of the Department of National Homeland Security does not \nchange that fact. While this new Department will subsume some of the \nexisting agencies, there will be many others which remain outside the \nauthority of the Secretary of Homeland Security but will still be \nperforming vital missions related to our efforts to combat terrorism.\n  As an example, the intelligence community itself is not going to be \nbrought into the Department of Homeland Security. Clearly, it will play \na very significant role if we are going to anticipate and be able to \nrespond to terrorist attacks before they are launched.\n  The Department of Defense has recently created a new central command \ncalled Northern Command. That command will have increased \nresponsibility for the military's role in protecting the security of \nour homeland. The departments of the Treasury will still be responsible \nfor coordinating economic measures to reduce the opportunities of \nterrorists who finance their activities through U.S. sources or \ninternational sources. The departments of State and the Department of \nEnergy, which has a major role in our nuclear policy and will have a \nmajor role in the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to develop \nnew technologies that will help us better confront terrorism--they will \nall play a role in our national efforts to combat terrorism.\n  The Director of the National Office of Combating Terrorism will have \nthree missions. First, the Director will be able to provide that \ncoordination on counterterrorism for all of the agencies--not only the \nDepartment of Homeland Security but the intelligence community, \nDepartment of Defense, Department of the Treasury, Department of State, \nDepartment of Energy, just to list some of the other agencies that will \nbe most directly involved in homeland security.\n  He will be able to do this with his power to certify budgets, that \nthey are consistent with the comprehensive plan for combating \nterrorism. The model for this is twofold. I mentioned earlier the 1947 \nNational Security Act, created by statute for a National Security \nCouncil and a National Security Adviser to the President.\n  In more recent years, we have created an office of drug policy. That \noffice has been increased in authority over the years as we have seen \nthat greater authority was needed in order to bring the Federal \nGovernment more effectively into a common army to combat the enemy of \ndrug traffickers. That legislation now provides that the head of that \noffice is appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation, \nand has the power to decertify budgets that are not consistent with the \nPresident's antidrug plan.\n  Those two models--the National Security Council and the National \nOffice for Drug Policy--are the models for the office that we are \nproposing to create today.\n  This office and these powers, particularly the power to certify \nbudgets, are what are necessary for the Director to\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\neffectively coordinate the counterterrorism efforts of the important \nagencies that will not be part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The second responsibility of the Director will be to assure that his \nstatus and his effectiveness derives from law, not just the personal \nrelationship with the President. Like the Office of Drug Policy, this \nis an agency that serves not only the interest of the President but \nalso the interest of all of the American people and their \nrepresentatives in the Congress. So it is important there be a level of \nshared responsibility and confidence in the individual who occupies \nthat position.\n  Third, the Director will be subject to the explicit oversight of \nCongress. This is important so that Congress is a full partner; that \nCongress is there at the launch of our comprehensive strategy to combat \nterrorism so that Congress will be there during the good days and the \nbad days, and there will be some of both as we move forward in this \neffort to protect the homeland.\n  Fourth, this Director will have the confidence of both the executive \nbranch and the Congress and will play the critical role of assuring \nthat the agencies most involved in the war on terrorism will make the \nnecessary institutional adjustments to move toward the era of terrorism \nand away from many of the concepts which have dominated us during the \ncold war.\n  One of the concerns I have developed, as our Intelligence Committee \nhas reviewed the events leading up to September 11, is the question of \nwhy was the intelligence community slow to recognize that the world \nchanged in a very fundamental way in terms of its mission with the end \nof the cold war? It was not surprising that the intelligence agencies \nwere very influenced by the history of the cold war because they were a \nproduct of the cold war.\n  The United States had not had an organized intelligence service until \nWorld War II. During the war, a special security agency was established \nto develop and analyze intelligence for a military purpose. As soon as \nthe war ended, so did that agency.\n  Two years later, President Truman recognized that as the Soviet Union \nchanged from being a wartime ally to now an adversary, we needed to \nknow more about the Soviet Union, about its capabilities, about its \nintentions, and in order to do so, we needed to have a permanent and a \nmixed civilian and military set of intelligence agencies.\n  Out of that decision came the 1947 National Security Act and the \ncreation, in addition to the Department of Defense and the National \nSecurity Council, of also the intelligence community more or less as we \nknow it today.\n  The intelligence community grew up dealing with the peculiarities of \nthe Soviet Union. We knew a tremendous amount about the Soviet Union. \nWe probably, without question, had more information about issues of \nwarfare in the Arctic Ocean than any other place in the world, \nincluding the Soviet Union itself because it was very much in our \ninterest to understand that particular water body.\n  As we were acquiring this tremendous depth of knowledge about the \nSoviet Union, we were doing it at the expense of not learning more \nabout much of the rest of the world. Our intelligence agencies became \nfocused narrowly--culturally, and linguistically--particularly on the \nSoviet Union. We were not acquiring competencies in other parts of the \nworld.\n\n  Second, we became very dependent on technology as a means of \ncollecting intelligence. The Soviet Union was a hard place to get spies \ninto and to support and to sustain them once they were there. \nParticularly our satellite-based technologies gave us the means of \nacquiring most of the information we wanted to learn about the Soviet \nUnion without the risk and difficulty of putting human beings into a \nposition to collect that intelligence.\n  Finally, there was a criticism, which is subject to debate, that our \nintelligence communities became risk adverse; that we were reluctant to \nengage in operations that might fail and be embarrassing; it might fail \nand cost lives. All three of these characteristics, real or alleged, \nhave disserved us in the post-cold-war era. Instead of being narrowly \nfocused, we now must be broadly focused. We must understand the \ncultures and languages of countries that did not exist at the time the \ncold war started.\n  We no longer can depend on our technology, although it continues to \nbe a very significant part of our intelligence collection, but if you \nare going to understand the mind of Osama bin Laden, you cannot do so \nby taking a picture or even listening to a conversation. The fact is, \nmodern international terrorists rarely use the kind of communication \nthat we have the greatest capability to intercept. Rather, we must have \nan intelligence capability which is extremely diverse, that understands \nmany cultures, understands many languages, and is able to function in \nalliances with the intelligence services from many other nations.\n  Finally, this is going to be a riskier war than was the cold war. \nWhile the cold war posed the ultimate risk--nuclear annihilation--this \nis going to require human beings operating in very close contact with \nour adversaries and exposing themselves to the risk of that close \nencounter.\n  The reason I use this example of the intelligence community and its \nnecessity, but slowness, to make the conversion from its cold-war \norientation to the orientation of the new era on terrorism is that \nthese same challenges will be faced by the agencies which are now being \ngiven responsibility for homeland security.\n  I can state with virtual certainty of correctness that over the next \n10 to 20 years the nature of our enemy at home, the tactics that are \nused, will be substantially different than those that were used on \nSeptember 11, 2001, and we must have a homeland capability which \nrecognizes those changes and is prepared to adapt to the new \nchallenges, the new threats that it will face.\n  I believe one of the things that was missing in the intelligence \ncommunity was having an office which could be constantly challenging \nthe intelligence leadership: Are you relevant to the challenge we are \nfacing today? Are you looking over the horizon at the kinds of \ncapabilities you will need in the tomorrows in order to prepare against \nthis emerging threat?\n  In my judgment, the most important function of this office to combat \nterrorism will be its role as the constant challenger of all of the \nmain line departments, from the new Department of Homeland Security to \nthe Department of Defense to the Department of Energy, challenging \nthem: Are you relevant to the current face of evil that we are \ncontinuing against?\n  What are you doing to prepare for future emerging threats? What are \nyou doing to identify those threats? What are you doing to recruit and \ntrain and provide professional advancement to your key personnel so \nthey will be personally responsive to the new challenges? Those are \nsome of the issues. Those are some of the challenges. Those are the \nfundamental rationales why the committee, under the leadership of \nSenator Lieberman, included title II and title III in providing for the \nOffice for Combating Terrorism within the Office of the President.\n  These four missions together will assure the Director has both \nauthority and legitimacy, authority with respect to his colleagues who \nlead other Governmental agencies, and legitimacy with respect to the \nimportant role the legislative branch will play in the achievement of \nhis goals.\n  This position, as I indicated earlier, parallels the job being done \ntoday by the Director of the President's National Security Council. It \ndoes for domestic security many of the things that Dr. Condoleezza Rice \ndoes for foreign policy. It also parallels in many ways the emerging \nOffice of Drug Policy and its challenge to have a coherent plan of \naction, and then assure all the Federal agencies that are responsible \nfor that play their appropriate role.\n  We are about very serious business. It is not just business that will \nfade after the sorrow and shock of September 11. It goes further into \nhistory. In my judgment, for our lifetime, as it is today, the issue of \nterrorism will be the single most significant security threat faced by \nthe United States of America. So we must prepare for the long haul, the \nsustained commitment.\n  There has been some criticism that Congress played a role in this \nfailure of the intelligence community and other aspects of our National \nGovernment to\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\nmake the transition from the cold war to prepare for the challenges of \nthe new era of terrorism. Some of those criticisms are no doubt \ndeserved. This is an opportunity for Congress to take action which will \nhelp prepare us to avoid the unstated criticism. I do not want to have \nour predecessors in the Senate ask the question 25 years from now: Why \ndid we create, in the year 2002, agencies that would become the \ndinosaurs of 2022 because they were unable to make the transition as \nthe rapidly evolving but not fully understood threat of terrorism \nconfronted our people?\n  This office, in my judgment, will reduce the likelihood of that \ncriticism because, if this office functions as the architects intend, \nit will be the agency for continuing renewal within all of our \nDepartments which have a responsibility for protecting the American \npeople in our homeland.\n  For those reasons, I respectfully resist the amendment offered by \nSenator Thompson, urge its defeat, and the continuation within this \nlegislation of the important concepts contained in title II of the \nOffice for Combating Terrorism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. NELSON of Nebraska). The Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the well-thought-out \nstatement of my colleague from Florida with regard to his opposition to \nthis amendment. I think the groundwork has been laid now for a good \ndiscussion of the pros and the cons.\n  The points my good friend made are not valid and are certainly not \nsufficient to defeat this amendment. I support this amendment basically \nfor the following reasons, in addition to what I said earlier: It seems \nthe opponents of this amendment--those who would create the new \nnational Office for Combating Terrorism--take the position we need a \ncoordinator to develop a strategy. But since this idea was first \nproposed, lots of things have happened. One is we are now on to the \nconsideration of a large, new Department containing 22 agencies. \nSecondly, we have a strategy. In July, the President came forth with a \nnational strategy.\n  Now we have under consideration a large new Department taking in most \nof the agencies that will have a homeland security function, and we \nhave a strategy that this new Department will be following in trying to \nimplement the safety measures that we all know are needed.\n  In addition, we still have a coordinator. We have someone to \ncoordinate this new Department and those agencies which cannot be \nbrought into the new Department, such as the Department of Defense and \nthe FBI and other agencies. That is the Office of Homeland Security, \nunder the leadership of Mr. Ridge. We also have the Office for \nCombating Terrorism under the NSC. Those offices are already there. We \nhave those two offices in the White House serving a coordination \nfunction.\n  Plus, we will have a new Department with a new Secretary and all of \nhis responsibilities. So we have a strategy.\n  I have not heard criticism that the strategy is not a good one or \nthat we should go in a different direction or that there is some reason \nwe should set up a whole new mechanism and bureaucracy to come up with \na new strategy. So we have those components which the opponents of this \namendment say we need. I agree we need them. We have them. We have them \nin a different way than what our friends on the other side would \nsuggest.\n  It is suggested that the National Security Council is an analogous \nentity or one after which this provision in the Senate bill has been \npatterned. There has been a comparison between the NSC and this \nproposed office, but the National Security Act of 1947 created the \nNational Security Council, and this legislation gave the NSC broad \nresponsibilities and limited authority.\n  The head of the NSC, of course, is not confirmed by the Senate. There \nis no advice and consent with regard to the NSC. There is no Senate-\nconfirmed official. The NSC has no budget authority, which is another \nbig distinction between the NSC and the proposed Director in this bill. \nIt was also designed for the sole purpose of coordinating policy.\n  In contrast, the proposed White House office would have specific \nstatutory responsibilities and functions; would have a Senate-confirmed \nDirector; would have considerable budget review authority; and would, I \nsubmit, interfere with the executive branch's current budget process.\n  I will dwell on that particular aspect of the bill because I think it \nis significant. That has to do with the budget authority. It is \nsubstantial. In title II, section 201, it states the new Director is:\n\n       To coordinate, with the advice of the Secretary, the \n     development of a comprehensive annual budget for the programs \n     and activities under the Strategy, including the budgets of \n     the military departments and agencies within the National \n     Foreign Intelligence Program relating to international \n     terrorism, but excluding military programs, projects or \n     activities relating to force protection.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       To have the lead responsibility for budget recommendations \n     relating to military, intelligence, law enforcement [et \n     cetera]. . . .\n\n       To serve as an advisor to the National Security Council.\n\n  It goes on in section 202 and says with regard to the submittal of \nproposed budgets to the Director:\n\n       The head of each Federal terrorism prevention response \n     agency shall submit to the Director each year the proposed \n     budget of that agency for the fiscal year beginning in that \n     year for programs and activities of that agency. . . .\n\n  The proposed budget of an agency shall be submitted to the Director \nbefore that information is submitted to the Director of the OMB.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       If the Director determines that under paragraph (1) that \n     the proposed budget of an agency for a fiscal year . . . is \n     inadequate, in whole or in part . . . the Director shall \n     submit to the agency . . . a notice and a statement.\n\n  It goes on to state:\n\n       The head of the Federal terrorism prevention response \n     agency that receives a notice [as described] shall \n     incorporate the proposed funding . . . set forth in the \n     statement accompanying the notice in the information \n     submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. . . .\n  So as I read that he pretty much had to do what the Director says \neven though the agency has the primary responsibility for dealing with \nthe problem under their jurisdiction.\n  It goes on under the section having to do with review and \ndecertification, the Director:\n\n       Shall review each budget submitted under paragraph (1);\n       And may decertify the proposed budget.\n\n  So, in effect, this Director has a veto over the budget.\n  National Terrorism Prevention and Response Program budget in general:\n\n       For each year, following the submittal of proposed budgets \n     for the Director under subsection (b), the Director shall, in \n     consultation with the head of each terrorism prevention \n     agency concerned--\n       (A) develop a consolidated proposed budget for each fiscal \n     year for all programs and activities under the Strategy . . .\n\n  And submit it to the President and Congress.\n\n       The head of the Federal terrorism prevention and response \n     agency may not submit to Congress a request for a \n     reprogramming or transfer of any funding specified in the \n     National Terrorism Prevention and Response Program Budget for \n     programs or activities of the agency under the Strategy for \n     a fiscal year in excess of $5,000,000 without the approval \n     of the Director.\n\n  So, obviously, there is substantial budgetary authority--even though \nwe have created a new Secretary with vast responsibilities, including \nthe normal budgetary responsibilities--that the head of this Department \nwould have. We still have the OMB and the regular process. Yet we would \nhave a new Director who may not have the entire view of the Government \nthat OMB has.\n  Certainly it has an important function, an important role to play. \nCertainly it can have some input, but the ability to unilaterally make \nthose kinds of budgetary decisions when we have this process, at a time \nwhen we are creating a new Department and a new Secretary, and to kind \nof take that away from the OMB, which has responsibility for a bigger \npicture, shall we say, I submit is not a good idea and it is \nunnecessary.\n  It is not necessarily accurate to say that more is better when \ncreating this Department. We can make it so large, so huge, there are \nso many moving parts--and we already have more directorates in the \nSenate bill than the President would submit--that it becomes unworkable \nor much more difficult to handle and to manage than is necessary.\n  Also, it takes away from ease of accountability. One of the most \ndifficult\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nthings we have seen in the Governmental Affairs Committee with regard \nto the overall operation of the Government in looking at so many of the \nefficiencies that many of the Departments have and that we fear we may \nbe incorporating into this new Department is lack of accountability, \nwho is in charge. If the administration has it their way--and I submit \non a close call you ought to give an administration, and the President, \nand a new Secretary, a fighting chance to take the approach they want \nto take and then have the accountability of making it work than \notherwise--if we adopted the President's suggestion, we would have the \nOffice of Homeland Security, Mr. Ridge, which he says he will retain \nunder any circumstances. So we have to assume he will.\n  The Office of Combating Terrorism, under the NSC, which we have, and \na new Department with a new Secretary with a big umbrella covering 22 \nagencies, I submit that will be complicated enough. We do not need a \nnew directorate duplicating the budget process, duplicating the \nstrategy process, when we already have one, and doing all those things \nthat the administration is saying we don't want to do, we don't need to \ndo. There has not been any good reason to say that is an incorrect \nposition or that we need it. I don't think anyone has ever recommended \nexactly what we are considering today.\n  The Gilmore Commission suggested a statutory White House position. \nThat is true. But they did not also suggest a new Department. That was \nbefore we had the new Department under consideration, as we have today.\n  Hart-Rudman recommended a new Department, but they did not recommend \na statutory White House position. They recommended a coordinator, as I \nrecall. I think I am accurate in saying that no Commission, no entity, \nanywhere, has ever recommended we have both a statutory, confirmable \nWhite House entity in addition to a new Department with a new Secretary \nwhich would be confirmable.\n  I submit it is a reasonable and prudent thing to prune this huge--\nsome have called it--monstrosity. Maybe I have in times past. It is so \nbig and potentially so unwieldy. I hope it does not turn out to be a \nmonstrosity. I am talking about the new Department with all of the \ndifferent agencies and 170,000 people, coming together and all of that. \nSurely, on something that is clearly as duplicative as this, we can \npare it down a bit, use those offices and people we already have in \nplace in all these key positions, and give the administration the \nability to start this extremely important operation on a level playing \nfield and one with which they feel comfortable. It does nothing for \nhomeland security. It does not do anything to make this Nation safe by \njust adding on new agencies or any offices and new Directors and new \nresponsibilities.\n  Let this entity also do what this other entity is already doing and \nestablish someone else in play with regard to that. That does not do a \nthing to enhance homeland security.\n  I submit that it diminishes homeland security. None of us want to do \nthat. So I submit the amendment is founded on sound principles and \ndeserves serious consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from Tennessee, which would strike \ntitle II and title III, two very important pieces of our legislation; \nthat is, the amendment that was passed out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, not \nonly for his eloquent statement in response to the introduction of the \namendment by Senator Thompson, but for the considerable work he has \ndone on this proposal for almost a year now building on work, as he \nsaid in his statement, that was done by other groups calling for such \nan office. It was bipartisan work, incidentally--including members of \nthe other party here in the Senate. This work greatly influenced the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee as we put together the amendment \nthat we bring before you. So I thank the Senator from Florida for his \nthoughtful leadership on this matter.\n  This is not an amendment that strikes at the margins of our committee \nproposal. This is an amendment that really goes to one of the \nfundamental parts of the amendment that the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee reported out in a bipartisan vote of 12 to 5. Look at the \ntitle of the amendment, the proposed bill: The National Homeland \nSecurity and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002. It clearly is the \nintention of our committee not just to create a Department of Homeland \nSecurity, which is, of course critical, but to combat terrorism. \nTerrorism goes beyond homeland security. It goes beyond the Department \nof Homeland Security. We feel very strongly that it requires the kind \nof strong coordination that the National Office for Combating Terrorism \nwould provide. We wrote these two titles, title II and title III that \nSenator Thompson's amendment would strike, into our bill because while \nthe new Department of Homeland Security would be a critical advance in \nour efforts to combat terrorism by raising our guard, by defending \nourselves, the American people here at home, it is obviously not all \nthat is needed to rise to the challenge that our terrorist enemies have \nput before us.\n  More than half the Members of the Senate were in New York Friday with \nmore than half the Members of the House to meet in an unusual joint \nsession to express our solidarity and respect and admiration to the \npeople of New York, to honor those who were heroes that day, to mourn \nthose who died that day, and to support their survivors. But also, I \nthink, to rededicate ourselves to the war on terrorism so, as much as \nit is humanly possible, we believe that we have done everything we can \nto prevent another September 11 type of attack from occurring.\n  I strongly believe for that to be so we need not only the Department \nof Homeland Security, but the office that this proposal would require \nbecause even after the Department is up and running, there are going to \nbe many agencies and programs with key roles in the war on terrorism \nthat would be outside the purview of the new Department. That is why we \ncreated this national office in the White House.\n  The Director of the office, in my view, and I believe in the view of \nthe majority on the committee, would be the primary architect of an \nantiterrorism multi-agency strategy working, of course, for the \nPresident because the Director is the appointee of the President. That \nstrategy would include a host of components beyond homeland security--\nsome diplomatic, some financial, some military, some intelligence, some \nlaw enforcement. I think Senator Graham has listed the possibilities \nand the realities quite effectively.\n  What we are saying is, what we need to prevent another September 11 \nfrom ever happening again is not just a new department to oversee the \nmost critical aspects of homeland security, but a coordinator, a \ndirector working directly for the President, who has the real power and \npositioning to see the larger picture of the war against terrorism and \nto coordinate it in a very aggressive way for the President.\n  We heard testimony at one of our Governmental Affairs Committee \nhearings--one of 18 we have held since September 11, 2001, from Ashton \nCarter, who was an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Clinton \nadministration. I want to quote from him. Ash said:\n  The announcement of an intention to create a cabinet-level Department \nof Homeland Security should in no way obscure the paramount need for a \nstrong White House hand over all aspects of homeland security . . . The \nnation's capabilities for homeland security, even optimally \ncoordinated, are simply not adequate to cope with 21st century \nterrorism. What is needed is far less a coordinator of what exists than \nan architect of the capabilities we need to build.\n  I want to read from a few others who have both supported the creation \nof a new Department and a strong White House office.\n  In July, the Brookings Institute issued a report called, ``Assessing \nthe Department of Homeland Security.'' They say in that report:\n\n       Whether Congress establishes the broad ranging department \n     the Bush administration proposes or the more focused \n     department we advocate--\n\n  That is the nonpartisan experts on this task force at Brookings--\n\n     there will remain a need for White-House coordination. By the \n     administration's own\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\n     reckoning, more than 100 U.S. government agencies are \n     involved in the homeland security effort . . . There is a \n     critical need to coordinate their actions with those of DHS \n     and to develop and implement a government-wide homeland \n     security strategy.\n       Indeed [Brookings continued] it would be advisable to \n     broaden the scope of the Office of Homeland Security to \n     include overseeing the intersection between the U.S., \n     domestic and overseas counter-terrorism activities. Under \n     this arrangement, the Office of Homeland Security will likely \n     only be able to perform its vital coordinating functions if \n     Congress steps in and provides the homeland security office, \n     council and director status in law.\n\n  Which, parenthetically, I say, is exactly what our proposal would do. \nGoing back to Brookings:\n\n       Moreover, if the Office of Homeland Security and its \n     director are to continue to have a major role in drawing up \n     an integrated homeland security budget--\n\n  As was the case for Governor Ridge for the 2003 fiscal year request--\n\n     it is absolutely critical that the director not only have \n     statutory authority but be accountable and answerable to \n     Congress.\n\n  I will read one more quote of GEN Barry McCaffrey, who testified \nbefore our committee on October 12 of 2001. Of course, General \nMcCaffrey had been the Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy. He talked about the importance of the authority to review and \ncertify budgets if we are going to have and implement a national \nstrategy for combating terrorism. General McCaffrey said:\n\n       A strategy without the resources is not worth the paper it \n     is written on. The director of the Homeland Security Office \n     needs the authority to independently decertify any agency \n     budget that does not provide the resources needed to combat \n     the threat of terrorism.\n\n  He added:\n\n       Not only are budget certification powers required to ensure \n     sufficient resources, they also play a critical role in \n     policy-making. The ability to decertify an agency's budget is \n     the nuclear weapon of policymaking--it isn't something you \n     can use often, but the mere fact that it is in your \n     arsenal guarantees you are taken seriously. If you want to \n     see another agency get with the program fast, just \n     articulate the possible decertification of its budget.\n\n  End of quote from General McCaffrey. It is a very important point. \nThe reality is that President Bush has acknowledged the need for an \nongoing White House coordinating office on homeland security and \nterrorism, saying he would retain the current office he established \nlast October once the new Department is established. That is what the \nThompson amendment seeks to achieve, preserving the status quo with \nrespect to the powers of the Office of Homeland Security.\n  But with all due respect, that would give us less than we need. We \nneed an office that, of course, is accountable to the President, the \nPresident's appointee, but nonetheless can be an advocate within the \ncouncils of our Government to make antiterrorism a priority and, also, \nas General McCaffrey's words suggest, to create an incentive, because \nof the potential use of the power of decertification, for agencies not \nto slip back and underfund our antiterrorism effort, not to allow us to \nfall back into a slumber and make counterterrorism and antiterrorism a \nsecondary or tertiary matter.\n  This office, with the authority our bill gives it, through both \nbudgetary authority and Senate confirmation, will have the power to be \nwhat we all need it to be. The President basically acknowledges the \nutility of continuing the office. The question is, Will it be a strong \noffice or a weak office?\n  I think the very reasons that convinced President Bush, contrary to \nhis original position on this--and, of course, I am grateful for the \nchange he made and I appreciate and admire him for making it--make the \ncase for a strong White House office. He concluded that the original \nOffice of Homeland Security was not enough to do the job that he \nwanted, as President, to have done because it did not have the power to \ndo the job.\n  Also, there are war stories you can hear from inside the councils of \nGovernment about various attempts Governor Ridge made to try to bring \nsome coordination to the disparate agencies involved in homeland \ndefense. For instance, there was a proposal on coordinating the border \nagencies, and it was knocked down from within the agencies themselves.\n  Part of why, probably, those four men to whom Senator Byrd refers \noften, who gathered secretly to put together the administration's \nposition or recommendation on the Department of Homeland Security, did \nso is that I think they--wisely, in this case--did not want to enter \ninto a process preliminarily that would have allowed the bureaucracy to \nfight change, which was what Governor Ridge was facing.\n  So I think the fact that the Governor hit a lot of roadblocks and \nspeed bumps rather than paved stretches of road should convince us that \na Senate-confirmed director of the White House office, exercising \nstatutory powers, would have the clout he or she needs to accomplish \nwhat the President wants him or her to accomplish.\n  Some argue, I know, that once we create the new Department, it will \nnot really matter if the White House position is statutory and Senate \nconfirmed. Certainly, I agree that even without a statutory and Senate-\nconfirmed director of the White House office--which, again, we know \nwill exist, in any case--the new Department of Homeland Security would \nbe a vast improvement over what we have today. But it is still risky.\n\n  It is inadequate to assume that, even with the new Department, we can \nafford to have anything less than the strong antiterrorism coordinating \noffice in the White House that was conceived by Senator Graham and his \ncosponsors and adopted by our committee. As he has said, critical \npieces of the antiterrorism effort cut across the Government and will \nnot and cannot and should not be folded into the new Department even if \nit is well organized. Somebody needs to be looking at the big picture \nwith a comprehensive sense of how every piece and element of the fight \nsupports every other element, and then directly advising the President \nas to how the entire effort can be strategically integrated and \nimplemented.\n  The White House office can be a crucial complement to a line agency. \nIt is not unprecedented for Congress to create such positions within \nthe White House, as Senator Graham has said. Such legislatively created \noffices include the National Security Council; the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, subject to confirmation; the Office of Drug Control \nPolicy, of course, subject to confirmation by the Senate; and the \nDirector of OMB, naturally subject to confirmation by the Senate.\n  The complexity of orchestrating the fight against terrorism makes \nthis mission, which will be central to our security for a good part of \nthe years ahead of us, every bit as worthy of statutory status within \nthe White House as those other missions fighting drugs, expanding and \nproviding for fair trade, and coordinating management and budgeting.\n  The White House office our legislation envisions would not be charged \nwith homeland security per se, I want to make clear. Homeland security \nis the responsibility of the new Department. The White House office's \njob is to orchestrate and advise the President more broadly on the \nfight against terrorism. For instance, central questions that this \noffice would consider, that will not come before the Department of \nHomeland Security or the Secretary, are: Are we doing enough to cut off \nthe money supply of al-Qaida? And where might a new funding stream come \nfrom? Are our public diplomacy efforts, which are run through the State \nDepartment, complementing the other pieces, the military pieces, of the \nwider war against terrorism? How should our trade policies or our \nforeign aid policies be structured to be maximally effective in the \nfight against terrorism? Are there efforts that are duplicative or are \nthere gaps between the various Departments beyond homeland security \nthat need to be addressed? Those are central questions in the war \nagainst terrorism which will not come before or be decided by the \nSecretary of Homeland Security or all the agencies working under him or \nher.\n  A lot of our antiterrorism effort was not well coordinated before \nSeptember 11. That is a sad fact. As we approach the first September 11 \nsince the dark day of September 11, 2001, it is critically important \nthat we make sure our antiterrorism effort has learned all the painful \nlessons of last September 11. It is just unrealistic to think that a \nnew Department alone will achieve that goal. We must still press for \nthe most effective coordination and leadership we can achieve.\n\n[[Page S8358]]\n\n  I must say, we must do that for the longer term. I understand the \nPresident has strong feelings about this, but Congress has a \nresponsibility to legislate for the longer term. As we all have agreed, \nthe battle against terrorism is going to go on for the longer term, not \njust through this administration. And that really argues strongly for a \nstatutory, Senate-confirmed position such as this bill would provide.\n  I want to quote David Walker, the Comptroller General, who made this \npoint when he testified before our committee in April. On that \noccasion, he called for support of a statutory, Senate-confirmed \nofficial to coordinate antiterrorism policy Government-wide. \nComptroller General Walker stated:\n\n       Bottom line, there is a clear correlation that to the \n     extent that there is a significant responsibility that spans \n     administrations and years, that involve significant sums of \n     money, . . . Congress has historically sought to address \n     those with a statutory basis and to head those offices or \n     operations with a Presidential appointee subject to Senate \n     confirmation. History has shown that those lead to . . . more \n     effective and accountable activity.\n  That is a critically important statement. We are legislating here for \nthe long term. David Walker explains why the long-term interests of the \nsecurity of the American people argue for this office as we have \nconceived it.\n  Brookings Institution scholar Paul Light added at one of our \nhearings:\n\n       Congress should establish a statutory foundation for the \n     White House Office of Homeland Security. Such a foundation is \n     essential for the strategy, authority, and, perhaps most \n     importantly, accountability.\n\n  Again, an important office. There is no sense in maintaining this \noffice, as the President wants to do, unless it has an important role. \nIf it has an important role, it ought to be subject to Senate \nconfirmation and, therefore, accountable to the Congress as \nrepresentatives of the people.\n  Title III of the legislation calls for a comprehensive national \nstrategy to combat terrorism to be developed collaboratively by the new \nSecretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the White House \nOffice for Combating Terrorism. The Secretary will have the lead role \nin issues of border security, critical infrastructure protection, \nemergency preparation and response, and integration with State and \nlocal efforts. Those are the elements within the Department. But the \nDirector will have overall responsibility for preparing the strategy \nand will take the lead on strategic planning concerning intelligence \nand military assets, for instance, law enforcement, and diplomacy.\n  The idea is, the Director, working with the Secretary, will ensure \nthe coordination of critical counterterrorism areas of Government \noutside the Secretary's direct control. And the legislation establishes \nan interagency council to be cochaired by the Secretary and Director to \nassist with preparation and implementation of the strategy.\n  It very progressively establishes a nonpartisan nine-member panel of \noutside experts to provide an assessment of the terrorism strategy. \nThis is similar to the national defense panel created in legislation \nthat came out of the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which I am \nprivileged to be a member, that, in 1999, assessed the first Department \nof Defense Quadrennial Defense Review for military planning, and did so \nwith very productive results.\n  In the area of antiterrorism, complacency has to be our constant \nconcern. This panel our legislation creates will help assure an \noutsider-based, so-called red team critique of the strategy on a \nperiodic basis.\n  Under our legislation, this antiterrorism strategy would be updated \non a regular basis. The President's recently completed and released \nhomeland security strategy is a good, constructive beginning, but of \ncourse it does not obviate the need for more detailed and updated \nstrategies in the years to come.\n  I don't know if it is fair to quote a distinguished citizen from \nTennessee when arguing against an amendment offered by the Senators \nfrom Tennessee, but I remember Fred Smith of FedEx said in a speech \nyears ago, speaking to his employees--I paraphrase; I may not have it \nexactly--the journey to higher quality services has no final \ndestination point.\n  That is a good point because the journey goes on and on. We are \nconstantly trying to improve. In that same sense, the need for constant \nreview and revision of our antiterrorism efforts will have no end. We \nhave to keep reviewing and being a step ahead of our enemies.\n  I hope in the years to come and in future administrations, obviously, \nthat terrorism is much less fresh in the minds and hearts and souls of \nthe American people than it is less than a year after September 11. \nWhen it is, we need to ensure that, nonetheless, antiterrorism does not \nfall from the top of our concerns because these enemies of ours will \nstill be out there in the shadows.\n\n  This statutory proposal of ours seems to me to be one of the best \nways we can guarantee steadfast attention to the terrorism threat from \nadministration to administration, from generation to generation, as we \ngo forward in this century. We have never before had to organize and \nimplement both a concerted assault against terrorists and to mount a \ndefense of our people here at home at the same time, following an \nattack of this kind against civilians, innocents, on our territory. It \nis unprecedented.\n  Meeting the challenge means not only consolidating and organizing the \ndozens of agencies responsible for homeland security into a single \nunified chain of command, as we did in the first title of our bill, but \nit also means ensuring that the agencies and offices that remain \noutside the Department do not slip to the fringes of the fight against \nterrorism. That is what is achieved in titles II and III of the bill \nwhich Senator Thompson's amendment would strike.\n  We need every gear of government turning in the right direction, \nsupporting every other as far ahead as we can see, to maximize our \nantiterrorism strategy, to advance the President's vision and policies, \nand to provide, in this painfully new context, for the common defense.\n  Therefore, I strongly oppose the Senator's amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Connecticut \nfor eloquently laying out his case against this amendment. It makes for \na good debate.\n  As I sit and listen and think about what we are about here, it occurs \nto me that never before in the history of this country have we ever set \nup an organizational framework at this level of government. That is a \npretty strong statement. I stand to be corrected if I can be.\n  We are setting up something here that we have never tried before. We \nare experimenting in a way in which we should not be experimenting. Why \ndo I say that? I say that because we have never had a situation in the \nhighest levels of government where we had a department with clearly \ndefined responsibilities for an area of government and a White House \nentity that is Senate confirmed with decertification authority over the \nbudget that pertains to that Secretary.\n  If there is another situation like that in the history of the \nGovernment, I will acknowledge it and stand corrected.\n  Reference has been made to the drug czar. He is Senate confirmed. He \nhas decertification authority. But there wasn't a department such as \nthe one we are in the process of creating. He, by his nature, by the \nnature of his job, had to coordinate legions of different entities and \nagencies and departments' budgets under the framework they had then. \nThere was no one drug department or drug-fighting department other than \nhim. He was it.\n  He had to deal with budgets of the Department of Agriculture, the \nCorporation for National and Community Service, the DC court services \nand offender protection, the Department of Defense, the intelligence \ncommunity management account, the Department of Education, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, the Department of the Interior, the judiciary, the \nDepartment of Justice--I am not listing all the divisions and agencies \nwithin these Departments--the Department of Labor, the OMBCP, the Small \nBusiness Administration, the Department of State, the Department of \nTransportation, and the\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\nDepartment of the Treasury. He was a coordinator in the truest sense of \nthe word--not analogous at all to the situation we have here.\n  Reference has been made again to the NSC. We all know that the NSC \nnot only does not have decertification authority; the NSC has no budget \nauthority. The NSC is not confirmed by the Senate. Reference was made \nsome way to our Trade Representative. He is confirmed by the Senate. He \nis the Trade Representative. I guess you could make some analogy to the \nDepartment of Commerce in terms of there being a Department that \nsomehow has a responsibility in that area, but he is the person there, \nplus the fact that he has no decertification authority with regard to \nthe Department of Commerce or anybody else.\n\n  So, again, I cannot think of another situation where we have had a \nlarge Department that we are getting ready to create, with 22 agencies, \n170,000 people, and all the responsibilities, and we are going to be \nlooking to that new Secretary. Everybody agrees there needs to be a \ncoordinator there. I don't hear any reference to Mr. Ridge not doing a \ngood job or the present circumstance not working out.\n  As the Office of Homeland Security is now constituted, we have a \ncoordinator. But a new Department, a coordinator, who has \ndecertification authority--think about how that would work. It is a \nrecipe for conflict and turmoil within any administration. I don't know \nthat there is a comparable in the history of our Government. It stands \nto reason that there would not be. What we seemingly have done is taken \na lot of good ideas from a lot of people and added them together and \nnot eliminated much of anything.\n  I don't know of any proposal that we do that is truly analogous. \nPerhaps Brookings comes the closest, but they were thinking about a \nmuch narrower Department. They were thinking about a border security \ndepartment more than anything else.\n  So I suggest that we really think this through. More is not \nnecessarily better. Do we really want a new coordinator who apparently \nis going to work down the hall from Mr. Ridge? I don't know if we are \nassuming--the President tells us he deserves to have his own person \nthere. Are we assuming that he is going to back off? Is the new \nperson--new Director--going to work down the hall from Mr. Ridge? Are \nwe going to insist that the President get rid of Mr. Ridge's position \nbecause one is not confirmed and the other one is to be confirmed? It \ncannot be the same person serving both functions. I don't know what we \nare assuming.\n  Do we really want to set up a person there who has decertification of \nthe budget--even over the military, apparently, according to Senator \nWarner, who can speak for himself, and I understand he will--inside the \nWhite House? It is to be submitted to the budget and to him before it \neven goes to OMB, when you have a Secretary there with all of the \nresponsibilities, budgetary and otherwise, that Secretaries normally \nhave? Do we really want to do that? Is that really going to improve the \noperation of Government?\n  Like I say, there have been different ideas at different times, at \ndifferent stages of this process. Many of them are good ideas, but many \nof them came before the President proposed his ideas for a Department \nand before he submitted his national strategy in July. To a great \nextent, unfortunately, what we have done is taken all these proposals \nand kind of added them together and said if a Senate-confirmed new \nSecretary for a Department is good, then a Senate-confirmed new Office \nof Homeland Security would be even better. And if the responsibility of \nthe new Secretary for his budget is a good idea, let's have somebody \nover in the White House who can decertify his budget.\n  As I say, I think it is a recipe for turmoil within any \nadministration. It is a recipe for conflict. I know that is not what is \nintended. As I sit here and think about how this would work, I think \nthat would happen in any administration.\n  I think Mr. McCaffrey used his authority one time to great \nconsternation with regard to everybody, but it would not be anything--\nperhaps he used it wisely, and I assume he did, but it would not be \nanything like a new Secretary with the responsibilities that a new \nSecretary would have, and the responsibility that OMB has.\n  We are going from a budget surplus to a budget deficit. We have no \nidea, in my humble opinion, as to how much this is going to cost us. We \ndon't know how much it is going to cost the private sector and the \nState and local governments. I think it is going to be a lot if we do \nwhat we need to do to protect our infrastructure and the other things \nthat constitute homeland security. It is certainly going to cost the \nFederal Government an awful lot of money.\n  We cannot shut this Nation down. We cannot spend all of our money on \nhomeland security. We cannot have someone--I suggest it would not be \nwise--in the White House who only has responsibility for homeland \nsecurity dictating what the entire Federal budget ought to look like. \nSomebody has to balance those, goodness knows, legitimate and, I would \neven say, primary concerns. But they are not exclusive concerns. We \ndon't have an unlimited amount of money. We are apparently not willing \nto make tradeoffs.\n  We are spending money like there is no war against terrorism. We are \nadding new entitlement programs--the Congress is--as we speak. We have \ndone some and are in the process of doing others. So what are we going \nto do, send somebody up in the White House to say, stop, don't let us \nkill again; is that the idea?\n  I think it has to do more with the will of Congress. We are going to \nhave to do the right thing as a Congress. The Secretary is going to \nhave to make proposals. The President and the head of OMB are going to \nhave to say how much money we have to spend, and then take it to \nCongress and see what we think about it.\n  There will be plenty of ways for Congress to exert its will--properly \nso. We are not going to be cut out and should not be. That is the \nnormal process. Do we really need another entity, which I think would \nbe unprecedented, in the midst of all this confusion and difficulty \nthat we are going through? People talk about maybe we ought to look at \nthis thing in stages. Maybe that is one of the things we ought to look \nat in stages.\n  If it turns out that the strategy does not pan out, it is not \nsatisfactory, that the budgetary situation is not working, it might be \nsomething we can revisit at another time. But with all these \ndifficulties, is this really something we want to interject in the \nmiddle of this very difficult process? I submit to you that it is not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, just to respond to some of the comments of \nmy friend and colleague from Tennessee, it seems to me, as this debate \nhas gone on for the last couple of hours, that we have sort of narrowed \nthe focus. One question is: Does America need--assuming that there will \nbe created an Office for Homeland Security--an office in the Presidency \nfor the specific purpose of coordinating our efforts to combat \nterrorism?\n  I think the Senator from Tennessee just said he agreed--or he thought \nthe President agreed--that some sort of office like that was going to \nbe necessary. Basically, it is the office that Governor Ridge has been \noccupying now for approximately 10 months. So we agree there is a \nsufficient potential disorder, with the number of agencies that are \ngoing to have a role in our efforts to combat terrorism, and that is \nthe specific and sole focus of this office in the White House; that it \njustifies somebody to attempt to bring order out of disorder.\n\n  As I was reviewing the legislation, I found some agencies that, \nfrankly, I had not originally thought were going to be part of the \nfight to combat terrorism which I did not mention in my earlier \nremarks. One of those is the Environmental Protection Agency. One might \nsay: How in the world is the Environmental Protection Agency going to \nbe a part of the effort of homeland security against terrorism?\n  The answer is, if you list our vulnerabilities to terrorists, clearly \none of the most significant of those vulnerabilities is our \ninfrastructure, our basic water systems. If you were a creative \nterrorist and wanted to quickly disrupt America, identifying and \ntargeting your efforts against our\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\nwater supply would be one of the ways that you might consider doing so.\n  Obviously, if that is going to be a vulnerability, then the agency of \nthe Federal Government which has the primary responsibility, \nparticularly for protecting the quality of our water--the Environmental \nProtection Agency--becomes an agency that has a role to play in \ndeterring terrorists from access to that part of America's \ninfrastructure.\n  The list of agencies you can consider today, much less what we might \nbe dealing with 10 or 20 years from now when the imagination of the \nterrorists in our own sense of vulnerabilities have become more mature, \ncould be very numerous. So we agree there is a need for there to be an \nagency in the White House for purposes of focusing on the specific \nissue of terrorism.\n  The second question then becomes: If so, how should that office be \norganized? Should it be called ``a meeting and hope people will come \nand, if they come, that they will cooperate'' type of agency, or should \nthey have some agency with teeth that can sink in, if that is \nnecessary, in order to accomplish the result?\n  We have had some experience with the former type of agency in the \noriginal version of the National Office of Drug Control. That office \nhad relatively little real teeth and, therefore, had little \neffectiveness on chewing on the difficult problems of getting the \nvariety of Federal agencies that have a role in our drug policy to \ncollaborate.\n  We already are aware of some of the difficulties we are going to have \nin the area of homeland security because we are identifying areas in \nwhich various agencies, for reasons of their cultural attitudes or \ntraditions, their isolation, their desire to not share the potential \nglory of success with other agencies, have been insular and the \nAmerican people have paid the price because the agencies that should \nhave known important pieces of information were denied that information \nand, therefore, their ability to be as effective on behalf of the \nAmerican people in giving us security against terrorists was \nfrustrated.\n  We know that this office within the White House has to have enough \npower to be taken seriously. I believe it is the evolution of the \nOffice of Drug Policy that is the most informing recent experience in \nAmerican Government as to what kind of agency this needs to be and that \nwe do not have the luxury of waiting 10 years for it to get there; that \nthis office within the White House needs to have some ability to \noversee and control the budget as it is being developed to assure that \nit is consistent with the strategy for combating terrorism that has \nbeen agreed to and that, in the implementation of budgets, agencies \nwill devote the required funds necessary to carry out that strategy.\n\n  I believe if we are serious about a war on terror--and the American \npeople are very serious about an effective war on terror--they need to \nhave what, in this beginning of the season, we might refer to as a head \ncoach who can oversee all of the assistant coaches who have \nresponsibility for individual components of the team to assure that the \nteam in totality is focused on victory against its opponent.\n  There is the third question, and that is: How do we prepare for the \nfuture? It was said that we do not need title III which calls for the \ndevelopment of a strategic comprehensive plan to combat terrorism \nbecause we already have a plan. It was the plan the President submitted \na few weeks ago.\n  Without commenting about the current plan that the President \nsubmitted, I can tell you--and I do not believe there would be anyone \nhere who would speak to the contrary--but that is not the plan we are \ngoing to have 10 years from now. We are not so lame-headed as to be \nunable to learn from the experience that we are going to have over the \nnext decade and to then incorporate that experience into what we think \nis the effective strategy to protect Americans against terrorism.\n  Unfortunately, there is a tendency to want to revere the status quo \nand to resist change. In my earlier remarks I talked about some of the \nhistory of the American intelligence agencies, going back to their \ninception in 1947 and how they became so committed to fighting the cold \nwar against the one big enemy, the Soviet Union, that when the cold war \nwas over and we suddenly had a much different environment of enemies, \nthat they found it difficult to make the transitions that were \nnecessary to respond to the new set of enemies.\n  The same thing is going to happen in our domestic war to secure \nAmericans here in our homeland, but we have already demonstrated some \nof the slowness to respond.\n  One of my critiques of the current effort at homeland security is \nthat we have tended to focus our efforts on those vulnerabilities that \nhave been attacked. Just think of all the things we have done to change \nthe character of American airports and American commercial airlines, \nwith many more changes still to be fully implemented. Contrast that to \nwhat we have done to substantially increase the security in areas that, \nin my judgment, are equal in their vulnerability and threat to the \npeople of the United States, such as the water systems to which I \nreferred earlier.\n  What have we done to increase the security of our seaports and those \nthousands of containers which enter America every day? In my own \njudgment, they represent one of the greatest threats for a terrorist \nwishing to bring a weapon of mass destruction into the United States.\n  We have almost a genetic tendency to support the status quo and a \ngenetic tendency to respond when we have been hit where we have been \nhit. Hopefully, this agency, at its best, will be an agency that will \nchallenge us to think creatively about what our vulnerabilities might \nbe, and then to assess: Are we taking those steps that are reasonable \nand appropriate to protect us against an attack, against a \nvulnerability that has not yet been exploited?\n  I believe an agency that has that kind of an orientation, mission, \nand responsibility will also then need the authority this legislation \nprovides to see that, in fact, we act against that.\n  It is easy to get Americans energized to deal with commercial airline \nsafety when commercial airliners have been flown into some of the \nsymbols of America's greatness, but it is more difficult to get \nAmericans to respond to dealing with the potential threats at a \nseaport, or a metal container rolling down the highway when we have not \nyet been attacked at that point of vulnerability.\n  This agency will have the opportunity, within the White House, with \nthe power of the Presidency and the power of the Congress, through \nconfirmation, and with the power that this legislation would provide, \nto be that creative watchdog to ensure that we are responding to the \nthreat profile as it changes and that we do not require that we be \nattacked in a particular point of vulnerability before we take steps to \nsecure that vulnerability.\n  So I think those are the basic issues in this debate.\n  Does America need such an office? I believe there is unanimity, yes. \nOnce established, does the office need to have the capability, the \nauthority, and the clout to assure that it can conduct a difficult job? \nI think the answer to that question is yes because it then answers the \nthird question: Are we going to look to this agency to be, yes, a \ncoordinative agency; yes, an agency that will help advise us as to the \nwisest strategy to combat terrorism, but, maybe most importantly, to be \nthe agency that will be responsible for our creative inquiry as to what \nis the nature of the threat today, what is it likely to be tomorrow, \nand how do we prepare to give to the American people what they deserve \nand what they look to us to provide, the most effective security in the \nhomeland of America?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I agree we do have some points of \nagreement. One is the fact that we do need a person in the White House \nin this coordination function. I agree with the second point also that \nwe need a person with some clout. I submit Condoleezza Rice has clout \nand Tom Ridge has clout to do their jobs. Neither is confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may just momentarily desist and \ncontinue to hold the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, throughout this debate--and there really \nhasn't been a lot of debate--there was talk about rushing this bill \nthrough and putting it on the President's desk before the August \nrecess. Then there was kind of a fallback position in which it would be \nrushed through but it would be on the President's desk by 9/11, \nSeptember 11. Neither of these efforts, as they appeared to be \nexplained in the newspaper, was a very wise approach to dealing with \nsuch a very, very difficult, important--and I will use the word \ncomplex, which encompasses difficult as well, but I will add it to the \nsentence--piece of legislation.\n  How many Senators are paying attention to what is being said on this \nvery important legislation? We have on the floor the distinguished \nmanager of the bill, the chairman of the committee which had \njurisdiction over this legislation, and we have the ranking member. \nThese two Senators are here at their posts of duty. How many other \nSenators are there? I see the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, \nMr. Corzine, in the Chair. And here is this middling upstart from West \nVirginia at this desk.\n  So the deadline for completing this legislation by the beginning of \nthe recess came and went, and the deadline of September 11 is going to \ncome and go, but who is paying attention? My thought was that if \nSenators had the August recess, many of them would read this bill. What \nI mean by ``this bill,'' this bill is a House bill which was passed by \nthe House after 2 days of floor debate--imagine that. Two days of floor \ndebate. Why, it would take longer than that to get a sewer permit \napproved by the city council in many towns. And here we are passing a \nbill of this magnitude in 2 days by the other body and great pressure \non this body, now, to act on this mammoth proposition, great pressure \nfrom the President, who is going up and down the country saying: Pass \nmy bill. Pass my bill. Pass my bill. Then there are others from both \nsides who are willing to go along and really want to hurry through this \nlegislation.\n\n  But let me say in all candor that if we do not pass this bill until \nnext year, this country is not going to go undefended at its borders, \nat its ports, at its airports. No. The same people who will be working \nin the agencies within the new Department, when it is created, are \nalready out there right now. They are out there on the borders today. \nThey were out there last night when you and I were sleeping. I take it \nthat you slept a little bit. I got a fair amount of sleep. But they \nwere out there protecting us. They are at the airports. We are not \nsatisfied with the protection we are getting at the airports, but I \ndon't know that this bill is going to improve that.\n  But, in any event, what I am saying is that the very people who are \ngoing to be protecting the ports of entry, protecting the long borders \nto the north and to the south, protecting the seaports and the river \nports, they are out there now. These are experienced people. These are \nthose terrible Federal employees whose rights are about to be swept \naway under the administration's proposal. But under this bill they are \nbeing protected.\n  That is not exactly the point I am making. The point I am trying to \nmake is why the hurry? On the other hand, in looking about this Senate \none would say: Why not? There is no interest in this bill. Senators are \nnot at their desks. Look on that side: One Senator. Look on this side: \nTwo Senators, and one in the Chair. I am not saying that in derogation \nof Senators. They are busy, very busy. Senators are on committees, they \nhave people back home who are No. 1. This is the people's branch. They \nare busy.\n  But how many Senators have read this bill? That is the key. If more \nSenators had read this bill than obviously have read it, I think we \nwould have more Senators on both sides on the floor.\n  The chairman and ranking member have given plenty of attention to \nthis bill. They worked for days. Their staffs worked for days and far \ninto the nights in developing this piece of legislation. So we have \nseveral Senators on both sides of the aisle who have read the bill and \nworked over it and they have far more expertise so far as this bill is \nconcerned than I have.\n  I am not on the committee that has jurisdiction over their \nlegislation; what business do I have here?\n  Well, I have the same business here that every other Senator on both \nsides of the aisle has, and I have been concerned about this \nlegislation. I have read the House bill. I have read the Lieberman \nsubstitute. And I have read them both more than once--twice is more \nthan once, so I read them at least twice, you can say--you can draw \nfrom that statement. But I read this bill. When I say ``this bill,'' I \nam talking about the House bill and the Lieberman substitute. The House \nbill is the underlying bill here--we all know that--and it can be \namended, too.\n  But the Thompson amendment is the amendment before the Senate right \nnow, and it would strike title II and I believe it would strike title \nIII as well; am I right?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is true.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Thompson amendment touches the bill in \nmore than one place. It touches the bill in several places so it is \nopen to a point of order to strike, a point of order against this \namendment because it touches the bill in several places--more than one \nplace, certainly. Also, it certainly is open to division. I am not sure \nat this point in time that I intend to pursue either of these two \ncourses: make a point of order or ask for divisions. I am not sure of \nthat at all.\n\n  I want to proceed right now with my statement. But I want to call \nattention to the fact that neither the Senate, apparently, judging from \nthe attendance on the floor, nor the press is greatly concerned about \nthis bill. Maybe Members and the media are just taking it for granted \nthat this bill will pass, and it is a good bill, and the President \nwants it, and there it is; that is all there is to it. It is going to \npass, so why fool around with it? Let's get on with something else. We \nhave many other issues to occupy our attention.\n  I cannot fathom the reasons, except that I do not believe Senators \nhave read this bill. I just do not believe it. If Senators read this \nbill, I think many more Senators would express concerns about it. \nSeveral Senators have expressed concerns about it. I am very concerned \nabout it. It is a complex bill, and I think we are about to pass \nlegislation here, if we are not very careful, that we will come to rue, \nthat there will be many, many problems in connection with this bill \nthat Senators have not thought through and will look back and say: My, \nhow could that have happened? I didn't know that was in the bill.\n  So, in a way, I can understand Mr. Thompson's desire to strike titles \nII and III of the bill. I can understand that. I am not all together \nhappy with either of those titles. But I think that the Senate will err \nin adopting the amendment by Mr. Thompson.\n  Throughout this debate, such debate as we have had, I have made clear \nmy respect for the efforts of Senator Thompson in his work with \nChairman Lieberman on the homeland security bill. First of all, I think \nthe Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, has a head full of common \nsense. You can find a good bit of that in those Tennessee hills and \nthroughout most of Appalachia. I can say that because I am likewise \nfrom Appalachia. There are several States in Appalachia. But this \nSenator from Tennessee is one of the Senators representing a State in \nAppalachia where the common people, the common folk live. There are a \nlot of them down there, just ordinary people who live on my side of the \ntracks, the side of the tracks where I grew up.\n  I have also made clear my intention to oppose any effort that I \nbelieve jeopardizes the rights and liberties of the American people. I, \ntherefore, must oppose Senator Thompson's amendment because, as I see \nit, it would contribute to the undermining of our constitutional system \nof checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches.\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\n  Now, to begin with, let me say that the administration's proposal \ndoes exactly that in several ways. I will not go into all the ways \ntoday. But if Senators will take the time to read the House bill, which \nreflects, in great measure, the administration's position on homeland \nsecurity, they will find many instances in the House bill reflecting \nthe administration's position which do just that--that get between the \nConstitution and the people, that put the Constitution and the people \noff to one side--and while this piece of legislation goes like a \nsteamroller over that constitutional system of checks and balances, the \nseparation of powers.\n  So the Thompson amendment would strike titles II and III of the \nLieberman substitute. Title II is a title that provides a National \nOffice for Combating Terrorism be established within the Executive \nOffice of the President, presumably to replace the current White House \nOffice of Homeland Security.\n\n  So we already have, in essence, just such an office as the one we are \ntalking about in title II; namely, a National Office for Combating \nTerrorism. There is already one in the White House. There is already \none established within the Executive Office of the President. It has \nnot been established by law, but it has been established by Executive \norder. I do not have much use for Executive orders, whether they are \nissued under a Republican President or a Democratic President. But this \nlegislation would replace, in my judgment, the current White House \nOffice of Homeland Security.\n  In the legislation we are talking about here, in title II of the \nunderlying legislation, such an office would be headed by a Director, \nwho would be subject to Senate confirmation and made accountable to the \nCongress. Get that.\n  We already have such a Director down at the White House now working \nwithin the office of the White House, and that person is Tom Ridge, a \nformer Governor of Pennsylvania. He has been there quite a while. He \nhas been given a great deal of authority by the administration, by this \nPresident. He is an individual who is not subject to Senate \nconfirmation and, therefore, is not made accountable to the Congress.\n  This legislation would make him subject to confirmation and \naccountable to the Congress. Why shouldn't that be the case?\n  Mr. President, the White House Office of Homeland Security was \ncreated to respond to an immediate need for an Executive Office that \nwould oversee our Nation's homeland security efforts. Since its \ncreation, however, it has become clear that that office, which has \ntaken on such an important role in protecting our homeland, was also \ndesigned to be insulated from the American people, to operate from \nwithin the White House without congressional oversight and outside our \nconstitutional system of Government, without, as I say, congressional \noversight.\n  Now, Senator Stevens and I, as all Senators know, tried repeatedly to \nhave Mr. Ridge come before the Senate Appropriations Committee and \ntestify on the budget for homeland security. The Director of the Office \nof Homeland Security has repeatedly refused.\n  I say with respect to Mr. Ridge, he is a former Governor. He is a \nvery able, likable man, who once served in the Congress of the United \nStates. He repeatedly refused to testify before the Congress. The \nadministration arrogantly, in my opinion--arrogantly--maintained that \nhe is accountable to the President only and not to the people's \nRepresentatives.\n  Now, I have some sympathy for the argument that a President ought to \nbe able to have advisers from whom he can receive confidential \nguidance.\n  I am not saying that every Tom, Dick, and Harry, every clerk high and \nlow at the White House, should have to come up and testify before the \nCongress if it invites him or her up to the Hill. I have sympathy for \nthat idea as a concept.\n  But in the Director of Homeland Security, we have something that goes \nfar beyond a mere staff person, far beyond a mere adviser to the \nPresident.\n  The Bush administration designed the Office of Homeland Security to \nbe the Federal Government's point man on homeland security. There is \nthe man. He is the man in whom the President of the United States has \nreposed great confidence and authority. Authority? Well, there was an \nExecutive order.\n  The Office of Homeland Security was intimately involved in crafting \nthe President's proposal to create a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I have said many times, I have almost spoken ad nauseam about \nthe way this idea was initiated in the bowels of the White House and \nbrought to life, much like Aphrodite, who sprang to life from the ocean \nfoam and later appeared before the gods on Mount Olympus, and they all \nwere much taken with Aphrodite; or much like Minerva who sprang from \nthe forehead of Jove, fully armed, fully clothed, fully grown. And here \nit is, Minerva.\n  Well, that is the way this thing kind of came up. It came right out \nof the White House like an ocean foam. There it is, bango. You got it. \nWe have something here that was created, lock, stock, and barrel, from \nan embryo of a tiny imagination. It was not quite the committee that \ncreated the Declaration of Independence, not quite of that caliber, but \nit was a committee of respectable men. There were four of them.\n  It was all done in secret, you know, down there in the subterranean \ncaverns where there was not even a candlelight whose rays might \nilluminate just what was being talked about. But here it came.\n  Do you know why it came? In large measure, I say to my friend, \nSenator Thompson, I think one of the compelling factors in this idea \nthat sprang from the White House foam might have been that legislation, \nthat appropriations bill which was fast approaching and which had in it \nthe language that Senator Stevens and I put in it to require Mr. Ridge \nto be confirmed by the Senate of the United States.\n  That was in the appropriations bill. That appropriations bill passed \nthe Senate in the seventies for it. Nobody took on provision. Nobody \nattacked that provision when it was before the Senate. Nobody tried to \nstrike it. But there was a provision in that appropriations bill that \nsaid the Director of Homeland Security should be confirmed by the \nSenate of the United States.\n  Well, the administration saw that coming. They saw it coming like a \ntrain down the track. And it passed the Senate. Nobody raised any \nquestions about it. It was headed for conference. And it went to \nconference.\n  So the administration, I think, thought: Wait a minute here. We had \nbetter get on board. Let's not get on board. Let's get ahead of that \ntrain. That is a fast train coming down the track. Let's get ahead of \nit. And so here came this thing out of the dungeon, out of the dark \nbowels of the Earth, beneath the White House.\n  So the administration had to do something fast to get ahead of this \ntrain so that the administration could claim, of course, credit for it. \nSo here they came with this big idea of having a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I am not sure they would have done that had Ted Stevens and I \nand the other members of the Appropriations Committee not included that \nprovision in our appropriations bill which passed the Senate with \nnobody raising a finger against that provision. The administration saw \nthat train coming.\n\n  The Office of Homeland Security was intimately involved in crafting \nthe President's proposal to create a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Its Director has represented our Nation in forging \ninternational agreements related to our homeland security. You see, \nGovernor Ridge could go to Mexico, he could go to Canada, but he \ncouldn't come here before the Senate Appropriations Committee. ``No. \nNo. No, don't throw me into that briar patch.'' He didn't want to come \nhere. I think probably it was the President who didn't want him to come \nhere.\n  Further, the President has vested in the Director of Homeland \nSecurity budgetary powers that led our colleague, Senator Specter, to \nsay in testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee in April:\n\n       Some have compared Governor Ridge's position to that of Dr. \n     Condoleezza Rice, the National Security Adviser. However, \n     Governor Ridge's authority over such a large piece of the \n     budget clearly distinguishes his position from that of the \n     National Security Adviser. When an adviser such as Governor \n     Ridge has significant responsibility for budgetary matters, \n     he should be subject to congressional oversight.\n\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\n\n  That was Senator Specter. He went on to say:\n\n       We need to ``codify'' Governor Ridge's position.\n\n  The Office of Homeland Security is perhaps the clearest example of \nthe administration's contempt, utter contempt, for Congress, a contempt \nthat drives the White House to operate in a cloud of secrecy, beyond \nthe boundaries of our constitutional system of government.\n  I recall--I am sure my distinguished friend from Tennessee recalls \nbecause he was here, as I was, and he was right in the middle of the \nnews of that day and time--the Nixon administration attempting to \ncreate an entire executive system to bypass Congress. It has been \ncalled a ``personalized presidency.'' It has been called an \n``administrative presidency.'' But whatever we call it, President Nixon \nwanted an administration in which the Federal Government would be run \nout of the White House, while the executive departments, those agencies \nand offices that are subjected to the oversight of Congress--I am \ntalking about the people's branch--were, for all practical purposes, \nstripped of policymaking powers.\n  I do remember that period quite well. I was the Senate Democratic \nwhip at the time. Senator Thompson must remember that period, too. He \nwas minority counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Presidential \nCampaign Activities--in other words, the Watergate committee. He did a \nvery competent job because he is a very competent man and a very \nknowledgeable person, as I said, and has a lot of the sense of the \nAmerican people who read this thing and who are far ahead of any of us \nmost of the time.\n  I remember not only the Watergate scandal, but I also remember the \natmosphere and the culture that created it. As President Nixon's \ncounsel, John Dean, later pointed out, Watergate was ``an inevitable \noutgrowth of a climate'' that had developed over the previous years of \nthe administration.\n  Foreign and military policy at the time was being run not by the \nState Department so much or the Defense Department but largely out of \nthe White House by the National Security Council, with National \nSecurity Adviser Henry Kissinger in command. There existed at the White \nHouse a layer of Government between the President and his Cabinet \ndepartments, with their congressionally confirmed Cabinet secretaries.\n  To run domestic policy, the Nixon administration created a White \nHouse Domestic Council, which was patterned after Kissinger's version \nof the National Security Council. According to former Nixon \nadministration official Richard Nathan, in his book, ``The Plot That \nFailed: Nixon and the Administrative Presidency,'' Nixon's intent was \n``to achieve policy aims through administrative action as opposed to \nlegislative change.'' I repeat, ``through administration action as \nopposed to legislative change''--by the White House rather than the \nCongress, where the people have their say.\n  I recall the Nixon administration's defiance of Congress and the \nconstitutional process. This included Nixon administration officials \nrefusing to appear before Congress. It included the Nixon \nadministration's efforts to ``stonewall'' Congress by denying \ninformation to congressional committees. It included the Nixon \nadministration's efforts to belittle Congress and its constitutional \nresponsibilities. It included the impoundment of funds appropriated by \nCongress by Mr. Nixon.\n  ``Quite clearly,'' I wrote in my own history of the Senate, \n``President Nixon set out to circumvent Congress.''\n  ``Had Nixon succeeded,'' wrote Arthur Schlesinger, ``he would have \neffectively ended Congress as a serious partner in the Constitutional \norder''--a stunning thought that, through such brazen power grabs by \nthe administration, in fact, one man could so dramatically shift the \nbalance of power that safeguards the people's liberties. It should \nworry us all. It should worry us, as the people's elected \nrepresentatives. It should worry the media, as the fourth estate that \nis to enlighten the people--our people. It should worry us all just how \neasily that shift can be accomplished.\n  Cloaked in secrecy and shrouded in arrogance, the Nixon \nadministration became one in which the President and his aides believed \nthat they operated outside the constitutional process and beyond \ncongressional oversight. ``Even before Watergate,'' wrote Nathan, \n``Nixon's management strategy was criticized as dictatorial, illegal \nand impolite.''\n  My point is that Watergate didn't just happen. Years of Executive \nsecrecy and arrogance and contempt for Congress created it. As John \nDean said, it was an ``inevitable outgrowth.''\n  When I think of these preconditions that led to Watergate, I keep \nthinking--I cannot help but think of the current administration. I am \nconcerned--no, let me say I am not just concerned, I am alarmed that in \nthis administration we are witnessing another Nixonian approach to \nGovernment; that is, holding the Congress at bay, saying to \ncongressional committees, no, this man won't come; he is not coming up \nthere--holding the Congress at bay using Senate-confirmed department \nand agency heads, while the real policy decisions are being made by \nadvisers to the President behind the protected walls of the White \nHouse. That is where the real decisions are being made.\n  The Assistant to the President for National Security, Condoleezza \nRice, plays a major role in crafting foreign policy for the Bush \nadministration. That position, however, unlike that of Secretary of \nState, is not subject to Senate confirmation. While the Secretary of \nState testifies regularly before the Congress and is accountable for \nthe Bush administration's foreign policy, the President's National \nSecurity Adviser operates secretly, inside the White House, and is \nlargely unaccountable to the American public.\n  The same can be said for the Assistant to the President for Economic \nPolicy, Larry Lindsey. The President's economic adviser is not subject \nto Senate confirmation and, while he crafts economic policy for the \nadministration, he is not accountable for that policy to the Congress. \nThe Treasury Secretary, who is confirmed by the Senate, has to justify \nhis decisions and actions to Congress and to the public. The \nPresident's economic adviser, however, has no such obligation.\n\n  These are policymakers inside the White House who operate outside the \nconstitutional system of checks and balances.\n  With the creation of this new Department of Homeland Security, my \nconcern--indeed, what should be the concern of every Member of this \nbody--is that the Department and its Secretary will be used as decoys \nto divert the attention of the American public away from the White \nHouse's Office of Homeland Security and its Director, Tom Ridge.\n  I speak with great respect for Tom Ridge, who happens to be the \nperson in that position at this point. It could be ``Jack in the \nBeanstalk,'' or John, or Henry, or Robert--whatever. The White House \nhas tried to shield that office. I know. Ted Stevens knows that. I know \nthe White House has tried to shield that office from the Congress and \nthe American public ever since its creation last year. Oh, they are \nwilling to come up, yes. I heard from Tom Ridge. He was willing to come \nup and brief the members of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Well, now, that is a way of getting around what the people desire. \nThe people deserve something better. The people deserve to see these \nhearings. The Appropriations Committee has been created now since 1867. \nSo for these 135 years, since its creation, that is the way it has been \ndone. I know the other body apparently settled for that kind of thing \nbut not our side; we are not going to settle for that. We will do it \nthe way it has always been done--out there within public view, with the \nrecord being written, questions being asked, and the American people \nwatching.\n  The American people want answers to these questions, not just members \nof the Appropriations Committee. So it is the way it has been done for \n135 years, and as long as I am chairman, that is the way it is going to \nbe done. We are not going to settle for merely briefings. We can get \nthat from lots of people.\n  But title II of the Lieberman bill seeks to make the actions of a \nHomeland Security Office inside the White House more accessible and \nmore accountable to the public. What we must strive to avoid is a White \nHouse Homeland Security Office--be it the Ridge\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\noffice or John Doe's office or the one envisioned by the Lieberman \nsubstitute--that would act as a puppet-master for Homeland Security, \npulling the strings of the new Department and its Secretary from behind \na curtain of secrecy.\n  That is why it is so important that the White House office, whatever \nits form, whoever its Director may be, be held accountable to the \nCongress and the American people. The head of that office must be a \nconfirmable position, no matter what the President--any President--may \nsay. After all, we hear that this battle, this war on terrorism, is \ngoing to go on for a long time. So I take ``a long time'' to mean \nbeyond this year, beyond next year, beyond the next election, beyond \nthe next 2 years. And who knows, we may have a different President in 2 \nyears; we may have a Democratic President.\n  Will I feel any differently? No, not one whit. No. The head of that \noffice must be a confirmable position. If the war is going on for a \nlong time, that position is going to be there a long time. That office \nwill be there a long time, and it should be a confirmable position.\n  If there is a Democratic President in office 2 years from now--and \nwho knows. I do not know if I will be around or not. Only the Good Lord \nknows that. But whether I am around or not, that position, under a \nDemocratic President or under a Republican President, should be \nconfirmed by the United States Senate. He should be accountable to the \nAmerican people, the people out there who are looking through those \nelectronic lenses right up there, right now. He should be accountable \nto them.\n  Mr. President, the men who drafted our Constitution carefully laid \nout a system of government that has worked remarkably well for more \nthan two centuries. It began in 1789. The First Congress in 1789 was \nprobably the most important Congress of any of the 107 Congresses we \nhave had. There was no Congress before it to tackle those problems. \nThat Congress took on great problems, and the Senate especially is to \nbe credited with the formulation of the Judiciary Act, creating the \njudiciary.\n  There we are, 1789. What would those signers of that Constitution \nthink about the way we are running our Government today? Would they say \nto Robert Byrd: Senator Byrd, you should take your seat; there is no \nreason for that person to be confirmed; he should not be confirmed; we \nshould accept at face value whatever President is in office, whether he \nis a Democrat or Republican. They would say: We did not have any \npolitical parties in our time, but you have them. You ought to just sit \ndown and not worry. Leave it all to the President. If he is a \nDemocratic President, leave it all to him. If he is a Republican \nPresident, leave it all to him. Leave it up to him. Trust him. Don't \nrequire that person to be confirmed.\n  How many Senators would believe those men who signed that \nConstitution of the United States would say that? They would turn over \nin their graves, as we hear an expression often in our part of the \nwoods. They would turn over in their graves to even contemplate such a \nthing.\n  A major reason our Government has been so successful is that our \nFounding Fathers were wise and cautious people who had no naive \nexpectations about human behavior. They understood human behavior. It \nhas never changed. It is just like it was when Adam and Eve were in the \ngarden, just as it was when Cain slew Abel. It does not change. That is \nwhy we have Saddam Hussein because human nature has not changed.\n  Everybody loves power, and sometimes we get intoxicated with the \npower we have. That intoxication feeds on intoxication and power feeds \non power. I would much rather believe that the American people were in \nthe mix. I should think any President would want that to be the way: I \nhave nothing to hide; let the American people see it.\n\n  James Madison, the Father of our Constitution, had a shrewd view of \nhuman nature. He knew that those who achieved power too often tried to \namass more power or, in other ways, misuse their power. ``If men were \nangels,'' he observed in Federalist 51, ``no government would be \nnecessary.''\n  According to Madison, history showed that those in power often \noverreach; they want more. It is like that song: Give me more, more, \nmore of your kisses. They want more, more, more power.\n  According to Madison, history showed that those in power often \noverreach and, as a result, power too often can become located in a \nsingle person or a single branch of government, either of which is \ndangerous to liberty. That is what we are talking about, the liberty of \nthe American people. We are not talking about the prerogatives of the \nSenate per se. They are prerogatives of the Senate by the Constitution, \nbut it goes deeper than that.\n  We are talking about the people's liberties. ``The accumulation of \nall powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands,'' \nwrote Madison, ``may justly be pronounced the very definition of \ntyranny.''\n  This very point was emphasized by none other than the Vice President \nof the United States, Richard Cheney, when as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, during a hearing by the Iran-Contra committee, he, \nRichard Cheney, lectured Oliver North saying, and I quote the now-Vice \nPresident:\n\n       There is a long tradition in the Presidency of presidents \n     and their staffs, becoming frustrated with the bureaucratic \n     organizations they are required to deal with, to increasingly \n     pull difficult positions or problems into the White House to \n     be managed because there is oftentimes no sense of urgency at \n     State or at Defense or any of the other departments that have \n     to be worked with. . . . [P]roblems . . . that automatically \n     lead presidents sooner or later to move in the direction of \n     deciding that the only way to get anything done, to cut \n     through the red tape, to be able to move aggressively, is to \n     have it done, in effect, inside the boundary of the White \n     House.\n\n  That was now-Vice President Cheney back then.\n  Is that what is going on now? I remember the concerns and issues \nraised by Members on the other side of the aisle when the Clinton \nadministration's health care task force was forming its policies in \nsecrecy. One Republican Senator, who is here today--not on the floor \nright at this time--denounced the Clinton administration for \noperating--and I quote the Senator--a ``shadow government, without \naccountability to the American people.''\n  That Senator went on to say that:\n\n       All Americans should know what their Government is doing \n     and how it is spending public funds. That is just the way we \n     ought to do things in a democracy.''\n\n  While I do not agree this is a democracy--Senators know we do not \npledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States and to the democracy \nfor which it stands. This is a republic. But that is neither here nor \nthere.\n  This Senator said that is just the way we ought to do things in a \ndemocracy. Well, I think that Senator was right. He was a Republican \nSenator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  Another Republican Senator at that time, Senator Simpson, charged:\n\n       The secrecy on the ongoing negotiations within the confines \n     of the White House is a major concern of mine. . . . Health \n     care is too important an issue to the American public to \n     deliberate behind secretive walls of the White House.\n\n  Well, Senator Simpson was right, too. I do not dispute those \ncomments, but I do ask this: If health care is too important an issue \nto the American public to deliberate behind the secretive walls of the \nWhite House, then what about the challenges of protecting our Nation in \nthis frightful new age of terrorism, and what of a White House that \nseeks broad new authorities without respect to the harm they may do to \nthe people's liberties or to our system of government? What about an \nofficer who has his hand in intelligence, health care, law enforcement, \ncommerce, environmental protection, transportation, agriculture, all \nmatters that fall under the broad rubric of homeland security? What of \na White House officer who would be granted never-before-seen \nauthorities to involve the U.S. military?\n  Now get this, Mr. President, as you sit up there in that chair \npresiding over this august body. It is probably not very difficult to \npreside over when there are only three Senators in the Chamber. What of \na White House officer who would be granted never-before-seen \nauthorities to involve the U.S. military in any domestic matter that \ncan be labeled ``homeland security''? What about that?\n  Let me read that again. What of a White House officer who would be\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\ngranted never-before-seen authorities to involve the U.S. military in \nany domestic matter that can be labeled ``homeland security''?\n  That is enough to choke on, is it not? Give me a glass of water. My \ngosh, that is enough to choke on. That is more than a bone. We will \nfind that more than a bone in one's throat.\n  The White House is clearly seeking new and expanded roles for the \nmilitary within our own borders. It has articulated as much in the \nhomeland security plan the President released last July.\n  The White House aims to provide broad authorities to the military as \npart of its national antiterrorism homeland security plan. That should \ngive us all pause.\n  I am certainly not to be equated in any sense with George Washington, \nbut I think of George Washington who said, I have grown old and gray in \nmy country's service; now I am growing blind. So in that sense I am a \nbit like George Washington.\n  Now, when we are talking about the military, I am reading from the \nnational strategy for homeland security. This is what it says, in \npart--these are major Federal initiatives. I will just pick out this \none. It jumps out at me.\n\n       Review authority for military assistance in domestic \n     security. Federal law prohibits military personnel from \n     enforcing the law within the United States except as \n     expressly authorized by the Constitution . . .\n\n  Oh, that word. How many of us have heard that word on television \nrecently, the word ``constitution''? Let me read that again.\n\n       Federal law prohibits military personnel from enforcing the \n     law within the United States except as expressly authorized \n     by the Constitution or an act of Congress. The threat of \n     catastrophic terrorism requires a thorough review of the \n     laws permitting the military to act within the United \n     States in order to determine whether domestic preparedness \n     and response efforts would benefit from greater \n     involvement of military personnel and, if so, how.\n\n  All right, Senators, see if you can swallow that one. Apparently, \nthere is some thinking going on in certain circles, because this says \nso, that the threat--I will read this portion again:\n\n       The threat of catastrophic terrorism requires a thorough \n     review of the laws permitting the military to act within the \n     United States in order to determine whether domestic \n     preparedness and response efforts would benefit from greater \n     involvement of military personnel and, if so, how.\n\n  I say to Senators, beware.\n  The Lieberman substitute includes language requiring the Director of \nthe new National Office for Combating Terrorism, in consultation with \nthe new Homeland Security Secretary, to develop a national strategy \nthat would include ``plans for integrating the capabilities and assets \nof the United States military into all aspects of the Strategy.''\n  Let me read that to Senators. I read from the substitute by Mr. \nLieberman. I read title III, section 301, the section entitled \n``development,'' which says:\n\n       The Secretary and the Director shall develop the National \n     Strategy for Combating Terrorism and Homeland Security \n     Response.\n\n  Then it goes on and tells the responsibilities of the Secretary, and \namong those responsibilities I go down to the word ``contents,'' and \nthen I go down to the fourth paragraph which reads as follows:\n\n       Plans for integrating the capabilities and assets of the \n     United States military into all aspects of the Strategy.\n\n  Title III of the Lieberman bill talks about the Strategy. And so the \nDirector and the Secretary together will develop the National Strategy \nfor Combating Terrorism and Homeland Security Response. That is being \ndone now in the White House by the Director, Tom Ridge, I would say \nundoubtedly.\n  Senator Lieberman is trying to put--I have a little dog. I used to \nhave a dog named Billy. I have a little dog now whose name is Trouble. \nMy wife named him Trouble. She may have been looking at me when she \nnamed the dog. We put a little collar on that dog, and then I have a \nnice little chain that goes into the collar. That little dog might go \nastray if we did not have that collar on that sweet little dog. She has \nmy wife and I around her two front paws. So when I take her out for a \nwalk, she then would not run out on the street and get run over by a \ncar.\n  Senator Lieberman is seeking to put a collar on this office. He is \nseeking to put a chain on it, and for good reason. So Lieberman's \nsubstitute includes language requiring the Director--this is the chain \nin the collar--requiring the Director of the new national Office for \nCombating Terrorism, in consultation with the Homeland Security \nSecretary, to develop a national strategy that would include plans for \nintegrating the capabilities and assets of the U.S. military and to all \naspects of the strategy. The White House Homeland Security Director, \nMr. Ridge, is under similar orders from the President. But at least, as \nI say, under the Lieberman plan, the Government official responsible \nfor developing plans to mobilize U.S. troops within our own borders, if \nit comes to that, would be held accountable--and I hope it does not \ncome to that--to the American public and the Congress. That is a \ncritical difference.\n  Certainly the American people should feel uncomfortable with the \nthought of government officials, hidden away inside of the White House, \ndrawing up plans on how to insert the military into the homeland \nsecurity efforts of our communities. Ours is a nation in which the \nstreets of our small towns and large cities are patrolled by civil \nforces, not tanks and black hawk helicopters. Our policemen are \naccountable to locally elected leaders, not four-star generals in \ndistant command centers. Our citizens are tried in courts of law, not \nsecret military tribunals. We may, in an abstract sense, recognize the \ndanger of a growing involvement of the military in civil affairs, but \nwe do not seem to recognize that the wall between civil and military \ngovernment may be eroding as we speak. It is imperative, therefore, to \nensure that any White House officer who would be granted such broad \npowers--as, say, Mr. Ridge would be--to insert the military into ``all \naspects'' of the homeland security strategy should also be made \naccountable to the people's representatives.\n  I recognize the value of an Executive Office to coordinate homeland \nsecurity efforts across the Federal Government. But there is also a \nneed to ensure that any office with such long arms, so able to reach \ninto the affairs of so many agencies, and with powers so sweeping that \nit can trim the liberties of the American people is, ultimately secured \nunder the control of the people. Title II of the Lieberman bill \nattempts to respond to that need.\n  The mere fact that White House advisors have quietly accumulated \nbroad powers in the past is certainly no reason to allow a White House \noffice with influence of this magnitude and without congressional \noversight to go forward.\n  We stand today in the swirl of unanswered questions about this \nadministration's intent with regard to an unprovoked, preemptive attack \nagainst the sovereign nation of Iraq, the reasons for which have not \nyet been explained to Congress or the American people. Perhaps the \nWhite House has the answers to the questions that people are asking \nabout why we may soon send our sons and daughters to fight, and perhaps \ndie, in the sands of the Middle East, but thus far, we have encountered \nonly a wall of secrecy at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue--a wall \nbuilt on the pillars of Executive privilege.\n  On the issue of homeland security, however, the lives at risk are not \nonly of those who have chosen to serve our country in uniform. Homeland \nsecurity is about protecting the lives of innocent civilians--men and \nwomen, children and grandparents--from terrorist attacks. The current \nadministration is quite evidently eager to avail itself of every past \nprecedent and every current day opening to hide its affairs from the \npublic eye. If anything, we, the people's representatives, should be \nalarmed.\n  If I were Paul Revere and had the lungs, brass lungs, if I could \nspeak as thunder from the cloud in a storm, I would insist that any \nsuch powerful White House Homeland Security Office not be allowed to \noperate outside the reach of the American people.\n  So I urge the Senate to refuse to be a party to erecting such a \ndangerous wall of secrecy between the people and their government. I \nurge the Senate to refuse to be a party to erecting such a dangerous \nwall of secrecy between the American people and the American \nGovernment, their Government. I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nThompson amendment.\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, here we are. We are talking--I am not sure we are \ndebating it, but we are talking--about this massive piece of \nlegislation that would constitute the greatest reorganization of the \nAmerican Government since 1789--not since the Department of Defense was \ncreated, not since the National Security Act, but I think the greatest \nreorganization of Government and, it is certainly arguable, since 1787, \nwhen our constitutional forebears met in Philadelphia to create a new \nConstitution, a new Government under a new Constitution, while those \nmen at Philadelphia were serving under the Constitution that then \nguided them, and that then obtained the Constitution under the Articles \nof Federation. That was the first Constitution, that was the first \nAmerican Constitution. There were State constitutions, State \nconstitutions in 13 States before that time. They reconstituted this \nGovernment. Not all of the delegates from the 13 States attended; Rhode \nIsland did not think too much of the idea. But under that Constitution, \nand the new Constitution, the support and ratification by nine States \nwould constitute enough, a sufficient number to adopt this new \nConstitution and create a new order of--a new order of the ages. \n``Novus ordo seclorum,'' a new order of the ages. There it is, up there \non the wall. They created it.\n\n  ``Annuit coeptis.'' He has favored our undertakings. God.\n  So they set forth a new order for the ages. They created anew, they \nreorganized this Government. That was the greatest reorganization ever. \nAnd there was the reorganization of the military that we have already \ntalked about. And now we come along with this reorganization. But this \nis a far-reaching reorganization and this is a new Department.\n  Senators will remember the first three Departments were the \nDepartment of State or foreign affairs, the Department of War, and the \nDepartment of the Treasury. And the first committees, the real \ncommittees of the Congress, were created in 1816--the permanent \ncommittees. And the Appropriations Committee, as I say, was created in \n1867. But here we are. We are creating a new Department of Government.\n  I have been here when several new Departments have been created. This \nwill not be my first one, but this is the one which gives me greatest \npause, the creation of this Department.\n  I will not proceed to make a point of order against this amendment at \nthis time. I am not the manager of this bill. I am not even on the \ncommittee that created it. But I still have the rights of any Senator, \nso I can make a point of order. But out of courtesy to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee and the distinguished ranking \nmember, who certainly has listened to me and my concerns--and Ted \nStevens and his concerns, our concerns with respect to the power of the \npurse--they have listened and they have given great consideration to \nour concerns in those regards--I will not make the point of order, as I \nindicated was available to me and I could have made, but I am not going \nto do that out of respect for them. They are managers of the bill, not \nI. But I must say I am very concerned, extremely concerned about this \nwhole matter.\n  I think the language that has been brought to the floor by Mr. \nLieberman and Mr. Thompson is--I wouldn't say light years ahead, but it \nis certainly way ahead of the House bill. I only hope Senators will \nread the House bill so that they can see the legislation that pretty \naccurately reflects the administration's position with respect to this \nnew Department. I am telling you, it will make your hair curl if you \npay close attention to that language.\n  I have some problems with this substitute, I have to say. But I will \nhave opportunities as time goes on. I have an amendment which I will \noffer. I have more amendments than one, but I do have one I am going to \noffer within the next few days.\n  I hope, may I say to the chairman and ranking member, that other \nSenators will come to the floor and discuss this amendment. I hope they \nwill come to the floor and discuss this amendment. I hope they will \nread in the Record tomorrow morning what was said today and that they, \ntoo, will come to the floor. The people will profit by vigorous debate.\n  I thank both Senators for their courtesies to me. I have great \nrespect for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for a characteristically learned statement, and also for \nthe passion with which he has delivered it. He always informs this \nSenator and illuminates and informs the debate generally. I am very \ngrateful to him.\n  I share his wish that Senators will come to the floor and debate this \namendment. This amendment really does, as I indicated earlier today, go \nto one of the pillars of the bill. It is not just a bill to create a \nDepartment of Homeland Security. It is a bill to create a Department of \nHomeland Security and Combat Terrorism. The strength and structure and \nauthority and accountability of this White House office really will \ndetermine, in my view, how effectively we will be able to combat \nterrorism.\n  Senators were here for a vote earlier today. As the Senator from West \nVirginia said, I know and respect the difficult schedules of Senators, \nbut this is a very important amendment and I hope more Senators will \ncome to the floor tomorrow. I believe it is the intention of the \nleadership to move to a vote on this amendment sometime tomorrow \nafternoon. There are many amendments filed by other Senators. This is \nthe beginning of the second week on which we have been on this bill, \nthough last week was a shortened week because of Labor Day at the \nbeginning and our joint meeting in New York at the end.\n  This bill deserves the involvement for which the Senator from West \nVirginia has called. I thank him for it. I echo it. We are going to \nkeep moving forward.\n  I thank Senator Thompson for putting forward a very consequential \namendment which deserves the attention of all Members of the Senate.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from West Virginia has said. There is a \npoint of order that is appropriate here. He reserves the right, of \ncourse, to make that point, as others of us do, and I would like to \ncounsel with him on this tomorrow as we go forward and also to engage \nthe Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, who was a major contributor and \ndrafter of this particular part of the amendment we have put before the \nSenate.\n  The bottom line is I want to thank the Senator for West Virginia for \nhis commitment, his understanding of how significant this piece of \nlegislation is, and the extent to which he has devoted his valuable \ntime to studying the various proposals and then his valuable time to \npreparing the learned statements--I go back to that adjective--learned \nstatements that he has already made in the 3 or 4 days we have been on \nthe bill, on different parts of the bill. He sets a standard for the \nrest of us. I must say even when, as occasionally happens, I do not \nagree with him, I always benefit from his involvement and appreciate \nvery much his extraordinary public service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on June 6 of this year, President Bush \nproposed the establishment of a Department of Homeland Security and, \narguably, the most fundamental reorganization of the United States \nGovernment since the passage of the National Security Act of 1947.\n  This proposal by our President is the logical culmination of a very \ndeliberate process that started when then-Governor George W. Bush \nestablished homeland security as his highest priority during a speech \nat the Citadel in September 1999, when he stated, ``Once a strategic \nafterthought defense has become an urgent duty.''\n  While I support the overall intent of the legislation and strongly \nagree with the need to better organize our Government to protect our \nhomeland, I do not support all provisions of this bill as drafted. Two \nsuch provisions are addressed by the pending Thompson amendment--which \nI support--which would strike titles II, and III of the underlying \nlegislation.\n  Title II mandates the establishment of a National Office for \nCombating Terrorism and title III mandates the development of a \nnational strategy for terrorism and homeland security response. I would \nlike to note that the\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\nadministration is strongly opposed to both of these titles.\n  On October 8, 2001, following the tragic events of September 11, \nPresident Bush formed the Office of Homeland Security in the Executive \nOffice of the White House to oversee immediate homeland security \nconcerns and to propose long-term solutions. Governor Ridge and others \nhave worked hard under the President's guidance to produce a \ncomprehensive plan that now deserves our serious consideration and \nsupport.\n  To now mandate the establishment of a national Office for Combating \nTerrorism within the Executive Office of the President would be \nredundant to the structure currently in place, particularly since the \nPresident has already stated his intention to retain the position of \nAssistant to the President for Homeland Security.\n  Additionally, I have serious concerns about the budget review and \ncertification authority provided by this legislation to the proposed \nDirector of the National Office for Combating Terrorism. In my view, \nsuch authorities would undercut the ability of several Cabinet-level \nofficials, including the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, \nthe Attorney General and the Director of Central Intelligence, as well \nas the new Secretary of Homeland Security, to carry out their primary \nresponsibilities.\n  In the case of the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense \nhas wide-ranging responsibilities to protect vital U.S. interests and \nto prevent threats from reaching our shores. The Department, under the \nleadership of Secretary Rumsfeld, is currently engaged in an all-out \nglobal war against terrorism--designed to bring to justice those \nresponsible for the September 11 attacks on our Nation and to deter \nwould-be terrorists and those who harbor them from further attacks.\n  The Secretary of Defense must ensure that the Department is \nadequately and properly funded to carry out its many missions. It would \nbe unwise to subject portions of the budget carefully prepared by the \nSecretary of Defense to a ``decertification''--in essence, a veto--by \nan official who does not have to balance the many competing needs of \nthe Department of Defense and the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  Title III of the pending legislation requires the development of a \nnational strategy for combating terrorism and the homeland security \nresponse. When the President established the Office of Homeland \nSecurity, he directed Governor Ridge to develop a comprehensive \nstrategy to protect the United States from terrorist attacks.\n  In July of this year, President Bush unveiled his Homeland Security \nStrategy, precluding the need for Title III of the pending legislation. \nLegislating anything other than a periodic review and update of this \nstrategy in conjunction with normal updates of our overall national \nsecurity strategy would be burdensome and would divert attention and \nresources away from the administration's focus on homeland defense and \nthe global war on terrorism.\n  As the President stated in releasing the homeland security strategy \non July 16, ``The U.S. Government has no more important mission than \nprotecting the homeland from future terrorist attacks.'' We in the \nCongress should do all we can to help our President achieve this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Thompson amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8367-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

PAUL SCHNEIDER\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I would like to recognize the professional \ndedication, vision, and public service of Mr. Paul Schneider, who is \nleaving his position as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the \nNavy for Research, Development and Acquisition. It is an honor for me \nto recognize the many outstanding achievements he has provided to the \nAssistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and \nAcquisition, the Navy, and our great Nation.\n  Mr. Schneider has spent almost four decades ensuring our Nation and \nits naval forces are equipped with the technological supremacy to \nensure victory over America's enemies. As our Nation enters the 21st \ncentury and faces new and unsettling changes, the leadership and \ntechnological achievements Mr. Schneider has nurtured will continue to \nensure our strength and freedom.\n  Mr. Schneider began his public service career over 37 years ago at \nthe Portsmouth Naval Shipyard as a project engineer to the Submarine \nPropulsion and Auxiliary Machinery Branch and Waterfront Design Liaison \nOffice. Throughout the 1970s Mr. Schneider was a key member of the \nNavy's Trident submarine program, where he provided leadership, \nexpertise, and vision in design, engineering, program management, and \nadvanced technology development.\n  The Navy, recognizing Mr. Schneider's leadership and engineering \nexpertise, brought him to the Naval Sea Systems Command in 1981 to be a \nDeputy Director in the Engineering Directorate where he was responsible \nfor design and engineering of ship and submarine mechanical and \nelectrical support systems and auxiliary machinery. In his next \nassignment, Mr. Schneider became executive director of the Amphibious, \nAuxiliary, Mine and Sealift Ships Directorate.\n  Throughout the 1990s, Mr. Schneider continued to be one of the Navy's \nleading engineers, becoming Executive Director of the Surface Ship \nDirectorate. In October 1994, he became Executive Director and Senior \nCivilian of the Naval Sea Systems Command where he led efforts to \nrevamp the Navy business process by adopting commercial cost processes \nand practices in the acquisition of major systems. He also implemented \ntraining and education programs to retool the Navy's acquisition \nworkforce for the 21st century. In 1998, Mr. Schneider became Principal \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and \nAcquisition.\n  Mr. Schneider has earned numerous awards, including the Department of \nDefense Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Department of the \nNavy Distinguished and Superior Civilian Service Awards, and \nPresidential Distinguished and Meritorious Executive Rank Awards.\n  I could go on and on about the many significant contributions made by \nPaul Schneider throughout his long and distinguished career. There are \nalmost too many to recount. Despite his many professional, technical, \nand engineering achievements, perhaps his most noteworthy trait is his \ngenuine concern for those around him. He regards as his family the \nentire community of military personnel, civilian employees, \ncontractors, and industry who faithfully serve the Navy throughout the \nworld. His memberships in the American Society of Naval Engineers, \nSociety of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, Association of \nScientists and Engineers, Navy League and the Naval Institute attest to \nhis dedication to be a friend, counselor, and mentor to many hundreds \nof junior personnel who have had the pleasure to serve under him during \nhis tenure.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today as I wish Mr. Paul Schneider all \nthe best in his future as he continues his successful career as Senior \nAcquisition Executive for the National Security Agency. On behalf of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Paul and his loving wife \nLeslie fair winds and following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8367-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8367-S8368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ALAN BEAVEN\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to honor \nthe heroism of Alan Beaven--a Californian aboard Flight 93 who helped \nprevent the terrorists from crashing another airplane into its intended \ntarget on September 11, 2001.\n  As we approach the one-year anniversary of that horrible day, our \nthoughts turn to the heroes like Alan who gave their lives to save \nothers.\n  To honor the courageous passengers of Flight 93, I joined Senator \nSpecter to co-sponsor the ``Flight 93 National Memorial Act,'' which I \nbelieve the Senate will pass today to establish a\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\nmemorial at the crash site in Pennsylvania. This legislation will also \nestablish a Flight 93 Advisory Commission to recommend planning, \ndesign, construction, and long-term management of the memorial.\n  I believe it is important to pass this legislation before the \nanniversary of September 11 to appropriately recognize the heroism of \nAlan Beaven and the other Flight 93 passengers.\n  I would like to take a few moments to tell the world about Alan and \nhis family.\n  Alan Beaven wasn't supposed to be on Flight 93 that tragic day. On \nMonday, September 10, Alan and his wife Kimberly were in New York \nplanning for a year long sabbatical in India to work for a humanitarian \nfoundation. Alan was a top environmental lawyer in San Francisco who \nplanned to volunteer his services in India.\n  Alan was headed east, not west, but there was one last case involving \npollution in the American River near Sacramento and settlement talks \nhad broken down that Monday. Alan had to head back.\n  Tuesday morning Alan drove to Newark, New Jersey to catch a flight to \nthe West Coast. Flight 93 was 40 minutes late that day--giving \npassengers onboard time to learn about the planes that had crashed into \nthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon. A few called home on cell \nphones to express their love and say that a group of passengers were \ndetermined to fight back against the hijackers--Alan Beaven was one of \nthose brave men.\n  No one knows for sure what happened aboard that airplane, but we do \nknow countless lives were saved when that plane was diverted from its \nintended target.\n  Even though Alan's seat was in the back of the airplane, his remains \nwere found in the cockpit at the crash site in Pennsylvania. The Beaven \nfamily has also heard Alan on the cockpit voice recorder, so it is \nclear that Alan, standing 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighing over 200 \npounds, fought with the hijackers.\n  I will enter two letters I have received from the Beaven family into \nthe Record. Alan's wife, Kimberly, and his son, Chris, wrote to me \nabout what they heard on the cockpit voice recorder in April when the \nfamilies of the passengers of Flight 93 were allowed to listen to the \nstruggle aboard the aircraft.\n  My heart goes out to Alan's wife, Kimberly, and his three children \nJohn, Chris, and Sonali. John earned a biology degree at UC San Diego \nwhere he was captain of the baseball team and an Olympic torch bearer \nwhen the torch went through Sacramento on its way to Salt Lake City \nthis past winter. John's brother Chris attends Loyola Marymount \nUniversity and sister Sonali is 5-years-old.\n  Alan's great joy was his family. He spent hours reading to Sonali, \nscuba diving with Chris, and playing catch with John.\n  In fact, John's early memories of his father were of the two of them \nplaying catch for hours on end. When John was 5, the family moved from \nLondon to New York and before they could drop off their luggage, young \nJohn made Alan play catch in Central Park.\n  In a tribute to Alan, the Beaven family decided not to have a \nfuneral, but instead a ``Thanksgiving for the life of Alan Anthony \nBeaven.''\n  And what a life it was.\n  Alan was born in New Zealand on October 15, 1952. He worked as an \nattorney in New Zealand, England, New York, and California. As a top \nenvironmental lawyer, Alan worked on over 100 clean water cases in just \n10 years in California.\n  Friends and family of Alan say they are not surprised that Alan \nrisked his own life so selflessly to save others.\n  The day after the terrorist attacks on our nation, Alan's secretary \nwent into his office and found a single piece of paper tacked up at eye \nlevel on the wall in front of his desk. It was a quote he heard that \nweek which summed up how he lived his life, and how he ended it when he \njoined others to fight back against the terrorists. Alan wrote, ``Fear, \nwho cares?'' And these words adequately describe his actions aboard \nFlight 93.\n  I did not know Alan Beaven, but this quote tells me all I need to \nknow about him--that he was a fearless, loving, and devoted man.\n  One year later, it is clear that our Nation has lost a superstar \nenvironmental lawyer, a loving father and husband, and a true hero--\nAlan Beaven.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the two letters to which I referred \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   August 9, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: My father, Alan Beaven, was among \n     those 33 passengers of United Airlines Flight 93. Their \n     hurried steps toward the cockpit were the first in an \n     international campaign against the threat of fanatical \n     hostility. For this they should be celebrated.\n       My dad played a central role in the deposing of his \n     flight's assailants. Not only did he cooperate in an \n     organized effort but he commanded it as well. for this effort \n     he should be particularly acknowledged.\n       The cockpit recorder (C.V.R.) substantiates my claim of his \n     exceptional heroism. At a private listening in Princeton, New \n     Jersey I twice heard his accented words. His final phrase, \n     ``Turn up!'' was shouted at 10:02:17.3 on the official C.V.R \n     transcript. Given the range of sensitivity of the cockpit \n     microphones and my father's seating placement in the rear of \n     the plane I reasonably believe that these findings indicate \n     my dad's extraordinary actions.\n       Secondly, my father's remains were recovered in the front \n     of the aircraft. Authorities confirmed that D.N.A. testing \n     placed him in the cockpit at the time of impact. Again, given \n     his seating placement, this evidence undoubtedly proves his \n     centrality in the effort to regain custody of United's Flight \n     93.\n       Though my father did not place a telephone call in his \n     final hour, other such correspondences indicate his \n     exceptional involvement. Reports were made of great men well \n     above the height of six feet leading the passengers toward \n     the captured cockpit. My dad, 6'3\" and 215 lbs., was one of \n     few men who met this description.\n       Finally, the assumption of his extraordinary bravery in \n     death is founded on the thematic valiance of his life. \n     Whether in his professional or personal activities he met \n     opposition with strength and spirit. It is understood by all \n     who knew him that he continued this trend in passing.\n       In conclusion, I concede that assumptions based on the \n     thematic valiance of his life do not warrant superlative \n     public recognition. However, his stature and his physical \n     placement at impact beg it. Finally, the cockpit voice \n     recording demands it. I ask you to do all in your power to \n     issue due credit to my father. He led a group that led a \n     nation that led an international campaign against the threat \n     of fanatical hostility. My father is a hero.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chris Beaven.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   August 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On April 18, 2002 in Princeton, NJ, \n     I heard the voice of my husband, Alan Beaven, on the cockpit \n     voice recorder of United Airlines Flight 93 that crashed in \n     Shanksville, Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001.\n       I know without a doubt that I heard Alan's voice shout \n     ``Turn up!'' at the time on the tape's clock of 10:02:17.3. \n     My stepson, Chris Beaven, who was listening to the VCR at the \n     same time, independently made note of the exact same words \n     and time.\n       There are at least two other occasions that I am very \n     confident that Alan's voice was recorded. These additional \n     times were of shouting and ``aargh'' noises, familiar to us \n     as Alan often ``wrestled'' playfully with his sons. The \n     distinct sounds were very similar. The times I noted for \n     these sounds were 9:38:36.3 and 9:40:17.7.\n       As you know, Alan's physical remains were found in the \n     cockpit area of the plane. Alan was a 6 foot 3 inch, 205 lb \n     powerful man. A brilliant litigator who made his life's work \n     fighting for justice. I, and all who knew Alan, know he was \n     an active participant that fateful day.\n       Please ensure that Alan Beaven and all the passengers of \n     Flight 93 are duly honored for their heroic actions in \n     preventing the terrorists from destroying their intended \n     target in Washington, D.C.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Mrs. Kimberly Beaven.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8368-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8368-S8369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       JOHN E. COLLINGWOOD OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the service \nof my good friend John E. Collingwood, upon his retirement as the \nAssistant Director for the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs \nfor the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Collingwood will retire \nafter 27 years of exemplary service as a Special Agent of the FBI. As \nMr. Collingwood enters the private sector, he leaves behind an \nirreplaceable legacy of dedication, integrity, and success.\n\n[[Page S8369]]\n\n  John Collingwood was raised in Findlay, OH, and graduated from \nBowling Green University in Ohio in 1970. Mr. Collingwood then worked \nin the family business and went on to graduate from the University of \nToledo Law School in 1975. Upon graduation, he began his career with \nthe FBI as a Special Agent in Detroit, MI.\n  During the following three decades, John Collingwood served the FBI \nin many capacities. After attending the Defense Language Institute in \nCalifornia, he became a Special Agent in Portland, OR. His first \nposition at FBI Headquarters was in the Legal Research Unit of the \nLegal Counsel Division. He then became the Unit Chief of the Civil \nLitigation Program. In 1992, Mr. Collingwood was named to head the \nOffice of Public and Congressional Affairs and became the Assistant \nDirector in 1997.\n  During the past three decades, Mr. Collingwood has made countless \ncontributions to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He can take pride \nin all of his accomplishments during his tenure. Mr. Collingwood is to \nbe commended for working diligently to keep Congress informed about \nissues related to the FBI. Under his leadership, the Office of Public \nand Congressional Affairs assumed responsibilities of the Freedom of \nInformation and Privacy Act and implemented initiatives to increase the \nFBI's responsiveness to the public. I would also like to congratulate \nhim for his continuing efforts to help reshape the structure of the FBI \nas our Nation deals with the tragedies of September 11,\n  The positive impact Mr. Collingwood has made on the FBI and our great \nNation runs deep, and I applaud him for his leadership. During the past \nthree decades, he has worked tirelessly to make positive changes within \nthe agency.

Madam President, I want to express my relief that the \nlong standoff with the Russian Government over American poultry exports \nhas finally been resolved. On March 1, 2002, the Russian Government \ninstituted a ban on American poultry imports and cited safety concerns \nabout U.S. processing procedures. Although the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture responded to those concerns point-by-point, the ban \ncontinued until August 23.\n  Russia is the largest market for U.S. chickens, with annual sales of \nabout one million tons valued at $600 million. This trade dispute had \ncost Georgia poultry producers, the most productive in the country, \napproximately $100 million a year.\n  After many efforts to resolve this embargo, American poultry \nproducers may resume selling chickens in Russia. I had joined with many \nof my colleagues on multiple occasions in contacting members of the \nadministration about this unfair trade practice. For example, I \ncosigned a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Zoellick with 16 other \nSenators on March 4. Soon after, on March 14, I personally wrote to the \nPresident on behalf of Georgia poultry producers. On March 22, I \ncosigned a letter to the President with nine of my Senate colleagues. \nOn May 9, I personally wrote Trade Representative Zoellick on behalf of \nGeorgia's poultry producers. Again, on May 17, I cosigned a letter to \nthe President with 51 of my Senate colleagues. Finally, on July 2, I \ncosigned a letter to the President with 30 other Senators about the \nserious economic damage that the Russian trade block was having on the \nAmerican economy.\n  I believe that the continued focus by members of Congress, as well as \nthe diligence of the administration, helped bring about the successful \nresolution of this ban. At a time of economic uncertainty, the poultry \nproducers of my State will certainly appreciate the reopening of this \nimportant market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8369-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Two gay men, Treve Broudy, 33, and Edward \nLett, 22, were brutally beaten while walking home after dinner. As the \nvictims were walking, a car pulled up beside them. The two assailants, \none of whom wielded a bat, jumped out of the car and attacked the \nvictims. Mr. Lett received minor injuries, but Mr. Broudy was \ncritically wounded, having been kicked and punched and struck violently \nin the back of the head with the baseball bat.

I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8369-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8369-S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STOPPING THE LITIGATION LOTTERY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, the only level one trauma center in Las \nVegas shuts its doors. Twelve orthopedic surgeons at facilities near \nPhiladelphia resign their practice. Two-thirds of doctors in a small \nMississippi city consider leaving for Louisiana. What is forcing our \nmedical community to take such drastic measures? The ``litigation \nlottery,'' trial lawyers filing too many lawsuits with the hope of \nwinning excessive awards.\n  Medical malpractice litigation, when an injured patient sues a doctor \nover a medical error, has exploded in the United States. Between 1995 \nand 2000, the average amount a jury awards a patient rose more than 70 \npercent to $3.5 million per claim. And more than half of awards now \nexceed $1 million. Trial lawyers, who are fueling this surge by hand-\npicking patients whom they believe will win large awards, typically \ntake 30 to 40 percent of the proceeds.\n  Doctors purchase insurance to protect themselves from malpractice \nlawsuits, but excessive awards have pushed the cost of insurance to \nunaffordable levels. In 2001, insurance premiums rose 30 percent or \nmore in some States. And for doctors who perform high-risk procedures \nor practice where trial lawyers have won excessive awards, premiums \nhave risen by as much as 300 percent per year. Many doctors can no \nlonger afford to do the jobs they love.\n  But even more disturbing to doctors, because we swear a sacred and \nancient oath to do no harm, is the impact of excessive awards on \npatient care. High insurance premiums are forcing doctors to move their \npractices to other States, adjust how they practice medicine, or quit \npracticing medicine altogether. Trial lawyers may be winning the \nlitigation lottery, but patients are suffering a health care crisis.\n  First, excessive malpractice awards hurt access to health care. When \na trauma center closes or specialists resign from a hospital or rural \ndoctors can't deliver babies, patients must travel longer distances to \nget the care they need. They must also select from a smaller pool of \nphysicians. When minutes, and a doctor's experience, can mean the \ndifference between life and death, access to health care matters.\n  Second, excessive malpractice awards increase the cost of health \ncare. Many doctors are forced to practice defensive medicine. They must \norder more tests, write more prescriptions, and refer more patients to \nspecialists to protect themselves against lawsuits. A recent Federal \nreport found evidence that reasonable limits on malpractice awards \nwould reduce health care costs by as much as 5 to 9 percent per year.\n\n[[Page S8370]]\n\n  Third, excessive malpractice awards are the single largest barrier to \nimproving patient safety in our country. Doctors and hospitals want \ndesperately to improve patient safety by sharing, analyzing, and \nlearning from medical errors. I have proposed a bill that would let \nthem do that without the fear of being sued for trying to improve \npatient care. But even the most limited restrictions on lawsuits are \nunacceptable to some of my Democrat colleagues. They believe trial \nlawyers should have open access to any medical error reporting system, \nwhich would render such a system useless because few doctors or \nhospitals would participate.\n  We can turn back this growing health care crisis by reforming medical \nmalpractice litigation. Some States have already taken the responsible \nstep of capping awards for noneconomic damages, which are highly \nsubjective, intangible and the major source of mischief for trial \nlawyers. Rightfully, these States have also preserved awards for \neconomic damages, such as lost wages and medical costs.\n  But most States have done nothing or not enough to fix the problem. \nThe American Medical Association lists 12 States that are now in a \nhealth care crisis because of excessive malpractice awards. And 30 more \nStates are nearing crisis, including Tennessee. This is a national \nproblem that will worsen without a national solution.\n  Just prior to the August recess, the Senate debated medical \nmalpractice litigation reform that would have capped trial lawyers' \nfees. Though I support bolder action that includes limiting awards for \nnoneconomic damages, this bill would have been a good first step. It \nwould have allowed injured patients to keep a greater share of their \nrightful compensation while reducing the incentive for trial lawyers to \npursue excessive awards. Unfortunately, all of my Democrat colleagues \nvoted against this patient-friendly bill, keeping the litigation \nlottery alive and well.\n  Injured patients have the right to sue for medical malpractice, but \ntrial lawyers do not have the right to force innocent doctors from \ntheir livelihoods and throw our health care system into crisis. With \nmillions of uninsured families, increasing health care costs, too many \ndeaths from medical errors, and no prescription drug benefit for \nseniors, the Senate must show its commitment to turning back the \ngrowing health care crisis in our country. Limiting excessive \nmalpractice awards is one solution that concerned public servants, \nproviders, and, most importantly, patients can and should support.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to discuss an issue that \naffects a broad coalition of health care providers and the Medicare \nbeneficiaries they serve. I have become increasingly concerned that the \ncurrent method for updating Medicare payments to physicians and other \nhealth care providers does not accurately reflect the costs associated \nwith delivering high-quality patient care. Reimbursement levels for \nproviders participating the Medicare Program this year will decline by \n5.4 percent. There is little to suggest that the cost of providing care \nhas declined. In fact, costs to various providers have actually \nincreased over the past year.\n  These payment reductions could have strong repercussions on access to \nessential health services. A flawed payment update system potentially \njeopardizes access to medically necessary services for millions of \nseniors and disabled Americans who rely on Medicare for their health \ncare. In addition, a flawed payment system makes practicing medicine, \nparticularly in underserved areas, all the more difficult, if not \nimpossible for providers participating in the Medicare Program.\n  Reductions in Medicare physician reimbursement forced Ronald Johnson, \nM.D., an Illinois physician, to borrow money to keep his practice \noperating. All told, the loan necessary to sustain his practice for an \nadditional year was equivalent to two-thirds the value of his family \nfarm.\n  I share the view of many health care analysts, including MedPAC, that \nthe methodology used to update physicians payments is flawed. Although \nthis system was designed to accurately compensate providers for the \ncare they provide while controlling overall program spending on \nphysician and other providers services, it has become apparent that the \ncurrent system struggles to meet each of these goals. The volatility of \nphysician payments is also a persistent problem for those providers \nattempting to gauge expected revenue from one year to the next.\n  Until 1989, Medicare physician payments were based on a reasonable \ncharge payment system. This system was thought to be responsible for \nescalating program costs, and the Medicare physician fee schedule was \nadopted in response to these concerns.\n  The current method for updating Medicare physician payments is unique \nbecause the annual increase or decrease in physician payments does not \nsimply reflect changes in the cost of medical goods and services. \nUnlike other payment systems, an expenditure target for physician \nservices, know, as the sustainable growth rate, (SGR), is calculated \neach year. Annual payment updates for physician services, that reflect \nthe changes in the costs of medical goods and services, are then \nincreased or reduced to meet targeted expenditures for the program. In \nother words, physician payment updates only reflect actual changes in \nthe cost of medical goods and services when actual costs equal the \ntarget growth rate in physician payments.\n  Setting target expenditures, or the SGR, for physician payments that \ndo not depart from the actual costs associated with delivering patient \ncare has proven difficult. Methods for calculating the SGR have \ncontributed to this divergence. The SGR is calculated using estimated \nchanges in spending due to fee increases, changes in Medicare fee-for-\nservice enrollent, gross domestic product GDP per capita and the cost \nof new laws and regulations. Moreover, many of the factors that \nstrongly influence the overall cost of services are difficult to \nmeasure including patient preference, technological advances, and \nchanging demographics.\n  In particular, the inclusion of the GDP in SGR calculations is \nproblematic. Economic downturn may lead to sharp reductions in GDP that \nare far more dramatic than changes in Medicare beneficiary need. This \nvolatility can have devastating effects on the program and threaten \nbeneficiary access to critical health care services. At a time when \nbeneficiary need is growing due to an aging U.S. population, providing \nphysicians and other health care professionals with adequate \nreimbursement levels is an the more important.\n  Also, erroneous CMS enrollment and spending data collected in \nprevious years has exacerbated and already difficult financial \nsituation. Although the necessary corrections were made, the changes \nhave a disproportionately negative financial impact over the coming \nyear.\n  Efforts to control Medicare spending should not jeopardize the \nintegrity of the health care system. Designing a physician \nreimbursement system that is less volatile and reflects the actual cost \nof delivering high-quality patient care is absolutely necessary. Now is \nthe time to take a closer look at the way Medicare payments affect \nthose serving some of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. Further \ndelay could make it financially untenable for doctors such as Ronald \nJohnson to practice in areas like Pittsfield, IL.\n  I ask that the article from FPReport be printed in the Record.\n\n                       [From FPReport, May 2002]\n\n  Lower Payments Force FPs To Risk Personal Loss for Their Patients, \n                               Practices\n\n                            (By Jody Gloor)\n\n       For a growing number of family physicians, Medicare payment \n     cuts ultimately could break up the ``families'' dependent on \n     them--families composed of patients, employees and entire \n     communities.\n       While some FPs have stopped accepting new Medicare \n     patients, others are putting personal loss on the line to \n     keep their ``families'' intact.\n       One rural doctor in Illinois who borrowed money to meet his \n     payroll is now borrowing against his dream farm to repay \n     those loans and protect his practice from financial failure.\n       Medicare patients make up one-third of the Pittsfield \n     practice of Ronald Johnson, M.D., and the area's only \n     hospital claims nearly 80 percent of its patients use \n     Medicare. With an average age of 58 in the two counties \n     Johnson serves, ``we don't have the choice of not taking \n     Medicare patients. That's our life here,'' he said in a \n     recent telephone interview. ``They are our neighbors; they \n     are our friends. We have to take care of each other.''\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\n       When he added the losses from Medicare reimbursements and \n     accounts receivables that have doubled in the past six \n     months, Johnson realized he needed to borrow an amount that \n     nearly equaled the value of his farm.\n       ``I got lucky,'' he said, ``because the farm has been \n     taking care of itself financially. Now, it's going to take \n     care of us and our patients.''\n       Johnson is finalizing a loan for two-thirds of his farm's \n     value. It's an amount that realistically, he said, can \n     sustain his practice for another year--two at the most--\n     depending on factors including future Medicare reimbursement \n     rates, the local economy and land values.\n       ``I'd never thought I would spend this much of my time \n     being a businessman,'' he said. ``It's such a joy to sit down \n     and see a patient. I thought that was what I was training \n     for.''\n       AAFP Director Arlene Brown, M.D., of Ruidoso, NM., said she \n     and her staff ``saw the writing on the wall'' when Medicare \n     physician payments dropped and accounts receivables \n     increased. Something had to happen to keep her ``frontier \n     medicine'' practice open.\n       Brown serves 8,000 patients, some of whom must drive 50 \n     miles on a dirt road to reach a paved road--then must drive \n     another 100 miles to her office. At least 30 percent rely on \n     Medicare, she said, ``and we can't stop accepting these \n     patients.''\n       So Brown took a pay cut and turned to her staff for help. \n     The employees--a close-knit ``family''--didn't want to see \n     anyone lose his or her job, she said. Instead of eliminating \n     a position and/or cutting patient services, all staff members \n     agreed to cut their hours and pay by 15 to 18 percent.\n       ``We must stay open,'' Brown said. ``We now if my patients \n     have to get their primary care 200 miles away from home, they \n     won't go get it. They depend on me, and on us.''\n       How long can her practice hold out for a permanent \n     financial solution? Not long, Brown said. She's hoping \n     efforts to get the federal government to rethink Medicare and \n     correct the physician payment formula will succeed soon.\n       ``If not, we'll be cutting some services we don't have to \n     provide,'' she said. ``The first to go will be flu shots.'' \n     Next to go will be the free assistance older and low-income \n     patients get when they need help to buy prescription drugs.\n       ``It all makes for bad medicine,'' Brown said, ``but it \n     could help keep our doors open.''\n       If her practice closes, the entire community--her \n     community--could collapse, she said. ``A majority of \n     Americans eat, live, sleep and die in small communities. If \n     we shut down the very things that help small communities \n     survive, like medicine, then those communities will die.''\n\n  (At the request of Mr. DASCHLE, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8371-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONGRATULATING AUSTIN AND LYDIA WARDER\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, today I bring your attention to \nAustin and Lydia Warder. On August 12, 2002, they celebrated their 60th \nwedding anniversary, and I ask you to join me, their family and friends \nin congratulating them.\n  The Warders have devoted 60 years to each other, to their family, to \ntheir community of Indian Head, MD, and to the service of their country \nthrough the United States Navy. Our country could not ask for two more \ndedicated citizens.\n  Austin Warder was born in Marbury, MD in 1922, just a few miles away \nfrom his future bride, Lydia Eastburn, born in 1924. The two met and \nsoon married on August 12, 1942, in Austin's hometown, just before he \nshipped out for World War II. Austin served his country as a United \nStates Navy Seabee in the South Pacific from 1942 until the war ended \nin 1945. During that time, Lydia joined the war effort and began \nworking at the Naval Ordinance Station in her hometown of Indian Head, \nMD.\n  After the war, the Warders settled down in Indian Head. Austin \ncontinued his service with the U.S. Navy, joining Lydia at the Naval \nOrdinance Station where she worked as a housing project manager. Austin \nbegan his career there as Director of the Public Works Department, \nMaintenance Division. Both received numerous letters of commendation \nand many outstanding performance ratings over their long careers. They \nworked together over the years. They finally decided to retire, \ntogether, in January of 1977. Lydia was retiring after 35 years and \nAustin after 32 years.\n  The Warders have left an important legacy with the Federal \nGovernment. Together, they have 70 years of service, and I am sure the \nNavy joins me in congratulating them. But their most important legacy, \nand I know their favorite, is their family. Austin and Lydia have been \nblessed with a large and loving family. They have one daughter, Sandra \nBenson, two grandchildren, five great grandchildren and one great-great \ngrandchild.\n  I am honored to share this couple's story of commitment and service \nwith the Senate today. Austin and Lydia Warder are fine Marylanders. \nTheir shared values, hard work, and spirit kept them together through \nthe War, through many years with the Navy, through children and \ngrandchildren and great grandchildren. Please join me in wishing the \nWarders my most sincere congratulations and best wishes for many more \nhappy years!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8371-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING THE ENTERPRISE FOUNDATION'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise today to recognize The \nEnterprise Foundation as it celebrates its 20th year of building \ncommunities and improving low-income people's lives across America.\n  Renowned developer James Rouse and his wife, Patty, launched \nEnterprise in 1982. Jim and Patty were inspired to start Enterprise by \nthree women from the Church of the Saviour here in Washington. They \nasked Jim for help in turning two run-down, rat-infested buildings \nblighting their Adams Morgan neighborhood into affordable apartments \nfor low-income residents of the area.\n  With Jim and Patty's help and thousands of hours of volunteer time, \nthe group achieved its goal. The buildings still provide a decent \naffordable home to low-income people in that community today.\n  Jim and Patty founded Enterprise to help more community groups \nrebuild their neighborhoods. Today, Enterprise works through a network \nof more than 2,200 community-based organizations in more than 820 \nlocations to provide affordable housing, safer streets, and access to \njobs and quality childcare.\n  Through these unsung heroes at the grassroots, Enterprise has \ninvested nearly $4 billion to produce more than 132,000 homes \naffordable to low-income people. On any given day, more than 250,000 \nlow-income people live in decent, affordable housing made possible in \npart by Enterprise.\n  In addition, Enterprise's job training and placement programs have \nhelped more than 32,000 hard-to-employ people qualify for work and \nretain employment. More than 4,500 children have benefited from \nEnterprise's childcare initiatives.\n  President Clinton presented Jim with the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom in 1995. When Jim passed away a year later, Patty and the rest \nof Enterprise's leadership continued the work he began.\n  That work goes on today. I have seen firsthand what Enterprise has \nachieved in many communities in my State. To cite just one example, \nEnterprise has been working since the early 1990s with the residents of \nSandtown-Winchester in Baltimore City on a comprehensive effort to \nreverse decades of disinvestment and decay.\n  After more than a decade, Sandtown is showing signs of a turnaround. \nThe median income in the community increased by 50 percent during the \n1990s, according to the Census. Median home sale prices rose 376 \npercent during that time, according to Johns Hopkins University's \nInstitute for Policy Studies. In the parts of this 72-block community \nwhere Enterprise has been most active, crime is down and elementary \nschool students are going better.\n  More work remains, in Sandtown and in countless other low-income \nareas around the country. True to Jim Rouse's vision, Enterprise will \nnot rest until all low-income Americans have the opportunity for fit \nand affordable housing and to move up and out of poverty into the \nmainstream of American life.\n  I ask that we pay tribute to Mr. Rouse's legacy and to the profound \nimpact that The Enterprise Foundation has had, and continues to have, \non the lives of low-income Americans building better lives for \nthemselves, their families and their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8371-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8371-S8372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INVENTION OF THE TELEVISION BY PHILO T. \n                               FARNSWORTH\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to honor the \nlate Philo T.\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\nFarnsworth and the Farnsworth family on the 75th anniversary of the \ninvention of the electric television.\n  It was on September 7, 1927, while working in his small, cramped \nlaboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco, that Philo Farnsworth \nconducted the first successful experiments that form the basis for \ntoday's television. Upon completing the very first transmission of an \nelectronic image, Farnsworth sent a telegram to his investors that \nsimply said, ``The Damn Thing Works.''\n  Farnsworth first conceptualized these ideas one summer day while \ntilling a potato field on his family's farm. Riding atop the horse \ndriven plow, the 14 year-old Farnsworth was struck by the crisscrossed \npatterns in the field. Like the furrows in the field front of him, \nFarnsworth believed he could separate a picture into lines and \nreassemble them elsewhere.\n  In 1930, Farnsworth obtained the patents for his invention, which \nemploys a magnetically deflected electron beam inside a cathode ray \ntube to transmit a picture. All forms of video in use in the world \ntoday, including computer displays, trace their origins to Farnsworth's \npatents and this seminal event 75 years ago.\n  When Farnsworth died at the age of 64 in 1971, he held more than 300 \nU.S. and foreign patents. In September 1983, he was one of four \ninventors honored by the U.S. Postal Service with a stamp bearing his \nportrait. My home State of California has recognized his invention of \nthe electronic television by placing a State historical marker \nmemorializing the event in front of his former lab in San Francisco. In \naddition, the mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, recently issued a \nproclamation making September 7, 2002, Philo Taylor Farnsworth Day in \nthat city.\n  Before I conclude today, I also want to recognize the important \ncontributions of Elma ``Pem'' Farnsworth, now 94 years of age and the \nonly living witness to this historic 1927 event. Mrs. Farnsworth, a \ntalented scientist in her own right, worked closely with her husband on \nmany of his inventions.

Gillan.\n  Ms. Gillan has served as General Counsel for the California Public \nEmployees' Retirement System, CalPERS, since 1996, and also worked as \nStaff Counsel from 1986 to 1990 and as Deputy General Counsel from 1990 \nto 1996. She led a team of attorneys and other professionals who have \nworked to support the retirement, health and investment programs \nbenefitting CalPERS members and employers. Ms. Gillan was instrumental \nin drafting corporate governance principles for the CalPERS Board of \nAdministration, making CalPERS the first fund in the Nation to \narticulate roles for its Board, leaders, committees and staff.\n  Ms. Gillan also facilitated the CalPERS Board's self-evaluation \nprocess and helped the Board implement path-breaking corporate \ngovernance policies. She was the principal drafter of all CalPERS \ncorporate governance policy statements since 1992, and met with more \nthan 150 companies to address poor financial performance and corporate \ngovernance.\n  Under Ms. Gillan's leadership, the CalPERS legal team successfully \nfought and won litigation that resulted in a return of over $2 billion \nto the fund, and the establishment of the principle that CalPERS \nmembers have a vested right to a fiscally secure retirement system. She \ndrafted Board policies on securities litigation, including the CalPERS \nprocess for evaluating litigation that served as a roadmap for the \nCalPERS legal team to win the largest securities fraud class action \nrecovery in history.\n  Ms. Gillan has been the recipient of numerous industry honors, such \nas being named one of the National Law Journal's top 50 women lawyers \nin the United States in 1998, and was included in that publication's \n1995 list of the top ``40 under age 40 attorneys'' in the Nation.\n  Ms. Gillan's expertise, dedication, and leadership should be \ncommended. Her work has resulted in the advancement of corporate \ngovernance principles in corporations throughout the United States. \nEstablishing higher standards and clear accountability for corporate \ngovernance is vital to the integrity of the American economy, \nparticularly in light of the burgeoning corporate scandals in our \nmarkets.\n  I wish Ms. Gillan all the best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8372-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8372-S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE CHALLENGE OF COMMUNITY SERVICE\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have learned much in the last \nyear about how to measure the strength of America, a Nation built on \nthe willingness of our citizens to give of their time and their energy, \nknowing that in the end our freedom and strength as individuals is \nconnected to the freedom and strength of our Nation, and when one \nfalters the other suffers in turn. Mothers and fathers have passed \nalong to every successive generation pride in sacrifice and a \ncommitment to our shared values that have become the touchstone of \nAmerica's strength, grounded in the simple words of DeTocqueville: \n``America is great because Americans are good.''\n  Arthur Blaustein's book on American volunteerism proves that the \nspirit of our forebears, that spirit that carried us through the \ntumultuous early days, a Civil War, a Depression, two World Wars, and \nthe upheaval at home and overseas of the sixties, is alive and well \ntoday. From commitments to civil rights and civic bodies to military \nservice and community volunteering, our Nation is a nation committed to \nstrengthening and improving the world around us.\n  And every time Americans have sought to strengthen our freedom and \nvalues, we have found individuals willing to volunteer their time and \nlead by their example, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Clara Barton, \nRachel Carson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and many more. And today, \nyoungsters in middle school and high school have more opportunities \nthan ever to volunteer in their local communities, in nursing homes, \ntutoring their peers, or helping protect our environment; and are doing \nso in increasing numbers.\n  Arthur Blaustein, a long-time volunteer himself and an active force \nin American volunteer efforts, has written a book that appears at a \ncrucial moment in our Nation's history, a moment when communal and \ncivic engagement are more important then ever. His book honors the high \nideals and values that are found in these organizations that have \nproven so successful in strengthening the ties of our communities and \nour country.\n  His message is an important one: if America is to remain strong and \ncommitted to our values, civic and community engagement is a necessity. \nI applaud his proposals and hope many more, both young and old, will \nvolunteer their time and energy to keep America strong.\n  Part I, The Challenge of Community Service: The traditions of \ncommunity service and citizen participation have been at the heart of \nAmerican civic culture since before the nation was founded; whether \nthrough town hall meetings, the local school board, a political party, \na hospital auxiliary, or one of our innumerable other national and \nlocal organizations, Americans have felt and acted on the need to give \nsomething back to their communities. Yet since the events of September \n11, this need has become more urgent, as Americans on the whole have \nbecome more introspective and more patriotic. This patriotism has taken \nmany different forms, but one thing is clear: our concern for our \ncountry, our communities, our families, and our neighbors has become \nmore acute, and our need to contribute more urgent.\n\n  With firefighters, police officers, and rescue teams leading the way, \nordinary citizens, ironworkers, teachers, public health clinicians, \nprofessionals, businesspeople, and schoolchildren, either volunteered \nto go to Ground Zero or offered their support from a distance. \nEverything from blankets to blood, peanut butter to poetry arrived\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\nin New York City by the bale, the gallon, the barrel, and the ream. \nAmericans didn't wait until January 1, 2002, to make resolutions; in \nmid-September, many resolved to be more caring and giving.\n  Make a Difference is here to help harness this outpouring of \ncompassion, energy, and patriotism in creative and useful ways. If \nyou've decided to make a difference because of the events of September \n11, or if volunteering is one of those things you've been meaning to do \nall along but just haven't gotten around to, or if you're just curious \nabout what's out there, this book can help you take the next step. It \nwas designed to help you decide that you can make a contribution to the \nwell-being of your community. It will help to answer the why, the how, \nthe what, and the when. Why is community service important? How can you \nget in touch with a group that promotes the values and goals that you \nbelieve in? What specific volunteer activities match up with your \nskills and experiences? When is a good time to volunteer?\n  Each of the organizations included in the book has been selected \nbecause of its commitment to educational, social, economic, \nenvironmental, and community development goals. Some have been in \nexistence for many decades and others are fairly new. Most are national \norganizations and some are local prototypes; but all have a solid track \nrecord of delivering services that are useful and meaningful. Before \nyou select an organization, ask yourself a few questions.\n  How much time do you want to serve?\n  What kind of service fits your personality?\n  What neighborhood and community do you want to work in?\n  Which target population do you want to work with?\n  What skills do you have to offer?\n  What would you like to gain from the experience?\n  If, for example, you're over 17 can commit a full year, and would \nlike leadership training, some income, and a stipend, you should \nseriously consider AmeriCorps. If you want to commit a year and you're \nover 18 and want to work on environmental, art, or music projects, or \nin community development, you should think about Volunteers in Service \nto America (VISTA). If you only have a weekend or one day a week, you \nlike working with your hands, and you want to be outdoors, Habitat for \nHumanity will probably be perfect. If you only have a few hours a \nweek and enjoy children, consider mentoring or tutoring with an \neducational group. It might take some reflection and research, but \nthere is a fulfilling opportunity for everyone.\n\n  Historically, our greatest strength as a nation has been to be there \nfor one another. Citizen participation is the lifeblood of democracy. \nAs Thomas Paine put it, ``The highest calling of every individual in a \ndemocratic society is that of citizen!'' Accidents of nature and \nabstract notions of improvement do not make our communities better or \nhealthier places in which to live and work. They get better because \npeople like you decide that they want to make a difference.\n  Volunteering is not a conservative or liberal, Democratic or \nRepublican issue; caring and compassion simply help to define us as \nbeing human, Unfortunately, opportunistic radio talk-show hosts and \nreactionary politicians have spread two false myths about community \nservice. The first is the notion that only inner-city minorities \nbenefit from volunteer efforts. Here's a story about that myth, told to \nme by a friend who was in VISTA. He was helping local groups organize \nfuel cooperatives many years ago, in small towns in Maine. That winter \nwas unusually cold and the price of home heating had skyrocketed, \nplacing an enormous financial burden on most families in the state, \nwhich had a low per-capita income. He was invited to make a \npresentation to about two hundred residents in their town's church. \nAfter the talk, one of the ``happy guy'' television reporters from \nPortland baited a farmer, asking, ``What do you think of this outside \nagitation?''\n  The farmer, who was about seventy-five, paused for a moment; and, \nwith an edge of flint in his voice, he said, ``You know, I'm a fourth-\ngeneration Republican Yankee, just like my father, my grandfather, and \nmy great-grandfather, but if I've learned anything, it's that there are \ntwo kinds of politics and economics in America. The first kind is what \nI see on television and what politicians tell me when they want my \nvote. The other kind is what me and my friends talk about over \ndoughnuts and coffee. And that's what this young fellow was talking \nabout tonight, and he made a lot of sense to me. I'm joining the co-\nop.''\n  Over 65 percent of America's poor are, like this farmer, white, and \nwhite families with children are the fastest growing homeless \npopulation. The myth that social programs only serve inner-city \nminorities stigmatizes volunteer social programs, which are, in fact, \ncolor-blind.\n  The second myth is that the vast majority of individuals who \nvolunteer for community service are naive, idealistic do-gooders. \nHere's a story about that myth. It happened to me in a bookstore in \nNorthern California. Six years ago, I was a technical advisor to the \nproducers of a public television series called ``The New War on \nPoverty.'' There was a companion book to the series, and since I had \nbeen one of the contributing editors, the publisher asked me to give \nreadings. This particular evening, I showed film clips from the series \nand spoke about the importance of several War on Poverty programs, \nincluding Head Start, the Job Corps, VISTA, Legal Services, and Upward \nBound.\n  While I was signing books after the reading, a woman in her mid-\ntwenties who looked like a quintessential California valley girl, blond \nhair, blue eyes, approached me with tears in her eyes. I asked if I had \nsaid anything that offended her. She replied that I had not and told me \nshe was nonpolitical, conservative, and in her last year of law school. \nShe had been a political science major at college but knew nothing \nabout the history of the War on Poverty. She said she was \nashamed because, despite having benefited from two of the programs I \nhad spoken about, Head Start and Upward Bound, she had never before \nfelt a responsibility to give back to her community, and to assure that \nthese programs would be continued so that others could have the same \nopportunities she had.\n\n  Like this woman, the vast majority of volunteers I've worked with are \nnot idealistic, but are serious realists. They are only too aware that \nas a nation we cannot squander our human and natural resources.\n  Community service not only exposes the sterility of this kind of \nidealism-versus-realism debate, but helps individuals to integrate \ntheir own idealism and realism. An idealist without a healthy dose of \nrealism tends to become a naive romantic. A realist without ideals \ntends to become a cynic. Community service helps you put your ideals to \nwork in a realistic setting. It creates a dynamic tension that gives \nyou a coherent and comprehensive approach to complex problems. I've \nseen it happen time and again with my students, and with VISTA and \nAmeriCorps volunteers. Dr. Margaret Mead, one of my teachers in \ngraduate school at Columbia, wrote that a truly healthy person is a \nthinking, feeling, acting person. That's what serving helps us to \nachieve.\n  The talk-show hosts and politicians who push these myths are \nscapegoating and attacking the most vulnerable segments of our society. \nThey are adept at moralizing over the problems of the homeless and the \nhungry, the unemployed and the underemployed, drug users and the \nmentality ill, and over such issues as infant mortality, child and \nspousal abuse, and disrupted families. But they have neither the heart \nnor the will for rigorous thought and the work of finding cures, nor \neven relieving some of the suffering or symptoms. Just as military \nservice and patriotism should not be politicized, neither should \ncommunity service.\n  Nearly 40 years ago, when President John F. Kennedy launched the \nPeace Corps, he made this oft-quoted suggestion: ``Ask not what your \ncountry can do for you, but what you can do for your country.'' After \n30 years of firsthand experience with hundreds of volunteers, I would \nmake a follow-up suggestion: ``Ask not what you can do for your \ncommunity and the people you serve, but what they can do for you.'' \nCommunity service is very much a two-way street. It is about giving and \nreceiving, and the receiving can be\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\nnourishing for the heart and mind. The very act of serving taps into a \nwellspring of empathy and generosity that is both personally gratifying \nand energizing. Again and again, former volunteers described their \nexperiences with words like these: adventure, growth, human connection, \nexciting, spiritual, learning, and enjoyable.\n  I saw this in action 3 years ago when I decided to give the students \nin each of my classes, mostly university seniors, the choice between a \nmid-semester exam or sixteen hours of community service. The students \nunanimously chose service--though most of them didn't know what was in \nstore for them. They had a choice of about ten different activities \norganized by the Public Service Center at the University of California, \nBerkeley.\n  Here's what one student wrote about this experience: ``Before I \nstarted volunteering, I had very different expectations about the \n[after-school] program. I thought it would be very sports-oriented with \nlittle academic emphasis. Luckily, my expectations proved false. The \nprogram for fourth and fifth-grader at the Thousand Oaks/Franklin \nElementary School, has a set schedule for each grade. The students \nrotate between free play, sports, library study time, circle time, and \narts and crafts.\n\n       It was in the library that I saw how truly behind these \n     children are in mathematics, reading, and grammar. In \n     addition, I never expected to see the immense poverty that \n     these children experience or to be so emotionally affected by \n     it. Last week, I learned that one of my favorite children is \n     homeless. It seems so silly to be reprimanding him for not \n     doing his homework and not putting out the effort at school. \n     This seems so trivial compared to the real-life horrors that \n     he must experience. Although I had my expectations, never did \n     I anticipate the emotional attachment that I now share with \n     these children. I find myself yearning to become a teacher, \n     which was a career I never thought about before this program. \n     I know that as these children grow, they will probably forget \n     about me; but I know I will never forget them. I have truly \n     changed and matured as a result of them.\n\n  A second student wrote:\n\n       Before I started tutoring I was really scared, because I \n     didn't know what tutors did in junior high schools. I was \n     afraid of not being able to explain things so that the kids \n     could understand. I thought I might also lose patience \n     quickly with kids who were slower in understanding and for \n     whom I would have to repeatedly state the same thing. I was \n     concerned that the kids would resent me or not respect me \n     because I wasn't the teacher and was closer to their age. And \n     finally, I thought they wouldn't like me; the first day I \n     even had trouble introducing myself because of this initial \n     uncertainty.\n       Contrary to these preliminary fears, however, tutoring at \n     Willard has been a life-changing experience for me. I've \n     found that I have more patience working with kids than I've \n     ever had in any other area of my life. I work hard to come up \n     with lots of examples when the kids I'm working with don't \n     understand. We relate well to one another because I'm close \n     to their age, yet they respect me because I go to Cal and \n     they know that I'm there to help them. It's been the joy of \n     my semester to work with these students, who I really \n     appreciate.\n\n  These comments were typical of the experience of nearly all 80 \nstudents. Their testimony is consistent with the more formal academic \nresearch and evaluations, which tell us that service-learning clearly \nenriches and enhances the individual volunteer in multiple ways. And \nthe same things happened to me during my own community service 35 years \nago, when I taught in Harlem during the early years of the War on \nPoverty and VISTA.\n  My students now, and I back then, confronted the complexities of the \neveryday worlds of individuals and communities quite different from our \nown. We are forced to deal with difficult social and economic \nrealities. It was an eye-opener to learn about the inequities and \ninjustices of our society, to see firsthand the painful struggles of \nchildren who did not have the educational, social, or economic \nopportunities that we took for granted. This experience was humbling \nand it broke down my insularity, for which I'm truly grateful. Again, \nit was Dr. Margaret Mead who called this ``heart-learning.''\n  Community service also taught me an important lesson about our \nsociety: ethical values and healthy communities are not inherited. They \nare either recreated through action by each generation, or they are \nnot. That is what makes AmeriCorps, VISTA, and other forms of community \nservice unique and valuable. They help us to regenerate our best values \nand principles as individuals and as a society. From Plato to the \npresent, civic virtue has been at the core of civilized behavior. My \nexperience as a teacher and with service-learning has taught me that \nmoral and ethical values cannot survive from one generation to the next \nif the only preservatives are texts or research studies. Real-life \nexperience is the crucible for shaping values. Out of it develop an \nintuition and a living memory that are the seeds of a humane and just \nsociety.\n\n  The task of passing along to the young our best civic traditions is \nmade more difficult by the steady shift of emphasis away from \nqualitative values civility, cooperation, and the public interest, to \nquantitative ones, competition, making it, and privatism, as well as \nthe demoralizing pursuit of mindless consumerism and trivia force-fed \nus by the mass media. Just about every parent and teacher I know has, \nin one way or another, expressed the concern that they cannot compete \nwith the marketing techniques of the mass media, particularly \ntelevision. They are worried about the potential consequences of the \ngrowing acquisitiveness, the indulgence, and the self-centeredness of \nchildren. You hear this from conservatives, liberals, and moderates. \nSmall wonder. The average eighteen-year-old in the United States has \nseen more than 380,000 television commercials. We haven't begun to \ncomprehend the inherent brutality of this media saturation on our \nchildren's psyches.\n  Materialism and assumptions of entitlement breed boredom, cynicism, \ndrug abuse, and crime for kicks. Passivity, isolation, and depression \ncome with television and on-line addiction. Ignorance, fear, and \nprejudice come from insularity and exclusivity. A national and local \neffort to promote community service by young people is the best \nantidote to these social ills. The goals are inclusive and nourishing; \nthey seek to honor diversity, to protect the environment, and to enrich \nour Nation's educational, social, and economic policies so that they \nenhance human dignity. On a personal level, volunteering, the very act \nof caring and doing, makes a substantial difference in our individual \nlives because it nourishes the moral intelligence required for critical \njudgment and mature behavior.\n  Dr. Seuss reminded us in The Lorax that ``unless someone like you \ncares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better. It's not.'' \nSeptember 11, 2001, as tragic and traumatic as it was, can serve as a \ntransformative event for the American people. We responded to this \ncrisis with introspection, generosity, and caring. Now is not the time \nto push the snooze button and return to civic fatuity and complacency. \nJust as we marshaled our forces and mobilized our capacities to \nconfront a foreign enemy, we can take action and confront our domestic \nproblems and conflicts on the home front. In the real world, we know \nthat taking ordinary initiatives can make a difference. It is within \nour power to move beyond a disaster and to create new opportunities. \nWhat it comes down to is assuming personal responsibility. If we decide \nto become involved in voluntary efforts, we can restore idealism, \nrealism, responsiveness, and vitality to our institutions and our \ncommunities.\n  At her memorial service, it was said of Eleanor Roosevelt, the most \ninfluential American woman of the twentieth century, ``she would rather \nlight a candle then curse the darkness.'' What was true for her then is \ntrue for us now. The choice to make a difference is ours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8374-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8374-S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING NEW YORK CITY'S COURT OFFICERS\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, as we approached the 1-year \nanniversary of 9/11, I rise today to again honor all of the public \nsafety officers whose courageous and heroic acts saved thousands of \nlives at the World Trade Center. In particular, I want to highlight a \ngroup of public safety officers who deserve to be honored for their \nheroism. The New York City court officers risked their lives and \ncontributed immensely to the rescue and recovery operations at Ground \nZero.\n  I especially would like to honor three court officers who gave the \nultimate sacrifice--their lives. Their heroic deeds have earned them \nthe nomination for the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor--a \ntestament to true American heroes.\n  I would like to say a little bit on each officer.\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\n  Captain William ``Harry'' Thompson, of the Bronx, was widely \nrespected and beloved by all 1,600 court officers in New York City as \nsenior instructor at the New York State Court Officers Academy. A 27-\nyear veteran, he was the father of two adult sons and was the sole \nsupporter for his widowed mother. All who knew Captain Thompson \nconsidered him a ``spit and polish'' type of officer. Captain Thompson \nwas proud of his profession and New York is so very lucky that he \ndevoted his life to public service.\n  Senior Court Officer Thomas Jurgens was part of a family who believed \nin giving back to one's city and country. Senior Court Officer Jurgens \nwas the son of a firefighter, and was a volunteer fireman from \nLawrence, Long Island. He made all of us proud by serving his country \nin the Persian Gulf war as an Army combat paramedic. Senior Court \nOfficer Jurgens was a 4-year veteran at the Manhattan Supreme Court, \nand he was married in June 2001.\n  Senior Court Officer Mitchel Wallace, of Mineloa, Long Island, worked \nat the Manhattan Supreme Court for 2 years. Before September 11, the \nNew York State Court of Appeals Chief Judge Judith Kaye honored him for \nresuscitating a man who had collapsed from cardiac arrest aboard a Long \nIsland railroad train. Senior Court Officer Wallace planned to marry \nNoreen McDonough in October, and he called her ``Cinderella.''\n  In addition to these brave heroes who were lost, 22 other court \nofficers risked their lives to save others at the World Trade Center. \nThese men and women have been honored for their bravery on September \n11. They are: Deputy Chief Joseph Baccellieri, Jr., Officer Tyree \nBacon, Sgt. Frances Barry, Captain John Civelia, Sgt. Gerard Davis, \nOfficer William Faulkner, Officer Gerard Grant, Officer Edwin Kennedy, \nOfficer Elayne Kittel, Officer William Kuhrt, Officer Theodore \nLeoutsakos, Officer Craig Lovich, Sgt. Patricia Maiorino, Major \nReginald V. Mebane, Sgt. Al Moscola, Sgt. Kathryn Negron, Officer \nJoseph Ranauro, Sgt. Albert Romanelli, Sgt. Richard Rosenfeld, Officer \nAndrew Scagnelli, Officer Mahindra Seobarrat, and Sgt. Andrew Wender.\n  Hundreds of court officers volunteered to work on recovery efforts at \nGround Zero. After working full shifts at the courthouse, these \nofficers would then work a full shift at Ground Zero. They would return \nhome, clean the dust and debris from their hands, and return to their \njobs at the courthouse. Through valor, duty, and commitment, they did \nall that they could to assist in the rescue and recovery operations.\n  On behalf of the American people, I express my thanks and \nappreciation for these public safety officers whose dedication and \npatriotism strengthen the resolve of our Nation. These officers went \nabove and beyond the call of duty, sacrificing their lives in order to \nsave others, not because it was their job, but because it was their \nsense of duty of pride. These officers represent the very best in \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8375-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM A SCHWARTZ, VICE CHAIRMAN AND VOLUNTEER CEO, \n                   NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER COALITION\n\n Mr. CLELAND.

Madam President, I want to draw the Senate's \nattention to National Assisted Living Week, which begins September 8 \nand continues through September 14. Since 1995, the National Center for \nAssisted Living has sponsored National Assisted Living Week to \nemphasize the importance of this service that nearly 1 million seniors \nrely on for long-term care.\n  Assisted living offers hope to seniors who can no longer live \nindependently at home but do not need the level of care provided by \nnursing facilities. In assisted living facilities, seniors find \ndedicated caregivers to provide assistance in the activities of daily \nliving in a setting that truly becomes a home. It is predicted that the \ndemand for assisted living will continue to grow as more and more \nseniors and their families seek out home-like independent living with \nthe benefits of 24-hour supervision.\n  The theme of this year's National Assisted Living Week is ``Honoring \nthe Spirit of Our Nation,'' which is intended to honor the Nation's \nrekindled interest in our heritage and values. It is an appropriate \ntheme because it celebrates the residents' lifetime of memories, \ndevotions, and patriotism and the dedication and service of assisted \nliving caregivers. The theme for National Assisted Living Week will \nhighlight the variety of ways assisted living meets the different needs \nof seniors in our Nation.\n  I am proud that Oregon has led our Nation in the concept of assisted \nliving. Assisted living has developed differently in each State and its \nimportance in meeting the needs of seniors continues. I believe \noffering these choices for seniors is important in order to provide \nthem with security, dignity, and independence. It is also important for \nus to continue to support options that allow seniors and their families \na choice of settings in order to assure that they get the level of care \nthey need and deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8375-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8375-S8376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  REMEMBERING A GREAT GEORGIAN AND A DEVOTED LEADER IN THE FIGHT \nAGAINST PROSTATE CANCER\n Mr. MILLER.

These individuals are being honored for their \noutstanding devotion to the effort to enrich the lives of people with \ndevelopmental disabilities in Illinois.\n  These recipients have displayed a strong sense of humanity and \nprofessionalism in their work with persons with disabilities. Their \nefforts have inspired the lives of those for whom they care, and they \nare an inspiration to me as well. They have set a fine example of \ncommunity service for all Americans to follow.\n  These honorees spend more than 50 percent of their time at work in \ndirect, personal involvement with their clients. They are not primarily \nmanagers or supervisors. They are direct service workers at the \nforefront of America's effort to care for people with special needs. \nThey go to work every day with little recognition, providing much \nneeded and greatly valued care and assistance.\n  It is my honor and privilege to recognize the Illinois recipients of \nAAMR's 2002 Direct Service Professional Award: Amy Burnell, Kay Grant, \nHattie Gregory, Judy Harper, Dora Hildebrand, Mae Holmes, Sarah \nKyakonye, Toni Lloyd, Bob Maas, Kelli Martin, Janet Maxton, Millicent \nMcAfoos, Flo McMaster, Lisa Mitchell, Anne Pettus, Sharon Pritchett, \nLeVetta Rhodes, Ruth Rodenberg, Karin Schwab, and Judy Sheffield.\n  I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating the winners \nof the 2002 Direct Service Professional Award.

Rept. No. 107-9)\n\n       (Text of Committee Recommended Resolution of Ratification\n\n       Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein),\n       Section 1. Advice and Consent to Ratification of the \n     Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination \n     Against Women, subject to Reservations, Understandings and \n     Declarations.\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \n     Against Women, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly \n     on December 18, 1979, and signed on behalf of the United \n     States of America on July 17, 1980 (Treaty Doc. 96-53), \n     subject to the reservations in Section 2, the understandings \n     in Section 3, and the declarations in Section 4.\n       Section 2. Reservations.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate is subject to the \n     following reservations, which shall be included in the \n     instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The Constitution and laws of the United States \n     establish extensive protections against discrimination \n     reaching all forms of\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\n     governmental activity as well as significant area of non-\n     governmental activity. However, individual privacy and \n     freedom from governmental interference in private conduct are \n     also recognized as among the fundamental values of our free \n     and democratic society. The United States understands that by \n     its terms the Convention requires broad regulation of private \n     conduct, in particular under Articles 2, 3 and 5. The United \n     States does not accept any obligation under the Convention to \n     enact legislation or to take any other action with respect to \n     private conduct except as mandated by the Constitution and \n     laws of the United States.\n       (2) Under current U.S. law and practice, women are \n     permitted to volunteer for military service without \n     restriction, and women in fact serve in all U.S. armed \n     services, including in combat positions. However, the United \n     States does not accept an obligation under the Convention to \n     assign women to all military units and positions which may \n     require engagement in direct combat.\n       (3) U.S. law provides strong protections against gender \n     discrimination in the area of remuneration, including the \n     right to equal pay for equal work in jobs that are \n     substantially similar. However, the United States does not \n     accept any obligation under this Convention to enact \n     legislation establishing the doctrine of comparable worth as \n     that term is understood in U.S. practice.\n       (4) Current U.S. law contains substantial provisions for \n     maternity leave in many employment situations but does not \n     require paid maternity leave. Therefore, the United States \n     does not accept an obligation under Article 11(2)(b) to \n     introduce maternity leave with pay or with comparable social \n     benefits without loss of former employment, seniority or \n     social allowances.\n       Section 3. Understandings.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate is subject to the \n     following understandings, which shall be included in the \n     instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States understands that this convention \n     shall be implemented by the Federal Government to the extent \n     that it exercises jurisdiction over the matters covered \n     therein, and otherwise by the State and local governments. To \n     the extent that State and local governments exercise \n     jurisdiction over such matters, the Federal Government shall, \n     as necessary, take appropriate measures to ensure the \n     fulfillment of this Convention.\n       (2) The Constitution and laws of the United States contain \n     extensive protections of individual freedom of speech, \n     expression, and association. Accordingly, the United States \n     does not accept any obligation under this Convention, in \n     particular under Articles 5, 7, 8 and 13, to restrict those \n     rights, through the adoption of legislation or any other \n     measures, to the extent that they are protected by the \n     Constitution and laws of the United States.\n       (3) The United States understands that Article 12 permits \n     States Parties to determine which health care services are \n     appropriate in connection with family planning, pregnancy, \n     confinement and the post-natal period, as well as when the \n     provision of free services is necessary, and does not mandate \n     the provision of particular services on a cost-free basis.\n       (4) Noting in this Convention shall be construed to reflect \n     or create any right to abortion and in no case should \n     abortion be promoted as a method of family planning.\n       (5) The United States understands that the Committee on the \n     Elimination of Discrimination Against Women was established \n     under Article 17 ``for the purpose of considering the \n     progress made in the implementation'' of the Convention. The \n     United States understands that the Committee on the \n     Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, as set forth in \n     Article 21, reports annually to the General Assembly on it \n     activities, and ``may make suggestions and general \n     recommendations based on the examination of reports and \n     information received from the States Parties.'' Accordingly, \n     the United States understands that the Committee on the \n     Elimination of Discrimination Against Women has no authority \n     to compel actions by States Parties.\n       Section 4. Declarations.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate is subject to the \n     following declarations:\n       (1) The United States declares that, for purposes of its \n     domestic law, the provisions of the Convention are non-self-\n     executing.\n       With reference to Article 29(2), the United States declares \n     that it does not consider itself bound by the provisions of \n     Article 29(1). The specific consent of the United States to \n     the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice \n     concerning disputes over the interpretation or application of \n     this Convention is required on a case-by case basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8384-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n       S. 2913.

A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to provide health insurance protections for individuals who are \nliving organ donors; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today to raise the awareness of \nan issue that affects over 22,000 people a year, and that issue is \norgan donation. The sad fact about organ donations is this: We have the \nmedical know-how to save lives, but we lack the organs. We lack organs \nbecause most Americans simply are unaware of the life-giving difference \nthey can make by choosing to become organ donors.\n  Sadly, each day the waiting list for those needing organs continues \nto grow. Today, nearly 79,000 people remain on the national transplant \nwaiting list. Right now, more than 50,000 people, alone, are waiting \nfor kidney transplants. That number is expected to double within the \nnext decade. Additionally, between 12 and 16 people die each day just \nwaiting for an available organ.\n  To remedy the organ shortage, we must increase public awareness. By \neducating the public and raising awareness, more people will choose to \nbecome organ donors. At the very least, through these efforts, we can \nencourage more families to discuss what their wishes are and whether \nthey would want to be organ donors.\n  But our efforts must not stop there. We must do more than just \nimplement public awareness campaigns, because the face of organ \ndonation is changing. For the first time ever, the number of living \norgan donors outnumbered cadaver donors. Last year, there were 6,081 \ndonor cadavers while 6,485 people opted to become living donors, \nusually giving up a healthy kidney to help a family member or friend.\n  Recognizing this, my colleague, Senator Durbin, and I introduce a \nbill today that would help protect living organ donors in the group \ninsurance market. Our bill would ensure that those individuals who \nchoose to be living organ donors are not discriminated against in the \ninsurance marketplace. Our bill builds on the protections provided by \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, so that living \norgan donors are not denied insurance nor are they applied \ndiscriminatory insurance premiums because of their living organ donor \nstatus.\n  Quite simply, a brother who donates a part of his kidney to his \nsister should not be denied health insurance. But tragically, that is \nwhat oftentimes happens. Frequently, individuals who are living organ \ndonors are denied health insurance or restricted from the insurance \nmarket. Instead, we should celebrate living organ donors and remove \nobstacles and barriers for the successful donation of organs. Insurance \nshouldn't undermine someone's decision to be a living organ donor.\n  Some States are evaluating how living organ donors affect the market. \nStates are amending their Family Medical Leave eligibility so that \nliving organ donors can participate and benefit from the program. The \nFederal Government, with the Organ Donor Leave Act of 1999, offered 30 \ndays paid leave to Federal employees who chose to be an organ donor. \nBut, paid leave and job protection doesn't mean much if people are \ndenied health insurance or are required to pay higher premiums because \nthey donated an organ to save another person's life.\n  The impact of living organ donation is profound. A living organ donor \nnot only can save the life of one patient, but can also take that \nperson off the waiting list for a cadaver donation. That means the next \nperson on the waiting list is ``bumped up'' a spot--giving additional \nhope to the 79,000 persons on the national transplant waiting list.\n  Living organ donors give family members and friends a second chance \nat life and the opportunity to reduce the number of people on the \nwaiting list to receive an organ. It is time for Congress to make a \nsensible decision in support of a person's decision to be a living \norgan donor. I encourage my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2914. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for appropriate incentive payments under the medicare program \nfor physicians' services furnished in underserved areas; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Medicare \nIncentive Payment Program Refinement Act of 2002. This bill makes \nneeded and long-overdue changes to the Medicare Inventive Payment \nProgram, an initiative conceived to address the growing primary care \nphysician shortage in some of our country's most medically underserved \ncommunities. The number of physicians needed to care for all \nindividuals, especially our aging seniors, continues to grow in remote \nrural areas and in underserved urban areas. However, rising health \ncosts and the difficulties of operating a practice in underserved \ncommunities has exacerbated the physician shortage. Although the \nMedicare Incentive Payment Program aims to address the financial \nhurdles facing physicians in needy areas, the program has failed to \nachieve real results. This bill will make fundamental changes to \nimprove the program's effectiveness.\n  Rural areas, in particular, are in need of efforts to retain primary \ncare physicians, since the difficulties of operating a practice often \ndrive doctors to larger areas with more resources and professional \nsupport. According to the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy, over \n20 million Americans live in areas that have a shortage of physicians, \nand between 1975 and 1995 the smallest counties in the U.S., population \nunder 2,500, experienced a drop in their physician-to-population ratio. \nMore than 2,200 primary care physicians would be needed to remove all \nnonmetropolitan HPSA designations, and more than twice that number is \nneeded to achieve adequate physician staffing levels nationwide.\n  According to the National Rural Health Association, nonmetropolitan \nphysicians treat a larger number of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries \nthan their urban counterparts do, generating less income for physicians \nper patient. Furthermore, nonmetropolitan physicians are less likely to \nperform high cost medical services due to their limited number of \nresources. Understandably, MIPP monies can affect the quality of life \nfor rural physicians and help prevent the mass migration of\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\nneeded health care professionals from underserved areas.\n  The Medicare Incentive Payment Program, as it exists today, has not \nfulfilled its original mandate, to recruit and retain primary care \nphysicians in health professional shortage areas. Passed as part of \nOBRA 87, the program pays all physicians a 10 percent bonus for each \nMedicare recipient they treat. This enhanced reimbursement is meant to \noffset the financial advantage of providing service in more populous \nareas, as well as help physicians with the costs associated with \noperating a practice in an underserved community. Most importantly, the \nprogram aims to increase health care access for Medicare beneficiaries \nand improve the health of communities overall.\n  However, analyses from the Office of the Inspector General of HHS, \nthe GAO, and independent health experts confirm that the program is \nunfocused and largely ineffective. All physicians are eligible for \nbonus payments, even when they may not be in short supply. Bonus \npayments are 10 percent, not enough to lure physicians to underserved \nareas, especially if the payment is based on a basic, primary care \nvisit. Finally, many physicians do not even know this program exists, \nand those that do are often unsure whether they are delivering care in \na HPSA and how to bill for the payment appropriately.\n  To improve the program, this bill increases the bonus payment from 10 \npercent to 20 percent and allows only those physicians providing \nprimary care services, including family and general medicine, general \ninternal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency \nmedicine, and general surgery, to receive the incentive payment. \nFinally, my bill automates payments, so physicians no longer have to \nguess whether they are eligible for the program. These improvements \nwill strengthen the original intent of the legislation, to recruit and \nretain primary care physicians in underserved areas, and strengthen the \nprimary health care infrastructure of our country's most needy \ncommunities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Incentive Payment \n     Program Refinement Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REVISION OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR PHYSICIANS' \n                   SERVICES FURNISHED IN UNDERSERVED AREAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1833(m) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395l(m)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(m) Incentive Payments for Physicians' Services Furnished \n     in Underserved Areas.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In the case of physicians' services \n     furnished by a physician with an applicable physician \n     specialty to an individual who is enrolled under this part \n     and who incurs expenses for such services in an area that is \n     designated under section 332(a)(1)(A) of the Public Health \n     Service Act as a health professional shortage area, in \n     addition to the amount otherwise paid under this part, there \n     also shall be paid to the physician (or to an employer or \n     facility in the cases described in clause (A) of section \n     1842(b)(6)) (on a quarterly basis) from the Federal \n     Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, an amount equal \n     to 20 percent of the payment amount for the service under \n     this part.\n       ``(2) Applicable physician specialty defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term `applicable physician specialty' means, \n     with respect to a physician, the primary specialty of that \n     physician if the specialty is one of the following:\n       ``(A) General practice.\n       ``(B) Family practice.\n       ``(C) Pediatric medicine.\n       ``(D) General internal medicine.\n       ``(E) Obstetrics and gynecology.\n       ``(F) General surgery.\n       ``(G) Emergency medicine.\n       ``(3) Automation of incentive payments.--The Secretary \n     shall establish procedures under which the Secretary shall \n     automatically make the payments required to be made under \n     paragraph (1) to each physician who is entitled to receive \n     such a payment.

A bill to put a college education within reach, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as another school year starts, many college \nstudents are worrying not only about their class loads and their \ncoursework, but about where the money to pay for their educations will \ncome from. Today, the average cost of attending a public 4-year college \nhas jumped to $9,000, up 7.7 percent from last year. This represents \nthe highest rate of increase since 1993. For those families that choose \nto send their children to a private institution, that number rises. Up \n4.7 percent from the year before, the average cost of a private 4-year \ninstitution is now close to $24,000 a year.\n  What do these rising tuition costs mean? Hard working American \nfamilies are spending a larger percentage of their incomes than ever \nbefore to send their children to college. To attend the University of \nDelaware, where I went to school, it costs nearly 20 percent of a \nDelaware family's average annual income to cover costs. To attend a \nprivate college or university, that number, in some instances can jump \nto over 40 percent of annual income.\n  To help remedy this situation I come to the floor today to \nreintroduce legislation to help American families afford their \nchildren's tuition. This comprehensive package, ``The Tuition \nAssistance for Families Act,'' builds upon previous steps that others \nand I have taken to make it possible for more families to provide their \nchildren with a college education. I introduce this bill so that the \ndecision to send one's child to college will not be overshadowed by the \ndecision of how to pay for it.\n  The ``Tuition Assistance for Families Act'' will provide middle class \nAmerican families with a $12,000 tuition tax deduction each year. Based \non legislation that I introduced with Senator Schumer last year, at \n$12,000 this deduction provides real, meaningful tax relief. Tax relief \nthat American families have been waiting for. Tax relief that can go a \nlong way in helping them afford room, board and tuition.\n  The bill that I am introducing today also expands the two tuition tax \ncredits enacted in 1997--the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning \nTax Credit. Under current law, the Lifetime Learning Credit allows a 20 \npercent tax credit on the first $10,000 in higher education expenses in \nyear 2003. Under my bill, the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit percentage \nwould jump from 20 to 25 percent and raise the amount of education \nexpenses subject to the credit to $12,000. In terms of real dollars, \nthis would mean that a student who files in tax year 2003 under my plan \ncould get up to $3,000 back in taxes. Under current law, the maximum \nallowable credit is only $2,000. That is a $1,000 difference. $1,000 \nthat can go directly into a student's pocket to pay for books, a \ncomputer or tuition. The also raises the income limits for each credit \nto $130,000 per family, per year, so that more families are afforded \nthe help that they need.\n  This bill reintroduces the idea of a $1,000 merit scholarship to be \nawarded to the top 5 percent of each high school's graduating class. \nThese types of scholarships not only reward student achievement, they \nhelp to ensure that the best and brightest students have the ability to \ngo on to college--thereby increasing the pool of well-qualified \nAmerican workers for the information technology age.\n  This act also increases the maximum Pell Grant award from $4,000 to \n$4,500. During the 2001-2002 school year, the maximum Pell Grant award \ncovered about 42 percent of the average tuition, room and board at a \npublic 4-year university. During the 1975-76 it covered 84 percent of \nthese same costs. Clearly, the purchasing power of these grants has \ndramatically declined. As such, the debt load of American families and \nAmerican students has increased considerably over the years as students \nhave looked to federal and private loans to finance their educations. A \nreport released just this March by the State PIRG's Higher Education \nProject found that at the end of the 1999-2000 school year, 64 percent \nof college students graduated with student loan debt at an average of \n$16,928, nearly double the average debt load just eight years ago. \nDouble the debt load in 1994.\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\n  It is the dream of every American to provide for their child a better \nlife than they had themselves. Helping families afford the increasing \ncost of a college education will move us closer to making that dream a \nreality. For this reason, I have spent a great deal of time in the \nSenate fighting to provide tax relief for middle class American \nfamilies struggling with the cost of college. And while I was pleased \nwhen some of the ideas I advocated were adopted in the 1997 tax cut \nbill, it is clear that as tuition costs rise dramatically, working \nAmericans need additional assistance. The ``Tuition Assistance for \nFamilies Act'' will provide extra help so that more families can afford \nto give their children a brighter and better future. Let's not allow a \ncollege education to become a luxury when, in the information \ntechnology age, it is an absolute necessity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/09/senate-section/article/S8388-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8388-S8389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 324--CONGRATULATING THE NATIONAL FARMERS UNION FOR \n100 YEARS OF SERVICE TO FAMILY FARMERS, RANCHERS, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nDaschle, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Nelson \nof Nebraska, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Allard, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nBayh, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nJerffords, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. DeWine, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \nBreaux) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I rise today for myself and Senator \nCantwell to submit a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of the \nCongress that the Secretary of Health and Human Services should conduct \nor support research to improve early detection of ovarian cancer. \nSpecifically, our resolution encourages continuing and accelerating the \ndevelopment of an ovarian cancer screening test currently underway \nthrough a public-private partnership including the National Cancer \nInstitute and the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of the gynecologic cancers and the \nfourth leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. \nOvarian cancer occurs in 1 out of 57 women, and an estimated 13,900 \nAmerican women died from ovarian cancer in 2001 alone.\n  Currently, approximately three-quarters of women with ovarian cancer \nare diagnosed when they are already in advanced stages of the disease, \nand only one in five will survive five years. However, if the disease \nis caught early, the five-year survival rate jumps to 95 percent. Thus \nproviding a way to routinely identify the disease in its ``Stage 1'' \nphase could have a dramatic impact in what is now a very deadly cancer. \nNo screening test exists that can accurately detect ovarian cancer in \nthe early states when it is highly curable.\n  In the February 2002 issue of The Lancet, scientists from the Food \nand Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute reported that \npatterns of protein found in patients' blood serum may reflect the \npresence of ovarian cancer. Using an innovative testing approach, \nanalyzing patterns of blood protein rather than identifying single \nblood biomarkers, researchers were able to differentiate between serum \nsamples taken from patients with ovarian cancer and those from \nunaffected individuals.\n  However, this research finding was only a first step. Before the \nscientific community will agree that protein screening is an accurate \nand beneficial tool, additional multi-institutional trials must be \ncompleted.\n  Patients would certainly be more willing to be tested if all that it \ninvolved were a simple, finger-stick blood test, thus eliminating the \nneed for surgery, biopsy, or other painful, invasive, or risky \nprocedures. The critical advantage of such as screening test is early \ndetection, finding the disease when it is most treatable. Of course, \nearly detection of ovarian cancer will save health care costs, but, \nmore importantly, it will save lives.\n  This is why I am submitting this resolution. Our resolution \nencourages the Department of Health and Human Services to rapidly \nevaluate the efficacy of this cutting-edge work in the area of testing \nfor ovarian cancer. If the screening tests are proven effective, the \npublic must have the widest\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\npossible access to them. Toward that end, the resolution provides that \nthey be covered by Federal health care programs and group and \nindividual health plans.\n  Representatives Steve Israel, and Rosa DeLauro, both tireless leaders \non cancer research and health issues, introduced this resolution, in \nthe House of Representatives. Through their efforts and bi-partisan \nsupport, H. Con. Res. 385 was passed by the House of Representatives on \nJuly 22.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 510, H.R. 4687.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4687) to provide for the establishment of \n     investigative teams to assess building performance and \n     emergency response and evacuation procedures in the wake of \n     any building failure that has resulted in substantial loss of \n     life or that posed significant potential of substantial loss \n     of life.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, today the Senate will consider H.R. \n4687, the National Construction Safety Team Act. The Senate companion, \nS. 2496, was introduced by Senators Clinton, Schumer, Lieberman, and \nDodd, and is currently pending before the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, which I chair.\n  At the urging of our colleagues, particularly Senator Clinton, the \ncommittee has agreed to move the House version of the legislation in \nthe hopes\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\nthat action on this bill might be completed by September 11. The \ncommittee has worked to accommodate those requests to move this bill. \nIn that effort, the committee has made some changes to the bill to \nclarify its purpose and to address some technical issues.\n  The National Construction Safety Team Act would provide for the \nestablishment of investigative teams to assess building performance and \nemergency response and evacuation procedures in the wake of any \nbuilding failure that has resulted in substantial loss of life. The \nbill seeks to address several problems identified as a result of the \ncollapse of the World Trade Center Towers. For example, no Federal \nagency is clearly charged with investigating building failures. The \nbill would solve this problem by giving the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, NIST, clear responsibility to handle such \ninvestigations. Further, there are currently no guarantees that \ninvestigations will begin quickly enough to preserve valuable evidence. \nThe bill would require NIST to act within 48 hours of a building \nfailure. In addition, no Federal agency has the investigative authority \nneeded to ensure access to a building's structural information. \nTherefore, the bill would provide to NIST clear authority to enter \nsites, access documents, test materials, and move evidence, as well as \nclear authority to issue subpoenas. Finally, there is no mechanism for \nkeeping the public informed of the progress of an investigation. The \nbill would require NIST to provide regular public briefings and to make \npublic its findings and the materials that led to those findings.\n  I would like to enter into a discussion with my friend Senator \nMcCain, the ranking member of the committee, regarding the provisions \nin the bill relating to a construction safety team's final report and \nmembership.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee. When a \nconstruction safety team issues its report on the likely technical \ncause for building failure, along with recommendations under Section 8 \nof this legislation, it is my understanding that any strongly held \nminority or dissenting views would also be included in that report. I \nbelieve that is the committee's intent.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The ranking member is correct. While it is our hope \nthat teams would be able to issue a consensus report, the committee \nurges the Director of the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, when setting the procedures to govern construction safety \nteams, to ensure that any such minority or dissenting views are \nincluded in any report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would also like to clarify an issue regarding the \ncomposition of a safety team. It seems appropriate to permit employees \nof Federal agencies to serve as members of construction safety teams. \nAnd certainly in the event that a construction safety team investigates \nthe collapse of a Federal building, a representative from the General \nServices Administration should be included on the team.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree that is the committee's intent. I thank Senator \nMcCain once again for his cooperation in this matter and urge the \nSenate to pass this legislation, as amended.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4514\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the establishment of investigative teams to \n   assess building performance and emergency response and evacuation \n  procedures in the wake of any building failure that has resulted in \n    substantial loss of life or that posed significant potential of \n                       substantial loss of life)\n\n  Mr. REID. Senator Hollings has a substitute amendment at the desk. I \nask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered and agreed to; \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; the bill, as amended, \nbe read the third time and passed; the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and that any statements and colloquies relating to this \nmatter be printed in the Record, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
