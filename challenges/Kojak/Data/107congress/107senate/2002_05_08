Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the conference \nreport on the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act--the farm bill of \n2002.\n  We must have a strong and solid commitment to our family farmers, and \nwe must have a farm bill that provides this foundation. Simply put, \nthrough the miracle of modern day agriculture our farmers and ranchers \nprovide significant and mostly unappreci-\nated support for trade, jobs, our Nation's balance of payments; they \nserve as a catalyst for our Nation's economy and provide American \nconsumers with the most plentiful, inexpensive, and safe food supply in \nthe history of the world. So a good farm bill is essential to every \nAmerican citizen. The authors of the pending bill have tried to do this \nwith myriad commodity, conservation, nutrition, research, and many \nother programs. I thank them for their efforts.\n  Throughout my career as a Senator, Congressman, and congressional \nstaffer, I have had the privilege to work on no less than six major \nfarm bills and numerous pieces of smaller legislation. I must say that \nfrom a policy and process standpoint, this farm bill has certainly been \nunique.\n  I have always believed we should not play politics with a bill that \ndirectly affects the daily lives and pocketbooks of our farmers, \nranchers, our consumers, and, yes, even the taxpayer, and those who are \nhungry and malnourished. That is why I have supported bills written by \nboth Democrats and Republicans.\n  In my view, a farm bill should have two primary goals:\n  First, to provide assistance when needed to those who produce the \nfood for our Nation and a troubled and hungry world. That assistance is \nneeded now given the near revolutionary and dynamic changes we face in \nagriculture today. Put in Dodge City language, the farmer and rancher \ntoday are not in very good shape for the shape they are in. These are \ntough times in farm country.\n  Second, the bill should provide this assistance through a realistic, \nreasonable, and predictable farm program\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\npolicy consistent with the harsh realities of what we face in the \nglobal marketplace. I regret to say that I fear this bill fails on both \ncounts.\n  There are other very important goals that should be and are addressed \nin this farm bill. These include dealing with the environment, \nnutrition, research, and the new threat of agriterrorism. But my \nconcern is with the commodity title.\n  In this bill we have a real paradox. Those who have seldom or never \nvoted for farm bills in the past during their long years of \ndistinguished service and have made it a practice to regularly \ncriticize previous farm bills have written this bill and have \nproclaimed it to be the best bill ever written and they are going to \nvote for it.\n\n  On the other hand, some who have voted for farm bills in the past, \nthis Member included, knowing no farm bill is perfect or written in \nstone--knowing that the final product is never the best possible farm \nbill but the best bill possible--will vote no.\n  I make these comments without questioning the intent of any Senator \nor House Member who believes this bill is the ``best ever'' and, I \nmight add, who worked very hard through great difficulty to produce \nthis bill. I salute their hard work and tireless efforts but \nrespectfully disagree with their conclusion.\n  However, due to what I consider serious flaws in the bill, I cannot \nvote for final passage of this conference report. I do not believe the \nbill before us gets the job done for farmers and ranchers in Kansas and \nin other parts of the country.\n  In saying this, I pledge to my colleagues and my farmers and ranchers \nthat whatever concerns I have with this bill, I will work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to help make improvements when \nthey are needed. In fact, this bill is a fate accompli, it will pass \ntoday and the President will sign it. As least for now, the support for \na supplemental is not there. The bill should not be delayed any \nfurther.\n  Now, there are some good things in this legislation--including some \ninitiatives I have supported.\n  These include: Equalization of the sorghum loan rate to the corn \nrate; permanent authority for LDPs on grazed out wheat; a beneficial \ninterest fix for LDPs on the 2001 crops; expanded funding for the \nenvironmental quality incentives program, a most important program for \nour livestock producers; more equitable food stamp benefits; and most \nimportantly, research program authorizations that will allow us to \ndevelop the tools needed to protect agriculture and our food supply \nfrom terrorist threats and to expand carbon sequestration research to \nenable the farmer to be a partner in the challenge to reduce global \nwarming.\n  However, as I said, it is the commodity title that raises serious \nconcerns for this Senator.\n  First, there is the timing of this bill and the proposed assistance. \nWe are spending nearly $48 billion in new funding over the next 10 \nyears for our commodity programs.\n  Some argue this investment is supposed to ``restore the safety net'' \nfor our farmers and ranchers and eliminate the need for supplemental \nassistance in the future.\n  In fact, all programs considered, this legislation will add $73.5 \nbillion to the agriculture baseline which now totals an estimated $183 \nbillion with the new Congressional Budget Office scoring.\n  To say this represents a significant investment in our commodity, \nconservation, nutrition, and research programs is an understatement, to \nbe sure. I will leave the debate of how much is appropriate--given our \nbudget challenges and given the world farmers face; the world price \ndepression, lack of exports, market interference, unfair foreign \nsubsidization, weather, value of the dollar, and all of the other \nvagaries beyond the control of the farmer--to another time.\n  Mr. President, what is ironic is that due to the timing of payments \nin this legislation, the probability is--and I predict--we will be back \nhere later this year with Members and farm organizations asking for an \nadditional supplemental payment or disaster money.\n  My colleagues, we did not have to go down this road. Back in March I \nintroduced legislation that would have provided supplemental assistance \nwithin budget for this year's crop. It also would have provided \nconservation funding for several programs.\n  I introduced this package for two reasons: Our producers and our \nlenders needed some kind of certainty on the assistance they would \nreceive for this crop year, and second, virtually all planting and \nlending decisions had already been made for the 2002 crop, this year's \ncrop, and it did not make sense to change the rules of the game in the \nmiddle of the 2002 crop year. It made more sense to do an assistance \npackage this year and have the new bill apply to the 2003 crop after \nour producers and the Department of Agriculture had time to digest the \ndetails of the new bill.\n  The second concern: this is a complex bill, to say the least, and \nfarmers and ranchers and lenders and the USDA are going to feel and act \nlike a bear in a briar patch. We are going to do a new farm bill that \nwill require producers and USDA to work through a paper trail of \nrecalculated loan rates for every commodity in every county in the \ncountry, base updates, yield updates, and the list goes on.\n  Mr. President, the name of this bill should be the ``Farm Service \nAgency Full Employment Act''--exactly the opposite of the direction we \nhave been moving in recent years. As a matter of fact, sensing the \npaperwork and regulatory storm ahead, the USDA actually requested 100 \nmillion new dollars to enable the Farm Service Agency folks to come to \ngrips with and administer the new program. They got $55 million by the \nway. There are going to be some long lines at the Farm Service Agency.\n  Third, and this is a primary concern, when producers find out the \nfinal details regarding the so-called safety net, it will not be what \nthey expected due to the form of assistance and the timing. That is not \ngood.\n  Let's walk through an example:\n  We grow a tremendous number of crops in Kansas--wheat, corn, sorghum, \nsoybeans, and even a projected 80,000 acres of cotton this year. When \nit comes to actual planted acres, wheat remains king in Kansas.\n  Under the supplemental package I introduced, wheat producers would \nhave received 59 cents a bushel on this year's crop. This payment would \nhave occurred before the end of September. We need this money. We are \nin the midst of a drought in wheat country and we need the assistance \nnow.\n  If a wheat producer receives the maximum countercyclical payment \navailable under this proposed farm bill, he or she would receive \nadditional, combined direct and countercyclical payments on the 2002 \ncrop of 60 cents--about the same thing. But they would not receive the \nfinal payment until at least 13 months from now on June 1, 2003.\n  Let me say that again: wheat producers would not receive their final \nassistance on the 2002 crop until June 1, 2003. For cotton, it would be \nAugust 2003 and for corn, soybeans, and sorghum it would be September \n2003--a full 16 months from now.\n  How can this happen?\n  Under this proposed legislation, the maximum level of decoupled \npayments for this year's crop would be 60 cents provided as follows: \nsix cents for an additional direct payment as soon as practicable by \nthe Secretary; up to 19 cents--35 percent of the countercyclical \npayment--by October 31; assume an additional 19 cents--the difference \nbetween 70 percent of the total projected payment and the October \npayment--to be paid after February 1, 2003; and the remainder, \napproximately 16 cents--after June 1, 2003. Now, does that sound just a \nbit confusing? That is because it is.\n  It will take four checks from the Government for producers to receive \nwhat they could have received from one check under a supplemental this \nSeptember.\n  This is not market driven; it is mailbox driven.\n  They will not receive the last payment for this year's crop, the 2002 \ncrop, until they are harvesting next year's crop, the 2003 crop.\n  Just as important, the bill fails to provide assistance to producers \nwhen they need it most--when there is no crop to harvest.\n  We have gone back and checked the average marketing-year prices for \nwheat, according to USDA, on every crop from 1982 to 1999; some 17 \nyears in Kansas.\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\n  In 9 of those years there would have been no countercyclical payment \nfor wheat had this bill been in effect. These dates would have included \nthe following crops: 1982, 1983, 1984, 1988, 1989, 1994, 1995, 1996, \nand 1997.\n  Unfortunately, 1995, 1996, and 1989 represent what were basically our \nworst wheat crops in the past 20 years in Kansas. And the other 6 years \nrepresented some of our most marginal crops and difficult financial \ntimes.\n  The question is, why on earth should anyone from Kansas or a similar \nState support a bill that would not have producers of their State's \nnumber one crop in nine out of the past 17 years! A farm bill that \nwould not work over half the time in the last 17 years, why support \nthat?\n\n  Some will argue that producers may actually receive more assistance \nthis crop year under this proposed legislation because of higher loan \nrates. That may be true--if a producer has a crop to harvest.\n  But the producer who has no crop to harvest gets no benefit from a \nhigher loan rate. Again, this is a major concern for many of my Kansas \nproducers suffering from drought conditions.\n  We have had many reports that this year's Kansas wheat crop has the \npoorest condition rating since the 1996 crop year. Producers are saying \nthey have already destroyed or will destroy 200 acres, 500 acres, 1,000 \nacres, even 2,000 acres of wheat.\n  Let me report to my colleagues I have just returned from Dodge City \nand wheat country this past weekend. I checked the country around Dodge \nwith a long-time friend and farmer and that is precisely what is \nhappening.\n  The only thing you saw was the dust rising behind the tires because \nthere was no crop left.\n  These farmers are begging that we give them the supplemental package \nbecause the increased loan rate is going to provide them nothing when \nthey have been wiped out.\n  In addition, there are long standing policy concerns with the loan \nrate as well. And that brings up an additional concern, that of our \ntrade and export policy. The increase in loan rates is not market-\noriented. We are moving down a road that will drive production, lower \nprices, and reduce our negotiating leverage in international trade \nnegotiations.\n  I realize, appreciate and understand the advocates of higher loan \nrates always argue they will bring higher prices. However, as they lead \nto increased plantings and production, they will actually drive prices \nlower. I would remind my colleagues that the highest loan rates of the \nlast 20 years for wheat were from 1982 to 1986--during the height of \nthe farm crisis of the 1980s.\n  Additionally, a few questions need answers on this issue of loan \nrates. Why did rice and cotton get to keep their current loan rates, \nand why do loan rates for the other crops drop in 2004? Does this \nrepresent just a tad bit of politics? I hope not.\n  The risk of retaliation and reduced leverage in international trade \nnegotiations is real. For years we have argued that the walls and \nbarriers to trade be torn down by our international competitors.\n  With a ``free trade straight face'' in the past 2 months we have \nimposed tariffs on steel, we will pass a farm bill that increases the \nlikelihood of surpassing our spending limits under WTO rules, and we \nare going to pass country-of-origin labeling requirements that will \nupset many of our largest trading partners and just to make this whole \nbusiness really topsy-turvy, the majority is holding up expanding trade \nauthority for the President--the only way I believe we can regain \nmarket share price and income recovery over the long term. This does \nnot add up. This does not make sense.\n\n  I understand we do not write farm bills for Brazil, for the European \nUnion, or Canada, or any other country. But we should not write farm \nbills that guarantee trade retaliation either.\n  Let me stress another concern, and that is what we are robbing from \nin order to raise loan rates and expand farm program payments to new \ncommodities. We are paying for part of this bill by cutting spending of \n$2 billion from the major crop insurance program reform that we passed \n2 years ago, the Kerry-Roberts bill. That, too, just does not make \nsense.\n  As a final concern and comment on the commodity title, let us not \nforget all the promises we have made to farmers, to farm and commodity \norganizations--everyone in farm country--with regard to the need for a \nfarm savings account. Every farm and commodity organization has \nsupported this concept in resolution after policy resolution. I do not \nunderstand how we can include $94 million for payments to apple \nproducers and $10 million for onion producers--neither payment was in \nthe House or Senate bill--but we could not even include the pilot \nproject for a farm savings account that had bipartisan support from \nnumerous Senators.\n  Finally, giving credit where credit is due, this farm bill does \nemphasize conservation more than any other previous bill. Again, there \nmay be a conservation devil in the details. While we have increased \nspending for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program--EQIP that is \ncalled--to the benefit of many livestock producers, we are spending $2 \nbillion for a new conservation security program that no one truly seems \nto understand or can explain exactly how it will work. I hope it does \nwork.\n  With all the questions surrounding this proposal, an argument can be \nmade that this money could have been better spent through the EQIP \nprogram, additional research funding, or by designating more funding to \nthe trade title of this bill.\n  As we persevered through this farm bill debate over the past year, it \nwas my contention, voiced probably more than many wanted to hear, that \nwe should give some attention to policy and not just to dollar amounts. \nWith all due respect to my very dear friends and colleagues in the \nHouse and Senate, I just do not think we have considered all the long-\nterm ramifications of this legislation.\n  Farm bill policy and politics are never easy. We have strong \ndisagreements, but we all have the same goal in mind: Doing what is \nbest for our farmers and ranchers.\n  I had hoped as we wrote this bill and looked in the rearview mirror \nof the past, we would resist the temptation to return to those \npolicies. Sadly, we seem to have done a U-turn in the middle of our \nfarm policy road while other nations are moving more towards income \nprotection for their farmers and away from market-distorting price \nsupports. We are moving back again to price supports and away from \nincome protection, and none of us knows where that is going to lead.\n  This has been one of the most difficult decisions of my congressional \ncareer, but I cannot vote for a bill that would have provided no \ncountercyclical assistance to Kansas wheat producers in 9 of the last \n17 years, that will provide an additional direct payment of only 6 \ncents a bushel for wheat, 1.9 cents a bushel for corn, and 3.6 cents a \nbushel for sorghum, when Kansas producers, suffering from drought in \nmany areas, could have received payment of almost 60 cents, 33.4 cents, \nand 40 cents, respectively, on those crops if we had included a \nsupplemental assistance package for this crop.\n  I cannot vote for a bill that will not provide more than two-thirds \nof its badly needed countercyclical assistance for the 2002 crop until \n13 or 16 months from now, until 2003; a bill that increases loan rates \nwhen they do not benefit Kansas producers with no crop to harvest; a \nbill that cuts $2 billion from the Crop Insurance Program and that will \ngreatly increase the odds of the United States violating its world \ntrade agreements and entering into an agricultural trade war with some \nof our biggest competitors.\n  Despite these concerns, and my vote on this legislation, I pledge to \nmy farmers and ranchers, I pledge to my colleagues and those soon to be \nbeleaguered USDA employees, my assistance to work through these \ndifficult issues on a bipartisan basis. When this farm bill needs \nfixing--and it will--I will want to be part of the answer as opposed to \nsitting on the sidelines as a critic.\n  I ask unanimous consent a summary of questions I have received from \nKansas farmers, and answers my staff and I have prepared, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\n            Farm Bill Commodity Title Questions and Answers\n\n       1. Why did you vote against the Farm Bill?\n       Answer. I opposed the bill due to many concerns associated \n     with the commodity title. Specifically:\n       We are very dry in many parts of Kansas this year, and \n     producers may have little if any crop to harvest. Producers \n     need assistance now to meet their cash flow and pay their \n     bills;\n       I wanted to attach a supplemental package for the 2002 crop \n     to the Farm Bill that would have provided assistance quickly \n     while allowing USDA and producers time to implement and \n     understand the bill;\n       Instead of receiving the full level of assistance for the \n     2002 crop, producers will now have to wait 13 to 16 months, \n     and receive four different checks, to receive the same amount \n     of assistance;\n       A final counter-cyclical payment in June 2003 or even \n     September 2003 does not help you pay your bills in 2002;\n       A counter-cyclical program should provide assistance to \n     producers when they need it most. However, an analysis of \n     average marketing year prices for wheat in the 1982 to 1999 \n     crop years shows there would have been no counter-cyclical \n     payment for wheat had this bill been in effect. This \n     situation would have occurred for the crops in 1982, 1983, \n     1984, 1988, 1989, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997. This means \n     Kansas wheat producers would have received no counter-\n     cyclical payment in 9 of the last 18 years;\n       Higher loan rates do not provide assistance to producers \n     with no crop to harvest. Furthermore, they are market \n     distorting and impact planting decisions. We should provide \n     the money in guaranteed, direct payments;\n       The bill does not provide 70 percent more money for \n     payments to producers. First, the advertised increase in \n     funding represents the total increase above budgeted funding \n     for all USDA programs. Second, this figure does not include a \n     comparison to the supplemental assistance packages of the \n     last four years;\n       The average level of supplemental assistance in recent \n     years was $7 billion. This bill provides less than $5 billion \n     a year in additional assistance. Or, about $2 billion less \n     than we've been providing;\n       The bill cuts $2 billion from the bipartisan crop insurance \n     reforms we passed in 2000;\n       The bill significantly increases the odds the U.S. will be \n     found in violation of its WTO agreements; and\n       The bill provides direct payments for apples and onions but \n     eliminated a pilot project for the creation of Farm Savings \n     Accounts.\n       2. Will there be a supplemental AMTA payment this year?\n       Answer. No. There will be a very small additional direct \n     payment and new counter-cyclical program in its place. Both \n     are described below.\n       3. How much would I have received under Senator Robert's \n     supplemental proposal, and when would the payments have been \n     made to producers? What will the actual, additional, direct \n     payment for 2002 be under the new Farm Bill since there will \n     be no supplemental?\n       Answer. Under my supplemental proposal you would have \n     received a payment equal to the 2000 AMTA payment, and it \n     would have been made prior to September 30, 2002.\n       The payments for the 2002 crop under the supplemental \n     proposal would have been: Wheat--58.9 cents; Corn--33.4 \n     cents; Sorghum--40 cents; and Cotton 7.33 cent/lb.\n       Actual additional payment producers will receive in 2000 \n     under the new Farm Bill: Wheat--6 cents; Corn--1.9 cents; \n     Sorghum--3.6 cents; Cotton--95 cents; and Soybeans--44 cents.\n       4. When does this bill go into effect and how long does it \n     last?\n       Answer. The bill replaces the 1996 Act and applies to the \n     2002 through 2007 crops.\n       5. I see that loan rates have been increased. Does this \n     mean my loan rate on wheat will now be $2.80/bu, $1.98 for \n     corn, etc.?\n       Answer. Not necessarily. Under the previous bill, the \n     national average loan rate for wheat was $2.58. However, the \n     key words were national average. Some Kansas counties were \n     below the average while some were above. Loan rates will \n     still be calculated on a national average. Thus, we could \n     still have loan rates that are both above and below the $2.80 \n     national average in Kansas.\n       6. What will the loan rate be in my county this year?\n       Answer. USDA will have to recalculate the loan rate for \n     every commodity, in every county, prior to this year's \n     harvest. That means they have around 6 to 7 weeks to get the \n     job done for Kansas wheat producers. It also means this is an \n     opportunity for USDA to address discrepancies in rates across \n     state and county lines.\n       7. Are there any changes in the operation of the LDP and \n     marketing loan programs under this bill?\n       Answer. This program will still work as it has in the past.\n       The bill also includes a Roberts' provision that addresses \n     the best beneficial interest problem for producers of the \n     2001 crop. This will benefit approximately 350 Kansas \n     producers.\n       8. Does the bill include LDPs for 2001 crops harvested on \n     non-AMTA acres?\n       Answer. Yes.\n       9. Does the bill include eligibility for LDPs on grazed out \n     wheat?\n       Answer. Yes, this provision has been made permanent for the \n     life of the bill. Eligibility also continues for barley and \n     oats. One important addition for Kansas producers is \n     eligibility for grazed out triticale.\n       10. What are the national average loan rates for the \n     individual commodities we raise in Kansas?\n       Answer. Wheat is $2.80 in 2002 and 2003, falling to $2.75 \n     in 2004; Corn and Sorghum are $1.98 in 2002 and 2003, falling \n     to $1.95 in 2004; Soybeans are $5.00 for the duration of the \n     bill; Cotton is 53 cents/lb for the duration of the bill; and \n     Oats $1.35 in 2002 and 2003, falling to $1.33.\n       11. How does the counter-cyclical program work, and is it \n     coupled to production?\n       Answer. The counter-cyclical program is calculated on a \n     target price system and on base acreage, just like direct \n     payments, instead of production.\n       A producer may be able to get a counter-cyclical payment on \n     his base acres for a crop he did not grow in a particular \n     year, while he may not get a payment on a crop he actually \n     grew.\n       For Example: Assume a producer has a corn and wheat base \n     but grows cotton on 200 acres this year. If a payment is \n     triggered, the producer could collect a counter-cyclical \n     payment on wheat and corn, but not cotton.\n       12. What are the target prices for each crop and how is the \n     counter-cyclical program calculated?\n       Answer. Target Prices for Kansas commodities are as \n     follows: Wheat--$3.86/bu in 2002 and 03, rising to $3.92/bu \n     in 2004; Corn--$2.60/bu in 2002 and 03, rising to $2.63 in \n     2004; Sorghum--$2.54/bu in 2002 and 03, rising to $2.57/bu in \n     2004; Soybeans--$5.80/bushel for the life of the bill; and \n     Cotton--72.4 cents/lb for the duration of the bill.\n       The payments are calculated as follows: The higher of the \n     national avg. loan rate or the 12 month avg marketing price, \n     plus the direct payment level, subtracted from the target \n     price. The difference is the amount of the counter-cyclical \n     payment rate that will be received.\n       Example for wheat: Assume loan of $2.80, avg. market price \n     of $2.75, direct payment of 52 cents, and target of $3.86. \n     Since price is below $2.80, we use the loan rate in the \n     calculation.\n       The calculation is as follows:\n         (2.80) + (.52) = $3.32\n         (3.86) - (3.32) = 54 cents\n       Thus, the maximum counter-cyclical payment rate on wheat is \n     54 cents. If price goes above $2.80, the total amount of this \n     payment will fall.\n       13. What is the maximum counter-cyclical payment available \n     on each crop?\n       Wheat = 54 cents, Corn = 34 cents, Sorghum = 21 cents; \n     Soybeans = 36 cents; and Cotton = 13.73 cents.\n       14. What is the direct payment rate for each crop?\n       Payment rates for 2003 to 2007: Wheat = 52 cents; Corn = 28 \n     cents; Grain Sorghum = 35 cents; Soybeans = 44 cents; Cotton \n     = 6.67 cents; and Minor Oilseeds = .8 cents/lb.\n       15. Since the direct payment on wheat is 52 cents for 2002, \n     does this mean I get that payment on top of the 36 cents I \n     already received this year under the 1996 Act?\n       Answer. No, You will receive the difference between the \n     two, i.e., 6 cents. It will work the same for other \n     commodities. A producer that adds soybean or oilseed base \n     will receive the full payment because these crops have not \n     received payments in the past.\n       16. How much will I receive, and when will the payments be \n     made\n       Answer. You should receive your additional direct payment \n     as soon as possible. You will receive your counter-cyclical \n     payment as follows: Elect to receive up to 35 percent by \n     October 31. Receive the difference between 70 percent and the \n     October payment by February 1, 2003, The final portion of any \n     assistance will come at the end of the 12 month marketing \n     year for the crop. Wheat is June 1, 2003, Cotton is August 1, \n     2003, and corn, sorghum, and soybeans are September 1, 2003.\n       If USDA over estimates the early counter-cyclical payments \n     and the actual marketing year price is higher than they \n     projected you will have to repay the overpaid amount.\n       17. Will direct and counter-cyclical payments be made on \n     100 percent of my base acres?\n       Answer. No. Payments will be made on 85 percent of your \n     base acreage.\n       18. Will I have the option to update my base acres?\n       Answer. Yes. A producer will have three options for base \n     acres.\n       1. Maintain existing base acres.\n       2. Maintain current acres, but add your average oilseed \n     acres for 1998 to 2001 and reduce existing acres by a like \n     amount.\n       3. Do a complete update for all crops that will be the \n     average of your 1998 to 2001 planted or prevented from \n     planting acres. Key point here is that base update is based \n     on planted and/or prevented from planting acres, not \n     harvested.\n       Example of how this works:\n       Assume Kansas producer currently has 1000 acres of base \n     divided as follows: 600 acres wheat, 300 acres corn, 100 \n     acres grain sorghum. However, his 1998 to 2001 average \n     planted acres were: 400 wheat, 200 corn, 100 sorghum, and 300 \n     soybeans.\n       This producer can:\n       1. Keep the existing 1000 acre split.\n       2. Keep the existing 1000 acre split, but add soybeans. \n     Could be done as follows: Reduce the wheat acres by 150, corn \n     by 100 and sorghum by 50. Then add in 300 acres of soybeans. \n     He still has 1000 acres of base.\n       3. Update the entire farm to the 1998 to 2001 average for \n     the four crops.\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\n       19. Will I have the opportunity to update my base yields?\n       Answer. Yes. But only if you choose option 3 above, option \n     2 is not considered a base update, and the yield will only \n     apply for purposes of the counter-cyclical program. You must \n     keep AMTA yields for the purposes of calculating the base.\n       For the purposes of yield calculations a producer can:\n       1. Keep AMTA yields.\n       2. Take AMTA yields and add 70 percent of the difference \n     between existing yields and the average yield for 1998 to \n     2001.\n       3. Take 93.5 percent of the average yield for 1998 to 2001.\n       Example under option number 2: Assume producer has an \n     existing average yield of 25 bushel/acre for wheat and 100 \n     bu. for corn. Then assume that his 1998 to 2001 average \n     yields were 50 bushels for wheat and 200 bushels for corn.\n       Thus, the 1998 to 2001 average is 25 bushels higher for \n     wheat and 100 bushels higher for corn.\n       70 percent of each of these numbers is: (25 bu) (70 \n     percent) = 17.5 bushels; (100 bu) (70 percent) = 70 \n     bushels.\n       Thus, by applying 70 percent of the difference, the new \n     yields for the producer under this option would be 42.5 \n     bushels for wheat and 170 bushels for corn.\n       Example for Option 3. Use the same assumptions for yields \n     in the example above.\n       Take average yields for 98 to 01 times 93.5 percent; (50 \n     bu)(93.5 percent) = 46.75 bu, wheat; (200 bu)(93.5 percent) = \n     187 bu, corn.\n       These would be the new yields for that producer if he \n     chooses this option.\n       20. Can I update my base or yield for one crop, or do I \n     have to do it for all crops?\n       Answer. If you choose to update base and/or yield, it must \n     be done for all crops on the farm. You can not cherry pick.\n       However, you do not have to do it for all your farms if you \n     do it for one. Each individual farm will be treated \n     separately. If you have 5 farms you could do the following: \n     Farm 1--Keep current base and yield with no update; Farm 2--\n     Keep current base but add oilseed acreage; Farm 3--Update \n     Base, but keep current yields; Farm 4--Update Base, update \n     yields using 70 percent option; and Farm 5--Update Base, \n     update yields using 93.5 percent option.\n       If a producer has 30 farms, he will have to pencil it out \n     for each of the 30 farms and figure out what the best option \n     is for each farm.\n       Yes, producers and FSA are going to love this.\n       21. What happens if I want to update yields but I suffered \n     a crop loss in one of the years from 1998 to 2001?\n       Answer. In any year that your production fell below 75 \n     percent of the average county yield, you can insert this plug \n     into the equation for the purposes of your yield update \n     calculation.\n       22. What happens if I update my base using the 1998 to 2001 \n     average plantings of a crop(s) that I did not grow in 1981 to \n     85 when current direct payment yields were figured?\n       Answer. For all crops other than oilseeds, you would take \n     the yield of a similar farm in your area. In other words, if \n     your neighbor has an existing corn yield, you may be assigned \n     his yield, or something very similar.\n       Oilseed yields for direct payment purposes only are figured \n     by: Taking the 1981 to 1985 avg national yield of 30 bu/acre \n     for soybeans, divided by the 1998 to 2001 national average \n     yield of 38.2 bushels an acre. This basically equals 78.5 \n     percent. Multiply this number by your actual 1998 to 2001 to \n     get your yield for direct payment purposes.\n       Example: Assume producer has 1998 to 2001 average of 40 bu/\n     acre. Thus, using the calculation above his yield is: \n     (40bu)(78.5 percent)=31.4 bushels an acre.\n       23. Can you explain the actual timing of payments for the \n     next year or so?\n       Answer:\n       1. Additional direct payment on the 2002 crop as soon as \n     possible.\n       2. Up to 35 percent of counter-cyclical payment by October \n     31.\n       3. Producer option to take up to 50 percent advance of the \n     2003 direct payment on or after December first.\n       4. Difference between October payment and 70 percent of \n     counter-cyclical payment after February 1, 2003.\n       5. Remainder of counter-cyclical after end of 12 month \n     marketing year for each crop.\n       6. Remaining 50 percent, or full direct payment, for 2003 \n     crop after October 1, 2003.\n       24. When do I have to make a final decision on updating \n     base and/or yield?\n       Answer: The bill gives the Secretary flexibility in this \n     regard but indicates it should be done as quickly as \n     possible.\n       24. If I make one decision regarding updating, can I make a \n     change next year?\n       Answer: No. The decision made this year will stand for the \n     remainder of the life of the bill.\n       26. I want to try planting peanuts in western Kansas. How \n     will the new bill affect this decision?\n       Answer: The old peanut quota system is eliminated by this \n     bill. It is replaced by a marketing loan program that is very \n     similar to that in place for other program crops. All \n     producers will be eligible to participate in this program \n     regardless of where they are growing their peanuts.\n       27. Are there any payment limit changes in this bill?\n       Answer: Yes. A $2.5 million gross income limit will apply \n     to eligibility for the 2003 crop. A producer or entity is \n     only ineligible for assistance under this limit if less than \n     75 percent of their gross income comes from farming.\n       Beginning in 2002, the payment limits will be $40,000 for \n     direct payments, $65,000 for counter-cyclical payments, and \n     $75,000 for LDPs. The combined limits for a husband and wife \n     will be $360,000. Generic certificates remain in place for \n     the marketing loan program and the 3-entity rule remains in \n     place.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are endeavoring to get a list together \nin order of prospective speakers on the farm bill, to go back and \nforth. It is my intention, after I make a few comments, to recognize \nthe Senator from North Dakota. I assume then we will go over to the \nSenator from Arkansas. Then we will go back and forth as the day \nprogresses.\n  I feel constrained to respond, at least somewhat, to the comments \njust made by my friend from Kansas. I listened to his well-written \nspeech, and well-delivered speech. Frankly, I wonder if the person who \nmaybe had some input in writing that had been around over the last few \nyears.\n  I want to point out some of the errors that I believe were just \nmentioned. First of all, in the commodity section of the bill that we \nhave under the Freedom to Farm bill that was passed in 1996 there was \nno countercyclical payment, every year we had to rush in with emergency \nsupplemental payments, and it also capped loan rates. The only things \nit had basically were a capped loan rate and these AMTA payments.\n  The AMTA payments were based on unreal, optimistic assumptions that \nprices were going to be high forever and ever. Thus, every year we had \nto come in, rush in here, with emergency supplemental payments--every \nsingle year--because we had no countercyclical payments under that \nbill.\n  I just heard the Senator from Kansas say that in 9 of the last 17 \nyears somehow his Kansas farmers would not have gotten a payment under \nthe conference report we are debating. I do not know how that happens \nbecause the target price under this bill for wheat is $3.86. The only \nway that would happen in 9 of the 17 years would be if prices were very \nstrong. So in 9 of the last 17 years, if prices were high--the Senator \nis right, we do not give Government money if the prices are high. That \nwas the failure of the ``freedom to fail''--the Freedom to Farm bill, \nbecause what it said was: If prices are high, we are going to pay \nfarmers money, and if they are low, we are going to pay them the same \namount of money. That was the fallacy of Freedom to Farm.\n  What we are saying is, if prices are high, God bless you, that is \nwhat we want, the market is where the farmer should get his money.\n  I do not know the data of the last 9 of 17 years. But if his argument \nagainst this bill is that because of the commodity section, his \nfarmers, in 9 of the last 17 years, would not have gotten a \ncountercyclical payment, that can only mean then that in 9 of the last \n17 years prices were high, or at least higher than $3.86 a bushel minus \nthe fixed payment. I have my staff checking that right now because I \ndon't think that is the case.\n  I just looked here at the income protections. In the last farm bill, \nfor wheat, the income protection was $3.24 per bushel, including \nemergency supplemental payments. Under this conference report, it is \n$3.86 per bushel.\n  Let us take a look at the bill we are trying to replace, the 1996 \nfarm bill.\n  The prices paid by farmers for their inputs is this green line. The \nprices farmers have received for their crops is this red line.\n  When the 1996 farm bill was passed, the price farmers received was \ngoing up. Evidently, those in charge of passing that bill assumed the \nprices farmers received would continue to skyrocket.\n  After enactment of the 1996 farm bill, look what happened. Down it \ncame, and it is continuing to go down. That is the price farmers have \nreceived. The gap has widened between what they have to pay for inputs \nand what they get for their crops.\n  That is why this conference report is so necessary. I can only assume \nthat in urging the defeat of this conference report, the previous \nspeaker wants to keep on with the 1996 farm bill, fails to address the \ngap between cost of producing a crop and the price for that crop.\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\n  That is the choice we have today. Either adopt this conference report \nor stick with Freedom to Farm. That is the choice we have.\n  I think this graph illustrates why we have to turn the corner. Our \nfarmers can't continue to exist with the present Freedom to Farm bill \nany longer.\n  I wish to point out wheat growers, who are so prominent in the Plains \nStates.\n  Last year the loan rate was $2.58. The Secretary of Agriculture has \nthe authority to lower that level. Under this bill, the loan rate will \nbe $2.80 for wheat for 2002 and 2003. And the Secretary has no \nauthority to lower that.\n  I can't see how a wheat farmer will be better off with a lower loan \nrate compared with the $2.80 loan rate. It doesn't seem to make sense \nto me.\n  The other failing of the 1996 farm bill is that it really didn't do \nanything for conservation. This bill does a lot for conservation.\n  Look at the Conservation Reserve Program in the 1996 farm bill. It is \ncapped at 36.4 million acres; we go up to 39.2 million acres.\n  The Wetlands Reserve Program: 975,000 acre cap; we go up to 2.275 \nmillion acres.\n  Farmland Protection: $35 million for the life of that bill; we go up \nto $985 million.\n  The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, which is so necessary and \nwanted by our sportsmen--our hunters and fishermen: We preserve our \nNation's wildlife habitat. The 1996 farm bill had a measly $50 million \nfor the entire United States. We go up to $700 million over 6 years in \nthis bill.\n  For the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, the 1996 farm bill \nhad a total of $1.93 million for 7 years. We go up to $11 billion over \n6 years to help our livestock producers and crop producers meet \nenvironmental standards.\n  Again, those who would vote against this conference report would say \nlet us go back to the 1996 farm bill.\n  We have done so much more for these existing conservation programs in \nthis bill than was done in the 1996 farm bill.\n  Lastly, I point out that we have a new conservation program that \nwasn't in the 1996 bill: the Conservation Security Program, funded at \n$2 billion.\n  We also provide $600 million for Ground and Surface Water \nConservation. And the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program is so \nimportant in Plains States. It wasn't in the 1996 farm bill.\n  Agricultural Management Assistance wasn't in the last farm bill.\n  Desert Terminal Lakes was not in the last farm bill.\n  In terms of conservation, this bill takes a giant step forward in \nconservation, which is another reason why it should be supported.\n  The last farm bill that we are trying to replace basically had one \nleg. That leg was AMTA payments. No matter whether we have good prices, \nthere were AMTA payments.\n  This bill, in terms of commodity for farmers, has four legs: a target \nprice program; we have a loan rate which the Secretary cannot lower; we \nhave the direct payments; and we have conservation payments. So we have \nfour legs to the stool for our farmers, producers, and ranchers.\n  Lastly, I am amazed at how many people who supported the Freedom to \nFarm bill said it was the best thing ever and are now telling us they \ncan't wait to get rid of it. They can't wait to get a new farm bill. \nHow many times have I heard from those who supported the Freedom to \nFarm bill that we need this new farm bill, we need it now, we are \nwaiting too long, and we have to have it now?\n  This bill was before us 5 months before the Freedom to Farm bill \nexpired. I point out that the Freedom to Farm bill didn't pass until 6 \nmonths after the previous Freedom to Farm bill expired.\n  We have done our work in a manner that I think benefits this whole \ncountry. As I have said many times, can I defend everything in this \nbill and say it is perfect? No. But when you look at this country, at \nthe South, the Northeast, the West, the Midwest, and when you look at \nnutrition programs, the last farm bill didn't even have a nutrition \nprogram. Yet we have put in $6.4 billion in new spending for nutrition \nprograms in this bill. The last farm bill didn't even have one.\n  We have covered those who need help and who need food to make sure \nthey do not go to bed hungry at night. We have covered that.\n  We have a new energy program in this farm bill.\n  We need this farm bill now. We need it now, and we can't send this \nback to conference. If this bill fails today, there will be uncertainty \nfor our farmers. They need this bill, and they need it now.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, after consultation with the ranking \nmember, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nrecognized in this order and for the amount of time stipulated: Senator \nDorgan be recognized for 20 minutes; after that, Senator Brownback for \n10 minutes; after that, Senator Hutchinson for 15 minutes; then Senator \nHollings for 10 minutes; Senator Feinstein for 10 minutes; and Senator \nThompson for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor the work they have done. I know there are differences of opinion on \nthe floor of the Senate about this farm bill.\n  Let me say that I intend to vote for this farm bill. It is not a \nperfect piece of legislation by any means. I will talk about some of \nthe shortcomings. But it is far better than current law.\n  The current Freedom to Farm law is a very flawed piece of \nlegislation. It was always a flawed piece of legislation. It required \nus every year to come in with an emergency piece of legislation to try \nto deal with the problems in Freedom to Farm.\n  Is what is brought to the floor of the Senate today a much better \napproach than Freedom to Farm? The answer is clearly yes.\n  But it is always interesting to me that people in dark suits who \nshower before they go to work will come to the floor of the Congress \nand talk about the economic future of people who wear work clothes and \nwho shower at the end of the workday. These are family farmers. They \nwork hard. They live on hope--hope that they will be able to raise a \ncrop, have some livestock, survive a season, and go to market and make \nsome profit. They live on that hope. Most of all, they work very hard. \nAnd they live in a world in which more and more people are hungry.\n\n  We are told half a billion people go to bed every night with an ache \nin their belly because it hurts to be hungry. Our farmers take their \ngrain, in a 2-ton truck, to an elevator, grain which they had planted \nin the spring and nurtured, which they go to sell in the fall.\n  After they planted those seeds, they worried that it would not rain \nenough, they worried it might rain too much, they worried it might hail \nor that disease would come or the insects would eat that crop up. If \nthey are lucky enough to survive all of those things that nature puts \nin the way of a good crop from time to time, then they put this grain \nin a truck and drive it to the elevator. They are then told: Oh, by the \nway, this food you produced isn't worth anything. And the family farmer \nscratches his or her head and says: But we have a hungry world. Most of \nthe people in the world need food. Why is our grain a product without \nvalue? And the grain trader says: It is worth what the market says.\n  Farmers would much sooner get their money from the marketplace than \nfrom a safety net proposed by the Federal Government. But the fact is, \nthe marketplace has collapsed. Almost immediately after passing the \nFreedom to Farm bill, the marketplace collapsed, and stayed collapsed. \nFamily farmers are not able to survive with the current price structure \nin the market, so\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\nwe are trying to build a bridge over those price valleys.\n  That is what this is about: for family farmers to get from here to \nthere. I mentioned, they survive on hope. All of us who have a lot to \ndo with family farmers understand that hope. Against all odds, they put \nall they have into the ground in the spring, hoping they will be able \nto harvest a crop in the fall and get a price for it. Increasingly, in \nrecent years, the answer has been, they have not gotten a price for it.\n  They know, and we know, that we add one New York City in population \nto this world's population every 30 days. Let me say that again. Every \n30 days, we add the equivalent of the population of New York City to \nthis Earth. Those are mouths to feed, people who need food. Yet our \nfarmers are told that which they produce in such great abundance is \nwithout value. They understand, and I understand, there is something \nfundamentally wrong with that.\n  The question for our country is not whether we produce the food, the \nquestion is how we produce it. Corporations could produce food for our \ncountry by having corporate farms stretching from California to Maine. \nThey could start with a big tractor in the morning and plow until the \nSun goes down, and then plow in the other direction back the next day. \nYes, they can do that. They can produce food. And what you would do is \ntake all those family farms off the land and change the culture and \nchange the economics of what we do in this country.\n  So the question for this country is, Do we want family farmers in our \nfuture? Do family farmers provide value to our country? Well, I think \nthey do.\n  In this age of terrorism, we worry about bioterrorism in our food \nsupply. What better way to defend against that than to have a broad \nnetwork of family producers producing America's food? How easy would it \nbe to introduce an agent of bioterrorism in a feedlot with 100,000 \ncattle? How much more difficult would it be with a broad network of \nfood producers, families out there living under the yard lights who are \nrunning their operation, to provide livestock and grain for \nthe marketplace? So, for food security, to combat bioterrorism--yes, \nthis makes sense. Preserving a network of family farms is an investment \nin this country's future. There are also cultural and economic reasons \nfor us to care about whether we have people in this great country of \nours out there living under the yard lights and farming a family farm.\n\n  Europe has already made that decision. People come to the political \narena in this country disparaging Europe, saying they spend so much on \nfamily farming. Europe has been hungry and is determined to never be \nhungry again. As a result, they have decided they want family farmers \ndotting the network of rural areas in Europe. The result of this \ndecision is, family farms do well in Europe. Small towns do well in \nEurope. Small towns are alive on weekend nights in Europe. Why? Because \nEurope has already made the decision that we should make; and that is, \nfamily farmers are important and they matter to this country. They \nprovide an economic and a cultural component to this country that we \ndesperately need.\n  There is no one in this Chamber who got up early and milked a cow \nthis morning. I am safe in saying that because I am looking at staff \nand Senators. No one in this Chamber, within recent days, has gassed up \na tractor and tried to plow a straight furrow or seeded some wheat or \ncorn. So, we don't have such a big stake in this. We just wear blue \nsuits and come to work every day and talk about policy. But there are \npeople whose very economic lives are at stake with respect to the \ndecisions we are going to make in the Congress.\n  I had a call from a woman from North Dakota who wept on the phone, \njust sobbed uncontrollably. She said she and her husband married just \nafter high school and they wanted to farm. That is what they wanted to \ndo, take over her husband's dad's farm, and they did. She said: We \nfarmed for 20 years, and now we are being put out of business because \nprices were not good enough for us to be able to make it. They were \nactually milking cows, which is one of the hardest things you do on the \nfarm, day in and day out, seven days a week.\n  She said: We didn't go to town on weekend nights. We didn't spend \nmoney in a foolish way. She said: I told my daughter in junior high \nschool that I couldn't buy that new pair of jeans she needed for the \nstart of the school year because we didn't have the money. Now the bank \nsays we are out of business. All we know is family farming. We put our \nlives into this. It wasn't our fault that commodity prices collapsed. \nIt just wasn't our fault. She said: Mr. Senator, what do we do next? \nWhat can we do now?\n  There are people like that all over this country, wondering why the \nmarketplace says to them that what they produce, in such a prodigious \nquantity--the best quality food in the world--is judged valueless by \ntrade.\n  As a result of a lot of those kinds of concerns, we put together a \nsafety net. The safety net we had for the last 6 or 7 years has been a \ndisaster itself. It has been an awful farm bill. As the Senator from \nIowa said, every year we have to come to the floor to put together some \nsort of emergency bill to deal with it. It is like patching a big inner \ntube. Every year we know there is a big hole in this tube, so we just \nslap a big patch on it called an emergency plan. And we have done it \nevery single year. Why? Because the current farm bill has been \nworthless, just hasn't worked. So we tried to make something of it by \ndoing emergency legislation every single year.\n  The legislation that is brought to the floor of the Senate is not \nlegislation I perhaps would have written. I would have had a higher \nloan rate for wheat and feedgrains. We had to compromise with the House \nof Representatives. This loan rate is not as high as it was when it \nleft the Senate. I regret that. But it is a darn sight higher than \ncurrent law. Above that loan is a countercyclical piece, so the safety \nnet is better, far better, than current law for our family farmers.\n\n  In North Dakota, it is estimated that in this year--2002--this bill \nwill mean about $273 million in additional farm income above the \ncurrent Freedom to Farm law. So in my State alone, this year, $273 \nmillion goes to family farmers. But, it also shows up on every main \nstreet in North Dakota to support jobs, because almost 40 percent of my \nState's economy is dependent upon agricultural.\n  So this bill has a safety net. While not perfect and not one I would \nhave perhaps written myself--I would have been more generous and \nprovided a stronger safety net--it does have a safety net that is much \nbetter than current law.\n  This bill has other things that I think are important. We include \npulse crops for the first time: chickpeas, dried beans, lentils. These \ncrops will have a loan rate under this bill. That is very important in \nterms of crop rotation and the opportunity for farmers to deal with \ncrop disease problems.\n  So this bill adds something we have not had before, which I think is \nvery important to family farmers.\n  It also has country-of-origin meat labeling, which we have been \nfighting to get for a long while. I believe that is an important step \nforward so that consumers understand what they are eating and where it \nis from. I think the country-of-origin meat labeling is an important \npiece, especially for livestock producers.\n  There are some disappointments to this bill. When we passed this bill \nin the Senate, we included a payment limitations amendment by a 2-to-1 \nmargin. That was my amendment with one of my colleagues. We included \npayment limitations, but it was knocked out because the House of \nRepresentatives would not accept it. I regret that. I say this: This \nissue isn't over. I know this is the farm bill, and this is where we \nshould put payment limitations, but we will come back and try to put \nthat amendment somewhere else.\n  I did not come here to talk about the value of family farming to this \ncountry's future to then see somebody who has 60,000 or 70,000 acres \nget $20 million over 5 years. That is not what I am fighting for. This \nisn't about corporate welfare. This is about helping family farmers \nwith a safety net during tough times. That is what a farm bill is for.\n  This issue isn't over. Payment limitations didn't get done in this \nbill because the House of Representatives wouldn't accept it. The \nadministration wouldn't support it either. But we will come back with \npayment limitations\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\nin some other form. Ultimately that will get done.\n  On balance, this is a farm bill that is worth voting for. I intend to \nvote for it. Some will say: Why do we need to do a farm bill at all? I \nhave heard many colleagues in the last couple days talk about their \nconcerns about this bill. If you care about entrepreneurship, if you \ncare about small business, if you care about independent-minded people \ntrying to make a living, you have to care about family farmers. They \nare the economical all-stars in this system of capitalism. It is just \nthat the marketplace has conspired to find a way to ruin their economic \nhope and opportunity.\n  Let me describe that. For every single thing a family farmer does, \nthey find that someone else makes the money and they get the burden. \nFarmers raise a crop. They want to put it on a railroad track \nsomeplace. They are going to get charged through the nose by the \nrailroad company for hauling that grain. In my State, they are going to \novercharge shippers by $100 million, according to our public service \ncommission. Why? Because you don't have rail competition. In my State, \nin most cases you have a choice of one railroad. The railroad says: By \nthe way, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer, here is what you will have to pay for \ntransporting that grain. If you don't like it, tough luck; there isn't \na thing you can do about it. So it is an issue of who has the muscle. \nIs it family farmers or railroads? The answer is railroads.\n  How about the chemical companies? The chemical companies say: Here is \nwhat you have to pay for chemicals. Who has the muscle? The chemical \ncompanies. How about the packers? Over 80 percent of all the packing is \ndone by three or four companies. They say to the ranchers and farmers: \nHere is the price; if you don't like it, tough luck. Who has the muscle \nthere? The packing companies.\n  How about the cereal companies? It is interesting that our farmers \nproduce rice and wheat and corn and all these products. You go to a \ngrocery store someplace and buy that product. You discover that someone \nelse took that wheat and rice and corn, and they popped it, and they \nshredded it, and they crisped it, and they puffed it. And guess what. \nAs soon as it shows up puffed or crisped or shredded, you pay a fortune \nfor it. The fortune has nothing to do with the rice or the wheat or the \ncorn. It has to do with the fact that somebody made a fortune popping \nit or crisping it. The farmer who produced it, the person who drove the \ntractor, the person who plowed the furrow and seeded the land gets \nvirtually nothing for it.\n  That is wrong. That is a system that is wrong. Why does it happen \nthat way? Because of economic muscle. We have had the growth and \nconcentration of virtually every area of enterprise in this country \nthat squeezes family farmers, squeezes them in a way that says: You \ncan't make it, but we will. Everyone makes a profit off that which \nfarmers produce.\n  In the area of international trade, our farmers have gotten taken to \nthe cleaners. It doesn't matter in which direction you look. Look to \nCanada, Mexico, China, Japan. They have gotten taken to the cleaners. \nUnfairly subsidized grain from Canada; stuffed molasses with Brazilian \nsugar coming down; high-fructose corn syrup being impeded going into \nMexico; a 70-percent tariff on wheat flour going to Europe; a 38.5-\npercent tariff on every pound of American beef going to Japan. In every \nsingle direction, our farmers have been taken advantage of in \ninternational trade. And the farm organizations and commodity groups \nout here--most of them, not all--are saying to the farmers that all \nthis trade is a good thing for them. No, it is not a good thing: They \ndon't understand, those groups doing that, the interests of family \nfarmers. They understand the interests of agrifactories. But that is \ndifferent from family farmers.\n\n  Our farmers produce more than food. They produce community. They \nproduce something very important to the economy and culture of this \ncountry.\n  I have spoken at length about family farmers. I come from a town of \n300 people. We raised horses and cattle, my father and I. The fact is, \nmy home county is bigger than the State of Rhode Island. When I left, \nit had 5,000 people; now it has 3,000 people. In that county there is a \nLutheran minister, a friend of mine, who said at her church she \nofficiates over four funerals for every wedding. That is the opposite \nof the movie, you know, ``Four Weddings And A Funeral.'' Here it is \nfour funerals for every wedding.\n  That says those rural areas are losing population. People are growing \nolder. Young people can't stay. That is the case because family farming \ndoesn't work under the current system. That is why you need a farm bill \nthat works, that says to family farmers: If you are going to be out \nthere on the family farm and risk everything you have to plant a seed \nand hope it grows and then try to market it to a hungry world, we want \nto help you.\n  That is what this bill is about. It is trying to help families over \ntough times. These tough times have lasted 6 or 7 years. There is no \nend in sight. The question for this country is, Do you want family \nfarmers producing America's food? The answer ought to be a resounding \nyes. Why? Because it is important to have a network of family producers \nproducing America's food.\n  There will be, and there was yesterday, substantial criticism of this \nbill. I could join in that criticism because I find several parts of \nthis bill wanting. It is strange for me to see those who authored what \nI think was the worst farm bill I have seen in decades, the Freedom to \nFarm bill, come out and criticize this bill. It was only 6 short years \nago when they stood on the floor of the Senate and said: We want to \ntransition farmers out of the farm program and into the marketplace. \nWhatever the marketplace says, God bless you, that is your future.\n  We knew better than that. The marketplace was going to squeeze \nfarmers until there were no family farmers left. That is exactly what \nhappened almost immediately after we passed the Freedom to Farm bill. \nThe Freedom to Farm bill, we are told, produced celebrations around \nWashington, DC, and the country by the largest agrifactory \norganizations and the big commodity organizations and others who make \nmoney off family farmers.\n  The chemical folks, the grain trade, they all had a great celebration \nbecause that was a great bill for them. But, it was a bill that \ndevastated family farmers. That is why year after year after year we \nhad to come back and pass emergency legislation to correct it.\n  This bill provides certainty, perhaps at a lower rate with respect to \nthe safety net than I would have liked, but a substantially higher rate \nthan the Freedom to Farm would offer family farmers. Freedom to Farm \nwas scheduled to evaporate after 7 years. It was called transitioning. \nI have been transitioned a few times. Family farmers know what being \ntransitioned means. They are flat sick and tired of this notion of \nbeing transitioned. What they want is the ability to make a living by \nproducing the best quality food in the world, doing it for a hungry \nworld, and getting a fair return on that which they produce.\n\n  Virtually every part of our economic enterprise in this country is \nconcentrated now with giant economic muscle so that it squeezes family \nfarmers out of our future. This bill provides some hope and some \ncertainty. This bill, and this bill alone at this point, will tell \nfamily farmers: We are on your side; this Congress wants you to \nsucceed; a safety net is worth doing; we believe in your future.\n  I intend to support this bill. While not perfect, it is dramatically \nbetter than Freedom to Farm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am from Parker, KS, a town of 250 \npeople. I grew up in the suburbs, a mile and a half out of town, on a \nfamily farm. My parents still farm on it. Mom and dad are full-time \nfarmers. My brother is a full-time farmer with my dad. My other brother \nis a veterinarian--large and small animals--near Lyndon, KS.\n  Farm bills are important to Kansas. They are important to my family.\n  I have been secretary of agriculture in the State of Kansas for 6 \nyears. My degree is in agriculture economics. I have been a farm \nbroadcaster; State president of the Future Farmers of\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nAmerica in Kansas; national vice president of the Future Farmers of \nAmerica, Central Region; traveled the country for the FFA. I have been \nin 4-H. I have farmed. I love it. It is a great place to have been \nraised, a great place for the family.\n  It is a tough place to make a living. It is difficult and has been \nfor the generations in my family who have been on the farm and \nstruggled. My grandfather is a farmer who started my dad in farming. My \ndad started my brother. That is pretty typical. Farm bills are \nimportant for my State. They are important to my family. They are \nimportant to this country. That is why I rise today with a great deal \nof disappointment about this farm bill, and I am not going to be able \nto support the conference committee's farm bill.\n\n  While I am deeply grateful to the conference committee and their \nefforts, their work, the hours they worked, their earnest desire to \nfind a workable compromise--I truly believe they had a deep desire to \nfind what is right and what is best for agriculture in this country and \nfor the family farmer--it is now clear to me that the conference \ncommittee did not learn some of the lessons from past farm bills, ones \nI have worked on, working closely with agriculture. It seems to me we \nare repeating some of the worst mistakes of past farm bills.\n  While opposing a farm bill for some may be an easy issue based upon \ncost or complexities of the issue, it certainly is a different case for \nme and a different case for somebody representing a great State such as \nmine, Kansas. Many hundreds of Federal programs affect American \nagriculture more than any arcane debate between beltway policy types.\n  This farm bill is important to Kansas. It is important to our State. \nOur State is heavily involved in agriculture. My vote against the \nconference report is a result of a careful and thoughtful analysis of \nwhat it will do.\n  As Senator Roberts, my colleague from Kansas, has already laid out, \nthis farm bill just is not good for Kansas's family farmers.\n  While I think these deficiencies have been outlined ably in nearly \nevery editorial page in the country, I want to highlight a few of the \nproblems that are of most concern to Kansas.\n  First, the farm bill program raises loan rates. First and foremost, I \nwanted to cite that. This has historically and consistently led to \noverproduction and lower prices. It is a fundamental issue of \neconomics. When you raise the price, where supply and demand cross is \nwhere the price is set; you raise your price or you raise your \nguarantee under that, you stimulate production, your production goes \nup, your demand does not go up in an equal amount, and your price falls \non the world market. We should not be content to relearn this lesson. \nWe have done this in past farm bills where we have artificially raised \nthe loan rate, increased production, and when we increased production \nand demand did not equal it, the price on the world market fell. We \nlower the overall price.\n  Let me give one example: the current soybean loan rate. Since the \nenactment of the 1996 farm bill, soybean acreage has risen steadily. In \n1996, we were at 64.2 million acres; in 2001, 76.7 million acres.\n  These increases are hardly because of increased demand for soybeans. \nMore likely they are attributable to an unusually high soybean loan \nrate of $5.26 relative to corn at $1.89, which is a price ratio of 2.78 \nto 1.\n  Do we want these Government signals not market signals to determine \nacreage? As we increase these loan rates significantly in many of the \ncrops across the board, we are going to raise the production, and we \nraise production, we lower the overall price, unless there is an \nequivalent demand increase.\n  This perverse incentive laid down by the Federal Government seems at \ncross-purposes with many other Federal programs intended to bring \nprices up, not down. How is it we can be simultaneously providing what \namounts to a subsidy to increase production while at the same time \nsubsidizing the market price? This is working at cross-purposes.\n  Not only are we tinkering with these price controls and hoping the \nGovernment gets it right this time, but we are taking a huge step \nbackwards in complexity and ease of use. I do not need to remind my \ncolleagues of the horror stories from farmers using farm services in \nthe years before Freedom to Farm.\n\n  Government bureaucrats with confusing and conflicting rules were the \nbane of a farmer's existence. Many of us heard of waiting in lines at \nthe Farm Service Agency or its precursor agency as well. This bill will \nput more bureaucratic elements into the farm operations again, \nsomething we tried to get away from. To the farmers' pleasure, we were \ngetting away from these lines at the Farm Service Agency. This cannot \nbe a good development. We have tried this route before, only to abandon \nit for something better. My dad and brothers do not like waiting in \nline at the Farm Service Agency, and they are not going to like it \nunder this proposal.\n  As we debate this measure in the Senate, an apparent fait accompli, \nour most important trading partners are preparing to challenge this \ninitiative before the World Trade Organization. Just as our Nation's \ncommitment to the free trade agenda has been brought into question, we \nhave renewed concerns that we are unwilling or unable to compete on the \nworld stage, and we can compete on the world stage.\n  Our U.S. trade agreements limit domestic farm supports most likely to \ndistort production and trade to no more than $19.1 billion per year. \nThere is little doubt under this bill we will exceed these limits.\n  In my past, I worked in the Trade Representative's office. These are \ncontentious issues and will be challenged by our trading partners. Mr. \nPresident, 96 percent of the world's consumers live outside the United \nStates. Kansas farmers and my family are dependent on these world \nmarkets for their livelihood. This bill will surely spur our partners \nto retaliate. If you want evidence of how this compromise will be \ngreeted by our friends around the world, just look at how our trading \npartners are reacting to the proposal. Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, \nand the European Union have all expressed serious concerns about these \nnew ``amber box'' programs. It is perhaps most telling that our friend, \nAustralia, a country committed to free trade as is the United States, \nhas pledged to lead the challenge to this initiative before WTO. This \nis a troubling development for Kansas farmers much of whose acreage is \ndedicated to international trade.\n  There is the matter of the supplemental AMTA payments on which many \nfarmers in my State are counting. As my colleague from Kansas, Senator \nRoberts, has pointed out, earlier this year we supported a supplemental \nassistance package for the 2002 crop and told our constituents any new \nfarm bill would apply to the 2003 crop. For 2002 crops, the compromise \nI supported would have provided an additional payment of 59 cents for \nwheat, 33.4 cents for corn, and 40 cents for sorghum.\n  Instead, producers will now receive an additional fixed payment of \n5.9 cents for wheat, 1.9 cents for corn, and 3.6 cents for sorghum. \nProducers will then be eligible for maximum--it could be less--\ncountercyclical payments on the 2002 crop of 54 cents for wheat, 34 \ncents for corn, and 21 cents for sorghum. But the producers will get a \ncheck for 35 percent of the payment in October, 35 percent of it in \nFebruary, and the last payment at the end of the 12-month marketing \nyear for the crop in 2003. This is simply not what we promised and what \nwill prove to be a serious burden for Kansas farmers this fall. They \nwould have gotten the lump sum come this fall. Now it is going to be \nbroken out over a 12-month period. This is something a number of \nfarmers were counting on and need this year.\n\n  Despite my concerns about many provisions in the farm bill, I do not \nwant to indicate all is lost with it. I am pleased to see some of the \nconservation provisions in the bill which I think are positive. \nSomething I and others have worked on--carbon sequestration--is in the \nbill. The pilot program for carbon sequestration will help us build a \nnew market for farmers--one that pays them for how they produce, not \njust what they produce.\n  Carbon sequestration is a largely untapped resource that can buy us \nthe one thing we need most in the debate on climate change, and that is \ntime. The Department of Energy estimates\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\nover the next 50 to 100 years agricultural lands alone could have the \npotential to remove anywhere from 40 to 80 billion metric tons of \ncarbon from the atmosphere. If we expand this to include forests, the \nnumber will be far greater, indicating there is a difference that could \nbe made by encouraging a carbon sink approach.\n  I am pleased with the work the conferees have made. I am not pleased \nwith the product. I believe we are taking a step backwards for farmers \nin our country, for freedom, for markets, and for what is best for my \nfamily and for what is best for Kansas farmers. This is an overly \ncomplex bill. It is not going to be helpful this year.\n  In future years, we are going to be looking at it and saying: Why are \nwe going back to something we knew did not work in the past? For those \nreasons, I oppose the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconference report of the farm bill. This bill has been a long time in \ncoming. The House of Representatives passed their version of the farm \nbill last October, and the Senate began debating the farm bill on the \nfloor of the Senate last December. Our farmers have been waiting for a \nresolution. Our farmers have been waiting for some type of certainty in \nfarm policy. This bill provides changes to our current farm policy that \nare desperately needed by our country's farmers. Since last year, \nfarmers have been waiting to see if they will be able to continue \nfarming as a way of life and a way of making a living. They have been \nhoping Congress will do the right thing and provide them with the \nsafety net they need to continue. Frankly, during the last year, many \nhave not survived the wait. Many have held auctions, sold out, and left \nagriculture. However, others have been able to withstand the \nuncertainty and have waited for Congress to pass this farm bill. So I \nthink it is long overdue.\n  Many of our rural communities revolve around agriculture--from seed \nand fertilizer dealerships to farm implement businesses and storage \nfacilities. These businesses have entire communities that rely upon \nwhat they do. Agriculture is essential to the local economies of these \nsmall towns and communities. This is true in much of my State of \nArkansas and throughout the country. In addition to businesses, the \nhealth of the agriculture sector directly impacts the viability of \nlocal schools and churches. Without assistance, these towns will \nquickly disappear, and these small rural communities will be lost, and \nnothing will be left but ghost towns.\n  This bill includes many features that will benefit producers, rural \ncommunities, scientific advancement, and the environment. Throughout \nthe long process--and it has been an arduously long process--there was \na constant awareness of where farm policy has had shortcomings in the \npast and the important role of a complete and comprehensive farm policy \nas our producers continue to compete in an ever more global \nmarketplace.\n  The three-part safety net composed of marketing loans, fixed \npayments, and the new target price counter-cyclical payments will \nprovide much greater stability for our country's farmers. That is what \nfarmers have asked for more than anything else--a degree of \npredictability and certainty in farm policy. This bill will provide our \nfarmers with the predictability and certainty that they need.\n  In Arkansas, many farmers have not been able to get loans, and they \nare in jeopardy of not being able to farm. Some bankers in my State \nhave been lending to farmers so they can get the crops into the ground \nsimply on faith that we will eventually act and get something approved \nfor them. After months upon months of waiting, and delay upon delay--\nthese bankers, frankly, have had a lot more faith than I have. After \nall this time, we finally have a bill that can go to the President and \nbe signed into law, and it is a bill that my farmers in Arkansas \nsupport. Time is of the essence, and to delay any longer will only \nserve to further complicate and muddle the implementation of this new \npolicy.\n  The time has come to pass the bill. Negotiations have been completed, \nand I think any effort to delay the passage of this bill is simply, at \nthis point, hostile and antagonistic to farmers and farm communities \nthroughout the country.\n  This bill, when it left the Senate floor, included some provisions \nabout which I was very concerned. In particular, I was concerned about \nthe provisions included on payment limitations. As this provision was \nwritten, it would have had a disastrous impact on farmers in my State. \nA study conducted by the University of Arkansas indicated that farm \nincome would have been reduced instantaneously by 25 percent had that \npayment limitation gone into place, and that as many as 40 percent of \nthe farmers in Arkansas would have been impacted by this provision.\n  In my opinion, including these limitations without any studies, \nhearing, or adequate understanding of the impacts was irresponsible and \nunfortunate. I am heartened and grateful to the conferees for \nexercising wise judgment in withdrawing and drastically scaling back \nthese harmful provisions.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I am concerned about any abuses of \nGovernment programs. However, to punish all farmers and ranchers in our \ncountry because of the abuses and excesses of a few is bad legislating.\n  In addition, forcing arbitrary limits on our farmers is equally \nirresponsible. Different crops cost different amounts to raise. Some \ncrops, such as rice and cotton, have very high input costs, which \nrequire these operations to become larger because they rely on \neconomies of scale to survive. But these crops also need support, and \nto set arbitrary limits without any regard to the difference in crops \nand input costs would be disastrous and particularly harmful to \nspecific regions of the country.\n  Farm policy, as I have learned through this process, is very complex. \nBut this bill represents a responsible and comprehensive approach. This \nbill includes many provisions that will assist the farmers in rural \ncommunities in Arkansas and throughout the country.\n\n  However, this bill does not have everything I would want. One area in \nwhich I am very disappointed in this bill is the forestry title. In the \ncommittee and on the Senate floor, I believe many meaningful \ncompromises had been reached, and foresters in Arkansas supported many \nof the programs included. Following the horrendous ice storms that hit \nArkansas nearly a year and a half ago, the need for new programs and \nnew funding mechanisms became apparent. I think it is unfortunate that \nconferees could not come to consensus on many of those provisions. It \nis my sincere hope that the Agriculture Committee will work quickly to \napprove these necessary forestry programs.\n  While many of the forestry programs included in the Senate version of \nthe farm bill would have benefitted foresters in many states, the \nHazardous Fuel Reduction Program was of specific interest to me, and I \nwas disappointed that it was not included in the final version of the \nconference report. I am sure many of my colleagues on the Agriculture \nCommittee also would like to see many of these provisions passed, so I \nlook forward to working with them to resolve this matter.\n  Despite my concerns with the forestry title, or lack thereof, I want \nto highlight some of the provisions in this bill that I believe will \nhave great benefits to our country. One of the conservation programs of \nwhich I have been a strong supporter in the past is the Wetlands \nReserve Program. This program has been used by farmers throughout my \nState and across the country to restore wetlands and enhance wildlife \nhabitat. This bill includes funding to increase the acreage cap for \nthis program to 2.275 million acres. This will allow an additional \nquarter million acres of wetlands to be enrolled in this important \nprogram each year through 2007. By expanding this program, marginal \nlands can be taken out of production. It is good for the environment, \nit is good for recreation and sportsmen, and it is good for reducing \nfarm production on marginal lands. Basically, it is a win-win for all \nof the stakeholders in agriculture.\n  Also, I was very pleased with the increase in the funding for the \nEQIP program. This program will provide much-\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\nneeded funds for our livestock and crop producers who will be trying to \ncome in line with increasing environmental requirements. This program \nwill benefit both producers and the environment. I believe the \ninvestments we make in this program will be repaid many times over in \nthe future by the increased environmental quality we will all enjoy.\n  In the area of trade, this bill will provide increases in funding for \nimportant programs such as the Market Access Program, the Foreign \nMarket Development Program, and the Food for Progress Program. Although \ntrade will not solve all of the problems facing our country's farmers, \nit is a critically important component of our national agricultural \npolicy. We are the world's leading producer of food and fiber, and it \nis essential that we work to open these new markets. The investments we \nmake in these areas will benefit our producers by providing new market. \nIn addition, these programs will benefit consumers all over the world \nby granting them access to some of the safest and most nutritious food \nin the world.\n  This bill also addresses a key challenge facing agriculture in the \nUnited States: the lack of young and beginning farmers. One of the \nreasons young people are not going into agriculture today is the \ndifficulty in gaining the credit that is required to start a new \nfarming operation. This bill provides a number of incentives to help \nyoung farmers get started. I think that is a great victory for the \nfuture of agriculture in our country. If we are going to continue as \nthe world's leading producer of food and fiber, we must have young \npeople getting involved. This bill reserves funds for operating loans \nfor beginning farmers. It also authorizes funding for a beginning \nfarmer and rancher development program to assist young men and women \nwho want to get involved in agriculture.\n  There has also been much discussion of the energy title of the farm \nbill. While I am wary of the creation of new programs, several of the \ncomponents in the energy title will provide whole new options for \nproducers in Arkansas. More and more farmers I talk to are interested \nin the possibility of getting involved in some form of renewable energy \nproduction, whether it is ethanol or biodiesel. Farmers recognize that \nthese products could provide new markets for their crops. In addition, \nit could help our country become more energy independent. The inclusion \nof this title will complement the work we completed two weeks ago with \nthe passage of the energy bill.\n  Finally, I am extremely pleased that the deceptive use of the term \n``catfish'' for fish of many different orders and families can no \nlonger be used to artificially boost sales of foreign fish at the \nexpense of our domestic producers.\n  Much of this issue has been misunderstood. It has been a provision \nthat has been attacked, I think, unfairly, by opponents claiming that \nwe were somehow trying to redefine the names of specific fish \ninaccurately. Not at all. With this provision, we were trying to end \nthe deceptive and economically destructive practice of mislabeling \nVietnamese basa, and I am very pleased that this provision was \nretained. This provision is one that I and many of my colleagues have \nfought hard for. This has been a difficult problem to fix, and I am \nvery pleased this bill will make the correction permanent.\n  This farm bill has been a long time in coming. I urge my colleagues \nto pass this conference report quickly so the USDA and FSA officials \nthroughout our country can get to work, finalizing the regulations and \nimplementing the new programs. They are going to have a big job ahead \nof them, and we need to let them get started immediately.\n  This bill has the potential to stabilize the farm economy, promote \nthe development of new markets, revitalize our rural communities, and \nmake our producers more competitive in the global marketplace. This \nbill is not the solution to all the challenges facing agriculture, but \nit does provide farmers with a safety net they need to hold their own \nwhile we work to open new markets and fight the lower foreign tariffs \nand barriers to trade. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nbill.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my staff, Michael Zehr and Robbie \nMinnich, both of whom have gone through their first farm bill. They \nhave worked long hours and done marvelous work as we have gone through \nthis process. I thank them for their hard work on behalf of Arkansas' \nfarmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the conference report on the farm bill and to express my \ngrave disappointment that this long process has resulted in a bloated \nand unbalanced bill that I simply cannot support.\n  I am disappointed because there are some components of this bill that \nwould help some farmers in Maine and that I strongly supported when the \nbill was under consideration by the Senate. For example, the conference \nreport includes funding for the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition \nProgram, as well as much needed assistance for our apple producers who \nhave suffered from low market prices. It includes conservation funding, \nmore money for the Market Access Program, and a national dairy program \nthat I will discuss in more detail in a moment. It also includes--\nthanks in large part to Senator Lugar--a nutrition title that would \nbring needed assistance to legal immigrants and more working families. \nThe problem is that all of these good programs, including the $17 \nbillion conservation title, add up to only about 25 percent of the \nentire $180 billion bill. It is the other 75 percent of the bill that I \nsimply must oppose.\n  My colleagues, particularly Senator Lugar, have described in detail \nwhy this bill is bad for our farmers and our Nation. I agree with their \nanalysis. This legislation perpetuates a dependency that leads to \noverproduction that is harmful to our land and ultimately to our farm \neconomy. I am disappointed to see the reforms begun in the last farm \nbill sacrificed in a frenzy of overspending.\n  This bill is both too expensive and unbalanced. It provides far too \nmuch in Federal subsidies for some of the Nation's largest \nagribusinesses and not enough for the small family farmers in my State \nand across the Nation. At a time when we as a nation are trying to \nshore up homeland security, provide a prescription drug benefit for our \nseniors, and safeguard Social Security, we can ill afford to spend more \nthan $180 billion on agricultural programs that benefit the few at the \nexpense of the many. How can we justify passing an 80-percent increase \nin farm spending when we are facing a deficit that could easily reach \n$100 billion or more this year? It is not responsible to pass this \nbill. We should send it back to conference and come up with a more \nreasonable proposal.\n\n  I am also concerned about the environmental implications of this \nconference report. While the increased conservation funding included in \nthe legislation is certainly a step in the right direction, the \nconference committee slashed the environmental spending by $4.2 billion \nfrom what was included in the Senate bill. I share the disappointment \nof the Sierra Club and other conservation organizations with the final \nversion of the bill in this regard. Faced with a choice of cutting \nconservation, forestry, and other modestly funded programs in this bill \nversus cutting the bloated commodity programs, the conferees \nunfortunately chose the former every single time.\n  While I am pleased that the conference report includes some modest \nassistance for Maine's dairy farmers, I am disappointed that the \nNortheast Dairy Compact was not reauthorized. The dairy compact \nprovided far more assistance to Maine dairy farmers and at no cost to \ntaxpayers. That is why I wish we had simply extended the Northeast \nDairy Compact, which was working very well at no cost to our Federal \nTreasury. The new program included in the bill provides less help to \nMaine's dairy farmers and at a high cost to taxpayers. I view this as a \ntemporary measure to help keep our dairy farmers solvent until the \ncompact can be reauthorized.\n  I am also deeply disappointed that the payment limitations that were \nincluded in the Senate version of the farm bill, and that Senators \nGrassley and Dorgan worked so hard to include, were not retained in the \nconference report. While there is a supposed cap of $360,000 in \npayments that any one farmer may receive, the conference report\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\nexempts the little known crop loan certificate program. The result is \nto create a loophole that will allow some of the Nation's largest \nagribusinesses to receive millions of dollars on top of already \ngenerous commodity crop payments. Thus, more than 60 percent of the \npayments authorized by this bill will go to fewer than 10 percent of \nour Nation's farmers. Many small family farmers will receive absolutely \nnothing at all from this legislation.\n  The farm savings accounts, which I worked so hard for, would have \nhelped our small family farmers, but regrettably once again they were \ndropped from the bill.\n  Finally, while this conference report is bad for the Nation, it is \neven worse for Maine and I strongly suspect other Northeastern States \nas well. Maine receives precious little from this bill's unprecedented \nlargess: 99.9 percent of the bill's funds will be spent outside of our \nState. In other words, for every $1,000 it costs taxpayers to fund this \nbill, only $1 will come back to Maine.\n  I recognize that Maine does not grow the program crops of the scope \nand scale found in other States, and in recognition of this fact I \nwould have been pleased to vote for a responsible farm bill that \nprovided for the vast majority of funds to go elsewhere. But in this \nbill I cannot help but feel that Maine and other Northeastern States \nhave been tossed a little bit of hush money and then asked to turn the \nother way while big agribusinesses raid the U.S. Treasury of funds that \nare sorely needed for education, prescription drugs, defense, and other \npriorities.\n\n  This is not a responsible bill. We can do better, and I hope the \nSenate will vote to reject the conference report.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about \nthe farm bill. I have been a strong supporter of Tennessee farmers \nsince I first came to the Senate, and I supported the 1996 Freedom to \nFarm bill, but I cannot support the conference report that is pending \nbefore the Senate. At a time when our country is fighting a war against \nterrorism, at a time when we are facing a deficit of up to $130 billion \nthis year, I believe it is irresponsible to spend an additional $82.8 \nbillion on farm subsidies on top of the $163 billion that we are \nalready slated to spend. To do so would be a disservice to the citizens \nand taxpayers of this country. In addition, this farm bill will likely \ncause us to violate our WTO commitments at precisely the time when we \nare trying to convince other countries to open their markets to our \nagricultural products. Most importantly, I believe that the farm \npolicies in this bill will hurt the very people that they are intended \nto help the small family farmers, by perpetuating the cycle of \noverproduction, depressed prices, and government subsidies that has \nmade our farmers increasingly dependent on government assistance.\n  Since 1978, Federal outlays to farmers have exceeded $300 billion, \nequal to nearly 10 percent of the Federal debt. In 2000, direct \ngovernment payments to farmers reached a record high $22 billion. The \nbill proposes to spend $82.8 billion over the existing baseline of \nagriculture spending over the next 10 years. This amount is almost $10 \nbillion above the already generous amount provided for farm spending in \nthe FY 2002 budget resolution. The total cost of this bill over the \nsix-year life of the bill is $248.6 billion. The expansion of the farm \nbill represents a 76 percent increase in agriculture spending.\n  This remarkable explosion in spending would be a cause for concern at \nany time, but it is especially alarming under current circumstances. \nOur nation is fighting a war against terrorism and our government is \nfacing potentially large deficits. In fiscal year 2002, we will spend \nat least $29.2 billion on homeland security. The President has proposed \nan additional $5.2 billion in his recent fiscal year 2002 supplemental \nspending request, which would bring total spending to nearly $38 \nbillion. The President's budget request for fiscal year 2003 proposes \nspending of $37.7 billion for homeland security. This amount is double \nwhat we were spending on homeland security items prior to the September \n11 attacks. The Brookings Institution recently recommended funding of \n$45 billion for fiscal year 2003 for homeland security. The truth is \nthat we don't have a good notion of how much homeland security spending \nwill cost in the coming years, but we know that the costs will be \ntremendous. As I mentioned earlier, we recently received new \nprojections from CBO that our deficit this year could reach $130 \nbillion. We have to recognize that the world has changed.\n\n  My concerns about this legislation, however, are not limited to its \ncost. I believe that this legislation returns to the failed farm \npolicies that were in place prior to the 1996 Freedom to Farm \nlegislation, and that the effect of these policies will be to make \nfarmers increasingly dependent on government subsidies. These policies \ndefy logic and they defy the most basic laws of economics. The \ngovernment sets a floor price for certain agricultural commodities that \nis higher than the market price in order to support growers of those \ncommodities. The result is that farmers know that they are guaranteed \nto receive a certain price regardless of market conditions, so they \nignore market signals and overproduce. The overproduction further \ndepresses commodity prices, leading to the need for ever increasing \ngovernment subsidies. We don't need to rely on economic theory to know \nthat this is true. The data show that our farmers have been caught in \nan ongoing cycle of overproduction, depressed prices, and increasing \ngovernment subsidies for decades. According to a study by the Heritage \nFoundation, farmers have responded to existing price floors by planting \nas many as 5 million additional acres of crops that are already \noverproduced. The farm bill before the Senate today will increase the \ntarget prices for these commodities and increase the amount of \nsubsidies that farmers can receive, which I fear will only exacerbate \nthe overproduction problem. Of the new spending in this bill, $56.7 \nbillion is to increase commodity payments. That's nearly 70 percent of \nthe new funds for agriculture. These kinds of policies do our farmers a \ndisservice by creating a situation in which market prices cannot \nrecover, forcing farmers to become increasingly reliant on government \nsubsidies. Under current farm programs, federal government subsidies \nalready comprise 50 percent of total farm income. This farm bill makes \nit impossible for farmers to move away from these subsidies.\n  Proponents of this legislation argue that we must provide these \nsubsidies to support small family farmers who would otherwise be forced \nout of business. However, according to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, 60 percent of America's farmers are ineligible for any \ndirect government assistance. Of the 40 percent of farmers who are \neligible for government subsidies, 10 percent receive two-thirds of the \nbenefits. That means that 4 percent of our nation's farmers receive \ntwo-thirds of all federal subsidies. In Tennessee, the top 1 percent of \nfarm subsidy recipients receive 43 percent of the payments. That means \nthat about 1100 of Tennessee's approximately 110,000 farmers receive \nnearly half of the payments. The top 10 percent of farmers in Tennessee \nreceive 84 percent of the payments. The bottom 80 percent of farmers \nreceive only 7 percent of the total benefits, averaging less than $700 \nper farmer. That is not right and it is unworthy of this Congress.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, the House version of the farm \nbill, which was less expensive than the conference report, would have \ncost $190 billion in taxes over the next 10 years and $271 billion in \ninflated food prices. The Taxpayers for Common Sense performed a cost-\nbenefit analysis of the Senate bill on a state-by-state basis using \neach state's share of total U.S. personal income taxes. According to \nthat analysis, over the next 5 years, under the Senate bill, Tennessee \nfarmers would have received average annual farm subsidy payments \nof $159 million, but Tennessee taxpayers would have paid $273 million \nto obtain it for a loss to the state of $115 million.\n\n  With this farm bill, we had an opportunity to provide a safety net \nfor our family farmers while moving towards a\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\nmore market-oriented approach. Senator Lugar has spent countless hours \non the floor of this Senate, not only explaining all of these problems \nwith the current system, but proposing effective alternatives that \ncould move us towards a more market-oriented approach while still \nmaintaining a safety net for our farmers. He proposed ideas such as \nproviding federal subsidies for farmers to purchase whole farm \ninsurance or providing matching funds for farm savings accounts. \nInstead, the bill before us represents a grab bag of regional special \ninterests. For the northeast, there is a newer, more expensive dairy \nprogram. Studies indicate that this plan will increase the cost of milk \nby 10 to 15 percent. For the southern coastal states, the farm bill \ncontinues the sugar program, which has raised the price of sugar in the \nUnited States to nearly eight times the world price. The Midwestern \nstates, as always, receive the overwhelming majority of the direct \ncommodity payments. I understand we have some contested elections going \non.\n  I am also concerned that this farm bill will set back efforts to open \nforeign markets to our agricultural products. Everyone knew the U.S. \nmarket for agricultural products is essentially saturated. The real \ngrowth opportunity is in exports, and the U.S. has consistently made \ndecreasing other nation's price supports and export subsidies a high \npriority in our discussions at the World Trade Organization. However, \nthere is a high probability that this farm bill will cause us to \nviolate our WTO commitments. In 1995, we committed to reduce our most \ntrade-distorting domestic farm support to $19.1 billion per year. We \nhave fulfilled that commitment, in part because the direct government \npayments provided under the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill were not related \nto price or production and were therefore not considered most trade-\ndistorting and were not subject to the $19 billion cap. The conference \nreport before the Senate today will decrease these non trade-distorting \nsubsidies and replace them with trade-distorting coutercyclical \nsubsidies. A report by the Food and Agricultural Policy Research \nInstitute concluded that there is a 30 percent chance that the U.S. \nwill exceed its WTO commitments in the 2002 marketing year. Now the \nconference report does give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority \nto make a determination that the U.S. is likely to violate its WTO \ncommitments and to lower farm supports, but that creates a situation \nwhere the law provides an entitlement for farmers, which they would be \ncounting on, and then the administration would have to come along and \ntake that money away. Everybody in this room knows that is not going to \nhappen.\n\n  It is unclear whether the U.S. will face immediate challenge on the \nfarm bill at the WTO. The European Union has issued conflicting \nstatements. However, it is clear that the passage of the farm bill has \nangered our trading partners and weakened our ability to negotiate for \ndecreases in agricultural support at the WTO. E.U. Trade Commissioner \nFranz Fischler said the bill:\n\n       . . . marks a blow to credibility of U.S. policy in the \n     WTO, where the U.S. has presented a trade-oriented agenda \n     wholly inconsistent with the new bill.\n\n  This farm bill undermines our credibility when we push for open \nagricultural markets and reduction of the support levels provided by \nother countries.\n  In conclusion, this farm bill spends an enormous amount of taxpayers' \nmoney at a time when we cannot afford it to the disproportionate \nbenefits of a few large farms producing a limited number of program \ncrops. I believe most farmers do not want forever to rely on Government \nsubsidies for their living and in increasing numbers and percentages. \nThey want to earn a living by producing their crops and earning a \ndecent market price for them. This legislation will make that more \ndifficult. In fact, it goes in exactly the opposite direction. It is a \ncallous document that can only be supported in the name of political \nexpediency. I choose not to do so. I will not support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we are awaiting the next speaker in the \nsequence that the Chair has been given; therefore, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, the time to be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are awaiting the arrival of the next \nSenator to speak. In the meantime, I might just correct one thing that \nwas said here, I think, on the floor. I believe the Senator from Maine \nsaid that trade, conservation, and research would equal 10 percent of \nthe bill that we have--only 10 percent. Actually it is much more than \nthat. Conservation alone is 22 percent of the funding in this bill; \nthat is, $37.1 billion out of $173 billion.\n  If you take all the noncommodity titles--research, conservation, \ntrade, forestry, all the other noncommodity titles--it equals about 30 \npercent of the funding of the bill. I wanted to make that correction.\n  I want to go back to nutrition one more time and address the issue of \nfunding. In the committee, when we passed our farm bill, there was \nsupport for a $5.6 billion nutrition title. It was supported on both \nsides. When that title was passed in our committee, it was passed \nunanimously.\n  The bill then came on the floor and there were a number of amendments \nmade. Many of them I cosponsored. They added additional funding. By the \ntime we finished the bill, the nutrition title was $8.4 billion.\n\n  Keep in mind when the bill left the Senate floor, the CBO rescored \nthe bill and they had made a mistake. We didn't make the mistake. The \nCBO had miscalculated about $6.1 billion. So even before we went to \nconference we had to cut basically $6.1 billion out of our bill, which \nwe did across the board. We did not focus on nutrition or any other \nnoncommodity aspect of the bill. We just had to do it, basically, \nacross the board.\n  The House-passed bill had $3.4 billion for nutrition. The President, \nin his message, what he wanted was a $4.1 billion increase in \nnutrition. The bill before us has $6.4 billion for nutrition. That is \n$1.2 billion higher than we passed in our committee. It is almost \ndouble what the House had. So I believe we did a very good job in \nfighting for the nutrition program.\n  Do we always provide more money for the neediest people in our \nsociety? Sure. As we go ahead as the Agriculture Committee, we will be \nlooking to make sure that next year and the year after the people who \nrely upon food stamps and other feeding programs are not left behind. \nBut I think we did a great job getting the $6.4 billion for nutrition.\n  I received a letter yesterday from a number of food-related, hunger-\nrelated groups--51 groups. They said they are writing to express their \nsupport for the nutrition title.\n\n       The conference report makes critical steps forward for some \n     of the populations most in need of help: legal immigrants and \n     working parents with children. Additional provisions that \n     will substantially simplify the program are also critically \n     important.\n       We also applaud your additional funding for The Emergency \n     Food Assistance Program. Food banks, food shelves and food \n     pantries facing growing requests will be better able to meet \n     the need.\n       Given the scope of the hunger and food insecurity problem \n     facing our nation's people, we believe that passage of the \n     Farm Bill Conference Report with its investments in the \n     nutrition safety net must be a very high priority for the \n     Senate.\n\n  As I said, this was signed by 51 groups. I will not go through them \nall: America's Second Harvest, American School Food Service \nAssociation, American Public Human Services Association, Bread for the \nWorld, Children's Defense Fund, Coalition on Human Needs, Congressional \nHunger Center, the Food Research and Action Center, FRAC, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, the National Law Center on Homelessness and \nPoverty, Volunteers of America. Those are among the 51 groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter and those 51 groups' names be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\n\n                                                      May 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Agriculture Committee, Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin: We, the undersigned groups, are \n     writing to express our support for the nutrition title of the \n     Conference Report on the Farm Bill (H.R. 2646). The final \n     package makes very important investments to strengthen the \n     nutrition safety net, especially for vulnerable working \n     families with children, needy legal immigrants, and others \n     struggling to put food on the table.\n       As you know, USDA and the Census Bureau report that \n     approximately 33 million people in the United States--13 \n     million of them children--have been living with hunger or on \n     the edge of hunger. The recent economic slowdown and \n     increasing need are only exacerbating this problem of high \n     levels of hunger and food insecurity, particularly for legal \n     immigrants and other low-wage workers. Substantially \n     strengthening the national nutrition safety net is critically \n     important to address this problem.\n       Accordingly, we believe the Conference Report makes \n     critical steps forward for some of the populations most in \n     need of help: legal immigrants; and working parents with \n     children. Additional provisions that will substantially \n     simplify the program are also critically important. Easing \n     states' administrative burdens will reduce their costs, \n     reduce errors, reduce red tape for needy people, and speed \n     eligibility determinations and benefits delivery.

I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent \nthat the time of the quorum be equally divided between the proponents \nand opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with those who have expressed very \nsevere reservations and concerns about this bill. It is an \nextraordinarily expensive piece of legislation. This legislation is not \nonly going to cost the taxpayers of America a great deal of money--much \nmore than has ever been paid out before in the area of farm subsidies--\nbut it is a bill that takes us down the wrong path in the area of how \nwe should address production of farm commodities in our country.\n  Nobody questions that farmers are the hardest working people you \nmeet. At all levels of life, as you come across people, the farmer is \nsomebody who puts in incredible hours, who works from dawn to dusk in \nmost instances--unless they are a corporate farm owner--the people out \nthere actually doing the farming. They love their job, usually. That is \nwhy they do it. They are a contributor of immense proportions to our \nsociety, both from the standpoint of being hard workers and \nextraordinarily productive citizens, but also in setting a tone and a \ncharacter for our Nation and the communities in which they live.\n  Unfortunately, the system they are caught up in--not all, but those \nfarmers who find themselves existing on the Federal payroll--is one \nthat is fundamentally broken. Instead of a market system, it is a \nsystem of collectivization.\n  It is truly ironic, in fact, when you think about it. The way the \nfarm program works today for those people on the system is that the \nFederal Government essentially pays through the tax dollars of the \nAmerican people for the net income of those farmers.\n  Forty-six percent of the net income of farming as a result of this \nbill--46 percent--will be paid for by tax dollars.\n  In seven States, the Federal Direct Payment Program actually exceeds \nthe net farm income. Think about that for a moment.\n  In the State of Wisconsin, for example, the Federal Direct Payment \nProgram exceeds the net farm income by 174 percent. In Montana, it is \n178 percent. In North Dakota, it is 156 percent. There are seven States \nwhere it actually exceeds net income.\n  If you were to set out a classic definition of collectivization or \nsocialization of an industry, it would be that the tax benefits of the \nindustry exceed the income of the industry. This essentially means that \npeople aren't working to be productive; they are working to receive tax \nbenefits.\n  As I said, it is ironic that our farmers who are caught up in these \nprograms find themselves in this type of situation. If you look at it \nin a historical context, the country which most aggressively attempted \ncollectivization where they had a program where the farm community was \nessentially an extension of the State support program was, of course, \nthe Soviet Union where the system collapsed as a result of its \ninability to be competitive.\n  We, however, ironically and through the genius of our American \nfarmer, have managed to actually make it productive. We have a \nproductive, collective system where we are actually producing goods. \nBut we are not producing them efficiently, obviously. We are not \nproducing them in a form that makes a whole lot of sense. We are, in \nfact, producing goods that we don't need.\n  As has been mentioned numerous times by the Senator from Indiana and \nother Senators in this Chamber, we are creating a situation where by \ndefinition we produce goods at a price which has no relationship to the \namount of goods being produced. So we have more goods than we need; \nthus, we drive down the price; thus, we end up paying\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\nmore in subsidies to support those goods, a system which is cockeyed. \nIt makes no sense.\n\n  I heard one person come down here from the other side--the Senator \nfrom North Dakota--who said this bill is for entrepreneurship. It is a \nunique view of entrepreneurship because, basically, the entrepreneur \nhere is trying to figure out how they can get more money out of the \nFederal Government and how they can put more crops in the ground, which \nwe don't need, which produces a higher production level at a price \nwhich drives down the price so they can get more for the crop that we \ndidn't need to begin with.\n  It makes no sense. That is not entrepreneurship in a market economy. \nThat is a new form of entrepreneurship in a collectivized economy. That \nis gaming the system. Gaming the system would be more appropriate than \nentrepreneurship as a term.\n  I heard another Member say but this bill is going to produce so much \nin the way of paperwork in order to meet the new commodity rules that \npeople are going to be standing in line for days at the Farm Service \nAgency. I feel sorry for them standing in line all day.\n  As a practical matter, if you are going to opt into a system where \nyou are essentially getting all your net income out of the Federal \nGovernment, you ought to be doing something instead of standing in line \nfor that money.\n  Clearly, this system has failed when our farmers are standing in line \ninstead of working to produce goods, when they are using the system to \nproduce crops which they don't need and which we don't need, and when \nthey are getting a payment from the Federal Government which exceeds \ntheir income.\n  The bill also is perverse in whom it supports. Most of the subsidy in \nthis bill goes to a very small number of farmers who produce a small \nnumber of commodity crops. The State of California, which has the most \nfarmers in America, by far, and which has the largest farming industry, \nby far, gets only 9 percent of the benefit under the bill. But other \nStates which have commodity crops, with 3 percent of the farms, for \nexample, get two-thirds of the commodity subsidies. Sixty percent of \nAmerican farmers get no commodity subsidy at all. They are still in the \nmarket. Of course, that number is being reduced because this bill \nmanages to pick up a bunch of commodities that have not been there \nbefore. We now have onions. We have apples. We have pulse crops. And, \nof course, we dramatically expanded our effort in the area of dairy and \npeanuts.\n  Then there is sugar. Sugar: What a farcical exercise this is. What a \njoke on the American taxpayer this has become. Of course, it is a very \nexpensive joke.\n  First, we set the sugar price in this country arbitrarily at a rate \nwhich is 10, 15 cents higher than what the market bears \ninternationally, so that the average consumer in this country, for any \nproduct that has sugar in it, has to pay a great deal more than they \nwould if we were playing in an open market; in fact, the last number I \nsaw was $1.6 billion more in subsidy. Where does that go? To the sugar \nproducers. So that is the first time we hit the consumer.\n  For years, the sugar industry used to come to the Senate with \nrighteous statements, saying: But we take nothing out of the Federal \nTreasury; we just take it out of the consumer through the subsidized \ncosts that we put on the consumer--the inflated price. Well, they were \nnot happy with that. So in this bill they are going into the Treasury \nfor $435 million.\n\n  So first they hit the consumer with an inflated price, which they \nbenefit from because they do not allow market-priced sugar, and it is \nto the tune of $1.6 billion; and now they have set up a commodity price \nwhich is going to flow through to them to the tune of $430 million. If \nit were not so obscene, it would be humorous, the level at which it \ntakes from the consumer and the American taxpayer and redistributes \nthat in a countermarket system.\n  Robert Samuelson, who is one of the better economists in our country, \nmade the point that over the last two and a half decades farm subsidies \nhave consumed roughly 10 percent of what we have added to our national \ndebt. That is a price that in some ways I might be willing to pay if it \nwere done in a manner that had some relationship to market forces \nbecause I believe strongly that we need a farm economy that is strong. \nBut when you totally overwhelm market forces with this type of subsidy \nsystem, you fundamentally undermine the capacity to have a farm program \nwhich, first, represents production, which we need, in the commodities \nwhich we want, and, second, is fair to the American taxpayers and the \nAmerican consumer.\n  So I believe this bill should be rejected. I regret that it probably \nwill not be rejected. But I believe the increase in spending above the \nbaseline here, which is approximately $173 billion, is way beyond \nanything we can afford as an economy or as taxpayers, but, more \nimportantly, the policy in this bill totally perverts the market and, \nin my opinion, drives us in the wrong direction, away from a market-\noriented farm policy toward a more collectivized farm policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I will yield to the Senator from \nMichigan shortly, but I would like to say, for the benefit of Senators, \nthat we had a list before of speakers on the farm bill. If there are \nany Senators who wish to come to the floor to speak on the farm bill, \nthat list is vacant right now, so we do have time on the bill right now \nfor any Senators who wish to come over and speak. If they will just \ncontact us, we can get another list put up, so we can get an appointed \ntime for Senators to speak on the farm bill.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan. And I thank her for all of her great work on \nthis farm bill. I say to her constituents, the people of Michigan, \nthere isn't a person who has fought harder for their interests than \nSenator Stabenow, especially in agriculture, and especially when it \ncomes to the specialty crops.\n  I point out that I believe Senator Stabenow holds a record. Senator \nStabenow is the only member of the Agriculture Committee who served on \nthe agriculture committee in her State legislature, served on the \nAgriculture Committee in the House of Representatives, and is on the \nAgriculture Committee in the Senate. We are proud to have her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank, first, my wonderful friend \nand colleague and leader of the Senate Agriculture Committee. He is the \nperson who has brought us to this point with a farm bill of which I \nbelieve we can all be very proud. I am so grateful to him that he has \nunderstood that we in Michigan have 100 different commodities; that 60 \npercent of what we grow, in fact, is fruits and vegetables, and for the \nfirst time specialty crops are recognized by the Congress in a farm \nbill. It would not have happened without the leadership of our Senator \nfrom Iowa who has led this committee so ably.\n  Madam President, I could not disagree more with my friend from New \nHampshire who spoke right before me. I believe this is a bill of which \nwe should be very proud. It moves in the right direction. It helps our \nfamily farmers. It promotes conservation. It supports rural economic \ndevelopment. It is something that I believe is good for every family in \nthe country.\n  I want to start, though, by thanking all of the staff who have been \ninvolved in this effort. There have been hours and hours--hundreds of \nhours, weekend work--in which people have been working at a number of \npoints in order to get us to this comprehensive farm bill. I thank all \nthose on the Senate Agriculture Committee staff and Senator Harkin's \nstaff, the majority leader's staff, and I also thank Kim Love from my \nstaff who has worked so diligently fighting for the interests of \nMichigan family farmers and rural communities and all of those who \nbenefit from a strong farm policy. So to each of them I say: Thank you.\n  We do, in fact, have a farm bill that makes sense. I came into the \nhouse of Representatives in 1997 and watched and participated as a \nmember of the Agriculture Committee in the ``fruits,'' you might say, \nof the previous farm bill, what was called Freedom to Farm, which, \nunfortunately, left us in a situation where every year that I have been\n\n[[Page S3994]]\n\na Member of Congress we have had to pass an emergency supplemental \nbecause the farm bill did not work. Every single year, we were back \nsaying that our farmers were not going to be able to make it, that the \npolicies that were put in place with the last farm bill just did not \nwork.\n  So we are now using a different approach, one that takes into \nconsideration the economic challenges of our farmers and what is \nhappening in the world around us, and new opportunities.\n  I am extremely pleased that this final bill--thanks to the leadership \nof our chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee--includes, for the \nfirst time, a title on energy. We in Michigan welcome that. There is \nnot only ethanol, which we have debated on this floor, and which I \nstrongly support, but we have soybean lubricants and other \nopportunities where I believe Michigan farmers can take the lead in \nbiomass fuels. It is a real opportunity for us in Michigan as well as \naround the country. This dovetails directly with our energy bill that \nwas passed not long ago.\n  Again, in Michigan, we have 100 different commodities. I am pleased \nwith what we have been able to do with the dairy proposal and sugar, \nand with the basic commodities, when we look at what has happened in \nterms of support for all of the commodities.\n  I specifically rise to speak for a moment about what is called \nspecialty crops, our fruits and vegetable farmers. I am very pleased \nthat a provision I offered in the committee has in fact become a part \nof this final product, for the first time, to allow a minimum of $200 \nmillion per year to be used to purchase surplus fruits and vegetables, \nnot only to help our farmers in terms of their prices and to address \nsurpluses but also to have the win-win of offering those fruits and \nvegetables for our School Lunch Program, for our senior feeding \nprograms. This is a win-win situation. We should be very proud of the \nfact that through our nutritional programs we now are able to \npermanently put into place a way to help our farmers and at the same \ntime make fresh fruits and vegetables available to our children and to \nthose who are involved in our nutrition programs.\n  There is another important provision. For those states with critical \norchards--this is the capital for our cherry farmers, our apple \ngrowers, and so on--the Tree Assistance Program is reauthorized to \nprovide reimbursement for trees such as apple trees destroyed by \nnatural disaster. We have a really serious issue in Michigan with apple \nfire blight. Coupling that with the drought we experienced in the year \n2000, we have had a devastation in many areas of our orchards. The Tree \nAssistance Program is very important and an area I fought very hard to \ninclude in the final bill. I am pleased it is there.\n  One of the provisions that is not in the bill in its entirety and we \nwill continue to work to address this year through an emergency \nsupplemental is emergency assistance, on which the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, led the effort--to add $2.4 billion in emergency \nassistance. While we did not receive the agreement of the White House \nand our colleagues in the House of Representatives to include it in the \nconference committee, we were able to provide just under $100 million \nin market loss payments for apples. That is an important first step.\n  But I can say, coming from Michigan, where in the year 2000 we had 82 \nout of 83 counties declared disaster areas as a result of drought, just \nmaking our farmers eligible for more loans is not the right approach. \nOur farmers have enough loans. What they need is some direct assistance \nduring emergencies such as drought. I will continue to fight very hard \nto address that entire emergency assistance package.\n  I am also pleased that we are seeing almost a doubling of funding for \nconservation and that the new provision I was pleased to cosponsor with \nour chairman, the Conservation Security Program, that provides payments \nfor farmers for good environmental practices on working lands is \nincluded in the conservation title. Again, for the first time, \nspecialty crops are included as a part of conservation payments. This \nis very important to Michigan and very important to our producers \nacross the country.\n  We have many rural communities, hundreds and hundreds of rural \ncommunities in Michigan. From the upper peninsula all the way down \nalong our coast and central Michigan, we have small communities that \nhave benefited and will benefit from the strengthened rural development \ntitle in terms of infrastructure, water and sewer projects for which \nthey will be able to receive support, broadband, and other kinds of \ninfrastructure needs of our rural communities. I am very pleased the \nfarm bill includes a strong rural development title as well.\n  For our cooperative extension employees, we are pleased to be able to \naddress an issue of long-term care insurance that came to us from \nMichigan State University. I appreciate the fact that this is in the \nbill.\n  A couple of other areas of note: We have placed in the bill a \nnutrition pilot program that will allow five States to focus on good \nnutrition practices and encourage consumption of fruits and vegetables. \nThis is another important way we can not only promote healthy eating, \nhealthy living, but also be able to promote the nutritional value of \nour fruits and vegetables. I was pleased that the pilot program was \nincluded in the final bill as well.\n  Of course, coming from the Great Lakes State of Michigan, I fought \nvery hard for the Great Lakes Soil Erosion Program to be authorized. I \nam pleased it is authorized at $5 million a year. While this program \nhas received funding in the past, it has never been authorized as an \nongoing program. Through a combination of local and Federal funds, this \nprogram has been successful in keeping sedimentation out of the Great \nLakes and educating the agricultural community about erosion and water \nquality. I am very pleased that finally, for the first time, we have \nthis program authorized officially as a part of the farm bill.\n  We know there is a good safety net: Higher loan rates, \ncountercyclical payments, updated yields, continued direct annual \npayments, as well as conservation payments that come together in a way \nto support American agriculture, to support our family farmers. I am \nvery pleased to support strongly this final conference committee.\n  Let me, in closing, quote from our fruit and vegetable producers of \nthe country who have put out a statement which I believe should in part \nbe in the Record. It says:\n\n       We applaud the Congress and its Members who led the fight \n     to develop some of the most progressive and positive \n     agricultural policy initiatives that have been developed \n     through a farm bill process to address the unique needs of \n     the fruit and vegetable producers in the United States.\n\n  From the standpoint of our fruit and vegetable producers, this is a \nhistoric bill. From the standpoint of all of our families in the \ncountry, this is farm policy that makes sense for all of us. Again, I \nencourage my colleagues to support the bill. I commend our chairman \nfrom Iowa for his vision and leadership.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I say to Senators, we have a list of \nSenators who wanted to speak and be heard on the farm bill. I don't see \nanyone here right now. I know it is the lunch hour, but now is a good \ntime to come over and speak on the farm bill, if anyone so desires.\n  In the interim, I rise to point out that there was some mention made \nearlier today that somehow farmers in the Midwest and some of the \nPlains States would be better off if there were basically not this bill \nbut the Freedom to Farm bill. There was a bill introduced in March for \nan emergency package for this year--that was S. 2040--that would have \nspent $7.35 billion in this fiscal year. And some have asserted that \nfarmers would be better off if we could just pass an emergency package \nrather than this farm bill.\n  I asked my staff and the Food and Agricultural Policy Research \nInstitute to do an analysis of the conference report we have before \nus, comparing that to what farmers might receive under an emergency \npackage as envisioned in S. 2040. According to the FAPRI analysis of \nthe conference report, Kansas farmers, for example, would receive a \ntotal of $1.04 billion in commodity program payments for this crop \nyear, 2002. But they would receive only $795 million this year under \nFreedom to Farm,\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\nplus the emergency payments that would be made under S. 2040 for the \nsame period. The same is true for Iowa. We estimate that Iowa farmers \nwould get $1.7 billion for this crop year under this conference report \nbut would have received only $1.56 billion under S. 2040, the bill that \nwas introduced in March to put through an emergency package--sort of an \nemergency package on top of the Freedom to Farm bill. In any case, \nfarmers would be better off this year under the conference report. I \nwant to make it very clear that this bill will apply to this crop year.\n\n  FAPRI also did an analysis looking ahead at between now and 2007 and \ncomparing what farmers would get in certain States under this bill to \nwhat they would get if we continued Freedom to Farm.\n  For example, my Iowa farmers will have a $485 million gain, on \naverage, between 2002 and 2007 over the Freedom to Farm bill. That is a \n52-percent increase.\n  Illinois farmers will get a $486 million gain, on average, during \nthese years. That is a 57-percent increase for Illinois.\n  Kansas farmers, under this bill, will see a $402 million gain, on \naverage, between 2002 and 2007 over the Freedom to Farm bill. That is a \n91-percent increase for Kansas farmers. I think that is the highest of \nany State I have seen, in terms of the difference between Freedom to \nFarm and what we have in this bill.\n  Minnesota farmers get a $335 million gain, a 55-percent increase.\n  Nebraska farmers get a $380 million gain, on average, under this bill \nover the Freedom to Farm bill. That is a 68-percent increase for \nNebraska.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this analysis done by FAPRI printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Midwest, Plains States Beneficiaries of Farm Security and Rural \n                Investment Act of 2002 (FAPRI analysis)\n\n       Iowa farmers, $485 million gain on average between 2002-\n     2007 over Freedom to Farm (a 52 percent increase).\n       Illinois farmers, $486 million gain on average between \n     2002-2007 over Freedom to Farm (a 57 percent increase).\n       Kansas farmers, $402 million gain on average between 2002-\n     2007 over Freedom to Farm (a 91 percent increase).\n       Minnesota farmers, a $335 million gain on average between \n     2002-2007 over Freedom to Farm (a 55 percent increase).\n       Nebraska farmers, a $380 million gain on average between \n     2002-2007 over Freedom to Farm (a 68 percent increase).\n       Indiana farmers, a $243 million gain on average between \n     2002-2007 over Freedom to Farm (59 percent increase).\n       Montana farmers, $102 million gain on average between 2002-\n     2007 over Freedom to Farm (88 percent increase).\n       South Dakota farmers, $177 million gain on average between \n     2002-2007 over Freedom to Farm (57 percent increase).\n       North Dakota farmers, $201 million gain on average between \n     2002-2007 over Freedom to Farm (60 percent increase).\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, it would be a huge mistake to walk away \nfrom this bill--for farmers all over the upper Midwest. It would be a \nmistake for farmers in Michigan, and especially in New England. In New \nEngland, the dairy farmers have been helped immensely: Maine, New \nHampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island--all of \nthe dairy States.\n  One other group has been helped immensely, and that is the small \nspecialty crop farmers, those who grow blueberries, potatoes, and other \nkinds of vegetables, including apples, and there are many in New \nEngland. They will be helped immensely.\n  As the Senator from Michigan stated, we have a $200 million annual \nfloor on purchases of specialty crops. That is what the farmers in New \nEngland grow. They have never had anything like this. It wasn't in the \nFreedom to Farm bill. If this conference report is defeated, that means \nNew England farmers will not have anything. They will have nothing. \nUnder this farm bill, they are going to be a part of our agricultural \nstructure for the future.\n  It would be a shame to walk away from this today--walk away from the \nfarmers in New England, the farmers in Michigan, or in the upper \nNorthwest. It would be a shame to walk away from the great strides we \nhave made in nutrition. I pointed out earlier that the 1996 Freedom to \nFarm bill, under which we are operating, didn't even have a nutrition \nsection. That was taken up in welfare reform later. This time around we \nhave kept nutrition under the farm bill. We have made a huge increase \nin the nutrition programs. It would be a shame to walk away from that.\n  When you look at the broad aspects of America, this conference report \ndeserves to be supported. Again, if somebody asks me can I defend and \nsupport everything in this bill, the answer is no. But this is a \ncompromise bill. This is a large country. What benefits one area may \nnot benefit another. All of the support we have in there for specialty \ncrops, the support we have in other areas that do not affect my State, \nI support it because I recognize that farmers in New England and all \nover the country need help and support. We need to promote better \nconsumption of fruits and vegetables in this country. That is what is \nstrong in this bill. So it is a good bill for America.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum as we await the arrival \nof those who want to speak on the farm bill, either in opposition or in \nsupport. I ask that the time during the quorum call be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from Minnesota?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for being a great member \nof our Senate Agriculture Committee. Senator Dayton has been a personal \nfriend of mine going back 20-some years. It was absolutely a bright \nmoment when he came to the Senate and got on the Agriculture Committee.\n  I thank him for all his input on this farm bill. I say without \nhesitation many of the provisions in this bill that help our dairy \nfarmers, help conservation, got our loan rates up for our farmers bears \nthe imprint of the Senator from Minnesota, and I thank him for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I thank the chairman \nof the committee. I return the compliment. He has been a stupendous \nleader of the committee most of the time I have been there. We actually \nhave two Minnesotans on the Senate Agriculture Committee--my senior \ncolleague, Senator Wellstone and I. Heretofore, for a few years, we did \nnot have any representation on the committee.\n  I believe this farm bill is a better bill for Minnesota and it is a \nbetter bill for America as a result of our efforts. Without the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Harkin, we would not have \naccomplished any of this. His leadership has been extraordinary.\n  I hear some of my colleagues raising objections to certain measures \nin this bill. In the context of what we walked into in January of 2001 \nwhen I joined the Senate and that committee and the previous conditions \nin the agricultural sector, there is a disconnect between what they \nseem to be objecting to and the circumstances that existed--which, \nfrankly, I was not a part of--when I came on the committee in January \nof 2001.\n  The Senator from Iowa was not even the chairman of the committee at \nthat time. He was the ranking member. Our distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Lugar, was chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. The \nRepublicans had been in charge of the Senate for the previous 6 years. \nThere had been a Republican chairman of that committee for that period \nof time.\n  This means that the 1996 farm bill, if my recollection is correct, \nwas constructed and passed by that committee, and the full Senate and \nHouse, both under Republican leadership. There was a Democratic \nPresident, but they undertook that initiative.\n  I traveled the State in the year 2000 campaigning for office and \nlistening to farmers all over Minnesota. The chairman of the committee \nwas kind enough to join me for the day. I heard from farmers in \nMinnesota that they were in desperate condition. I looked at the market \nprices then in Minnesota, and\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\ncommodity prices were lower in the year 2000 than they were when I ran \nfor the Senate for the first time in 1982. That was not even inflation \nadjusted. This is just nominal dollars. The prices for corn, wheat, \nsoybeans, and milk were lower in Minnesota in the year 2000 than they \nwere in 1982.\n\n  None of the many products farmers have to buy to stay in business--\nsuch as tractors, diesel fuel, equipment, feed--have stayed at the same \nprice. In fact, they have gone up quite significantly.\n  When we came into the majority in the Senate and I was joined by my \ncolleague, Senator Wellstone, on the committee, the Minnesota farm \neconomy was in very desperate straits. In many areas of Minnesota, the \nfarm economy is the economy. It is not just farmers. It is every \nperson, every business owner, every employee of a business, every \nschool board member--everybody in Greater Minnesota, the majority of \nour State, knows their livelihood, the lifeblood of their communities, \nof their churches, of their schools depends on a healthy agricultural \neconomy, which depends on a market price, which depends on the ability \nto sell your product in the marketplace and make a profit, make enough \nmoney to feed your family, buy what you need, and those dollars \nmultiply through the local economy.\n  We have not seen that kind of prosperity in Greater Minnesota, in the \nagricultural economy of our State, for many years.\n  The Federal Government has stepped in, as it had to, given the \nfailure of Freedom to Farm, with supplemental payments, with double \nAMTA payments. If it had not, we would not have farms anywhere in \nMinnesota or they would be few and operating under large corporate \nauspices. The real people, the farmers would not be there.\n  Those who criticize us for going back, as they say, to a Federal role \nin agriculture should be reminded, in fairness, if they had their way \nas the architect of this bill in 1996, there would not have been any \nsupplemental payments; there would not have been any disaster relief. \nThere would have simply been a total reliance on the marketplace and \nwith prices that were going down through the floor and into the \nsubbasement with no supply management whatsoever.\n  Another one of the criticisms I heard in the last couple of days is \nwe are encouraging overproduction. The 1996 farm bill took all the caps \noff production individually and collectively: Produce whatever you can; \nproduce what you must to survive. Once again, they are criticizing \nsomething that is very much their own creation.\n  Another criticism I have heard recently is we are somehow putting too \nmuch of the taxpayers' money into the farm program. Again, coming from \na farm State, I know how vital this Federal role in agriculture is to \nthe economic lifeblood of Minnesota. I wish we did not have to put this \nmuch money into supporting and keeping our farmers alive. I wish they \ncould get every dollar they need in the marketplace. If we had had a \ngood farm program over the last number of years in this country, \nfrankly, that is where they would be getting their price today. But \nthat is not the case.\n  In fact, the farm index for this country is now at the lowest level \nit has been since the Great Depression. That is the price we get for \nall farm commodities in America divided by the cost of producing all \nthose commodities. It has dropped from 100 percent in the years 1990 to \n1992, which was the baseline, to 80 percent today. In 10 years, in just \none decade, the prices farmers receive all across this country as a \npercentage of the cost of producing all of those products has dropped \nby 20 percent. It dropped below the break-even point, which is why so \nmany farmers have gone bankrupt, and why, without these initial \npayments, thousands of farmers across America will go bankrupt.\n\n  This is the situation the chairman of this committee inherited, and I \nthink his leadership has been nothing short of miraculous and \nmagnificent. The title of the movie ``Miracle Worker'' really applies \nto the distinguished Senator from Iowa. To put this bill together with \nall the differences of view, diversity, forms of agriculture, sizes, \nand different philosophical and political perspectives, it is a true \nmiracle, one that was extraordinarily well done, one that would have \nbeen done--if the chairman had been assisted by everybody involved--\nsome time ago.\n  Another criticism I heard in the last couple of days is that this \nbill should have been passed already. Farmers have been chafing from \nuncertainty and lenders have been chafing from uncertainty. I have \nheard that from Minnesota bankers and farmers all over the State, but I \nam thinking to myself: Despite the crisis that September 11 brought on \nall of us, despite anthrax, which I believe drove the Senator from Iowa \nand his staff out of their office in the Hart Building, the Agriculture \nCommittee conducted its hearings, marked up a bill, and had it on the \nSenate floor last December so that we had 2\\1/2\\ weeks before our break \nto debate it and pass it and send it on to conference with the House. \nIf we had done that expeditiously at the very beginning, we would have \nhad that bill in conference. It could have been conferenced and signed \nby the President Christmas Eve or before.\n  Instead, some would not permit that to happen. We, Senator Daschle, \nthe majority leader, tried three times to invoke cloture. Three times \nwe had the majority of the Senators voting to do so but we could not \nget the 60 votes necessary.\n  So we left. We came back, just before the time of the President's \nState of the Union, without having passed a farm bill. So now I am \nhearing from people who voted against cloture in December three times, \nwho delayed it by 5 weeks, that somehow it is somebody else's fault \nthat we did not have a bill in March or February.\n  We could have had a bill, we should have had a bill, and they ought \nto take responsibility. To come back today or yesterday and say that it \nis somehow the chairman's fault or somebody else's fault, I think is \nirresponsible.\n  We have a bill that fortunately is well worth waiting for. It did not \nhave to be waited for, but it was really well worth it in terms of the \nState of Minnesota.\n  I inquire of the Chair how much more time I have available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that the chairman yield to me an \nadditional 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 4 additional minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DAYTON. This is a tremendous bill for Minnesota, and on behalf of \nour farmers I thank Senator Harkin. I want to pay tribute to my \ncolleague Senator Wellstone who had a huge role in this. He has had a \nlongtime friendship with the committee chairman. I see his \nfingerprints, his hard work, and his effectiveness in the Senate all \nover the bill that went out of the Senate committee, the bill that was \npassed on this floor and has now been incorporated into the conference \nreport.\n  There was an article yesterday in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, one of \nour leading newspapers, that said, by an independent analysis, the bill \nwould bring $1.16 billion a year into the Minnesota economy. That is a \nhuge increase in dollars coming out of the agricultural sector of our \nState and into our entire State economy. That means school districts, \nthat means city budgets, that means church contributions, that means so \nmuch in the lifeblood of Minnesota that will be increased and improved \nas a result of this bill. I want to pay tribute to Senator Wellstone \nfor his leadership in bringing that about.\n  Would that these dollars would come out of market prices. I believe \nas this bill unfolds with the counter-cyclical aspect to it, and some \nof the other features, that more of this bill will be paid for in the \nmarketplace, not out of tax revenues. As I say, though, without it, \nfrankly, there would not be any farms in Minnesota for anybody to be \nsupporting.\n  As others have said, in terms of conservation, another one of the \nchairman's initiatives, in terms of energy, combined with the energy \nbill which was passed in the Senate, the funds that are going now in \nthe initiatives for biofuels, for ethanol, for soy diesel, and other \nproducts, which I am convinced over the next 10 to 20 years is going to \nbe essential to this Nation weaning itself from complete reliance\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\non oil-based fuels, it is tremendously important. This bill and the \nenergy bill combined will lead us into that direction.\n  In the area of dairy, Senator Harkin, and Senator Leahy from Vermont, \nhave succeeded in accomplishing something that I think dairy producers \nin America would have thought heretofore was truly impossible, and that \nis to create one market for the entire country, to make available \nacross the Nation the same terms, the same pricing supports, the same \nformula for price support levels from the Federal Government. That has \nnot existed in the 16-plus years of Federal dairy policy and that is an \nextraordinary accomplishment in itself.\n\n  This bill is not perfect, as others have said, but it is awfully \ngood. It is so much better than what it is replacing, and given the \nconditions which it is stepping in to replace, to be picking at a penny \nhere or a day or a week of something, when this bill is in place and, \nyes--when this bill is fully in place, Minnesotans in terms of prices \nfor soybeans, for wheat, for dairy are going to be so much better off \nthan they would have been if present law had been continued.\n  I, again, thank the chairman of the committee. I urge my colleagues \nto do as I will do, which is to vote in favor of this conference \nreport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to yield 15 \nminutes off of the time of Senator Lugar to the Senator from Nebraska, \nMr. Hagel. At the completion of the statement of Senator Hagel, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. Carnahan, be \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport accompanying the farm bill.\n  When the current farm bill debate began more than two years ago, \nagriculture leaders and Members of Congress said a new approach and a \nnew policy was needed to face the challenges of a new century. The farm \nbill we debate today is not a new approach, nor is it a new policy, but \nrather it is a step backward into an antique farm policy of more \ngovernment command and control.\n  This bill could have been a good farm bill had it incorporated some \nof the innovative ideas that had been put forward--farmers savings \naccounts; more focus on farmer income support through direct, decoupled \npayments; a more significant role for rural development; giving USDA \nthe ability to review environmental and endangered species legislation; \ninitiatives and safeguards to keep our farm program trade compliant \nwith international trade laws; expanded crop insurance programs; and \nreal payment limits.\n  Instead, we have been presented with an election-year document whose \nglaring shortcomings far outweigh its virtues. This bill will continue \nto expand a policy that ensures commodity prices will drop lower and \nremain low, and that land prices and rents will continue to go up. As \none farmer in Nebraska wrote me yesterday, ``This farm bill is the same \nold thing, and will do nothing to reverse the trend of fewer and fewer \nfarmers on the land. The number of farmers in Nebraska under the age of \n35 is fading fast. The status quo represented by this bill will not \nhelp, and we do not have a lot of time to change things.''\n  As another constituent of mine said, ``This bill will not help \nfarmers--it will only help bushels, bales and pounds.'' It focuses on \nincentives for more production--whether the market wants it or not.\n  There are positive provisions in this Report. It contains a modest \nenergy title, which promotes renewable fuel. It substantially increases \nfunding for conservation programs. And it does not contain programs \nthat purchase local water rights with federal funds. But the negatives \nvastly outweigh the positives.\n  Of the many problems with this farm bill, one of the most serious is \nthe lack of real payment limits. Currently, two-thirds of all federal \npayments go to 10 percent of the recipients--the largest operators and \nlandowners. These lopsided payments encourage and subsidize \noverproduction; drive up land prices, land values and rentals; and \nallow large farm operations to outbid and buy up smaller and mid-sized \nproducers with taxpayer dollars.\n  The payment limits in the Senate farm bill were completely gutted by \nthe Conferees, despite having passed the Senate with 66 votes, and the \nHouse with 265 votes.\n  Without real payment limits, this farm bill will not only widen the \ndisparity gap between small and large farmers, it will make it much \nmore difficult in the future to gain support from non-rural Members of \nCongress. Without real payment limits, we risk derailing public support \nfor the entire farm program in the future.\n\n  The farm bill should not be welfare for small farmers. But Government \nshould not be financing the demise of the family farm. There is no \njustification for unlimited government payments.\n  Furthermore, we cannot overlook the effects this farm bill will have \non the cost of farmland. Unlimited government payments will only \nencourage large farm operations and wealthy, absentee landowners to buy \nmore ground, no matter how low the commodity prices drop.\n  The Omaha World Herald recently reported that Nebraska farmland \nvalues increased by 17 percent last year, despite 2001 being one of the \nworst years on record for crop prices. The USDA reports that nearly a \nquarter of current farmland value is due to government payments.\n  Yet, in many cases, the people who actually farm the land do not \nbenefit from higher land prices. Nearly half of U.S. farmers rent at \nleast some of their farm ground. For these farmers, this bill means \nthey will be faced with even higher cash rents.\n  No farm bill is perfect. But this one has enough problems that we \nwill be modifying it soon. One of the big question marks is this bill's \ntiming. The new farm program will go into effect this growing season--\ncovering the 2002 crop.\n  That means while farmers are in the fields tending to this year's \ncrops, they will also have to worry about updating their yields and \nacres, and doing other necessary paperwork to be eligible for the new \nprogram's fixed payments, loan rates and counter-cyclical payments. \nThis is bad timing and will create massive confusion for farmers.\n  The Senate should have seriously considered Senator Roberts' \nemergency assistance bill, which would have provided farmers with a \nreal and instant safety net this year. Under the new farm bill, it will \ntake four checks and more than a year for producers to get what they \nwould have received right away from a supplemental measure.\n  Also, by relying heavily on increased loan rates and moving away from \npayments not tied to production--price support instead of income \nsupport, this farm bill does not provide much of a ``safety net'' for \nthose farmers who fail to produce a crop. That is a very important \ndetail considering the severe drought in many parts of the country--\nincluding much of western Nebraska.\n  They are calling this bill the ``Farm Security and Rural Investment \nAct.'' That is a bit misleading.\n  Of the $73.5 billion in new farm bill spending over the next decade, \nonly $870 million--about 1 percent will go to rural development. \nCompared to the Senate-passed farm bill, this farm bill cuts rural \ndevelopment in half. That means phasing-down or completely eliminating \nimportant programs--like value-added projects for farmers that would \nhelp restore competition in the marketplace; rural business grants; and \nhigh-speed Internet access for rural areas. This is a serious \nshortchanging of rural America, especially considering that even before \nthe bill becomes law, it is estimated to run at least $9 billion over \nbudget.\n  Consider that in Nebraska, 61 of 93 counties have lost at least 10 \npercent of their population since 1980. Nationally, 556 rural counties \nhave lost 10 percent or more of their residents. A sensible, relevant \nand visionary farm policy would provide a better balance between \ncommodity support and rural investment than what is now in this bill.\n  Soon after the Senate farm bill passed, Senator Byron Dorgan of North \nDakota and I introduced the ``New Homestead Economic Opportunity Act.'' \nThis legislation, quite\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\nsimply, would attract individuals and businesses back to rural areas \nthat have been devastated by the restructuring of agriculture. Our bill \nwould encourage young people to live and work in rural areas suffering \npopulation loss. It would create real incentives for new home and \nbusiness construction, while protecting the value of existing homes. \nThis is the type of legislation that should be a key part of any \nagricultural policy aimed at improving the lives of those who feed our \nnation and the world, to assure those next generations feel they have a \nfuture in agricultural production and rural America.\n  Another glaring problem of this legislation is that it seriously \nimpairs the best hope for American agriculture's long-term viability \nand vitality--trade. America's ability to create new markets for its \nproducts and compete in those markets--is the key to America's future \nand our competitive position in the world. Our relationships with \ntrading partners are very important to our agricultural producers. \nExports account for 25 percent of gross cash sales for U.S. farmers and \nlivestock producers--a projected total of $57 billion for this year.\n  This report should have included Senator Grassley's trade amendment, \nwhich would have helped us avoid potential trade problems, which this \nbill will surely bring, while causing significant problems in our trade \nrelationships.\n  This farm bill takes us back down the dark road of tired, old farm \npolicy. It is a glorified carbon copy of market-distorting legislation \nthat will accelerate the vicious cycle of overproduction, low crop \nprices and soaring land values. Is this where we want U.S. agriculture \nto be six years from now? Is this the best way to improve America's \nagricultural competitiveness?\n  We can do better--we should have done better. I believe we will be \nforced to do better before this six-year farm bill expires. That means \nwe could be revisiting this issue before six years is up.\n  There are many other gaping holes in this bill. The Senate's ban on \npacker ownership of livestock was stripped, without even a study to \nreplace it. Farmers Savings Accounts was completely ignored. And by \nomitting the Senate farm bill's Cuban trade provision, which would have \nallowed private financing for food and medicine, this bill punishes \nU.S. agriculture by adhering to the counter-productive strategy of \nusing food as a weapon.\n  The work ethic of our agriculture producers is the best in the world. \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers produce the highest quality agricultural \ngoods in the world. As a Nebraskan and as an American, I am proud of \nthat effort and record. American agriculture can compete in the world \nmarkets. This farm bill should be allowing U.S. producers the \nopportunity to compete and succeed not holding them back and placing \nblockades in front of them.\n  This conference report is the result of election year politics at its \nworst--unimaginative legislation that throws money at complex problems \nrequiring more than just additional dollars. The winners will be large \nagribusiness, big landowners and large farm operations.\n  This bill will pass the Senate, as it has passed the House. We will \nneed to come back and fix it one of these days. Maybe then, we will get \nit right. However, there is not much margin of error left--time and \nmarkets are not on our side.\n  I would hope my colleagues think about the consequences of this \nlegislation. This is the wrong farm policy, at the worst possible time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Missouri is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, the farm bill conference report we are \nconsidering today is good for American agriculture. Historically, what \nhas been good for American agriculture has been good for America.\n  I raised my family on a farm in rural America. I have traveled \nthroughout rural Missouri for many years. I believe rural America's \nfuture can be limitless if we make the proper investments now. Because \nour farmers feed the world, the destiny of our Nation and rural America \nare intertwined.\n  It troubles me to see our rural communities struggle to compete in \nthe 21st century. Too often dwindling populations and lack of \nopportunity leave our rural communities contemplating a future much \ndifferent from their proud past. Many youth leave and do not return to \ntheir family farms or family businesses, the communities that \ngenerations before them had called home. Those who determine to remain \nand farm the land deserve a safety net for their labors, and they have \nnot had one for the past 6 years.\n  We have told rural America that help is on the way. Here it is at \nlast. The farm bill conference report will play a large role in helping \nrural America and American agriculture to reach its full potential. The \nstrong commodity title will give our entire agricultural industry a \ndegree of certainty when making business decisions, and it will provide \nadditional support for farmers when times are lean.\n  This farm bill's strong energy and rural development titles will help \nour farmers add value to their products, while decreasing our reliance \non foreign oil. I have visited many innovative Missouri farmers who now \nare forming new-generation cooperatives for ethanol production. Their \nefforts help us create sustainable jobs in rural areas. This farm bill \nplaces our reliance less on the Middle East and more on the Middle \nWest.\n  The rural development title provides our communities with more \nopportunities to enhance basic services such as fire protection, \nwastewater and drinking water programs, and much needed rural business \ninvestment programs.\n\n  I am also pleased this bill commits $100 million toward broadband \naccess, to improve telecommunications in underserved areas. It is \nimportant that those who live, work, and raise families in rural areas \nhave access to the technology of the 21st century.\n  Missouri is the confluence of American agriculture. Parts of northern \nMissouri resemble the Great Plains. Southeast Missouri's agriculture \nhas much in common with the Deep South. Missouri ranks second \nnationally in the number of farms in the State and second in beef \ncattle production. We rank among the top 10 in production of soybeans, \ncorn, rice, cotton, and hay. Farmers and business people all across \nMissouri support this farm bill because it is fair to all segments of \nour agriculture industry. A farm bill that is equitable to Missouri's \ndiverse agricultural base is fair to the Nation.\n  I joined my colleagues from States with traditionally southern crops \nin urging the conferees to produce a compromise that is fair to all \nregions. Southern crops, namely rice and cotton in my State, are highly \ncapital intensive. Family farmers growing these crops would not be \ncompetitive if the payment limitations provisions were to stand as \npassed in the Senate. The payment limitations compromise will preserve \nthe viability of Missouri's rice and cotton producers while denying \nbenefits to millionaires and others whom farm prices are not intended \nto benefit. I commend the farm bill conferees for producing a fair \ncompromise. I also commend Senator Harkin and Senator Daschle for their \noutstanding leadership.\n  Agriculture and a vibrant rural economy are critical to my State and \nto the entire Nation. I will be pleased to vote for the farm bill that \nI sincerely believe marks a new beginning for American agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, after which I ask unanimous consent, if there is no one \non the opposite side who shows up, that the Senator from Montana be \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to support and discuss the \nnew farm bill, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, \nlegislation the Senate will send to President Bush for his signature. \nThis new farm bill is not perfect. If this farm bill contained all of \nthe initiatives I helped include in the Senate-passed bill, it could \nhave been more beneficial to South Dakota agriculture, which generated \n$17 billion in economic activity in 2000 to South\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nDakota's economy, approximately twice that of the second largest \nindustry in my state. However, overall, it is a modest step in the \nright direction. I have advocated for the passage and implementation of \na new farm bill since the inadequacies of the current program were \nrevealed in 1997, a time when a significant drop in crop prices \neventually developed into a longer-term price crisis. Therefore, I look \nforward to the President signing this important legislation and \nanticipate the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, will take \nseriously their job to implement the new farm bill in a timely manner. \nI hope that USDA can administer the new bill for the 2002 crop year. I \nwill work with USDA to make sure South Dakota's farmers and ranchers \nare treated fairly and appropriately under the new farm bill.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to thank my friend and colleague, \nSenator Daschle, for his enduring leadership and tireless work to \nfinalize the farm bill. From day one, he has been determined to pass \nlegislation that would benefit America's family farmers and ranchers. \nAdditionally, I commend Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Harkin \nfor his persistence in shepherding this complex farm bill and reaching \na compromise with our House colleagues in the conference committee, \ndespite the substantial policy differences between the Senate and House \nbills. From the beginning of the farm bill process, Senator Harkin \nlistened to my concerns, included my initiatives for South Dakota's \nfarmers and ranchers in the Senate bill, and resisted many efforts by \nthe special interests to remove these important reforms from the final \nbill. I thank as well, Brian Jennings, from my Senate staff, for his \nexcellent work on this bill.\n  Most importantly, however, I am pleased that we finally have a farm \nbill for South Dakota's agricultural producers, who have been busy with \nfieldwork and preparations for the 2002 crop year. Indeed, South \nDakota's winter wheat crop has long-emerged from dormancy, winter wheat \nharvest will begin in the South within days, and my State's farmers \nhave planted much of the spring wheat crop and other small grains \nalready. Row crop seeding is underway in South Dakota, with over ten \npercent of the corn crop in-the-ground, and soybean and sunflower \nplanting will begin soon. Last year, South Dakota farmers produced 370 \nmillion bushels of corn and approximately 140 million bushels of \nsoybeans, making us the nation's eighth largest producer of those \ncommodities. Additionally, South Dakota ranks second in the nation as a \nproducer of sunflowers, flaxseed, hay, and proso millet, and we're \nwithin the top 10 States in wheat production. Obviously, it is critical \nthat we act quickly to move this legislation to the President's desk, \nallow USDA to begin implementation, and let South Dakota producers know \nhow the legislation will affect their operations.\n\n  Americans are the envy of the world because we enjoy the most \naffordable and the safest food, spending only 10 percent of our \nhousehold income on groceries. Yet today, our agricultural producers \nreceive about half the price for crops they pocketed 6 years ago. In \nsome cases, production costs exceed farm income. Furthermore, inclement \nweather has destroyed crop and forage production, while meatpacker \nconcentration, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and unfair trade \nagreements have contributed to the demise of independent producers. \nWithout policy changes to provide a much needed booster-shot to the \nfarm economy, USDA estimates that net farm income in 2002 could drop 20 \npercent, its lowest level since the 1980s farm crisis. Without a new \nfarm bill, our Nation would be unable to provide economic security to \nfarmers, enjoy environmental benefits, and maintain food security and \naffordability. I am hopeful the passage of the Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act will help forestall the economic decline in rural \nAmerica and help farmers, ranchers, and rural communities return to \nprosperity and growth.\n  South Dakota's farmers and ranchers have made it clear to me that \nthey want to derive income from the marketplace, not the government. \nFor that to happen, Congress must mend the income safety-net and \nrestore fair competition to agricultural markets. That is why I worked \nhard in the Senate months ago to include many meaningful provisions in \nthe farm bill, provisions that were priority-items for South Dakota \nproducers. A number of my initiatives were included the final bill in \nsome form, while others were dismissed by the House conferees and \nstripped from this farm bill. In summary, this farm bill meets most, \nbut not all, of the objectives I set out to accomplish when we began to \ndevelop and write the bill last year. Namely, this bill secures the \nincome safety-net for farmers, restores modest market competition for \nlivestock producers, greatly increases our commitment to conservation, \ndevotes more assistance to value-added agriculture and rural \ndevelopment, and focuses new attention to home-grown energy solutions. \nMr. President, this bill provides meaningful reform in farm policy, and \nI'm pleased with a number of provisions.\n  First, the farm bill contains language from S. 280, the Consumer \nRight-to-Know Act, legislation I sponsored to require country-of-origin \nlabeling for beef, lamb, pork, fruits, vegetables, fish, and peanuts. \nDespite strong opposition from the Bush administration, the \nmeatpackers, and other special interests, we prevailed in this effort \nthat I have worked on since I was in the House of Representatives. In \nfact, my first meat labeling bill was introduced in 1992, 10 years ago. \nWestern South Dakota cow-calf ranchers will be proud to know that the \nstandard for ``U.S. beef'' under my provision will require it to come \nfrom cattle born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States, despite \na last-minute campaign by opponents to allow foreign cattle to qualify \nas U.S. beef. Although the labeling program must first undergo a 2-year \nvoluntary implementation period, consumers will eventually be able to \nselect meat and other food products by their country-of-origin at \ngrocery stores. While the House-passed farm bill merely covered fruits \nand vegetables, the Senate-passed bill included an amendment I worked \non with Senator Wellstone to cover meat and other products. The \nconference committee nearly prevented the labeling of meat because it \nwas not in the House farm bill, but, I am pleased that we overcame \ntheir opposition. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of \nthe South Dakota farm organizations for supporting this legislation. \nFurthermore, I wish to commend the national farm and consumer groups \nthat helped lead the way on this effort, including, the National \nFarmers Union, the American Farm Bureau, R-CALF USA, the Consumer \nFederation of America, the National Consumers League, and a host of \nothers too numerous to mention. In fact, over 200 organizations in the \nU.S. have written me in support of this provision. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the \nNational Farmers Union regarding the passage of country-of-origin \nlabeling in the farm bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: On behalf of the 300,000 family farm \n     and ranch members of the National Farmers Union (NFU), I \n     write to commend you for your leadership and your tireless \n     efforts to enact policies that benefit our nation's \n     independent producers.\n       NFU enthusiastically congratulates you on your success in \n     the inclusion of mandatory country of origin labeling for \n     fresh produce and meat products in the conference-agreed farm \n     bill. Unequivocally, this is a hard-won and a hard earned \n     victory for our producers, growers and consumers. We greatly \n     appreciate your steadfast determination in the face of \n     sizable opposition to carry through in conference the \n     provisions of your original bill that require products \n     receiving a U.S. label must be ``born, raised, and \n     slaughtered'' in the U.S.\n       NFU lauds your assiduous efforts to enact a prohibition of \n     packer ownership of livestock. You were the first Senator to \n     introduce the packer ban as stand-alone legislation. And you \n     were a leader in the fight as your legislation gained \n     considerable attention during the farm bill debate, drawing \n     as many supporters from the countryside as opponents in \n     agribusiness. While the large meat packers and agribusiness \n     were able to obstruct the packer ban from being included in \n     the final version of the farm bill, we know the issue remains \n     a priority as both the\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\n     House and the Senate Agriculture Committee Chairmen have \n     stated they will hold hearings. Likewise, the tremendous \n     grassroots support for a ban on packer ownership continues to \n     grow.\n       NFU, again, congratulates your success for country of \n     origin labeling. We look forward to working with you in \n     enacting the packer ban provision as well as other \n     legislation that increases competition and transparency in \n     agricultural markets. You are champion to family farm and \n     ranchers across the country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               David Frederickson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, commodity programs in the new farm bill \nwill furnish America's farmers with three features to secure the farm \nincome safety-net. These commodity programs will maintain the planting \nflexibility so popular under the current program, but, they will also \nprovide more predictable support when prices are low. First, the farm \nbill will continue the practice of providing farmers of program crops \nwith marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency payments, LDPs, to \nhelp them market their crops and manage price risk. These 9-month non-\nrecourse loans provide farmers with the necessary support to make \nmarket-based decisions. Second, the farm bill will also continue to \nprovide de-coupled direct, or fixed, payments to farmers regardless of \nprice or production. The 1996 farm bill first introduced these direct \npayments, known as AMTA or production flexibility contract payments. \nFinally, the farm bill will complement these two payment features with \na new counter-cyclical payment program to provide additional support \nwhen crop prices fall below profitable levels. These new counter-\ncyclical payments will also be de-coupled in a sense, because they're \nnot directly tied to what a farmer plants. I am hopeful the revisions \nmade to commodity programs will help restore and strengthen the safety-\nnet for our agricultural producers.\n  South Dakota farmers will be pleased to know that for the first time \nsince 1981, the farm bill will include a significant increase in loan \nrates which are the basis for marketing assistance loans and LDPs. I \nbelieve that increasing loan rates is one of the best ways to mend the \nfarm income safety-net. First, loan rates are tied to actual \nproduction, instead of decoupled like direct and the new counter-\ncyclical payments. Second, marketing loans are available at harvest, \nwhen prices are historically the lowest during a crop year. Third, \nmarketing loans or LDPs are paid on 100 percent of production, not a \npartial percentage. Fourth, the loans go to actual producers who raise \ncrops, rather than absentee landlords. I am also pleased that producers \nof honey and wool in South Dakota will benefit from the inclusion of \nmarketing loans for their products. This is important because South \nDakota is the Nation's fourth largest honey and sheep producer. \nFinally, I would note that for the very first time, cold season legumes \nsuch as chickpeas, peas, and lentils will receive marketing assistance \nloan support. The inclusion of these so-called pulse crops in the \nmarketing loan program is similar to S. 977, legislation that I \ncosponsored to provide for marketing loans and LDPs for pulse crops. \nCold season legumes are gaining in popularity in South Dakota, and I am \npleased to help provide certainty for farmers wishing to plant them.\n  Individual farmer crop-yields used to calculate support under the \ndirect and counter-cyclical payment programs are critical to South \nDakota's farmers because our yields have dramatically improved in \nrecent years. Despite strong opposition from the House, the new farm \nbill will reward South Dakota farmers for their productivity with a \nmodest yield update permitted for new counter-cyclical payments. This \nis good news for farmers in my State because yields have increased \nsignificantly since the 1981-85 period, a time frame used to base \ndirect payments under the House farm bill and AMTA payments under the \n1996 farm bill. For instance, according to the South Dakota Farm \nService Agency, the House bill would base payments on a 64 bushel-per-\nacre corn yield, but the Senate bill would account for a modern-day 108 \nbushel-per-acre corn crop, a 44-bushel increase to reflect realities in \ncorn production. A corn farmer from Brown County, SD, called my office \njust yesterday to note that his yields are remarkably better than the \nlevels set in the House-passed farm bill. Moreover, the House farm bill \nwould base wheat payments on a 24 bushel-per-acre wheat yield, yet most \nwheat farmers in South Dakota produce wheat crops yielding \napproximately 36 bushels-to-the-acre today. Wheat producers in Stanley \nCounty would agree that given a choice, they'd rather operate under the \nrules of the Senate bill which rewards them for yield improvements. The \nfinal agreement will allow farmers to use updated and proven yields \nfrom the last four years and apply a 93.5-percent factor to that \nupdated yield for their counter-cyclical payments. While the new \ncounter-cyclical payments may be made based upon these updated yields, \nthe fact that the House forced the conference committee to not update \nyields for direct payments is a significant and costly problem that \nwill take money out the pockets of South Dakota farmers and continue to \nprovide the bulk of direct payments to large cotton and rice operations \nin the South. According to calculations by the South Dakota Farm \nService Agency, if the final farm bill had rewarded farmers by allowing \nthem to prove-up modern-day yields to base direct payments, as the \nSenate bill did, then these payments to South Dakota producers would \nhave doubled from $135 million to $271 million per year. While ordinary \nobservers may not think a yield update is a crucial element in the farm \nbill, consider the following. If the new farm bill froze crop yields at \nlevels in the House bill, farmers in South Dakota would be forced to \nuse yield data nearly 30 years old by the time this farm bill expires, \nmeaning young farmers may be using data older than they are to \ncalculate price support.\n\n  I am very pleased that under the new farm bill conservation programs \nwill experience the most significant amount of funding ever in a farm \nbill, an 80-percent increase over current levels. I believe farm \nprograms should place more emphasis on conservation initiatives that \nbenefit crop farmers, livestock producers, and American taxpayers, who \nrealize tangible benefits from clean air, clean water, and more \nwildlife habitat. I fought to increase our investment in conservation \nbecause I desire to help farmers keep lands in working condition while \nprotecting our soil, water, and habitat. The most popular conservation \nprogram, the Conservation Reserve Program, CRP, will be expanded from \n36.4 to 39.2 million acres under the new farm bill. I am pleased to \nnote that the Farmable Wetlands Program, the Conservation Security \nProgram, the new Grasslands Reserve Program, and a new-and-improved \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, will all be in the \nfinal farm bill as well. Inclusion of the Farmable Wetlands program is \nmodeled after the pilot legislation I authored in 2000, S. 2980, the \nConservation of Farmable Wetlands Act. The continuation of this program \nwill ensure farmable wetlands are eligible for enrollment in the \nConservation Security Program Chairman Harkin included in the farm bill \nis similar to S. 932, the Conservation Security Act that Senator Harkin \nand I sponsored. These programs provide a positive contribution to the \nstability of our delicate ecosystem, while providing landowners and \nproducers adequate incentives to participate. It is also important to \nnote that if the United States is planning to continue working within \nthe World Trade Organization conservation programs provide so-called \ngreen payments to producers that do not violate spending limitations \nestablished by the WTO.\n\n  I worked with Chairman Harkin in developing the new and innovative \nidea for an ``energy title'' in the Senate farm bill because it's time \nto recognize that U.S. farmers and ranchers can help develop home-grown \nsolutions to energy problems. While the House-passed farm bill did not \ninclude this energy title, the final farm bill will contain one for the \nvery first time. It will launch a number of new initiatives, including \na biobased products purchasing requirement for Federal agencies if the \nproducts are comparable in price, performance, and availability to \ntraditional products. The farm bill will also establish a new program \nto educate consumers about the benefits of bio-diesel use. Moreover, \nthe energy title will provide grants and loans to farmers, ranchers and \nrural small businesses for renewable energy systems\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\nand energy efficiency improvements, and, a complementary grant and loan \nprogram is established so that farmers, ranchers, and rural small \nbusinesses can purchase renewable energy systems and make energy \nefficiency improvements. Importantly, the bill will provide $204 \nmillion over 6 years for the Bio-Energy Program, similar to S. 1960, \nthe Bio-based Energy Incentives Act of 2002 that I cosponsored. My \nprovision in the farm bill will reimburse existing and new ethanol and \nbiodiesel facilities for using commodities to produce renewable fuels. \nA total of 42 ethanol plants and 12 bio-diesel facilities in 19 States \nreceived payments under this program last year. Ethanol plants such as \nHeartland Grains Fuels in Huron and Aberdeen, Broin's in Scotland, and \nDakota Energy in Wentworth were South Dakota's recipients. This year, \nthree new ethanol projects in Milbank, Watertown, and Rosholt, SD, are \npoised to collectively produce nearly 100 million gallons of ethanol. \nBecause my legislation was included in the final farm bill, they will \nbenefit from this incredible program.\n  Agriculture is entering an exciting new dimension with value-added \nproduction and processing, and I have fought to ensure the energy and \nrural development titles of the farm bill will collectively help South \nDakota create more success stories in value-added agriculture. When \nagricultural producers capture a more significant share of profits by \nadding value to their commodities or livestock before they are sold, \nit's called value-added agriculture. South Dakota has quickly become a \nleader in ethanol production, and given the number of projects \noperating in the state or at various planning stages, we're poised to \nproduce over 200 million gallons annually. A typical 40 million gallon \nethanol plant in South Dakota will provide a new market for nearly 15 \nmillion bushels of corn, provide jobs and over $1 million in annual \npayroll, and help South Dakota farmers become part-owners of the United \nStates' energy supply. The new farm bill may help create several of \nthese ethanol plants, which will multiply the financial benefits and \nput thousands of South Dakota farmers in a better economic condition. \nSouth Dakotans are working hard to create a new value-added agriculture \nsector beyond our growing ethanol industry, including projects such as \nsoybean processing, dairy cooperatives, beef and pork marketing co-ops, \nand venture capital initiatives. From the fledgling Dakota Value \nCapture Co-op in Sully County to the existing South Dakota Soybean \nProcessors plant in Volga, farmers will be able to capitalize upon the \nassistance in this bill to become price setters rather than price \ntakers.\n\n  A recent study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that farmers \nand ranchers are expected to lose 328,000 jobs over the next ten years, \nmore than any other sector of the economy. Given this startling \nforecast, the attention this farm bill places on rural development and \njob growth is critical to the future of rural States such as South \nDakota. The farm bill contains a rural development title which will \nhelp foster positive results for communities and rural citizens. I am \nvery pleased the Value Added Agricultural Market Development Grants \nprogram will receive a total of $240 million--$40 million annually--to \nprovide crucial grant assistance to value-added agriculture ventures. \nWhile the funding level for this program was $75 million annually in \nthe Senate bill, it's important to keep it in the farm bill. Another \nbenefit of this rural development title is the establishment of the \nNorthern Great Plains regional authority, as provided for in S. 1681, \nmy legislation to re-authorize the Northern Great Plains Rural \nDevelopment Authority. As a result, South Dakota is one of five States \nthat will have access to $30 million per fiscal year to provide grants \nto States in the Northern Great Plains Authority for projects including \ntransportation and telecommunication infrastructure projects, business \ndevelopment and entrepreneurship, and job training.\n  Also, for the first time, the farm bill will help provide $80 million \nfor rural citizens to access local television stations via satellite. \nThis program provides loan guarantees to launch satellite systems that \nprovide critical and timely news and weather to rural residents via \ntheir satellite. The LOCAL TV Act and loan guarantee begun because of \nlegislation I sponsored in 2000, S. 2097, the Satellite Home Viewer \nAct. We also must strive to bridge the digital divide, and the \ninclusion of $100 million for broadband service will allow rural \ncitizens to receive high-speed, quality broadband service.\n  As an original co-sponsor of S. 1111, I am very pleased to report to \nSouth Dakotans that a new National Rural Development Partnership Act \nwas included as a part of the rural development title as well. I \nbelieve it is important for local coordination to be a part of the \nlarger national strategy to enhance rural development. The entire State \nof South Dakota is considered rural, and in many places it is \ncritically depressed. Through this new program, rural economic \ndevelopment efforts will utilize the expertise of Federal agency \nofficials and dedicated local officials. Too often, the facilitation \nand implementation of rural development initiatives does not reach its \nfull potential because of the lack of local participation. The primary \ngoal of this new program is to engage in meaningful conversions that \nwill allow for the greatest success of all rural development \ninitiatives. South Dakota will be a true benefactor of the new National \nRural Development Partnership, and I am honored to have been a part of \nits establishment.\n  The farm bill is not only supportive of crop farmers and rural \ncommunities, it also authorizes essential nutrition and food assistance \nprograms. I am pleased that a provision of mine was included that will \nessentially save school lunch programs all over the country $100 \nmillion over the next 2 years. S. 1179, the Emergency Commodity \nDistribution Act, is my legislation included in the farm bill to fix \nthe way that commodities are calculated for the school lunch program. \nWhile not large in overall budget terms, this fix contained in my \nlegislation and the final farm bill will result in important stability \nfor South Dakota and nationwide school lunch programs. Moreover, the \nfarm bill continues the great progress made by the McGovern-Dole Global \nFood for Education Initiative, a program that I helped create by \nserving as an original co-sponsor of S. 1036, the bill that codified \nthe incredible idea former Senators McGovern and Dole had for an \ninternational food for education and child nutrition program. Finally, \nthe nutrition title will restore Food Stamp Program benefits for all \nlegal immigrants who have lived in the United States for at least 5 \nyears, and the immediate restoration of food stamp benefits to legal \nimmigrant children and the disabled. This provision was a bipartisan \nendeavor, with President Bush helping to lead the way for this reform.\n\n  I am also pleased the farm bill will re-authorize farm lending \nprograms and provide greater access to credit for beginning farmers and \nranchers. Under the final bill, USDA will increase its share of down \npayment loans for beginning farmers and extend the term of the loans. \nAdditionally, the bill will furnish $1.3 billion over 6 years for \nresearch programs such as those successfully carried out by land-grant \ncolleges like South Dakota State University.\n  Also of interest to South Dakota is the creation of a new national \ndairy program, to replace the controversial compacts that divided dairy \nfarmers between regions of the country. This is critical for new dairy \noperations in eastern South Dakota, and dairy processing facilities \nsuch as the new cheese plant hoping to begin operations near Lake \nNorden. In addition to extending the very important dairy price support \nprogram at $9.90 per hundredweight, the farm bill creates a new \ncounter-cyclical program that will provide assistance to farmers when \nthe price of milk falls below $16.94 per hundredweight. We in the Upper \nMidwest have argued over the years that all dairy farmers should be \ntreated the same regardless of the end use of their milk and I am \npleased that this bill supports that position.\n  Despite these and other farm policy improvements, special interests \nprevailed upon the House conferees to eliminate a number of important \ninitiatives from the final farm bill. As a result, Mr. President, I am \nvery disappointed that the final farm bill may result in long-term \nproblems for rural America.\n  First, the farm bill won't include my ``Johnson Amendment'' to ban \npacker\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\nownership of livestock. The opposition from the House conferees and \npacker-apologists was overwhelming according to Senator Daschle and \nothers on the conference committee. In the end, it appears the fact \nthat the House did nothing on this topic resulted in it's defeat in the \nconference committee. The Johnson amendment to ban packer ownership of \nslaughter livestock and the new ``Competition Title'' were necessary \nbecause the national food industry continues to grow economically while \nindependent livestock producers receive a small share of the consumer \nfood dollar. Horizontal and vertical integration have tipped the \nbalance of market power in favor of major meatpacking firms at the \nexpense of family-sized livestock producers. While the Competition \nTitle was narrowly defeated in the Senate Agriculture Committee, we \nconquered well-funded opposition twice during Senate consideration of \nthe farm bill and added my packer ownership provision to the Senate \nbill. Many livestock producers in South Dakota told me that the packer \nownership ban was one of the most important farm bill items. Despite \nbipartisan Senate support and an affirmative vote by Senate farm bill \nconferees the House of Representatives unanimously objected and the \nprovision was stripped from the final farm bill. While the opponents of \nmaking livestock markets more competitive are probably celebrating the \ndefeat of my Johnson amendment in the farm bill conference, it's \ncritical that Congress demonstrate leadership and a willingness to act \non this issue in a timely manner. I have already written Chairman \nHarkin to call for hearings in the Senate Agriculture Committee to \ninvestigate problems in the marketplace and to once again pass my \npacker ownership ban. I wish to thank the many South Dakota farm and \nranch organizations that provided real leadership on this issue, along \nwith the Organization for Competitive Markets and Senator Grassley. \nTogether, we will continue the fight.\n\n  While my country-of-origin labeling bill was included in the final \nfarm bill, the provision to prevent USDA quality grades from being \napplied to foreign beef and lamb was left on the cutting room floor. \nIt's discouraging to South Dakota's cattle and sheep ranchers that \ntheir high-quality meat has to compete with foreign beef and lamb which \nis camouflaged with a USDA choice or prime seal. I vow to continue to \nfight for a change that will only allow USDA quality grades on domestic \nbeef and lamb.\n  Also, the House insisted on changes to the payment limits provision I \ncosponsored in the Senate that virtually render the payment limits \nmeaningless. The new farm bill weakens what are already flawed payment \nlimitations and may provide a larger share of payments to the Nation's \nmega-farms than any other farm bill in history. While the overall limit \nwas reduced from the House level in the conference committee--the House \nlimit was $560,000 and Senate was $275,000 the inclusion of the \n``triple entity rule'' will allow large farms to double their $180,000 \npayment to $360,000. Furthermore, the farm bill imposes no real limit \non gains from marketing assistance loans because large farms can \nreceive unlimited marketing loan gains through use of generic \ncertificates. The Center for Rural Affairs has estimated that a 25,000-\nacre California cotton farm would receive $8.4 million, thanks to the \nmeaningless limits in this bill. While the bill was debated on the \nSenate floor, an overwhelming majority approved the Dorgan-Grassley-\nJohnson amendment to forestall large corporate farms from receiving \nthese huge government subsidies at the expense of family farm \noperations. Yet the House provision contained virtually no limits on \nthese payments. The integrity of this bill and future farm legislation \nis dependent upon common sense limitations. We cannot expect the \nAmerican taxpayer to continue subsidizing corporate farms who take \nadvantage of programs that are intended to assist small family farmers. \nI was pleased to see that the language includes a $2.5 million adjusted \ngross income cap on eligibility for participation in farm programs and \nthat some level of transparency will be included. Hopefully, this will \nshed light on those operations abusing the program. A new commission \nwill also be established to study and make recommendations regarding \nfarm program payment limitations and the impact of payment limit policy \nchanges on farm income, land values and agribusiness infrastructures. I \nvow to continue working with groups such as the Center for Rural \nAffairs and Senators Grassley and Dorgan to address this issue in the \nfuture.\n\n  Finally, the White House and House opposition to the $2.4 billion in \nemergency aid for the 2001 crop year led to its defeat in the final \nbill. I cosponsored Senator Baucus' amendment to include this important \ndisaster aid in the Senate farm bill because several agricultural \nproducers in South Dakota experienced weather-related disasters that \ndamaged crop and forage production last year. In fact, 13 counties in \nwestern and central South Dakota have been declared a drought disaster \nby USDA, and yet the Senate language to include this timely assistance \nwas killed. Congress has provided ad hoc disaster assistance to farmers \nsince 1998, but, without this provision, we will have disregarded \nlosses occurring in 2001. I am hopeful we can identify ways to include \nthis necessary disaster funding in another bill.\n  I cannot talk about this farm bill without publicly thanking the \nmembers of my staff who have worked so hard on this legislation for \nmany months. I can confidently say that the Senate version of the farm \nbill, and ultimately this conference report, would not have been as \ngood as it was without the efforts of my Legislative Assistant for \nagriculture issues, Brian Jennings. Brian's tireless effort for many \nmonths, and frankly over most of the past 3 years, was a major factor \nin my country of origin labeling provision being adopted by the full \nSenate and then included in the conference report as I have referred to \nearlier. And it was with Brian's help that my amendment to ban packer \nownership of livestock was adopted by the Senate. The long days, nights \nand even many weekends that Brian has worked during consideration of \nthis farm bill have paid off in many of the positive improvements this \nfarm bill makes over the current farm bill passed in 1996. Brian has \nworked closely with Senator Daschle's staff, Senator Harkin's \nAgriculture Committee staff, and staff from Senator's who serve on the \nAgriculture Committee on both sides of the aisle. I also want to \ncommend those staff members as well, as the Senate would simply not be \nable to function without the dedication and true public service \nprovided by all of our staff members.\n  Brian has worked on agriculture issues as a member of my staff since \n1998, and he has been instrumental in the success my office has had in \nfighting for South Dakota's family farmers and ranchers. And for those \nwho know Brian, this comes as no surprise. He grew up working on his \nfamily's ranch in Stanley County, SD, near Ft. Pierre, and his first-\nhand understanding of family farmers and ranchers in South Dakota is in \npart what makes him such an outstanding and effective advocate for all \nfamily farmers and ranchers here in the Nation's Capital. Brian's \nparents, Keith and Patti Jennings, should be very proud of Brian, as \nhis upbringing by them on the Jennings' Ranch is the main reason he has \nbeen such an effective and strong advocate for South Dakota's farm and \nranch families.\n  I also want to thank Sharon Stroschein of my Aberdeen, SD, staff, and \nKaty Ziegler of my Washington, DC staff. Sharon and her husband Larry \nStroschein operate their family farm near Mansfield, SD, in Spink \nCounty. Sharon is one of my original South Dakota staff members after I \nwas elected to the House of Representatives in 1986. Her first-hand \nknowledge and understanding of South Dakota agriculture have been \ninvaluable to me over the years as I do my best to represent South \nDakota in the United States Senate. Katy Ziegler grew up on a farm in \nMinnesota, and although she only joined my Washington staff last year, \nher farm background has also helped her to provide critical insights on \nmany issues that have been helpful to me and members of my staff during \nconsideration of the farm bill.\n  I will conclude my statement by saying that while a farm bill is not \na cure-all, the new farm bill should be a long-term economic stimulus \npackage for family farmers, ranchers and rural communities. Whether you \nsupport or\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\noppose this farm bill, it's important to pause and determine whether \nthe bill will provide a greater optimism about what family-farm \nagriculture will look like in the future. In some ways, I believe this \nfarm bill will indeed create a brighter future for family farmers and \nranchers, but without more meaningful reforms to meatpacker \nconcentration and payment limitations, I am uncertain whether the long-\nterm result will be as favorable as what is necessary to keep \nindependent producers on the land.\n  According to a preliminary analysis by the Food and Agricultural \nPolicy Research Institute, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nwill provide South Dakota farmers with an increase of approximately \n$200 million in benefits over the current farm bill for the 2002 crop \nyear. Moreover, after passage of the House farm bill last year, FAPRI \ndetermined that South Dakota farmers would receive the second lowest \npercentage increase in payments under the House farm bill among all 50 \nstates. Therefore, despite this bill's shortcomings, it is certainly \nbetter for South Dakota than the current farm bill and the House-passed \nversion, which catered to mega-farm agriculture and agri-business.\n  In the final analysis, independent farmers and ranchers in our free-\nenterprise democracy deserve the opportunity to make a living from the \ncommodities they produce in fair and competitive markets. I will \ncontinue to fight in the Senate to provide that opportunity and reduce \nthe obscene market power that is becoming all too common in crop and \nlivestock markets.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I speak today on a matter that touches the lives of every single \nMontanan. We have experienced 4 years straight in a row of ongoing \ndrought conditions.\n  I rise today not to oppose the farm bill conference--I support it--\nbut, rather, to express my extreme disappointment that a natural \ndisaster assistance provision which would provide real help to American \nfamily farmers suffering from drought is not included in the conference \nreport.\n  Not too long ago, I, along with Senator Enzi, offered a bipartisan \namendment to the Senate farm bill that passed by an overwhelming 69 \nvotes. That amendment provided funding for the Crop Disaster Program \nand for the Livestock Assistance Program.\n  This is not an idle matter. There are some from some States in the \ncountry who may not appreciate the gravity of the situation we face in \nthe West. It is severe. Our Nation's agricultural producers are holding \ntheir breath, particularly in my State of Montana. I was at home over \nthe weekend. You could feel it.\n  They want to know if this agricultural disaster is going to be in the \nfarm bill. They care about the farm bill. They care much more about \nwhether agricultural disaster assistance is or is not included; that \nis, the agricultural disaster assistance for last year, 2001, where the \ncrops were devastated. As I mentioned, it is 1 of 4 years in a row of \ndrought.\n  Let me be clear. Without this assistance provision in the farm bill, \nit really won't matter very much because farms are going to go under. \nWe are talking about saving long-time family farmers and long-time \nranchers whose generations have been farming. They just want to make a \nliving.\n  On March 28 of this year, Agriculture Secretary Veneman declared the \nentire State of Montana a drought disaster. This drought designation \ncame 2 months earlier than the designation in the previous year of 2001 \nand 8 months earlier than the same designation in the year 2000.\n  While our State picture is dire, it is even worse in some of the \nindividual communities. It is bad enough statewide, but in some areas \nit is just desperate.\n  In May of 1930, the Knees Weather Station, which is approximately 30 \nmiles from Brady, MT, located in the central part of our State, \nregistered 1.17 inches of precipitation. That is May 1930, the Dust \nBowl years--1.17 inches. In May of last year, the year for which \ndrought disaster assistance is so desperately needed, the same station \nregistered 0.16 inches of precipitation--about 10 times less than the \n1.17 in the 1930s.\n  I want to graphically show you what drought is doing to my State. \nThese pictures are courtesy of the Great Falls Tribune which has been \nchronicling this drought for a good period of time. This is the Golden \nTriangle, the so-called breadbasket of our State. I have gone out many \ntimes into the fields and kicked the soil. It is bone dry. There is \nnothing there. I have talked to ranchers and farmers in farm forums in \nShelby, Havre, and Conrad, where the drought is drying up hope, closing \ndown businesses, and forcing bankers to close their lines of credit. It \nis just getting worse.\n  These pictures show the problem. Some old-timers say it reminds them \nof the Dust Bowl days in the 1930s.\n  This picture shows Mark Peterson. Mark is a very good farmer. He \nfarms just north of Havre of Hill County. In this picture, he is taking \na core sample of soil to look at the moisture in the field he is \nseeding. This is what Mark said:\n\n       In the late 1970's and early 1980's, you couldn't do \n     anything wrong. Farming was fun. Right now it's hell.\n\n  This picture shows the moisture content. He goes down for the soil \nsample. It is not just the surface, but the subsurface soil content. It \nis lower than he has ever seen.\n  Here is what the Great Falls Tribune wrote, which is one of the \nlargest papers in our State:\n\n       Experts are predicting a harvest more disastrous than last \n     year's record-low winter wheat crop. Instead of admiring \n     their seedlings this spring, farmers in north-central \n     Montana's Golden Triangle are watching their topsoil swirl \n     away in the wind. As dust storms blow down Main Street, \n     agriculture-businesses are talking about layoffs and bankers \n     are running out of slack for debt-ridden farm families.\n       Congress has yet to pass a disaster payment to cover last \n     year's failed crops. Many producers are banking on the money \n     to pay off last year's operating loans. Without the Federal \n     assistance and a decent harvest, 2002 could be the end of the \n     line for some producers.\n\n  This photo shows Mark Peterson seeding winter wheat north of Havre. \nThis picture does not do justice to the problem.\n  I was home last weekend. This is dust blowing all across the highway, \nwhich is 20 or 30 miles south of where this picture was taken. I \ncouldn't believe it. I have seen nothing like this.\n  This next picture is a photo that shows a Liberty County employee.\n  Liberty County is supposed to be a very large wheat-producing area in \nour State. What is Al Green, a Liberty County employee, doing? He is \nclearing a culvert that is supposed to carry water. It is carrying \ndust. The culvert is being filled with topsoil. You can barely see the \nculvert. In fact, he had to dig it out; otherwise, the culvert would be \nfull of soil from the blowing dust.\n  Here is a another example. This chart shows a makeshift fence just \nsouth of Chester in Liberty County. That is also in the north-central \npart of Montana. I was there a short while ago. I walked out in the \nfields. It pulls at your heart. It is so sad, so tragic to see there is \nnothing there, to see people not making it. The soil just crumbles in \nyour fingers.\n  As you can see, here are the fences. This fence is about 3\\1/2\\ to 4 \nfeet high. Why is it there? The farmer is trying to desperately save \ntopsoil from blowing away. Clearly, you can't keep topsoil from blowing \naway unless you have a crop, unless you have moisture. But in this \ncase, it is gone. He is losing his topsoil.\n  The unrelenting drought in my State has brought economic hardship not \nonly to agricultural producers but to very widespread areas of the \nState. In 1996--just a few years ago--the year before the 4-year \ndrought kicked in, Montana received $847 million in cash receipts from \nwheat sales. In 2001, 4 years into the drought, we received not $847 \nmillion but $317 million in cash receipts. That is a 62-percent \ndecline. Why? Drought.\n  It is true a lot of farmers have crop insurance. That is a critical \nrisk management tool widely used by Montana producers. But, \nunfortunately, crop insurance coverage declines during consecutive \nyears of drought because a decline in actual production history\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\nmeans your coverage is less. That is the way the law is written. It is \na vicious circle. So the producers maintain their insurance, but they \nhave crop insurance that provides virtually laughable coverage.\n  Agriculture is about 50 percent of Montana's economy. It is the \nbackbone of our State. The drought affects not only farmers and \nranchers, it is felt throughout the rural communities. It means a loss \nof jobs. Small businesses are forced to close their doors.\n  For example, in the first 3 months of 2002, feed sales were down \nabout 20 percent. That is an indication that there are fewer livestock \nin the area.\n  Take Fort Benton, an average-sized agricultural community. About 80 \npercent of Fort Benton's businesses are agriculture related. Clearly, \nproducers are suffering. The town suffers. Those who sell agricultural \nequipment--for example tractor dealers--close their doors.\n  Here is a farmer I would like you to listen to: Dale Schuler, past \npresident of the Montana Grain Growers, and a farmer in Chouteau \nCounty, MT. He estimated nearly 2,000 square miles of crop in his area \nof central Montana have gone unharvested. So 2,000 square miles, in a \npart of Montana which usually produces tremendous wheat yields, has \ngone unharvested. That is about equal to the area of your State. An \narea the size of your State has gone unharvested in Montana. The entire \nState has gone unharvested.\n  As Dale said:\n\n       Farmers and our families haven't had the means to repay our \n     operating loans, let alone buy inputs to plant the crop for \n     the coming year. Chouteau County is the largest farming \n     county in Montana. And yet our last farm equipment dealer [in \n     the community] had no choice but to close his doors. Our \n     local co-op closed its tire shop. One farm fuel supplier \n     quit. And the fertilizer dealers and grain elevators are \n     laying off workers. I believe that we are set to see a \n     mass exodus from Montana that has not been seen since the \n     Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\n  I have talked to a lot of farmers in this area. I asked them to \nhonestly compare this situation to the 1930s. Their answer was, \n``worse.'' These are honest people. I asked them, why? They said, \nbecause during the 1930s, there was 1 year in between the drought years \nwhere it rained. There was moisture. And so some could hang on. We have \nnot had that interval year of moisture. It has been consecutive. So \nwhen it does rain now a little bit, were it to rain this year, it sinks \ndown. The moisture just keeps going down. It does not stay in the \ntopsoil.\n  Our creeks and lakes are drying up. They are gone.\n  Some people are wondering: Gee, haven't we all passed a big farm \nbill? Doesn't that help? The answer is that it does help. It is there \nto mitigate against future agriculture disaster assistance payments. \nThat is one point of the farm program. But it does not help Montana \nfarmers or other farmers in the Nation.\n  For last year, 2001, there was no farm bill that made any sense \nwhatsoever, there were no payments that made any sense to farmers, and \ncrop insurance didn't work, for the reasons I mentioned. And this is \nnot just in my State of Montana.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if you saw last Friday's New York Times, the \nfront page. There was a photograph of the drought in the West. It was \nnot Montana; it was another State. It was the same situation but in \nother States. There was a photograph very similar to this one I have in \nthe Chamber. It was on the front page of the New York Times last \nFriday. I encourage you to look at it.\n  One final point. We in the Congress have helped New York in times of \ndesperate tragedy. We came to the rescue of New York, as we should \nhave, and as we did, without reservation. It was the right thing to do. \nWe are one country. We also have come to the aid and assistance of \nother needs in this country. There are lots of different examples. I \ncould think of flooding in America. We have come to help out in that \nregard. It is very important.\n  Here is another disaster we are facing. I know Senators from urban \nStates do not quite understand it, just like we from the western States \ndo not fully appreciate the devastation of New York City. But we are \nhere together. We have helped New York. We will continue to help areas \nin distress.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember, we are one Nation. In our part of \nthe country, the north-central States desperately need help. A good \nexample of that, this is a map of January of this year. The red \nindicates severe drought. So it is not just Montana, but it is also \nWyoming.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Montana and Idaho and Wyoming are shown on the map in \nred, which means severe. But also look at parts of Texas, Oklahoma, \nKansas, and New Mexico, look at the eastern seaboard, and these yellow \nareas, which are areas that are strained. We all know that since \nJanuary--actually, this is dated December 8, 2001, to January 10, \n2002--it has been worse. A little intermittent moisture here and there, \nbut it is worse.\n  So I say to my colleagues, I support the conference report to the \nfarm bill. I deeply regret that the other body did not agree to include \nagricultural disaster assistance in the bill, even though it was \nadopted in the Senate with 69 votes.\n  I pledge to my people in Montana that I am going to use every ounce \nof energy at my command to get agricultural disaster assistance \nlegislation passed this year, because our people so desperately need \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to sit back and listen and be supportive of what \nwe need so much in our part of the country.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my good friend, the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am going to yield some time from Senator \nLugar's time to Senator Voinovich in a moment.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana, first, for being a valuable member \nof our Agriculture Committee, and thank him for all of his hard work \nand his input in developing this farm bill.\n  The Senator from Montana is correct. He did succeed in putting in in \nthe committee this emergency funding which not only helped Montana but \nall these other parts of the country. We kept it here in the Senate. We \nwent to conference, but we were told in the conference that both the \nadministration and the House opposed it in the farm bill. So, \ntherefore, we were not able to keep it as we came out of conference.\n  We were told that if we were to come up with an emergency package, \nthat would be different, that they would support that outside of the \nregular farm bill.\n  I assure the Senator from Montana, as soon as this farm bill is over \nwith, that as the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I will try to \nbring our committee together, hopefully, as early as next week, to, \nonce again, mark up an emergency disaster relief bill and to get it on \nthe floor as soon as possible.\n  The Senator from Montana is right. When we have a hurricane that hits \nFlorida, if we have a tornado that hits Oklahoma or Iowa, we come in \nwith emergency disaster assistance. The drought that hit these areas of \nthe country that the Senator from Montana spoke about is the same as a \nhurricane, tornado, or fire. It is a disaster that we, as a nation, \nshould respond to with emergency funding. I assure the Senator from \nMontana, we are going to do everything we can to make sure we do that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield, I very much thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee. He has put in such \nlong hours to get a good agriculture bill passed and working through \nthe conference. It is above and beyond the call of duty.\n  I thank the Senator very much for his indication of holding a hearing \nsoon in the Agriculture Committee and reporting out a bill that gets \ndisaster assistance to the people in our State.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have had the hearings. We just need to mark it up.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the chairman helping out.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes off the Senator's time \nto Senator Voinovich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today as a friend of agriculture \nfrom one of our Nation's leading agriculture States to oppose the farm \nbill\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\nconference report currently before us. It is too expensive, doesn't \nhelp those it claims to help, refuses to acknowledge the other \npriorities and challenges currently facing our nation, and will only \nworsen the problems with overproduction which it seeks to remedy.\n  According to the most recent numbers from CBO, this bill authorizes \nat least $180 billion in mandatory spending over the next 10 years, an \n$83 billion increase over existing programs. Increases such as this--an \n80 percent spending boost--are irresponsible during times like this and \ntotally ignore that we are at war abroad, trying to strengthen our \nhomeland defense against terrorism and that our economy is in trouble. \nWhen you have a situation like this you've got to set priorities and \nstick to them, even if they force you to make hard choices.\n  If Congress approves this conference report, it is sending a message \nto the American people that fiscal responsibility no longer matters, \nalthough our record in the last couple of years should give them a clue \nthat we are not a fiscally responsible Senate.\n  The Cleveland Plain Dealer said it best in its editorial yesterday, \n``No Republican who votes for [this bill] can ever say with a straight \nface that he or she believes in limited government or market economics. \nNo Democrat can hold that she or he believes in balancing the budget or \npreventing runaway spending.'' I agree.\n  The Senate should not approve this bill today, but rather we should \nsend it back to the conference committee from where it came and we \nshould tell them to make the cuts in spending necessary to fit this \nbill into the new reality we're facing in this country.\n  I agree with my colleague from Ohio, Congressman John Boehner, a \nmember of the House Agriculture Committee who served on the Conference, \nwho said last week in a press release, and I quote:\n\n       We should pass a supplemental aid bill now to help farmers \n     during this year's crop season. And once the November \n     elections are over--when sound, long-term policy takes \n     precedence over Washington politics--we should revisit the \n     Farm bill and make the right choices for Ohio and the nation.\n\n  I take a back seat to no one in terms of my concern for the American \nfarmer. I am pleased that I was referred to as the ``Ag Governor.'' \nWhen I was Governor of Ohio, agribusiness was my number one economic \ndevelopment initiative. Many people--even Ohioans--don't realize that \nfood and agribusiness means more than $73 billion to Ohio's economy \neach year. In fact, one in six Ohioans is employed in one aspect of \nagriculture or another.\n  Nevertheless, I cannot support this conference report, and honestly, \nI am disappointed at the apparent lack of respect some of my colleagues \nseem to have for the American farmer.\n  Every farmer worth his salt knows that if he or she wants to stay in \nbusiness, they have to be fiscally responsible and make tough choices. \nFarmers are some of the most fiscally disciplined people in business \nand they know that the United States has to be fiscally disciplined as \nwell. They understand that the farm bill does not focus on proper \nplanning and making the right choices, but rather ``getting while the \ngetting is good.''\n  This bill dispenses with any lip service toward fiscal conservatism \nand the other obligations our Nation now faces and plunges full speed \nahead with spending. It is heedless of Americas national security \nneeds, and it does nothing to acknowledge the long-term fiscal \nresponsibilities of our Nation. Instead, this conference report really \njust helps the Nation's agricultural conglomerates receive lots of \nmoney from the Federal treasury. It's an enormous transfer of wealth. \nIt's really that simple.\n  Gone are our efforts to let farmers operate in a free market economy \nand benefit from their own choices. We're turning our back on the \nmarket-oriented philosophy laid out in the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act \nwhich sought to wean farmers from large Government subsidies. And yes, \nin a free market there will be winners and losers, but the free market \nis what has made this country great, and it is what can make \nagriculture thrive if we let it operate without Government \ninterference.\n  Instead, when the waves of economic change get a little rough, \nCongress tries to retreat into the safe harbor of Government handouts \nin the expectation that it will solve the problem. The real truth is, \nhowever, that this will only worsen the problem. The effect of this \nlegislation will be to encourage production resulting in commodity \nsurpluses, lower prices, and the need for greater government support.\n  And I'm not just talking about small farmers. The bill includes \nheightened incentives for large agribusinesses to overproduce as they \nseek to maximize the Federal subsidies for which they are eligible. The \nresult will be continuing downward pressure on prices and continuing \ncalls for emergency farm rescue legislation. When will we end this \ncycle and truly set our farmers free to work as they see fit and \nrespond to the changing market with their own judgment, skill, and hard \nwork?\n  The agriculture community in my State recognizes this trap and has \ntold me that this bill sends the wrong message to farmers by \nencouraging farmers to grow for the program and not for the market.\n  Many of my colleagues constantly discuss how this bill so effectively \nmeets the needs of America's small farmer. As the Cincinnati Post so \neloquently responded to that claim in its editorial yesterday, ``That \nis hogwash.''\n  This bill does nothing to help the small farmer, but rather penalizes \nthe small farmer--the supposed beneficiary of this bill. There is no \neffective payment cap, which will continue to allow large \nagroindustrial operations to continue to reap millions of federal \ndollars in subsidies, perhaps using them to buy out small family \nfarmers in the end.\n  The majority of America's farms do not benefit from Federal \nsubsidies, and the formulas created in this bill will result in 10 \npercent of the producers getting two-thirds of the money.\n  To make matters worse, I was disappointed to read in the Akron Beacon \nJournal that this bill includes a provision that would protect payments \nmade under this program from public scrutiny. I believe that it is \nimportant for the American taxpayer to have access to information \nregarding how their tax dollars are spent.\n  I also believe that the specific programs in this farm bill \ndemonstrate very little understanding of the broader needs of American \ntaxpayers. It is a regional rip-off that includes new program payments \nfor sugar, peanut, and dairy producers. It also increases the payments \nto large cotton, rice, corn, wheat, and soybeans producers. Finally, it \nrevives programs which were terminated in the 1996 Farm bill--the \nhoney, wool and mohair payments.\n  Additionally, I am concerned that this bill could have a devastating \neffect on farm exports. The formula for countercyclical payments \nincluded in this bill could place us in jeopardy of violating our \nobligations under the World Trade Organization and weaken our demands \nthat Europe and other countries cut subsidy payments to their \nagricultural producers.\n  The conference report does include a mechanism for the Secretary of \nAgriculture to cut off payments if it appears that we are in danger of \nviolating our WTO obligations. Is it reasonable to expect that a \npolitical appointee will have the strength necessary to make this \ndecision?\n  For that reason alone the Bush administration should veto this \nconference report.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ncomment that this legislation does not present a budget problem because \nit is within the budget parameters outlined in the FY2002 Budget \nResolution. I disagree.\n  The new budgetary outlook argues against the bill.\n  Late last year, as the Senate began debating the farm bill that \nultimately passed the Senate, Senator Kent Conrad, the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, who clearly must understand our countrys \nfinancial condition, said, ``the money is in the budget now. If we do \nnot use the money . . . it is very likely not going to be available \nnext year.'' He was more prophetic than he could have ever imagined.\n  When we passed the budget resolution last year and allocated $83.5 \nbillion to reauthorize the farm bill, the budget outlook appeared much \nbrighter than it now does. At that time it\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\nlooked like we had surpluses as far as the eye could see.\n  Well, my friends, things have changed.\n  When we passed the FY2002 Budget Resolution we were operating using a \nCBO estimate that said we would have a $313 billion surplus in FY2002. \nHowever, as everyone now knows there won't be any surplus this year. \nInstead, there is going to be an enormous deficit.\n  The public needs to know the facts. When you take CBO's latest budget \nestimates for FY2002, released this past March, and you deduct the $51 \nbillion cost of the recent economic stimulus package, and you subtract \nthe part of the $27 billion defense supplemental we will pay out this \nyear, and then you consider that tax receipts are running $50 billion \nless than expected, you end up with at least a $100 billion deficit in \nthe current fiscal year.\n  Put another way, the budget outlook for FY2002 swung by $400 billion \nin just over a year. I remind my colleagues, when I talk about a $100 \nbillion budget deficit, I am talking about a unified budget deficit. In \nother words, this year we are going to borrow the entire $163 billion \nSocial Security surplus and then go out and spend all of it and then on \ntop of that we are going to go out into the capital markets and issue \n$100 billion of new debt and spend all of that.\n  Put another way, we are going to have to borrow at least $263 billion \nto fund the Government this year. And next year it looks just as bad. \nWe are on track next year to borrow and spend the entire $179 billion \nSocial Security and on top of that go out and borrow another $100 \nbillion to pay for the operation of the Federal Government.\n  Since there is no surplus this year or next year, and I doubt anytime \nsoon, I ask my colleagues, from where is the money for the farm bill \ngoing to come? Well, I will tell you from where it is going to come. We \nwill borrow it.\n  When people come to my office and ask for new or additional spending \nI always try to point out to them that every dollar of new spending is \ngoing to require us to borrow more money. And I ask them, do they think \ntheir request warrants borrowing money to pay for it? It is just that \nsimple. Every additional dollar of spending we enact puts us deeper \ninto debt and requires the Treasury to borrow more money.\n  And who do you think is going to pay off that new debt? Our children \nand grandchildren, that's who. The burden of paying off that debt is \ngoing to fall to them because it is increasingly clear that we are not \ngoing to be paying off debt anytime soon.\n  In fact, this week the Treasury Department is auctioning bonds to \nraise $24 billion in additional money. What is telling about this \nauction is the duration of some of these bonds being issued. They \nmature in 9 years and 9 months.\n  What that tells me is that the Treasury recognizes that the Federal \nGovernment is going to be borrowing money for a long time to come. The \nactions of the Treasury speak volumes about our long-run budget \npredicament.\n  Another illustration of how bad things have gotten is the pressing \nneed to raise the debt ceiling, which now stands at $5.95 trillion. \nLast year we were told that we would not have to worry about raising \nthe debt ceiling till the end of the decade.\n  But now we know that we are going to bump into the debt ceiling in a \ncouple weeks. Again, this illustrates the extent of our budget \npredicament and how the situation has changed.\n  The budget outlook is bad and bound to get worse. The fact is that \nthese recent budget deficits are a systemic problem; they are not a \ncyclical issue that will take care of itself. Here is why.\n  First, the recent and large increases in military and homeland \ndefense spending are permanent increases. Almost all this spending is \ngoing to be mirrored in future budgets. The need to defend the homeland \nis not going to go away any time soon and neither will those costs.\n  Likewise, increases in defense spending to rebuild the military \ninvolve long-term commitments that won't decline any time soon. My \npoint is that neither of these significant expenses is cyclical; they \nare here to stay.\n  Second, some people might think a surge in economic growth is going \nto bail us out of our budget problems. Well, my friends, I want \nvigorous economic growth as much as the next person, but I must point \nout to my colleagues that CBO's projections already assume robust \ngrowth.\n  In fact, CBO projects that the economy will grow at 5.4 percent next \nyear. This is the same level of economic growth as the consensus Blue \nChip private forecast. My point is that CBO's numbers are based on the \nassumption that the economy is going to experience robust growth; it's \nalready built into the numbers.\n  And the fact is that if the economy got going much faster than CBO \nand the private sector project, that would probably mean an increase in \ninflation. And we all know what happens when we face inflation, or even \nthe threat of inflation. The Federal Reserve puts the brakes on by \nraising interest rates.\n  Again, my point is that we face the prospect of chronic deficits, and \nthe economy is not going to bail us out. The fact is that we can't \navoid making hard choices and prioritizing. If we don't, then we face \nmore farm bills down the road, if we can give out this type of money \nwith this bill.\n  As a Senator who came here to try to bring some fiscal discipline to \nthis place, I am just dismayed by our complete lack of fiscal \nresponsibility. We just spend and spend and spend around here like \nthere is no tomorrow. And this farm bill is a fine example. As the \nAkron Beacon Journal, wrote in straightforward language in a May 7 \neditorial, ``This farm bill is really, really bad.'' It's that simple \nfolks.\n  I cannot in good consciousness vote for this conference report, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in opposing it. If that fails, I \nrespectfully urge the President to veto it. If he doesn't, and we \nchoose to give out this type of money with this bill, every other group \nwith a concern or problem will come before us and say, ``Well, you did \nit for them.'' And what will our response be? We won't have one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas, and I ask unanimous consent that after her remarks, the \nSenator from Mississippi be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the farm bill \nconference report that I believe will help rebuild rural America, \nstrengthen our rural infrastructure, and reinvigorate our rural \ncommunities and our main street businesses. If there is anyone in this \nbody who thinks that is not necessary at this time, I urge them to \ntravel to rural America, visit the rural communities in their States, \nto better understand the devastation that rural America has been going \nthrough over the past 10 years.\n  Many in our country have experienced the benefits of a good economic \ntime. Yet in rural America we have not seen all of those benefits. This \nfarm bill will come to our rescue. It is with great relief, after years \nof struggle under the Freedom to Farm debacle, that farmers can now \nhope for a new farm bill that will offer them a helping hand in growing \nthe safest, most affordable, and most abundant food and fiber supply in \nthe world.\n  After almost a year of hearings and studies, drafting and redrafting, \ncommittee meetings and markups, debates and amendments, we have finally \narrived at a bill that addresses the many needs of the broad and \ndiverse mosaic of the American farming and rural lifestyle. Like my \ncolleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee, I entered into this \nfray at the very beginning, fighting for a better farm policy than the \nold one, and I have fought all the way through this past year up until \nthis very moment. With this bill, we reach out to virtually every part \nof rural America. We strengthen the safety net for farmers of major \ncrops in every part of the country by adding a new countercyclical \nprogram to help them combat low prices in some of their toughest of \ntimes and by strengthening support for other farm production in dairy \nand specialty crops.\n  We encourage greater care of our environment by an 80-percent \nincrease in\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\nconservation programs, including the establishment of the Conservation \nSecurity Program, which will make for better farming practices on land \nthat is in production, rather than simply protecting marginal lands out \nof production.\n  As many people in Arkansas know, the conservation programs offered \nthrough this farm bill--the Wetlands Reserve Program, Conservation \nReserve Program, and the new Grassland Reserve Program--are all \ntremendously beneficial not only to our farming operation, taking \nmarginal land out of production and allowing producers to refocus their \nefforts on their more productive lands, but they enhance the beauty of \nthe environment that we as rural Americans all cherish.\n  We also provide better support for livestock producers in the greater \nfunding of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. We expand \nagricultural trade programs to assist our farmers in a global \nmarketplace, providing increased funding for important programs, such \nas food aid, which have played an instrumental role in foreign \nrelations in the last difficult 8 months.\n  To those who complain about whether or not we have given our full \nattention to making sure this bill is WTO compliant, I say we have. For \nthose who complain about it--particularly those from other countries \nwho have liked to talk down and talk badly about the bill we have come \nup with--are we just going to let them run over us or are we going to \nstand up and say we are simply asking for a level playing field for our \nproducers, to be able to have their Government support in a global \neconomy, just as those other nations have continued to provide their \nproducers in this global marketplace?\n  We significantly expand the nutrition title, making important changes \nto and increasing funding for the Food Stamp Program, as well as for \nemergency food assistance. The $6.4 billion in the nutrition title is \nessential to States such as Arkansas, where even though we may be \nunbelievable producers of food products, we still suffer desperately \nfrom hunger in our children. The school nutrition programs, as well as \nthe feeding and nutrition programs for our elderly, are absolutely \nessential to show our Nation and the rest of the world that our \nproducers are not only the best, but that our Government is concerned \nabout making sure those products get to some of the neediest.\n  We also improve the soundness and reliability of the farm credit \nsystem.\n  We increased funding for agricultural research to assist producers to \nbe even more efficient and effective in their production.\n  This bill provides permanent funding for technical assistance \nprograms to our Nation's private forest landowners, and we establish a \nnew energy title with funding dedicated to renewable resources and \nbiofuel development which produces a tremendous amount of benefits: It \nlessens our dependence on the importation of foreign oil, it creates a \nbetter environment, and it creates an additional marketplace for our \ngrowers and producers to be an effective part of lessening our Nation's \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Together these improvements to our new farm policy will help reverse \nthe course toward disaster on which rural America has been sliding and \nwill put our farmers back on the road to financial recovery and provide \nhope for the future in rural America.\n  Of course, whenever Congress rewrites major authorizing legislation, \nparticularly legislation this complicated and varied, there are going \nto be provisions that have different impacts on very different parts of \nthe country. So we compromise and put together the best bill we \npossibly can, one that best responds to the diverse needs of our vast \ncountry, and that is exactly what this bill represents. In this \nrespect, I believe this farm bill is a great success.\n  It is said that success has many fathers, and so, too, does this farm \nbill. It is the product of many people on both sides of the aisle and \non both sides of the Hill. This process has taken us all together, \nincluding time on the Senate floor and in conference, more than 5 \nmonths already. We have spent about 6 or 7 weeks in debate alone. Every \nstone has been turned. Every nook and cranny has been looked into. \nNevertheless, given the enormity of this process and the complexity of \nthis bill, it is not surprising perhaps that some people want to \nprolong our consideration of this bill, either to return this report \nback to the conference for more revision, or simply to prevent the \npassage of any farm bill at all. They do not believe our farm producers \ndeserve their Government's support.\n  I have spoken on the floor many times about the urgent need to pass a \nfarm bill. Farmers in my State have already begun their planting \nseason. Many of them were forced to alter planting decisions or forego \nplanting altogether because they were unable to arrange financing with \nlocal financial institutions which were, in turn, unable to extend \ncredit without some commitment by Congress to support the farmers.\n  Those farmers were able to go ahead with planting or did so with the \nexpectation that Government support in some form would be forthcoming \nthis year. And they need that support as soon as possible. In other \nwords, Arkansas farmers needed this bill yesterday, not today and not \ntomorrow. But there are others in this body who want to continue to \ntalk about this bill. So let me address some of the concerns I have \nheard expressed, particularly perhaps concerning the payment \nlimitations.\n  I have heard many complain that the conference report does not retain \nall of the restrictive provisions inserted in the Senate bill by the \nGrassley-Dorgan amendment on payment limitations.\n  By now everyone knows of my unyielding opposition to the Grassley-\nDorgan payment limitations amendment, and by now everyone has heard me \nor one of my colleagues explain the catastrophe the Grassley-Dorgan \namendment would have unleashed on my State and others who grow cotton \nand rice. I am greatly relieved that the Grassley-Dorgan amendment was \nmodified by the conferees because in its original form, the amendment \nwould have cost my State a little less than $400 million in direct \nlosses, and more than $1.3 billion in indirect impact. It would have \naffected more than half of my cotton farmers and a third of our rice \nfarmers. It would have impacted entire counties, not just individual \nfarmers but also the local bankers, the farm supply stores, the corner \ngrocers, even local schools and churches as a result of the significant \nreductions in land values and tax revenues.\n\n  By now, everyone knows of the utterly unfair and disproportionate \nimpact Grassley-Dorgan would have had on Southern farmers versus \nfarmers in other parts of our country, but this bill still provided a \ncompromise on payment limitations. We went from the 550 limit in the \nHouse, compared to the 275 limit in the Senate, to 360, which was a \ngood compromise. That does not mean there will not be people who will \nbe hurt or who will be affected by that 360. There will be. But it is a \nreasonable compromise that we could reach.\n  Why, then, I find myself still asking, would other Members of this \nbody from large farm States continue to seek the bankruptcy of my \nState's largest industry and largest source of employment? What is it \nthat they think Grassley-Dorgan would accomplish that would remedy the \nproblems in their own areas?\n  They say two things: First, they say they are trying to prevent large \nfarmers from hogging an unfair share of Government subsidies that are \nthen used to drive smaller farmers off the land.\n  Looking back on the debate we have had so far, I have had a hard time \nreconciling this explanation with other points that are made. For \nexample, I remember hearing that only a small portion of farmers would \nhave been affected by this amendment, but if so few farmers would be \naffected, then its impact on land values would also have been very \nlimited.\n  I am also bothered by something that my good friend from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, mentioned during his floor statement on the subject \nyesterday. I have deep respect and appreciation for Senator Grassley \nand have enjoyed working with him on a multitude of issues, but I could \nnot disagree with him more strongly, more vehemently than I do on this \nparticular issue. I suspect that our disagreement is driven by the \nharsh disproportionate effect his payment limits amendment would have \non my State compared to his.\n  Senator Grassley described the conference report as something that\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\nshould make cotton and rice farmers happy and something that would make \nIowa farmers unhappy, ostensibly because his payment limitation \namendment had been moderated by the conference. But given that my State \nconsists largely of cotton and rice farmers and his State has none of \neither, it really sounds like a concession, perhaps, that the amendment \nwould have had a disproportionate effect on Arkansas.\n  What, by implication, is the alternative? That he would be happy only \nif cotton and rice farmers were not? I do not believe that is the case, \ntruly. Or that the interest of my farmers in my State are opposite to \nthe interest of the farmers in his State? I do not believe that either. \nI reject that. I reject that categorically.\n  It used to be that farm policy was written with the interest of all \nfarmers in mind, and that is exactly what our chairman and the other \nmembers of the conference committee have tried to do. It is unfortunate \nthat so many people have abandoned the notion that legislators from \nacross the country should recognize their shared interests and work \ntogether to write farm policy that is beneficial for all.\n\n  Any problems this farm policy may eventually have are likely to be \ndue to the collapse of this farm coalition among States. I hope we \nlearn from this experience the next time we have to write major farm \nlegislation.\n  Senator Grassley's statement also raises another question in my mind: \nHow would undercutting cotton and rice farmers in Arkansas, or anywhere \nelse for that matter, help corn and soybean growers in a part of the \ncountry where cotton and rice are not grown? How would that help \nmoderate rising land values in Iowa?\n  The answer on both counts is that it would not. Slashing the value of \nthe industry in my State would do nothing to help the farm industry in \nIowa. If anything, driving cotton and rice out of Arkansas would \nactually hurt corn growers because farmland in Arkansas would \neventually be dedicated to corn production which would simply drive \ndown the price of corn and hurt corn farmers everywhere.\n  The second argument I have heard from proponents of the Grassley-\nDorgan amendment is that we must try to prevent so much money going to \nbig agribusiness and giant corporate farm entities. They refer to \ngeneric certificates in disparaging terms, such as ``loophole.'' This \nis our emergency disaster system which is only applied when prices are \nat their rock bottom and input costs are at their ultimate high on our \ncapital intensive crops.\n  Also, it should be noted that the Arkansas entities most cited as \nexamples of giant corporate agribusiness are rice cooperatives which \nprocess rice for thousands of rice farmers from Arkansas and \nsurrounding States. The support these cooperatives receive is simply \npassed on to their member farmers. It is incorrect to suggest Riceland \nFoods in Stuttgart, AR, is pocketing tens of millions of dollars when, \nin fact, Riceland is paying that money out to thousands of its member \nfarmers.\n  It should be noted that these cooperatives enhance their marketing \nleverage and, by relation, the marketing leverage for their farmers \nthrough the use of generic certificates. They pool all of the \nproduction and market the collected rice to customers around the \ncountry and around the world as needed.\n  Generic certificates allow them to do this. Otherwise, without \neffective use of those certificates, the cooperatives would be unable \nto pool member production and would have to erect paper walls between \neach member's contributions so they could be sure no one farmer \nreceived marketing loan support on an amount of rice that would put him \nover some arbitrary payment limit.\n  Burdening the co-op with such requirements would defeat the purpose \nof creating a cooperative in the first place; that is, to enhance the \nprocessing and marketing power of the co-op members, those individual \nfamily farmers.\n  Again, what, by implication, is the alternative? That the cooperative \nin Stuttgart, AR--Riceland Foods--should not have been established? \nThat it should not be able to serve its members as a cooperative?\n  Well, that is exactly what is implied by the expressions of shock \nthat such an entity as Riceland Foods would receive so much in farm \nsupports.\n  I would bet many of the Members of this body, and also of the House, \nwho have cited the amount of support sent to rice as an example of why \nstricter payment limits are needed are also many of the same Members \nwho have voted time and again to encourage the development of \ncooperatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes, at \nleast.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have other Senators lined up who have 2:30 \nappointments.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I will be very quick.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I add my compliments to the chairman of this great \ncommittee, also to our majority leader, Senator Daschle, as well as the \nother members of the conference committee who have worked so hard.\n  I am very proud of the incredible improvements and increased \ntechnology that our American farmers have accomplished over the past \n20th century and I think this bill complements that. Our producers grow \nthe safest, most abundant and affordable food and fiber anywhere. They \ndo it under some of the strictest environmental regulations and rules \nand with great pride and appreciation for their environment.\n  The American people enjoy a safely grown food supply for which they \npay less than any other country in the world. I am proud to support \nthis bill, and I am more than proud to support the American producer \nand the American farm family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Mississippi, under the previous order, \nhas 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that after he finishes, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, be recognized for 10 minutes \noff of Senator Lugar's time, and Senator Hutchison of Texas be \nrecognized for 10 minutes off of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, writing this new farm bill was a very \ndifficult challenge. I am very pleased our conference committee has now \ncompleted its work and the legislation now in the form of a conference \nreport has been approved by the other body and is now before the \nSenate.\n  It is a bill that has the support of President Bush. This is the \nstatement by the President that was issued on May 2, which I will read.\n\n       I congratulate Chairman Combest and the other House and \n     Senate conferees for a job well done in completing the Farm \n     Security and Rural Development Act of 2002. I am pleased that \n     the compromise agreement on the farm bill resulted in better \n     balanced commodity loan rates, spending that is no longer \n     frontloaded, and the strongest conservation provisions of any \n     farm bill ever passed by Congress. The final provisions of \n     the farm bill are also consistent with America's \n     international trade obligations, which will strengthen our \n     ability to open foreign markets for American farm products. \n     While this compromise agreement did not satisfy all of my \n     objectives, I am pleased that this farm bill provides a \n     generous and reliable safety net for our Nation's farmers and \n     ranchers and is consistent with the principles I outlined. I \n     thank the conferees for their hard work and urge Congress to \n     send the farm bill to my desk promptly for signature, to help \n     ensure the immediate and long-term vitality of our farm \n     economy.\n\n  One of the primary objectives of the new farm legislation should be \nto improve the predictability and effectiveness of the financial safety \nnet available to farmers. This bill does that. Farmers across the \nNation will now be able to make better management decisions for their \nfarm operations. This farm bill will continue the marketing loan \nprogram and provide farmers with a newly designed target price \nmechanism to stabilize and make more predictable the level of \nGovernment support when market prices are low. The target price will \nremain constant throughout the 6-year life of this farm program.\n  Farmers have requested that the new farm bill allow for updated crop \nbase\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\nacres and crop payment yields. This bill does that. It provides \nproducers with the option to update both base acres and payment yields. \nBy updating base acres and yield, the makeup of farm operations will be \ndetermined by recent planting history as opposed to outdated records \nfrom the 1980s.\n  This bill will protect more of our natural resources by increasing \nthe number of acres eligible for enrollment in conservation programs. \nThe Conservation Reserve Program acreage cap is increased from 36.4 \nmillion acres to 39.2 million acres. The Wetlands Reserve Program \nacreage cap is increased from just over 1 million acres to 2.75 million \nacres. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program is authorized at $700 \nmillion over the life of this farm bill, compared with $50 million \nunder current law.\n  The Environmental Quality Incentives Program, which provides cost-\nshare assistance to the livestock industry to comply with environmental \nregulations, is increased from $1.3 billion in the 1996 farm bill to $9 \nbillion over the life of this bill.\n  This bill also authorizes programs to increase our market access in \nother countries for both commodities and value-added products.\n  The nutrition title contains increased Federal support for school \nfood programs. Free and reduced priced meals will help students \nnationwide do a better job in the classroom. The bill not only provides \nfunding for the School Lunch Program, it establishes a pilot program to \nprovide school children with fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n  The rural development title of the bill will enable rural communities \nto receive high-speed broadband services.\n  The conference committee also noted the large backlog in waste and \nwater assistance programs at the Department of Agriculture. The bill \nauthorizes funds to eliminate this backlog of pending applications for \ngrants and loans. That will greatly assist rural communities, some of \nwhich are facing emergency drinking water shortages.\n  A Rural Business Investment Program also authorized in this bill will \nprovide loan guarantees for new and better job opportunities in rural \ncommunities. If the Senate does not adopt this conference agreement, \nthe Congress will be forced to consider yet another ad hoc financial \nassistance package for agriculture that could result in billions of \ndollars of additional emergency spending without providing farmers a \ndependable agricultural policy for the future.\n  I thank the members of our staff who worked so hard in our conference \ncommittee to bring about the result that we achieved. Especially, I \nwish to mention Chuck Connor, who represented the President, the \nadministration, at our conference meetings. He was available to answer \nquestions and assist with information that we needed. Hunt Shipman, who \nrepresented Secretary Ann Veneman, the Secretary of Agriculture, did an \noutstanding job providing assistance to the members of the conference \ncommittee. I want to mention Mary Waters, who also is an assistant to \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, who was very helpful to us all. And \nmembers of my personal staff, Hunter Moorhead, who is my agricultural \nlegislative assistant, worked long and hard nights and weekends, for \nmany months, to help put this legislative package together. He did a \ntruly outstanding job; my chief of staff, Mark Keenum, who had \npreviously filled that role, also provided very valuable and helpful \ninformation, insight, and assistance, along with one of my newer staff \nmembers, Emily Brunini, who recently joined our staff. For their \nservices and assistance, I am particularly grateful and want the Senate \nto know of their outstanding work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. under a previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport. I do so first by talking about a couple of things that are good \nin this bill. Oddly enough, one of the things I am most excited about \nin this bill is a move from a Depression-era farm program, the Peanut \nProgram, that has actually been taken into somewhat more of a modern \nera--not to the market, which is what I would like it to ultimately \nhave gone to, but we have taken it from a quota system, where the \nGovernment is micromanaging the production of peanuts, excluding those \nwho did not have a license or quota to grow peanuts. We got rid of that \nonerous Government-controlled program, and the farm bill is treating \npeanuts as we do the rest of the commodity programs.\n  In that respect, we had a program way out here on the left, regarding \nGovernment involvement, and moved it to the right. The problem is in \nthe rest of the bill. We were to the right, and we have moved it to the \nleft. We now have Government back into the business of supporting \ncrops, micromanaging what goes on around the country, leading to what \nhas been heard from many who oppose the legislation, to more certain \nmisery in farm country, more concentration, more large farms.\n  Most of the money in this bill for production is going to the row \ncrops. In Pennsylvania, we have some corn, we grow a little bit of \nbeans and other items. But the bottom line is most of my farmers are \nnot the big row crop farmers who qualify or participate in these \nprograms. The benefits will not go to the vast majority of States and, \nI argue, farmers in this country who do not live in the South or \nMidwest, who are the principal beneficiaries of the program. Two-thirds \nof the commodity money will go to 10 percent of the farmers in America. \nTwo-thirds of the money in this bill for production will go to 10 \npercent of the farmers in America. Where is the great sympathy for the \nsmall farmer?\n  All of the programs are justified because we need to help rural \nAmerica, the small farms. We have to keep the fabric of rural America. \nTwo-thirds of the money goes to 10 percent of the farmers. They are not \nsmall farmers.\n  As to this concept that we are here to preserve the rural way of life \nand this will be a breath of fresh air for rural America, this is \nanother nail in the coffin of the family farm in America, by the \nGovernment not only giving all this money to these large farmers and, \nby doing so, creating an oversupply situation so those who do not get \nthe money are going to have lower prices, but our little farmers will \nnot have markets to be able to make any kind of profit in what they do.\n  This is bad policy for farming. If we did anything such as this for \nany other industry in America, we would be called one of the great \nsocialist regimes in the world. Imagine talking about the paper \nindustry and saying we will provide all the subsidies and programs for \nanyone in the paper industry, or in the furniture business, or in the \nlighting business. We would be laughed out of this place if we tried to \ndo that. Yet we are going to micromanage agriculture and pour hundreds \nof billions of dollars into big farms, where only a very few States are \ngoing to benefit from this program. It is wrong for America. It is \nwrong for farming. It sets a horrible precedent. The sad thing is, on \ntop of all else, it will be very expensive for the taxpayers of \nAmerica.\n\n  Senator Lugar has reestimated a $57 billion increase in commodity \nsupports for crops. We are talking about a $57 billion increase over \nthe next 10 years. I guarantee today--I put a nickel on the table--that \nnumber will be at least $25 billion more, just in supplementals for \nfarmers. Why? Because prices will be so darn low, we will have to put \nin more money to bail out those who are hurt.\n  By the way, most of this helps farmers who have a crop. If you don't \nhave a crop, there is not as much help. We will come back and help \nfolks for the floods, for the droughts, and for everything else. This \nis going to be much more expensive than what we are talking about \ntoday. We have shown the rest of the world we are really not interested \nin opening markets, we are not interested in growing our exports, we \nare really not interested in setting an example for the world as to how \nwe can be better trading partners.\n  It is incredibly ironic, when we negotiate trade promotion authority, \nwe bring up a bill that has everything we deplore about the Europeans. \nThat is what we are doing in this bill. We are setting a bad example \nthat costs the taxpayers billions, and we are not helping the little \nfarmer who needs the help. We are not helping the little guy out there \ntrying to make it.\n  Why? Because all of the subsidies are going to the big farms. They \nwill produce. They have no incentive not to produce. They are being \nguaranteed a price to produce. Produce all you want.\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nDrive that price down. Put my little farmer who gets no subsidy out of \nbusiness. Congratulations. We struck a blow for rural America. We \nstruck a blow for the taxpayer. The problem is, the blow is right \nbetween the eyes. And it will knock them down, and in too many cases it \nwill knock them out.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, these past few years have been \nhorrible for farmers. Low prices, the recession, and weather-related \ncatastrophies--like the severe drought conditions we suffered in my \nhome State of Texas--have made it extremely difficult for our Nation's \nagricultural producers to sustain their farms and ranches, and maintain \ntheir ability to feed Americans and the people around the world. These \nextraordinarily difficult times reinforce the need for Congress to \nsupport a strong and effective farm bill that provides a solid safety \nnet and enhances the ability of our farmers and ranchers to compete \ndomestically and abroad.\n  This farm bill is not perfect, and I understand why many of my \ncolleagues are opposing it. There are many provisions that concern me \nas well. This legislation undercuts the very foundation of the Freedom \nto Farm concept. Freedom to Farm was the right approach for American \nagriculture, but our farmers were denied open markets and fair trade \nbecause of our competitors' subsidies and tariffs. Now, instead of \nopening markets and lifting trade barriers, we are moving back to \ndirect price supports. I am worried this could stimulate overproduction \nand drive commodity prices down even further. I am also concerned with \nthe uncertainty that will follow this bill's country of origin labeling \nrequirements.\n  However, Texas farmers and ranchers are backed against the wall. Like \nmany farmers all across America, Texans have been praying for two \nthings--rain and certainty. Texas farmers have been waiting for months \nto make their planting decisions for this year's crop, and their \nlenders cannot help them until this farm bill is passed. This is a \ndifficult vote for me. However, at the end of the day, this bill \nprovides critical assistance to those who produce our food supply. This \nis why I will reluctantly vote for this imperfect legislation.\n  This farm bill will answer the desperate calls for help from \nAmerica's farm and ranch country. Most importantly, it provides a \nstrong safety net for our farmers. The payment incentives in this bill \nwill free America's farmers from depending on Congress to continually \nprovide emergency assistance when prices drop. Over the last 4 years, \nCongress has spent nearly $30 billion on such emergency assistance for \nfarmers. This aid was necessary, but its inefficient delivery did not \nprovide the certainty that farmers and lenders need for crucial \nmanagement and financial decisions.\n  This farm bill may threaten our World Trade Organization commitments, \nso I am pleased that the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to \nregulate this spending on our domestic farm programs. Currently, more \nthan 25 percent of American farm income comes from exports. We must \ncontinue to fight to open these markets, and we cannot hinder access to \nforeign consumers who will provide new opportunity and income for our \nNation's farmers and ranchers.\n  Finally, this legislation protects the States' water rights and \ncreates the strongest conservation provisions of any farm bill in \nhistory. Many of America's livestock and dairy producers depend upon \nthese programs for essential soil and water conservation. The severe \ndrought and flooding that has occurred across the country makes this \nfunding even more critical as farmers work to sustain and enhance the \nproductivity of their land.\n  America's agricultural challenges must be addressed immediately. This \nbill takes a step--I hope the fundamentals will improve, so we can \nattempt--freedom to farm again in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time does this side have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 29 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And how much time does Senator Lugar have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 75 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if there are any Senators who wish to \nspeak on the farm bill, now would be the time to do that; otherwise, we \nmight be wrapping this up very soon. But we will run the clock a little \nlonger to give any Senators an opportunity to come over and speak. \nWhoever, pro or con, they will be recognized to speak. With that \nunderstanding, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask the time be \ndivided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask I be granted up to 10 minutes from the time \nallocated to Senator Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my concerns about the \nconference report on the farm bill. I understand the desire--and share \nthe desire--to make improvements in existing farm legislation. I know \nthe conferees worked very hard to address all of the concerns of \nSenators and Representatives from all over this country. A strong farm \nbill is a high priority, and I certainly agree with others who share \nthose views.\n  In my home State, the Commonwealth of Virginia, agriculture accounts \nfor a significant part of our diverse economy, creating nearly 10 \npercent of the total jobs statewide. I worked with members of our \nSenate Agriculture Committee to address the concerns of Virginia \ngrowers and the agricultural communities.\n  Several of these concerns were primarily addressed in the Senate \nversion of this bill. However, sadly and regrettably, I cannot vote for \nthis bill. My concerns are quite simple and represent not only the \ninterests of farmers in Virginia but also every American, whether or \nnot he or she is engaged in agriculture.\n  There are several points I want to make. Number one has to do with \nVirginia peanuts. I thank Senator Harkin. While I may not be joining \nwith him at this time, earlier I thanked him because if this conference \nreport was like the Senate version, I would be up here saying this is a \ngood bill. However, with regard to Virginia peanuts, this conference \nreport is not a good bill. Back in December I objected to the \nconsideration of this bill, not just for peanut farmers but for others, \nas the current farm bill doesn't even expire until the end of this \nyear. I thought, and continue to believe, it is unfair to our farmers \nand ranchers to hold hostage their way of life, to debate and implement \nchanges that may harm their income in the middle of the year--indeed, \nduring the plowing, planting, and now the growing season. I do not \nthink it is right to move the goalposts on someone after the ball has \nalready been kicked.\n  In 1996, when the Senate last debated the farm bill, the target price \nfor peanuts was lowered from $670 a ton to the current level of $610 \nper ton. This level was not due to expire until the end of fiscal year \n2002, which is September 30 of this year.\n  Today, a farm bill will pass, and the conference report on it takes \nthat level from $610 a ton to $495 per ton, a decline of almost 20 \npercent.\n  I worked hard to make some positive changes in the Senate bill. We \nincreased on the Senate side the target\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\nprice of peanuts from $480 in the House version to $520 in the Senate \nbill.\n  We increased the marketing loan rate from $350 to $400 and we \nincreased the quota transition payments from 50 cents to 55 cents. \nUnfortunately, the conference cut most of these gains.\n  Virginia has about 76,000 acres of peanuts and 4,000 peanut farmers. \nWhile these numbers may not look large to some Senators who have big \ncorporate farms in their States, these peanut farms are the basis of \nlocal communities throughout Southeastern Virginia.\n  The fact is, they are going to be devastated by this bill. And that \nmeans it is going to affect the implement and equipment dealers, those \nwho sell the fertilizer, seed, and herbicides. Obviously, it will \naffect the whole community. Despite the hefty expense of this bill--\nwhich for taxpayers is an expense of $4 billion--it will ensure the \ndemise of many Virginia peanut farmers.\n  Last week I brought a tin of Virginia peanuts to the Senate floor. I \nalso did so today because I want to share with my colleagues this great \nproduct which will continue to disappear, sadly, from the landscape of \nAmerican commerce. The bottom line is that it is simply not fair for \nour hard-working farmers to be dealing with a moving target--at the \nexpense of the American taxpayer.\n  The peanut section of this bill alone will cost every American man, \nwoman, and child almost $15 during the lifetime of this bill. Compare \nthis to the current peanut program which operates at no net cost to the \ntaxpayers. The way I see it, it is a losing proposition. The taxpayer \nloses, as do Virginia peanut farmers.\n  The second point of concern is regarding the budget. The bill not \nonly is expensive on the peanut front, but it also busts the budget.\n  The Budget Act allocated $73.5 billion for the farm bill. The \nCongressional Budget Office now says the legislation will increase \nagricultural spending by $82.8 billion over the next 10 years--nearly \n80 percent over the cost of existing programs. The 10-year cost of this \nbill, estimated at no less than $170 to $180 million, equates to a \nsubsidy of agriculture of more than $640 by every man, woman, and child \nin America.\n  In a time where budget surpluses have turned into budget deficits--we \nare fighting a war and fighting through a recession with the highest \nunemployment rate in over 8 years--we should not be diverting money \nfrom Social Security surpluses.\n  This is a policy that stimulates supply, drives down prices, and it \nhurts the farmers who it is meant to help. Simple economics says that \nan unchecked increase in production will lead to slumping prices, and, \nas Senator Hutchison of Texas said, it will ultimately result in \nincreased interest rates.\n  The decline in prices will shrink the profits of farmers, driving \nthem to borrow more money to stay in their business. And the inevitable \nincrease in interest rates will only compound their problems. The \nresult will be a continuing downward pressure on prices and continuing \ncalls for emergency farm rescue legislation.\n\n  The third issue of concern I would like to mention is trade. While \nthis bill is not officially a violation of WTO, it is inevitable that \nthere may be trade violations and claims made by foreign governments. \nThis bill has already come under attack from U.S. trading partners and \ncould set back our current efforts to strike free trade agreements.\n  The Uruguay Round agreement on agriculture limits U.S. spending to no \nmore than approximately $19 billion a year on domestic farm supports. \nThe reason for that was to not distort production and trade. It is very \nlikely that these limits will be exceeded in the future.\n  Furthermore, the new country of origin labeling requirement, besides \nbeing fundamentally impracticable and unworkable, will trigger \nretaliation from some of our most important trading partners--Canada \nand Mexico.\n  I also have other concerns about cuts in some specific programs that \nwere at least in the Senate version going in the right direction which \nwere beneficial to the people of Virginia.\n  The conference report drastically cuts rural utility service funding \nthat would deploy rural broadband programs and loans to rural electric \ncooperatives for service upgrades.\n  Also, the conference report deletes the Senate provision for $70 \nmillion for a nutrient reduction pilot program in the Chesapeake Bay.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has a few tributaries that flow into the \nbay, as, of course, does Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. \nUnfortunately, the Senate provisions were knocked out.\n  As Governor, we worked very hard--and I know the Presiding Officer \ndid as well when he served as Governor--to reduce nutrients going into \nthe bay so that grasses, fish, crabs, oysters, and mollusks could \nreturn. Unfortunately, that valuable nutrient reduction program was \nknocked out of the conference report.\n  In summary, ultimately, I would like to see us pass a solid farm bill \nthat provides a quality safety net to our hard-working farm families, \nwhich also keep prices affordable and low for consumers, which doesn't \nraid Social Security, and which does not grow the size of Government at \nthe expense of every hard-working American.\n  Indeed, I voted for the Senate version of the farm bill. While there \nare many salutary improvements in this bill, there are too many harmful \nresults for Virginians and Americans.\n  Today, this conference report takes a step backward on this \nphilosophy. It goes against the market-based principles instilled in \nthe 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, and it does so at a cost that is too high \nto pay.\n  Today, regrettably and sadly, I will have to vote against this bill, \nand in doing so represent the interests of Virginia peanut farming \ncommunities and also the long-term interests of all farmers who deserve \nboth adequate support and adequate predictability.\n  I vote for fiscal responsibility and to protect the Social Security \ntrust fund. I vote to keep the word of the U.S. to our trading partners \nthat is vital to expanding markets for American farm products. And I \nvote on behalf of the taxpayers of Virginia and nationwide who \nunderstand the great importance of agriculture but simply cannot afford \nexcessive, wasteful government spending.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before I yield time to the Senator from \nNebraska, I wish to respond to my friend from Virginia with whom I have \na good relationship. We have worked closely on this.\n  Let us be frank. I wish we could have had the whole Senate bill \npassed, as we passed it once before. As you know, we had to work these \nissues out in conference.\n  As concerns the Chesapeake Bay, this has been a concern of mine for a \nlong time, especially in terms of the agricultural runoff. That is why \nI was supportive of the provision that the Senator mentioned. But the \nHouse would not accept the carve-out of EQIP for the Chesapeake Bay \nnutrient reduction pilot program.\n  Experience being the best teacher around here, we put it in the \nconference report.\n  There is a new authority for the Secretary under a section called \nPartnerships and Cooperation. In which the Secretary can designate \nspecial projects and enter into agreements with non-Federal entities to \nprovide assistance. This could well help with the Chesapeake Bay. In \nfact, the Partnership & Cooperation authority was specifically crafted \nwith programs like the Chesapeake Bay Nutrient Reduction Pilot Program \nin mind. I want to read the language:\n\n       The managers intend for the Secretary to use this authority \n     to help producers avoid the need for further Federal and \n     State regulations to protect both water and air. The \n     Secretary is strongly encouraged to be proactive in \n     establishing partnerships in critical areas such as the \n     Chesapeake Bay.''\n\n  The Chesapeake Bay is the only specific region mentioned in the \nentire Partnerships & Cooperation report language section. That is \nintended to give the Secretary notice of the special status of the \nChesapeake Bay. I wanted the Senator to be aware of this report \nlanguage.\n  I also say to the Senator, as long as I am chairman of this \ncommittee, we intend to make sure the Secretary follows through on \nthis. This is one of our national heritage spots. It is one of our \nnational treasures, the Chesapeake Bay. We fully intend that the \nSecretary will use her authority to enter\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\ninto those arrangements just as we specified. It is the only area \nspecified in the report. We did not specify any other area than the \nChesapeake Bay. That is just under that program. They draw on the \nexisting conservation programs.\n  Secondly, we increase the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, \nwhich the Senator mentioned, from $2 billion to $11 billion, a 5\\1/2\\-\nfold increase. Under the EQIP program, farmers in the Chesapeake Bay \narea could receive funds and help for mitigating the runoff of \nnutrients.\n  The third part that will help the Chesapeake Bay is the new program \ncalled the Conservation Security Program that is in this bill. It is a \nnew entitlement program--open to all producers. For example, if a \nfarmer in the Chesapeake Bay wants to cut down on nutrients, wants to \ncut down on fertilizer, wants to stop soil runoff, wants to have \nresource management improvements there at a non-degradation level, and, \nto be the best manager of that land, that farmer could qualify to \nreceive a payment from the Government by entering into an agreement \nwith the Secretary.\n  So I say to the Senator from Virginia, there are at least three parts \nof this bill which will be helpful in mitigating and stopping the \nrunoff of nutrients and soil in the Chesapeake Bay area.\n  I am sorry we could not get the specific carve-out, but I can assure \nthe Senator as sure as I am standing here--that under those three \nprovisions in the conservation title will provide producers in the \nChesapeake Bay more opportunity for conservation in the next 6 years \nthan there has been in the past. That is all I can assure the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLEN. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator. I hope the Senator heard my remarks \nand how complimentary and grateful I am for the work the Senator did on \nthe Senate version.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLEN. All of those different approaches are good. And there are \ncompetitive grants. I am going to work with the Senator.\n  We did have that $70 million for that nutrient reduction pilot \nprogram. While all that is good--and I am going to work hard, and I am \nglad you were able to provide that--it is still not as good as the \nother version. If the House would have only listened to you more. But, \nagain, I thank you for at least keeping that. And we will work together \nto reduce nutrient runoff, whether it is filter strips, grass strips, \nriparian buffers, to reduce the nutrient and sedimentary runoff into \nthe tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. Actually, they are not all \ncompetitive grant programs. CSP is open to all producers who qualify. \nHowever, I do look forward to working with the Senator and others \nconcerned about the Chesapeake Bay on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, my neighbor to the west.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my neighbor to the east from Iowa, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for the \nopportunity to be here today and to rise in strong support of the farm \nbill conference report.\n  I say to my friends and colleagues who oppose this bill, and appear \nto prefer nothing to something, if you like importing 50 percent of the \nenergy needs of this Nation, you will love importing 50 percent of our \nfood needs, if this measure fails and domestic agriculture as we know \nit fails.\n  I am not sure whether I am pained more by the current state of the \nfarm economy--which pains me greatly--or by many of the attacks on this \nfarm bill, which I believe will set production agriculture on a course \nof financial stability over the next several years.\n  This farm bill, by every measurement, is not perfect. It was not \nperfect when the Senate passed it in February by a vote of 58 to 40. \nNeither was the House bill that passed last year in September. But both \nthe House and the Senate recognized, then, that their respective bills \nwere a vast improvement over the so-called Freedom to Farm legislation \nthat preceded it. And we passed it and sent it to conference.\n  Granted, changes were made in conference, changes which I wish had \nnot been made. But the overall bill is still a good piece of \nlegislation. It will provide substantial new funding for commodity, \nconservation, and nutrition programs. The bill reflects many priorities \nthat Nebraskans have asked for in this bill, including a reliable \ncommodity program, higher loan rates, funding increases for popular \nconservation programs, a new incentive program for hard white wheat, \nand new funding for renewable energy initiatives, just to name a few.\n  The farm bill includes a continuation of direct payments and a new \ncountercyclical program. Direct payments are fixed over the life of the \nbill. Loan rates are fixed for 2002 and 2003 and reduced by 1.5 percent \nfor the 2004 through 2007 crop years. Target prices will increase as \nloan rates are decreased.\n  The bill will increase funding for conservation programs by 80 \npercent, providing $9 billion in additional funding for the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program and increasing enrollment in \nthe Conservation Reserve Program--a very popular CRP Program--from 36.4 \nto 39.2 million acres. It also establishes the new Conservation \nSecurity Program which offers incentives to producers for conservation \non land under production.\n  Media reports place the amount of 2002 subsidies available for \nNebraska at $1.1 billion compared with $675 million under the 1996 law. \nThat is a half a billion more dollars to Nebraska farmers. This is good \nfor Nebraska's farmers, and it is good for Nebraska's economy.\n  As I said throughout the long process of developing and considering \nand passing a new farm bill, we need this legislation to help the \nagricultural sector of the economy. It seems to me that agriculture is \nan afterthought for most policymakers in Washington, often left out of \nimportant tax and economic legislative initiatives, as well as an \nafterthought in many of our trade initiatives and agreements.\n  Now, with this bill, I think we have changed that attitude. With the \nnew farm bill, and with the energy bill's emphasis on ethanol \nproduction as an alternative to foreign oil dependence, and other \nrenewable energy, we have taken steps to improve agriculture's position \non the priority ladder. This bill must be looked at as not only food, \nbut fiber and fuel.\n  Again, as with any piece of legislation, this conference report isn't \nperfect. I am disappointed, in particular, that the final version was \nstripped of the Senate provision I cosponsored that required payment \nlimitations to huge farming operations. But we can have that fight \nanother day, and I hope it will be soon.\n  On balance, the new farm bill is a giant step forward from where \nagricultural programs had been under the dramatic failure of the 1996 \nFreedom to Farm Program. It improves the efficiency of Federal programs \nand provides a higher level of assistance to our farmers. For this \nreason, I will vote for this legislation because I believe it is a vote \nin favor of fairness and stability for rural communities and the \nNation's agricultural economy.\n  Throughout the development of this bill, I have always sought ways to \nsupport our farmers and ranchers. And I have looked for reasons to vote \nfor this bill at every opportunity. But it seems to me that some of my \ncolleagues have looked for excuses to oppose it, and now they threaten \nto kill the conference report and cast our producers back into the \ndisaster known as Freedom to Farm.\n  It strikes me that many of those who oppose the bill were some of the \nsame ones who supported Freedom to Farm. These are strong words, I \nknow, but this is a very difficult time for agriculture.\n  I am here today to tell you that nothing is not better than \nsomething. This bill represents an honest attempt to improve farm \nprograms for our farmers. Sure, maybe we could have done even better--\nand we probally could do better--but the conference report which is \nbefore us today is such a vast improvement over the past that we cannot \nlet the perfect become the enemy of the good, particularly when our \nfarmers need the support provided in this bill. And they need it now.\n  In the final analysis, my decision to support this legislation was \neasy. The\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\nconference report provides the much-needed stability that farmers in \nNebraska have lacked for the last 5 years. It is about time. It allows \nfor major expansions of conservation, nutrition, rural development, and \ntrade programs.\n  It fits within the budget, and, on the whole, it is a good bill for \nNebraska. I see positive reasons to vote in favor of this conference \nreport which I think will be good for American agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Iowa, the distinguished chairman \nof the Agriculture Committee. I compliment the chairman and ranking \nmember and the conferees who worked so hard to produce a final product. \nThis one was not easy. There is the old saw about watching sausage and \nthe law being made. It probably applies to this bill as well as any \nothers.\n  I commend our House colleagues for continuing the tradition of \nbipartisan work on the farm bill, for soliciting broad input, for \nfinishing the bill early this year, for not pitting farmers against \nfarmers and one region against another, processors against farmers and \nenvironmentalists against farmers. In my view, the House did succeed in \navoiding the temptation to politicize farm policy, and I believe the \nproduct they have reached in conference with the Senate is good for all \nagriculture.\n  The staff worked long days, nights and weekends, as did, of course, \nthe conferees. It is not very often that we do anything around here \nahead of time. For that, the conferees deserve special recognition.\n  Clearly, there are many provisions in the bill that I support. There \nare some issues on which each of us would have a much different take, \nwe would have handled differently, if not burdened by the natural \nconstraints of a democracy. I know that some Senators are making a \nstrongly held case that this legislation costs too much. I have my own \nmisgivings about the price of farm policy. I will focus on that in my \nremaining remarks.\n  First, as with any estimate, it is based on assumptions. The new \nassumptions used in this case to calculate a score include new \nexpectations of market prices for individual commodities years in \nadvance of reality. These estimates are done in good faith. But, of \ncourse, it is laughable to think that we know what farm prices will be \nover a period of years that depend on world demand, trade preferences, \nthe relative strength of foreign currency, peace, war, and weather.\n\n  The reason this latest score is higher is because the expectations of \nmarket prices have been revised downward. If market prices are less, \nthen there is more urgency for the stronger safety net included in this \nbill, not less.\n  Let me point out something many people overlook. There are folks \nsaying this is 70 percent more expensive than the last farm bill. If \nyou look at the underlying farm bill, yes. But we didn't stick with the \nunderlying farm bill. When the world market for agcommodities crashed \nwith the Asian contagion, the Asian flu in the late 1990s, Congress \nstepped up to the plate. We have been providing emergency assistance \nbecause we did not want the artificial collapse in the demand of world \nprices to bankrupt farmers. What we are doing now in this bill is \nessentially building into the safety net the level of spending that we \nhave reached when we have had to come forward with emergency \nappropriations for the emergency costs each year.\n  I guarantee, if we had passed the old farm bill, if we had kept the \nold farm bill in place, if the year 2003 rolled around and it appeared \nthat we were going to have the same disastrously low farm prices we \nhave this year, we would have come right back here and people would \nhave said: Yes, you can't have large segments of agriculture going \nbankrupt because they can't get a return from the marketplace.\n  As most of us know, when farmers come into our Senate offices, they \nhave a broad agenda. Some of it we deliver; most of it we have not, \ndespite the best efforts of a good many Members of this body. I will \nmention on my side alone, Senators Lugar, Roberts, Grassley, Cochran, \nand others. Yes, farmers want a stronger safety net, but they would \nmuch rather get their returns from the marketplace than the mailbox. \nThey would rather have lower taxes and less regulation, more market and \ntrade opportunities, modernized transportation options, all of which we \nas a body, collectively and individually, have promised them but have \ndelivered too little.\n  Many Senators who oppose the farm bill argue that trade and taxes and \nrelief from regulation are what farmers need. I agree. Farmers heard \nthat 7 years ago. It hasn't been delivered, despite the best efforts of \na determined minority of us. I will continue fighting for all of those \nmeasures that are good for farmers, good for the economy, and which \nwill significantly reduce the cost of this farm bill.\n  In the meantime, I am going to support a responsible safety net built \nin to provide relief for farmers when the world demand situation and \nour exclusion from the world market keep prices artificially low.\n  If we want to reduce the cost of this farm bill--and certainly all of \nus do--we should pass the full farm agenda, not just the farm bill. We \nshould pass a trade bill. We should pass the energy bill, such as the \nbill we passed out of the Senate. I hope our House colleagues are \ntaking a look at it because that is very good for farmers as well as \nfor energy and the environment.\n  We should not place more mandates on farmers every time regulators \nhave a new idea. We should improve our land and water transportation. \nWe should reduce taxes. We should encourage more use of farm products.\n  If we do that, the farm bill will cost much less. American farmers \nwill be getting their return from the marketplace rather than the \nmailbox, and the American farmers will be happy. The taxpayers will be \nhappy, and we will all be happy. Farmers, just as others in the \neconomy, should be free to fail, but they should also be free to \nsucceed. That will not happen if we continue to ignore the rest of the \nfarm agenda.\n\n  There is another criticism of the farm bill; that is, that it \nprovides a disincentive for international market liberalization. It \nwill encourage foreign trade-distorting subsidies.\n  I think the opposite is the case. I do not believe our European trade \ncompetitors find it compelling or would be persuaded if we produced a \ngood example. In fact, they probably would find it laughable that we \nare thinking about how to clean up our act when they haven't cleaned up \ntheirs. President Ronald Reagan didn't get the Soviet Union to pull its \nintermediate-range missiles out of Eastern Europe by saying: We are not \ngoing to do that. He put in the Pershings. He put the pressure on them. \nThe Soviet Union collapsed. It is naive to think that we can \nunilaterally disarm and go into negotiations and expect to win. The \nsame applies with food policy.\n  Additionally, I know many Members are sensitive to editorial opinion \nthat is decidedly against this policy. I was asked today by some \nreporters about an editorial in a newspaper I generally respect. They \nsaid they really condemn this as pork.\n  I said: Normally, they write good editorials, well-reasoned and based \non fact. This was not one of them. They don't know what they are \ntalking about.\n  Many of those newspapers are published in high-rise buildings in some \nof our wonderful metropolitan areas. I doubt if they know what a \ncombine is or how you raise cattle or the impact of the world market on \nfarmers.\n  Still, I can't say that all the points the editorial opponents raise \nare invalid. But there are a great many things those people in the \nivory towers take for granted. They take for granted the volume, the \nlow price, the high quality, the unparalleled safety of our food supply \nand the national economic contribution made by U.S. farmers and the \nmany suppliers who ultimately end up with the farmers' money.\n  Editorial writers may be critical of farm policy, but they are \ncritical with full stomachs. In the emerging countries of Asia and \nAfrica, they say that a well-fed country has many problems, but a \nhungry country has but one problem. Fortunately, we don't have it. We \nask our farmers to produce more with less, to accept more Federal \nmandates\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\nwithout the ability to pass costs on to consumers, and we ask them to \ncompete in an international marketplace with competitors whose \ngovernment gives much greater levels of assistance. Then we have a \nperiod of good worldwide weather that has produced surplus world \nproduction, which has ensured that market prices around the world are \nlow. The big city papers can take our food supply for granted, but \nthose of us who live in flyover country--the real America between the \ntwo coasts--cannot and neither can the consumers in this country and \nelsewhere, who are unwittingly the biggest beneficiaries of the hard \nlabor and sacrifice of those who struggle on the farm.\n\n  I do agree that those critical of this bill are raising an argument \nthat we need to have, and that is where we draw the line. Given the \nnumerous ad hoc disaster bills, it is clear that the status quo is \nyielding little discipline from a fiscal standpoint. With this new \nprogram and its strengthened and more expensive safety net, I say to \nfarmers: The criteria for additional ad hoc disaster is now \nsignificantly more demanding, if not prohibitive.\n  The budget issues raised by those critical are not without validity \nand we will have a good opportunity to see if those who support this \ndramatically stronger safety net will resist the impulse to pile on \nmore and more in the months and years ahead.\n  While I support this farm bill, I warn all farmers that like the \nprevious farm bill, the commodity title will not increase market \nprices. Those who came to the floor with frequency the previous 4 years \nsuggesting the previous farm bill was a failure because market prices \nwere low knew better then and I hope everyone understands now that this \ncommodity section is a safety net only. The rural development and \nresearch titles should help expand markets and reduce costs to some \ndegree but not the commodity title.\n  If we want a chance to increase market prices over the long term, we \nwill have to give the rest of the farm agenda of trade, taxes, \ntransportation, energy, and regulatory relief a fraction of the urgency \nwe have demonstrated here in being so generous with other people's \nmoney.\n  The President has indicated that he approves of this legislation and \nthe House passed it on a bipartisan basis by a 2-1 margin. The farm \ngroups and livestock groups support the legislation.\n  I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member and those who \nparticipated and worked so hard on this conference report and urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, yesterday, during the course of the debate, \nI pointed out that ever since the conference report came to the other \nbody and the House of Representatives passed that conference report, \nthere has been a reevaluation of the amount of money that the bill we \nare now looking at would spend.\n  Frequently in the past, we have talked about the budget of a year \nago, allocating $73.5 billion over a 10-year period of time for farm \nlegislation. In fact, when we commenced the conference--that is, the \nSenate committee with our House conferees--the evaluation of the bill \nthe Senate had passed was that it was $79.5--$6 billion too much--with \nthe action we took here on the Senate floor. So in the early days of \nthat conference, the $79.5 billion that was estimated for our product \nhad to be scaled down by $6 billion. That came out of many programs. \nBut in due course it was achieved, so that we could at least confer \nwith our House friends on the basis of both of us having a $73.5 \nbillion product.\n  I dwell on that because much has been made of $73.5 billion of \nadditional spending beyond the so-called baseline. The baseline is a \neuphemism for the totality of farm programs that continue on--ones that \nwere provided by Freedom to Farm, and some were provided by other farm \nbills in the past; in other words, a pretty large aggregate of farm \nspending. That baseline was frequently estimated in many speeches \nduring this debate at about $100 billion. So in rough figures, the \ndebate started with the thought that we would have about $100 billion \nof baseline--all the programs that continue on and an additional $73.5 \nbillion of spending--and that would occur on a 10-year basis at $173.5 \nbillion. Now we know the $73.5 billion has now been evaluated as $82.8 \nbillion, so it is up $9.3 billion. The reason is that the Congressional \nBudget Office, taking a look at our assumptions--and the assumptions \ncame down principally to the price of row crops--corn, wheat, soybeans, \ncotton, and rice. The estimates that were in our bill were that the \nprices of those row crops would be higher than CBO's, and the experts \nthey have brought in now believe that will be the case--in essence, \nthat a downward trend of prices is continuing.\n  So since we are now providing much higher target prices or, in fact, \nreinstating those in a countercyclical program, and at slightly higher \nloan rates, since the base market prices are expected to be much lower, \nthe gap is larger; thus, the taxpayer input into the farm bill. So we \nhave moved from $73.5 billion to $82.8 billion. Now comes the news that \nthe baseline likewise has been reevaluated by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I have gone back to the drawing board, and the baseline was not \nexactly $100 billion. Our staff, by our best calculations, finds that \nit was $97.6 billion. So we had $2.4 billion there that we had not \nexpected. That is the good news. But the bad news is the new baseline \nis $107.155 billion. That is roughly $9.5 billion higher.\n  So our assumption, as we start this conference, that we had $100 \nbillion of baseline and $73.5 billion of new spending--thus, $173.5 \nbillion--is in fact now $82.819 billion. That is the new situation for \nthe new spending and a baseline of $107.155 billion, for a grand total \nnow of $189.974 billion, or roughly $190 billion.\n  Now, that is a lot more money, Mr. President. That $173.5 billion has \nbeen transformed, even in the course of this debate on the Senate \nfloor, up to $190 billion--a change of $16.5 billion, just for the same \nbill, with no change in any of the stipulations. Mr. President, I made \na prediction yesterday--and many have ratified that in their remarks, \nand some disagree with it--that we are likely, in fact, to see CBO look \nat the same programs year after year and reevaluate them higher--both \nbaseline and new programs. Why? Because this farm bill stimulates \noverproduction. It does nothing with regard to our trade situation.\n\n  We have had extraordinary speeches in which some have said we are \nreally fouling up the waters if we hope to ever get more exports to \ndeal with other countries in some sort of diplomatic way, to gain entry \nfor our crops, which we certainly need to do. But others have said, \nlisten here, this is an American bill, this is not a French bill, or an \nEnglish bill, or a Canadian bill and, by golly, it doesn't make any \ndifference what they think about it. Fair enough. But, of course, it \ndoes, because we are hoping to negotiate with these countries for entry \nfor our exports. At some point, perhaps we will be diplomatically \nsuccessful. Every farmer prays that will be the case. But it is \ncertainly not the case for the moment.\n  As a result, the supplies continue to pile up. Why? Because this bill \nis very generous to the row crops in offering incentives to plant more \nand to take advantage of the higher loan rates and the higher target \nprice. As a result, not only will there be surprises that have come out \non the floor in the last 2 days in which something that used to be \n$173.5 billion is now $190 billion of expenditures, but those figures \nare likely to escalate further each of the 6 years of the duration of \nthis bill, unless amended.\n  Now, Mr. President, at some point, Senators may say this is simply \ntoo much. I have raised the question, as have others, that the $15 \nbillion that is spent on additional reestimates of what we have done is \nmoney that might have been spent on health care--either reforming \nMedicare, for prescription drugs for the elderly, for shoring up Social \nSecurity, or for education programs that come up even in this debate. \nThe distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, \ndecried the lack of attention, really, to the President's suggestion to \nleave no child behind and the funding needed for that.\n  I once again point out that we find it, I suppose, possible to \ndiscuss farm bills\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\nin a total vacuum, but without realization of the war, homeland \ndefense, or the basic issues in most of our campaigns, there is almost \nan obsession with spending this money--all of it.\n  Without being redundant, I point out, as the Chair and others have \nheard, that if, in fact, this money were to go to small farmers, \nmedium-size farmers, even fairly large farmers who are in danger of \ngoing out of business, a case could be made for some of it. But the \nfact is that in the row crop situation--and this is roughly 60 to 70 \npercent of all the moneys, even after you talk about conservation, \nresearch, and the small crops, and so forth; that the basic row crops \nis roughly 60 to 70 percent of the money and two-thirds of that money \ngoes to just 10 percent of the farmers--it is an inescapable 60 \npercent, three-fifths of all the farmers in the country do not get the \nrow crop money at all, and that is where almost all the increases have \ncome from in the Congressional Budget Office reevaluation.\n  It is that part of the program that, in fact, has attracted most of \nthe money, has concentrated it on relatively few farmers, and even when \nthe Senate passed a fairly modest cap that no individual farmer should \nreceive more than $275,000 each year--not in the total of the farm \nbill, but each year--there were loud protests from our House \ncolleagues. As a result, that was scrapped. Through the two- or three-\nentity rule or all the various rules, certificates, what have you, the \nnet effect is there are no limits.\n  If, in fact, you are an ingenious farmer and a big farmer, this is a \nbonanza. Already bankers have sent in testimony in behalf of this and \nsaid things ought to be in pretty good shape for the next 6 years, in \nterms of the collateral for loans because land values escalate, and \nthat is the basic collateral, unless you are one of 42 percent of \nfarmers who rent and unless, in fact, you are a small farmer which no \namount of money from a country banker is likely to resuscitate, and \ncertainly not this bill.\n  After one bromide after another about how it brings stability, \ncertainty, and so forth to American farmers, I say a few American \nfarmers--very few, as a matter of fact--will do very well.\n  What I find baffling is how this body, with these facts squarely in \nfront of us--established now as we know by the Environmental Working \nGroup Web site farm by farm, county by county so there is \nincontrovertible evidence of exactly who gets what and in what \nproportion, what percentage, State by State--it is not speculation any \nlonger--to the dollar, year by year, even updated for 2001 now in a \nrecent update of the site--still Senators hue to the thought that \nsomehow Freedom to Farm failed and this bill in front of us now will \nmake an enormous difference for most farmers in the country.\n  My own view is that it will not. In fact, I believe most farmers in \nthe country will be hurt. These speeches that I give on the floor I \ngive in my home State. Despite some of the rhetoric in which people \nhave talked about people in skyscrapers writing articles, people who \nhave never seen a combine, never seen a cow--I will testify I have seen \na combine, I have seen a cow, I have even seen a farm, even own one, \neven tried to deal with these programs year by year so that I \nunderstand exactly what happens to farmers as a product of what we do.\n  Mr. President, I simply want to offer as one explanation of what we \nare doing a remarkably timely article that appeared in the Washington \nPost this morning. This is not the Washington Post editorial writers or \nsomeone remote from farming, but it is a gifted economist, Robert \nSamuelson, who has long written for Time, Newsweek, and others. I quote \nportions of what Samuelson says because I think they are appropriate \nfor our debate.\n\n  Samuelson says:\n\n       Farm subsidies are a splendid example of old-fashioned \n     politics: using public money to buy votes. It's the quest for \n     popularity and power, and not campaign contributions, that \n     matters. Under the new bill, the subsidies are estimated to \n     cost almost $200 billion over the next decade. . . .\n\n  Samuelson misses that, according to my calculation, by $10 billion. \nWe are now up to $190 billion, but with the meter still ticking.\n\n       If farm prices (mainly for wheat, corn, soybeans, and \n     cotton) are lower than expected, the subsidies will be \n     higher.\n\n  He is right on that point.\n  Similarly, higher farm prices would mean lower subsidies.\n\n       The point is to stabilize farm incomes--to prop them up in \n     periods of low prices and thereby save ``family farming.'' \n     The subsidies have existed in one form or another for almost \n     70 years, and there's no evidence that they work. Farmers and \n     farm workers accounted for 21 percent of the labor force in \n     1929, before the New Deal's first agriculture legislation. \n     Their share today is about 2 percent, even though the amount \n     of land in farming is almost the same (1 billion acres in \n     1931, 932 million in 1997).\n       Bigger tractors, more fertilizer and better seed varieties \n     and cultivation methods have promoted farm consolidation and \n     larger harvests. In the 1940s, American farmers grew an \n     average of 34 bushels of corn per acre; in 2001, the average \n     was four times that, 137 bushels an acre. Government \n     subsidies simply haven't been able to overcome the pressures \n     for bigger and more efficient farms.\n       Indeed, the subsidies have perverse side effects. Higher \n     subsidies boost land values, because (like crops) they add to \n     the land's cash-producing potential. In turn, higher land \n     prices and rentals mean higher costs for new farmers. \n     Similarly, farm subsidies stimulate production, which \n     depresses prices. The combination of higher costs and lower \n     prices squeeze farm incomes.\n       The subsidies also hamper efforts to open foreign markets. \n     Precisely because American farmers are so productive, they \n     need exports to absorb their surpluses. But foreign markets \n     are heavily protected by subsidies and high tariffs, because \n     farmers almost everywhere are a politically favored group. \n     According to a recent U.S. Agriculture Department study, the \n     average food tariff around the world is now 62 percent. It's \n     hard to convince other countries to cut their subsidies and \n     tariffs if we won't cut our own.\n       The survival of farm subsidies, despite their huge \n     shortcomings, partly reflects political inertia. Once \n     extended, government benefits are hard to withdraw. It would \n     seem ``unfair,'' and farmers--despite constant complaining \n     about details--have become dependent on subsidies. The \n     subsidies also endure because they're protected by the ``iron \n     triangle'' of congressional committees, interest groups and \n     government agencies.\n\n  Here, the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\n       Without farm programs, all would be much less important.\n       To sustain their power, farm legislators and lobbies ``are \n     willing to trade their votes for almost anything,'' says \n     economist David Orden, of Virginia Tech, a longtime student \n     of farm politics.\n       But what increasingly protects farm subsidies is political \n     competition. With Congress split--and control of the House \n     and Senate hanging on a few races--swing voters must be \n     courted. Both parties are in a bidding war.\n       The result is much bipartisan hypocrisy.\n\n  Indeed.\n\n  Each one of us has been involved in political campaigns, and we will \nbe involved in some more. We are aware of that situation. So is the \npublic. I cannot believe the public hearing this debate, understanding \nthe escalation of the monies that have been required to accommodate the \nlong list of additional crops, groups and farm entities in American \nlife, will not, in fact, find the whole situation to be very \ndisturbing.\n  As Samuelson concludes, at least the good thing is that it is \ndemocracy at work; people appealing to voters. What each one of us, I \nsuspect, will have to finally determine is who the voters are.\n  I submit that out in America there are a lot of people who are very \nsympathetic with regard to American agriculture, and many of them are \nin this Senate. But I also suggest that the American people want us to \ndetermine some priorities, that we have a responsibility as trustees of \nthe Public Treasury, and as trustees of a good number of things in \nAmerican life, to have some wisdom and some sense of justice with \nregard to all of this. This is why I will vote against the conference \nreport, because I believe it has reached outrageous proportions in \nterms of expense. It narrowly focuses most of these new outrageous \nexpenses on a relatively few farmers. It will depress prices almost \ncertainly and thus increase the cost of the whole enterprise year by \nyear. It is destructive of relationships abroad that are necessary if \nwe are to export more and, as a matter of fact, it really needs to be \nrevised very substantially.\n  Fortunately, we have a farm bill that does continue for several more \nmonths. It has been criticized routinely, but I noted two things in the \ncourse of the debate today, and in a bipartisan way,\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\nas I mentioned. The distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, \nmentioned that due to very technical aspects of payments--the Senator \nstated, very gifted as he analyzed the bill and understands it--many \nfarmers who are expecting to get money this year will be disappointed. \nThe checks will be spaced out in various increments. The Senator from \nKansas was suggesting that perhaps it would have been in the better \ninterest of most farmers to have a supplemental bill that costs much \nless than the new bill we are talking about, and to have provided the \nmoney as anticipated.\n  Now, the Senator did not advocate another supplemental bill, but if \nmy analysis is correct, others will. And why not? Why should this be \nthe final farm debate of the year if in fact more need and difficulty \ncan be found, as it clearly will be in the administration of this bill \nshould it pass?\n  There will be a number of people who will need to be employed by the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture. Hundreds of hours will be spent by \nordinary farmers figuring out whether they take the base of the past or \nthe base of a recent year's yield, and how to apply for all of this. We \nhave quite a turmoil ahead of us, and the money does not necessarily \nflow in that process. The Senator from Kansas recognized that and \ndescribed it rather acutely.\n  In addition to that, the distinguished chairman of our committee has \nmentioned he might wish to call a meeting of the Agriculture Committee \nnext week to mark up disaster assistance legislation, maybe in the \norder of $2.4 billion. I made the prediction yesterday, despite all of \nthe certainty, finality, and the thought that this does it as opposed \nto Freedom to Farm, we are very likely going to have two debates every \nyear in addition: One, for a supplemental, a group, wherever it may be \nin our society, who believes that somehow things did not work out well \nfor them and; secondly, disasters, weather disasters, health disasters, \nwhatever may have happened in the appropriations process.\n\n  I simply ask of Senators, once again, how much and how long does this \nprocess continue?\n  I trust there will not be any further reestimates by CBO even in the \ncourse of this afternoon. The shock of going from $173.5 billion to \n$190 billion during the course of this debate should be substantial. I \nhope that both at USDA, at the White House, as well as in this Senate, \npeople are evaluating the sums of money that are now involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the two managers of the \nbill. It is my understanding the manager for the minority, the senior \nSenator from Indiana, has agreed graciously to transfer 20 minutes of \nhis time, that is under the unanimous consent agreement, to Senator \nHarkin. Is that right?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct. We would be pleased to give 20 \nminutes of our time to Senator Harkin so that speakers can be \naccommodated.\n  Mr. REID. I would, on behalf of Senator Harkin, yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the \nauthorizing Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar, for yielding time, \nand the flexibility offered to me by the assistant majority leader to \nspeak to this conference report.\n  I have for the last few moments been listening to the senior Senator \nfrom Indiana talk about his frustrations and problems with this \nconference report and with agricultural policy. I must say I agree with \nso much of what he said.\n  When one is handed a political document and they try to fix it, and \nthe politics gets worse, the document ultimately does not get better. \nTragically enough, that is what we were handed in the Senate in the \nbill coming out of the Senate Agriculture Committee. We tried to make \nit better. It was not much better before it went to conference, and I \nam not sure what we now have is a much improved version.\n  I say that not only as a student of agricultural policy, once having \nserved on the authorizing committee, but now serving on the Agriculture \nAppropriations Committee, growing up a farmer and a rancher, being \nactive as an agricultural young person in FFA, both as a State officer \nand a national vice president, I have been involved and closely \nconnected to agriculture in my State and around this country for a long \nwhile. As someone who recognizes the importance of agriculture to my \nState and good farm policy, I am in a quandary, as are many of my \ncolleagues who have come to speak over the last several days to the \nissue of a new 5-year agricultural policy for our country.\n  How do I evaluate this in the context of how will it impact my State, \nprimarily, and then secondarily, what does it do to the country, both \nto the producers of agriculture, the farmer, the rancher, but what \nabout the consumer? How does it fit in the consumer market basket? How \ndo we put all of that together because that really is the charge of the \nCongress when they evaluate agricultural policy?\n  It is with those thoughts in mind that I joined with Senator Roberts \nsome weeks ago on the very thing Senator Lugar was talking about a few \nmoments ago, and that is the opportunity of a supplemental to send a \nmessage to production agriculture, as the tractors are ready to go into \nthe fields across America, that there was a policy in place, that we \nwere not going to play politics with it and that they could take \nsomething to the bank to negotiate with the loan officer on a line of \ncredit for the farming year.\n  Senator Roberts introduced that legislation a couple of weeks ago, as \nthe conference committee was pushing toward finality. We now have that \nin this document, in this conference report. The question is, What does \nit mean? What is its impact? How long does it take to reach regulatory \nform in a way that gets to the ground?\n\n  We will live out this year's farm policy because it does not expire \nuntil the end of the fiscal year. It is possible, while I think some \nwill meet it with resistance, that we will see a supplemental on the \nfloor to solve some of the immediate problems because this bill does \nnot deliver immediate aid to American agriculture. It spreads it out \nover an extended period of time when, in past policy and in current \npolicy today, they would have received some immediate assistance.\n  This does not solve a problem in the short term. Then, again, farm \npolicy is more about the long-term view as we deal with the day-to-day \nproblems of agriculture, in policy but also with the supplemental.\n  How do I evaluate this farm bill? Let me state what is bad. That is \nhow I looked at it--what is bad, what is good, how do I balance it out, \nhow do I vote for Idaho farmers and ranchers.\n  Idaho is one of the fastest growing dairy States in the Nation. We \nrank fifth in overall numbers of cows producing. It is a growth area in \nIdaho agriculture, and our dairies are 500-, \n1,500-, 2,000-cow units. We are one of the big growth dairy States. \nFrankly, policies that access markets and open up markets are the best \npolicies for Idaho. We are an exporter. We do not have to be in the \nbusiness of subsidizing an efficiency for the sake of the politics of \nthe local dairy environment. Our farmers have transitioned into a much \nmore competitive situation in modernizing themselves to fit the needs \nof the current consumer base.\n  When I look at a national milk program that basically only subsidizes \nor helps build a floor for cow units of 170 cows or fewer, my guess is \nthat is talking about what used to be when it comes to dairy policy \ninstead of what ought to be. That is not good policy because it \nperpetuates relative inefficiency or it subsidizes it in a way we ought \nnot be about. We have always been proud in American agriculture that \nefficiency was the name of our game. Our production set us apart from \nthe rest of the world. We ought not be about subsidizing something that \nis not efficient today. We ought to promote efficiency and \nproductivity. I don't think dairy policy does that.\n  If we really want to help out the bottom line of our Nation's dairy \nmen and women, it would be much more advantageous to look at \nalternatives to this bill's price support program, which is purposely \nbiased to a select dairy operation size.\n  What about forestry? Yes, when we talk agriculture, we talk forestry. \nOne\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\nof the largest divisions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is the \nU.S. Forest Service. It is tremendously disappointing to see the \nbiomass and stewardship provisions stripped from this farm bill. Why \ncan't we get involved in the business of actively managing our forests \ninstead of simply letting them grow old, die, and burn up? Right now, \nforests are burning in Arizona and New Mexico. It is a dry year. Part \nof the reason they are burning is that we have had no active management \nand we have watched the fuel base of those forests build. That is true \nin the Black Hills, an area not far from the chairman's home area. It \nis critically important we actively manage our forests instead of \nputting the fence around them and saying to the \nenvironmental community: Here is a preserve. Come look at it while it \nis alive because it is dying unless we create dynamics in it that will \nbuild back life and vitality.\n\n  We did not do that. We walked away from that. The House and the \nSenate could not agree. We will do what we have been doing for the last \nseveral years: We will legislate through appropriations. That is not \nnecessarily a way to create policy, but that is probably what we will \nend up doing because this was the wrong way to do it.\n  The Senator from Iowa and I and others got involved with the \nassistant majority leader in an issue over water when he was trying to \ntake States' water rights and reshape them and create water banks, \ndenying Western States their prerogative on western water rights. We \nwere able to get a big chunk of that knocked out. But then Nevada got a \nsweet deal, a couple hundred million dollars to go to a specific area \nin Nevada. That is the name of the game around here. At least we saved \nwater rights. Water rights cannot be bought, nor should they be owned, \nby the Federal Government. They ought to have a right to have rights \nwhere water is needed and water is utilized. But in western arid \nStates, that is a provision that is exclusively the States'.\n  In my opinion, those are some of the bad provisions in this bill.\n  Now let me talk about some of the good provisions because there are \nsome. I have been on the floor numerous times in the last good number \nof years talking about sugar and the sugar program. It is an important \npart of the agricultural base of my State. We got the forfeiture \npenalty eliminated. That was critically necessary. With the sugar \npolicy, we are moving back to a no-cost-to-the-taxpayer approach. That \nis good. That is the right way to move policy. We have done so for \nsugar.\n  We included wool in a marketing loan and an LDP program. As we know, \nand especially with western range sheep industries and with wool, that \nmarket has all but collapsed as a result of imports and as a result of \naccess by Australian and New Zealand interests in this market. This \nhelps create flexibility and staying power on the part of the sheep \nrancher of our country--the sheep farmer. I think that is important.\n  In my State, there is a class of crops called pulse crops, peas and \nlentils. Those are a valuable rotation crop, especially in the high-\ngrain-yielding country where they have 120-bushel dryland grain. It is \na marvelous producing crop in the north end of my State that moves into \nWashington. One way to maintain the integrity of the soil and the \nbalances to plant lagoons is nitrogen-bearing crops that put humus back \nin the soil and create the dynamics of a positive farm program, and yet \nthose crops have been without a loan program or LDP all these years. We \nwere able to create those dynamics in this farm bill. That is a \npositive provision.\n  Another positive part of the program is the conservation title. It \nincludes the EQIP funding and the CRP acreage. Certainly in my State, \nCRP has been a very dynamic program, creating the kind of conservation \nand soil management in some of our more steep grounds, some of our \nfoothill country, that not only has put that country back to grass, it \nhas created great wildlife habitat for upland game birds--an extremely \npositive program.\n  Another area of the conservation title is the Grasslands Reserve \nProgram for 2 million acres of pasture lands. I helped write that \nprovision. I introduced legislation with several colleagues. It is \npossible the chairman was involved in that issue. We have worked \ntogether to create the Grasslands Reserve Program.\n  There are positive conservation titles in that farm bill. That is one \nof the good things I see in this bill.\n  As to rural economic development, many Members, as we argue for a \nfarm bill, in part argue to create profitability in agriculture because \nof the dynamic and dramatic negative economics in many of the rural \nareas of our States. While we know that at least the number of farmers \nis dropping even though the number of acres farmed remains the same, it \nchanges the dynamics in small rural, agricultural America. As a result, \nmany have worked over the years to create new dynamics for the purpose \nof economic development in rural America. This is a title of \nimportance. It is important we do so. The funding is reduced. The title \nis stronger.\n  Over the years, I hope we can build back some of that funding to \nstrengthen rural economic development. If new industry is to come to \nrural America, then the infrastructure overall in America has to remain \nwhole. I have worked on and have a new rural health care title that \nwill allow our rural hospitals low-cost loans to buy back some of the \nequipment that is now obsolete.\n\n  I was visiting a hospital in Soda Springs, in the southeastern corner \nof my State. It is a rural area. Much of that equipment is 25 and 30 \nyears old in that hospital. You cannot call it state of the art, even \nthough they deliver quality health care. That is a hospital 30 miles \nfrom the next hospital, in which rural health care is critically \nnecessary. This legislation in the long term will help us.\n  My time is rapidly running short. I know others wish to speak as we \nnear the hour we will vote on this issue. Overall, this is not the farm \nbill I would have written. My guess is, we are going to be back \nrewriting it more than once over the course of the next several years.\n  Somebody said: Why aren't you on the authorizing committee anymore, \nSenator, and therefore on agriculture appropriations? Because, I said, \nmy guess is we are going to be rewriting this farm bill at least once a \nyear for the next 5, and that will be done in the Appropriations \nagriculture subcommittee as we work on these programs.\n  This is an expensive farm bill. My guess is in the end we will find \nwe cannot afford it all and we will begin to adjust some of this \ndownward--and I think that is appropriate. We are on the verge of \nbusting the budget on which we earlier agreed, but then, again, without \na budget resolution and without a fixed application of where we are \ngoing with agriculture, it is possible to argue that this bill doesn't \nmeet that test.\n  In the end, I am going to support the conference report. I think the \nfarmers of my State in the majority want that to happen. There are \nprovisions in this bill that I can support and I have outlined the \npositives and the negatives.\n  I hope we can pass this out and in the end the President will sign \nit, although I know the White House and the Department of Agriculture \nand the Secretary are very frustrated over where this Congress wants to \ntake agricultural policy at this moment.\n  Sometimes compromises are not necessarily good. Tragically, in the \nend, even in bipartisan environments, at times we do not always work \nthe will that ought to be worked to produce the kind of positives and \nthe dynamics we ought to in the marketplace.\n  I am as frustrated today as any other agricultural Senator is about \nprices, commodities, international markets, and the viability of the \nagricultural economy of our country. I do not deny where we are \nheading, with larger agriculture and all we are attempting to do to \nresolve those problems.\n  As a result of that, we have a conference report that I hope a \nmajority of the Senate will move in favor of, and therefore pass this \nconference report out and send it to the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time is left on Senator Lugar's \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 19 minutes.\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 4 minutes. I have permission to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on and most \nlikely pass a 6 year farm bill.\n  Supporters of the bill say it will cushion family farmers and rural \nAmerica from financial hardship. That may be true, but unless you are a \nbig meatpacker or a cotton and/or rice producer in the South, the new \nfarm bill is not what it is cracked up to be.\n  I am afraid that for Iowa farmers, the bill's shortcomings outweigh \nits virtues. So I will cast my vote against the bill.\n  There are two main reasons:\n  No. 1, during the last year, farmers in Iowa made clear to me they \nwanted Washington to crack down on the sky-high payments going to large \ncorporate farms. It is ridiculous that we shovel the lion's share of \nthe farm benefits to a handful of large corporate farming operations.\n  No. 2, Iowans also urged me to push public policy that would keep \ncompetition alive in the livestock industry by banning packer ownership \nof animals fed for slaughter.\n  My amendments got these two main family-farmer priorities included in \nthe Senate version passed last February, but my amendments were dropped \nby the conferees.\n  Who is this bad for? It is bad for small and medium sized farmers, \nthe very people a farm bill is suppose to help. Throughout the history \nof farm bills, their intent has been to aim the majority of the benefit \nto small and medium sized producers, the Congress has missed before, \nbut in my opinion we have never missed so badly.\n  We sent strong family-farmer oriented provisions to the conference \nand we got nothing in return, except a bill that is so complex family \nfarmers won't receive their 2002 crop benefits until right before \nharvest of the 2003 crop. That might make sense to the conferees, but \nit does not to me or any of the other farmers that are calling and \nemailing my office asking questions about this bill and why we made the \nfarm bill so complicated.\n  This clearly does not address the needs of small and medium-sized \nproducers in Iowa that put a premium on the issues of payment limits \nand banning packer-ownership, so I am going to vote against this bill \nand do anything I can to remedy the issues regarding competition that \nthe conferees discarded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today and apologize to my colleagues. I \nreserved a lot of time to come speak but I have gotten involved in the \ndebate about our effort to get trade promotion authority. I think it is \ntime well spent. I think the average farmer, in terms of real \nprosperity, is going to get more if we are successful in trade \npromotion authority than they are going to get under this bill. So I do \nnot have any apologies to make about the use of the time. I think for \nfarmers and for America trade promotion authority is a lot more \nimportant.\n  I am going to vote against this bill because it is a bad bill. We \nhave created a miracle in America, and I think this bill is going to \nadd to that miracle. The miracle is we have the best farmers, with the \nbest talent, with the most effective research system in history, \nworking the best land, with the best tools, and we have created a \nsituation where rural America is no longer a good place to make a \nliving.\n  How is all that possible? It is possible because we have created a \nprogram that encourages overproduction and, in the process, \nimpoverishes the very people who are trying to make a living farming \nand ranching in America. We have artificially inflated the value of \nagricultural land. We have spent money at a level unprecedented in \nhistory. We continue that in this bill. Surely there has to be concern \nthat the top 10 percent of the recipients under this bill will get 37 \ntimes as much money on average as the bottom 80 percent will get. How \ncan it make sense to have a bill where 10 percent of the beneficiaries \nwill get 37 times as much money as the bottom 80 percent will get?\n  The average family in America, two-wage-earner family, earns about \n$49,000 a year. When President Clinton was in office we tried to reduce \nthe taxes paid by two-wage-earner families by stretching the 15-percent \ntax bracket. Our Democrat colleagues said they were opposed to it \nbecause they said it only helped rich people. I remember pointing out \non the floor that these rich people made on average $21,600 each. Each \nmember of this working couple family, the ones who were going to \nbenefit of stretching this 15-percent bracket, made $21,600. Many of my \ncolleagues said those are rich people.\n  I pointed out, when did $21,600 a year qualify you as being \nrich? But, nevertheless, we were unable to do it because President \nClinton vetoed the bill.\n\n  When the Senate debated this bill, we had an amendment that Senator \nGrassley offered that put a cap on the amount of payments a person \ncould receive under this bill. His amendment said that no one could get \nmore than $275,000 of taxpayer money under this farm bill. Remember \nthat many of our Democrat colleagues said if you made $21,600 you were \ntoo rich for a tax cut. Senator Grassley offered an amendment that said \nthe Government can give you over 10 times that amount--$275,000 per \nfarmer. We adopted that amendment--I am proud to say I voted for it--66 \nto 31. Then we went to conference. Both Houses set a lower cap as to \nhow much money any individual farmer or rancher can get under the bill. \nAnd, all of a sudden, what happens? They go to a cap of $360,000--\nhigher than either House adopted.\n  Then, we have a three-entity rule.\n  Then, we have a husband-and-wife rule.\n  Then, we have a commodity certificate rule.\n  The bottom line is, you can get millions of dollars under this farm \nbill. One individual can get millions of dollars. So apparently it is \nOK to pay one person in agriculture millions of dollars, but we can't \ngive a tax cut to people who make $21,600 a year because they are rich. \nI don't understand that. I don't know how you can justify it. Needless \nto say, since I am voting against this bill, I am not going to have to.\n  By raising these loan rates in this bill, we have guaranteed that we \nare going to glut every market with every commodity. Under this bill, \nevery commodity that gets this loan guarantee is going to be under \npressure to overproduce.\n  Anybody who knows anything about the functioning of the farm economy \nknows that when you set that loan rate above the market price, which \nthis bill does, you are going to have people producing for the loan. \nThe commodities are then going to be dumped on the markets.\n  For 6 long years under this bill we are going to have gross \noverproduction, we are going to drive prices down, and we are going to \nhave all kinds of commodities in storage. We are going to have all the \nexcesses we had under the farm bill prior to the bill that we are \nconsidering here.\n  But that doesn't seem to be enough. This bill brings new commodities \ninto these programs. We eliminated some of these programs before but \nnow they are brought back to life.\n  It seems to me the bottom line of this bill is that it is going to \nguarantee overproduction--I am sorry this is going to happen because I \nthink it is going to be very harmful to rural America. It is going to \nguarantee depressed prices, and it is going to mean increased \nGovernment interventions to try to limit production.\n  So the Government, once again, is going to be telling people what to \ngrow and what not to grow. I think that is a step in the wrong \ndirection.\n  This bill also allows people who came to America illegally to get \nfood stamps. I am opposed to that. I am not trying to be hardhearted. \nBut there is a very real problem when you give benefits to people who \nviolate the law--you encourage them to violate the law.\n  When the Senate debated this bill, I offered a compromise which was \nadopted. That compromise said anybody who has been here for 5 years and \nis now here legally can qualify for food stamps, but that no one who \ncomes and stays here illegally for one year or more can qualify.\n  The reason I offered this compromise is because we want people to \ncome to America who want to work. We want\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\npeople to come to America with their sleeves rolled up, not with their \nhand held out. It fundamentally changes America when you do that. \nHaving a provision that says you can come here illegally and still get \nfood stamps is like putting a neon sign up on the border that says: \nViolate the law. Come into America illegally, and we will give you food \nstamps.\n  Let me sum up by saying I am not saying this bill is the embodiment \nof all evil. There are some good things in this bill. Doing away with \nthe old peanut quota, God knows, was a good thing. But I believe we are \npaying people too much to buy out the old quota.\n  The point is: Having the Government limit the ability of people to \ngrow peanuts makes absolutely no sense. But by setting these loan rates \nso high, we are going to end up with a peanut-like program in all of \nthese other areas over the next 6 years because we are not going to be \nable to pay for this program.\n  Finally, we said when we adopted the bill that it was going to cost \n$73 billion. It turned out that it cost $82 billion. Every penny of \nthat will come right out of Social Security.\n  We have colleagues who stand up on the floor day after day saying \ndon't spend the Social Security surplus. When you vote for this farm \nbill, you are spending the Social Security surplus.\n  Not everything in this bill is bad. There are some improvements in \nthe bill. But, overall, it is a move back to Government control of \nagriculture.\n  Is there a silver lining in this? I think there is. I think this will \nprobably be the last farm bill we pass. I think what has happened is, \nthanks to the Internet, people understand that while we talk about the \nsmall farmer, the fact is the top 10 percent of the people are getting \n37 times as much in Government payments as the small farmer. This bill \ngoes so far that it tilts the balance. In the end, I think this will \nundo this type farm bill, and in the long run it is good for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, the \ntime will be charged equally to both sides.\n\n\n      effect of payment limits means-test on conservation programs\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Harkin and \nRanking Member Lugar for their excellent work on the farm bill. And I \nwant to point out, in particular, their work to improve conservation \nprograms.\n  I would like to engage Chairman Harkin in a colloquy to elaborate on \ncongressional intent behind the effect of the $2.5 million means-test \nwith regard to conservation programs. It is my understanding that the \npurpose of the means-test is to prevent wealthy individuals with \nadjusted gross income of more than $2.5 million from receiving \ngovernment benefits on land signed up for conservation programs. \nHowever, it was never the intent to subject non-profit organizations \nthat actively work on conservation activities to the means-test. Isn't \nthis correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Lincoln is absolutely correct that the intent is \nnot to exclude these non-profit groups that are actively involved in \ndelivery of conservation programs. The work that non-profit \norganizations do under these conservation programs helps expand \nwildlife habitat and protect and improve all natural resources. This \nprovision was not intended to limit participation by non-profit land \ntrust groups or wildlife groups, like Ducks Unlimited, the Nature \nConservancy, or Pheasants Forever, or any other non-profit group that \nparticipates in the agricultural conservation programs.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you for that explanation, and thank you for the \nhard work you and your excellent staff have put into the farm bill and, \nparticularly, into the conservation title.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, and thank you for your hard work in getting \nthis important farm bill, with its strong conservation title, passed.\n\n\n  CHANGES TO THE VALUE-ADDED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT MARKET DEVELOPMENT \n                             GRANT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the chairman to elaborate on the intent behind some of the changes \nmade to the value-added agricultural product market development grant \nprogram in this farm bill. My understanding is that under this new \nlanguage, USDA should seek to fund a broad diversity of projects that \nincrease agricultural producers' share of the food and agricultural \nsystem profit, including projects likely to increase the profitability \nand viability of small and medium-sized farms and ranches. I certainly \nagree that USDA should seek to approve applications for projects likely \nto benefit producers with small and medium-sized agricultural \noperations. Do you agree that the language of this provision will allow \nUSDA to do this?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. Yes, I believe that \nthe changes we have made to this program will allow USDA to fund a wide \nvariety of value added projects that benefit small and mid-sized \nproducers as well as larger producers and organizations of producers. \nFor example, we broadened the definition of ``value-added'' to insure \nthat producers who add value to agricultural products by the manner in \nwhich they produce them may now apply for value-added grants to market \ntheir products. This is important, because many small and medium-sized \nfarms have found that they can increase their profits and stay in \nbusiness by converting their farms to organic and other types of \nhigher-value production. It is clear that many consumers will pay more \nfor products that are grown and produced in specific ways. This \nbroadening of the value-added grants program will assist farmers or \ngroups of farmers engaged in producing these kinds of high-value \nproducts in developing business plans and marketing their products, \nthereby contributing to the success of these kinds of ventures. I also \nexpect that a large share of the grants will continue to be made to \nproduce new non-food products, expanding the markets of corn, soybeans \nand other crops well beyond the market for foods. The bill also \nspecifically allows for grants for on-farm renewable generation such as \nwind turbines.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I understand this bill also broadens eligibility for \nthe program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Minnesota is again correct. The \nexpectation is that USDA will extend edibility to a broad range of \nproducer groups, including farmer and rancher cooperatives. Business \nventures with majority control by producers many receive up to 10 \npercent of grants provided. Nonprofit organizations controlled by \nproducers, whose mission includes working on behalf of producers, and \nwho otherwise meet the eligibility criteria established by USDA, shall \nalso be eligible for grants under this program.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I commend my colleague from Iowa on his work on this \nprovision. I certainly hope that USDA will make every effort to fund a \nwide variety of projects and to make grants of a wide variety of sizes, \nincluding small and mid-sized grants where appropriate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is certainly my expectation. I thank my colleague \nfrom Minnesota for his hard work on this provision in committee, and \nfor his support of the changes we have made in the program.\n\n\n                             chesapeake bay\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, would the distinguished floor manager \nyield for the purpose of a colloquy concerning two programs of great \nimportance to the continued efforts to restore and protect the \nChesapeake Bay.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be happy to yield to the senior Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am deeply disappointed that the conference report \ndoes not include two provisions included in the Senate-passed farm bill \nwhich sought to address the critical environmental needs of the \nChesapeake Bay. The first provision, the Nutrient Reduction Pilot \nProgram, sought to encourage the development of innovative solutions to \nthe nutrient pollution problem in the bay by creating new incentives \nfor farmers to reduce the application of nitrogen by at least 15 \npercent below what is normally considered best practice and to provide \nfinancial protection in the event of reduced yields. The second \nprovision strengthened the role of the U.S. Forest Service in the \nrestoration of the bay watershed. While I understand that disagreements \nwith the House Conferees prevented the inclusion of these programs in \nthe final bill, it is my understanding that the conference report does \ninclude\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\nprovisions that will be helpful in implementing the Nutrient Reduction \nPilot Program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct. In fact, the conference report \nincludes specific language in section 2003 that establishes \nPartnerships and Cooperation, a program specifically intended to allow \nstates like those in the Chesapeake Bay region--and the Chesapeake Bay \nis specifically mentioned--to submit innovative proposals which \ncoordinate and implement all of the conservation programs in the bill \nto achieve priority conservation objectives. It is modeled in many ways \non the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. The language \nspecifically provides that all the resources of the different \nconservation programs can be used, and indeed it provides that in \naddition to committing acres and resources from the different \nconservation programs to a special partnership, the Secretary has \nspecial flexibility with regard to 5 percent of the funds available for \nall conservation programs to use them for any activities authorized by \nany conservation programs. This bill will make on average $1.2 billion \nper year available for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program; \nany of these funds can be committed to a special partnership, and I \nthink it would be reasonable and I would certainly be willing to work \nwith the Senator from Maryland to encourage the Secretary to commit $20 \nmillion per year to the Chesapeake Bay region's innovative proposals to \nreduce nitrogen application using market-based strategies. Maryland is \nalso specifically included in Section 2501, the Agricultural Management \nAssistance Program, making it eligible to share in at least $110 \nmillion to implement, among other things, resource conservation \npractices.\n  Finally, the Senator from Maryland has my commitment and the \ncommitment of the majority leader that we will work with him to address \nhis concerns about the continuing loss of forestlands in the Chesapeake \nBay watershed by enhancing the support and resources of the U.S. Forest \nService to the bay cleanup effort.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chairman for his continued efforts on \nbehalf of the Chesapeake Bay and its farmers and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work together with him in this regard.\n\n\n             technical assistance for conservation programs\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senators from Iowa and Mississippi.\n  Mr. President, the 1996 farm bill contained a provision which led to \nserious disruption in the delivery of conservation programs. \nSpecifically, the 1996 act placed a cap on the transfers of Commodity \nCredit Corporation funds to other government entities. Is the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa aware of the so called ``section 11 \ncap?''\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Indiana for raising this issue, \nbecause it is an important one. The Section 11 cap prohibited \nexpenditures by the Commodity Credit Corporation beyond the Fiscal Year \n1995 level to reimburse other government entities for services. \nUnfortunately, in the 1996 farm bill, many conservation programs were \nunintentionally caught under the section 11 cap. As a result, during \nthe past 6 years, conservation programs have had serious shortfalls in \ntechnical assistance. There was at least one stoppage of work on the \nConservation Reserve Program. The Appropriations Committees have had to \nrespond to the problem ad hoc by redirecting resources and providing \nemergency spending to deal with the problem. This has been a problem \nnot just in my state of Iowa or in your states of Indiana and \nMississippi; it has been a nationwide constraint on conservation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chairman for the clarification, and I would \ninquire whether the legislation under consideration here today will fix \nthe problem of the section 11 cap for conservation programs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his attention to \nthis important issue. Section 2701 of the Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act of 2002 recognizes that technical assistance is an \nintegral part of each conservation program. Therefore, technical \nassistance will be funded through the mandatory funding for each \nprogram provided by the bill. As a result, for directly funded \nprograms, such as the Conservation Security Program (CSP) and the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), funding for technical \nassistance will come from the borrowing authority of the Commodity \nCredit Corporation, and will no longer be affected by section 11 of the \nCCC Charter Act.\n  For those programs such as the CRP, WRP, and the Grasslands Reserve \nProgram (GRP), which involve enrollment based on acreage, the technical \nassistance funding will come from the annual program outlays \napportioned by OMB--again, from the borrowing authority of the CCC. \nThese programs, too, will no longer be affected by section 11 of the \nCCC Charter Act. This legislation will provide the level of funding \nnecessary to cover all technical assistance costs, including training; \nequipment; travel; education, evaluation and assessment, and whatever \nelse is necessary to get the programs implemented.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chairman for that clarification. With the \nlevel of new resources and new workload that we are requiring from the \nDepartment, and specifically the Natural Resources Conservation \nService, I hear concerns back in my state that program delivery should \nnot be disrupted, and the gentleman has reassured me that it will not.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is then my understanding that, under the provisions \nof this bill, the technical assistance necessary to implement the \nconservation programs will not come at the expense of the good work \nalready going on in the countryside in conservation planning, \nassistance to grazing lands, and other activities supported within the \nNRCS conservation operations account. And, further, this action will \nrelieve the appropriators of an often reoccurring problem.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Both gentlemen are correct. The programs directly funded \nby the CCC--EQIP, FPP, WHIP, and the CSP--as well as the acreage \nprograms--CRP, WRP, and the GRP--include funding for technical \nassistance that comes out of the program funds. And this mandatory \nfunding in now way affects the ongoing work of the NRCS Conservation \nOperations Program.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chairman for his efforts to resolve this \nproblem.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I also appreciate the Chairman's work to ensure that \nadequate resources are available for technical assistance.\n\n\n        ALLOCATION OF SENIORS FARMERS' MARKET NUTRITION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank Senator Harkin \nfor all of his hard work in putting together this Farm Bill. One of the \nmost important parts of this legislation deals with nutrition, and \nensuring that all Americans have access to a healthy meal. I am \nespecially pleased to see an additional $5 million in funding provided \nfor the Seniors' Farmers Market Nutrition Program for fiscal year 2002. \nIn the 2002 Agriculture Appropriations bill, we provided $10 million \nfor this important program, and encouraged the Secretary to use \nadditional funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation if necessary. \nHowever, although there is a clear need for these additional funds, and \nthe Secretary has been reminded of this language on several occasions, \nthese additional funds have not been released. The result of this is \nthat 9 States and territories, including my state of Wisconsin, \nreceived funding for this program last year and applied this year to \ncontinue their programs, but were turned away. I intend to include \nreport language in the homeland security supplemental bill I am \ncurrently working on in the Appropriations Committee directing the \nSecretary to use any additional funds that become available to provide \nfunding for these states. I appreciate my friend's efforts to include \nthis additional money in the farm bill, and am hopeful that it will \nprovide at least partial relief to the drastic funding cuts being felt \nby these States.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Wisconsin for raising this \nimportant matter. I agree with his comments and am pleased that we are \nable to provide additional resources, through the farm bill, to assist \nStates that did not receive funding for this year. I also hope that \nfunding for States that successfully completed applications, and \nreceived insufficient funding, is increased. Clearly, there is a \nfunding\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\nshortage for this program and I want to stress that the purpose of the \n$5 million in the farm bill is not meant to replace the CCC funds \nmentioned by my colleague, but rather to supplement them. I support my \ncolleague in his efforts to ensure that no State or territory that \nwishes to participate in this program is turned away. The Seniors' \nFarmers Market Nutrition Program provides an important service, one \nthat brings low-income senior citizens and local farmers together in a \nmutually beneficial relationship.\n\n\n                        tree assistance program\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin, and congratulate \nhim for his leadership over the past year. The farm bill is a \ntremendous victory on so many fronts. I want to especially thank him \nfor the landmark inclusion of specialty crops in this farm bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator informed me from the beginning that specialty \ncrops like apples, cherries, blueberries, cherries, and asparagus are \ncritically important for Michigan's agriculture economy. She has been a \npowerful advocate for specialty crops and I appreciated your hard work \nthroughout this process to include them in this farm bill.\n  Ms. STABENOW. The farm bill before us has a $2 billion specialty crop \nprogram which provides a minimum of $200 million per year in USDA \nSection 32 purchases for nutrition programs. This new allocation of \nfunds will provide much needed help for growers of fruits and \nvegetables. It has been a true privilege to work with the Senator to \ndevelop this new program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think all of our colleagues on the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and in the Senate would agree that \nthe Senator's strong backing was absolutely instrumental in obtaining \nthe $2 billion specialty crop purchase program.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator. I would like to discuss another \ncritical program that we included in the farm bill for specialty \ncrops--the Tree Assistance Program, TAP.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, TAP is a critical program that provides \nreimbursement for trees, like cherry trees and apple trees, which have \nbeen destroyed by natural disaster.\n  Ms. STABENOW. TAP is very important, especially in Michigan. In 2000, \nour apple growers in the southwest region of the state suffered from \ndevastating fire blight that destroyed over 10,000 acres of apple \norchards resulting in an estimated total loss of $98 million for apple \ngrowers in Michigan.\n  Unfortunately, the funding for TAP expired the year before and none \nof these growers could apply for assistance.\n  I thank the Senator for reauthorizing TAP in the farm bill. In the \nSenate version of the farm bill, the reauthorization for TAP included \nthe following language regarding eligibility, ``(a) shall apply to tree \nlosses that are incurred as a result of a natural disaster after \nJanuary 1, 2000.''\n  Mr. HARKIN. I supported retroactive eligibility for TAP and supported \nthat provision in the bill that passed out of the committee. A majority \nof the Senate also supported this provision.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator. I look forward to working with him \nto insure that the apple growers in my State who suffered such terrible \nlosses in 2000 will receive help through the Tree Assistance Program.\n\n\n                             Section 10816\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers and other \nmembers of the conference for their efforts to maintain the Senate's \nintentions with respect to section 10816, which requires country-of-\norigin labeling for seafood products, among others. This provision is \nvery important to the seafood industry in my State of Alaska.\n  However, I note that the definition of ``wild fish'' applies to \n``naturally born or hatchery raised fish and shellfish harvested in the \nwild.'' This may lead to some confusion. As my colleagues know, fish \ngenerally are ``hatched'' rather than ``born.'' In addition, I \nunderstand it was the Senate's intent to apply this definition to \nhatchery fish only when they are released shortly after hatching, and \nlive the rest of their lives in the same environment as naturally \noccurring fish of the same species.\n  I wish to ask the managers if my understanding is correct, and agree \nthat the definition of wild fish should be interpreted to mean \n``naturally or artificially hatched fish that grow to maturity and are \nharvested in the wild.''\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska both for \nhis comments on the conference and for his question. His observation \nthat fish are hatched rather than born is well taken, and I agree with \nthe way he has rephrased the definition. It is indeed our intention \nthat the definition of ``wild fish'' apply only to fish that spend the \nbulk of their lives in the wild. This differentiates them from \n``farmed-raised fish,'' which are raised in confinement until they are \nharvested.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am grateful to my colleague for bringing \nthis point to our attention, and concur that wild fish are those which \nspend most of their lives free of confinement, whereas farm-raised fish \nare those which are held in pens or tanks until harvested.\n\n\n                             KLAMATH BASIN\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to thank my Senate colleagues, specifically \nChairman Harkin, for their continued attention to a matter of such \nimportance to the people of the Klamath Basin in Oregon and California. \nI especially want to thank my friends and colleagues, Senators Gordon \nSmith, Boxer, and Feinstein, for their initial help in getting Klamath \nlanguage and money accepted into the farm bill. And I want to recognize \nthe hard work and dedication of the chairman, Senator Daschle, and \ntheir staffs for sticking by the Klamath Basin until the bitter end. I \nalso want to thank my friend on the other side of the Capitol, \nRepresentative Walden, for his dedication to the Klamath Basin. Thanks \nto his collective bi-partisan effort, today I can come to the floor to \ndiscuss the future for the Klamath Basin with some hope.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Your dogged attention to the Klamath provision was \ncritical and appreciated. I thank you for all your support in getting \nthis important legislation off the Senate floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The conference report provides $50,000,000 under section \n1240I Ground and Surface Water Conservation. It is important for the \nlegislative history of this section to note that the conference report \nstates.\n  In carrying out the program . . . the Secretary shall promote grounds \nand surface water conservation by providing cost-share payments, \nincentive payments, and loans to producers to carry out eligible water \nconservation activities with respect to the agricultural operations of \nproducers, to--(1) improve irrigation systems; (2) enhance irrigation \nefficiencies; (3) convert to--(A) the production of less water-\nintensive agricultural commodities; or (B) dryland farming; (4) improve \nthe storage of water though measures such as water banking and \ngroundwater recharge; (5) mitigate the effects of drought or (6) \ninstitute other measures that improve groundwater surface water \nconservation, as determined by the Secretary, in the agricultural \noperations of producers.\n  In addition to all those excellent purposes, this section requires \nthat a Secretary may only provide this money to a producer if the net \nresult is ``a new savings in groundwater or surface water resources in \nthe agricultural operation of the producer.'' Chairman Harkin, it \nappears to me that these purposes coincide with the purposes of the \noriginal Klamath language in the Senate farm bill: water conservation \nand improved agricultural practices; aquatic ecosystem restoration; and \nimprovement of water quality. Do you read it the same way?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The difference is that the original language brought to \nlight the need to recover endangered species, including both anadromous \nand resident fish species; and maintenance of the National Wildlife \nRefuges.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Even so, Senator Wyden, the $50,000,000 provided by this \nfarm bill conference report for the Klamath Basin used under this \nprogram should benefit endangered species and the refuges in the \nKlamath Basin. Any program that improves water quality and quantity, as \nthis one does, will necessarily support the recovery of threatened and \nendangered species.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I agree. I am grateful that the other long-term benefits \nthat were to be considered under the original Senate Klamath language \nwill still\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\nbe considered under this provision: benefits to the agricultural \neconomy through incentives for the use of irrigation efficiency, water \nconservation, or other agricultural practices; wetland restoration; and \nimprovement of upper Basin watershed and water quality. Due to the \ncooperative nature of all farm programs, I remain hopeful that this \nprovision will be implemented in a manner that respects and uses the \nlocal expertise of the Klamath Basin farmers. In addition, this program \nshould be implemented in the Klamath Basin while the administration \nconsiders the long term effects of the water savings.\n  The original Senate Klamath language required the USDA to spend $175 \nmillion over 5 years, through the Natural Resources Conservation \nService and the Farm Service Agency, on Klamath Basin hydrology and \nwetlands restoration using any applicable USDA program. The particular \nprograms were not noted in order to provide some flexibility for the \nDepartment and basin farmers. The current language limits that \nflexibility, but fills an important purpose in the basin.\n  I am thankful that the President established a cabinet level Klamath \nWorking Group, made up of the Secretaries of Interior, Agriculture, and \nCommerce, thereby fulfilling another purpose of Senate Klamath language \nthat authorized the creation of a Klamath Basin Interagency Task Force \nmade up of agencies from the Departments of Interior, Agriculture, and \nCommerce. It is my hope, however, that while the Senate Klamath \nlanguage required public non-federal notice of work and intended plans \nby the Interagency Task Force to provide local awareness and the \nconference report does not, the current Administration Working group \nwould provide such public notice.\n  But there is more work to be done. While the $50,000,000 provided for \nproducers to conserve water in the Klamath Basin is a start, it will \nnot complete the entire hydrological restoration necessary in the \nbasin. The basin requires specific projects such as these I list here \nto restore the basin: $3,479,000 for feasibility studies by the Bureau \nof Reclamation, included in the President's funding request for the \nKlamath Project for FY 2002; $4 million to purchase, one time, 2700 \nacres at Goose Bay in Upper Klamath Lake (TNC); $25 million over 5 \nyears for the restoration of the Upper Klamath Lake tributaries (such \nas the Sprague, Williamson, and Wood Rivers); $40 million over 5 years \nfor the restoration of historic Upper Klamath Lake wetlands; $20 \nmillion over 5 years for the restoration of Lake Ewauna below Upper \nKlamath Lake that is essential for sucker habitat; $1 million for \nriparian fencing, grazing management, stream-bank restoration and \nrevegetation under CRP; $5 million for the purchase of the Barnes \nproperty by the Bureau of Reclamation for the whole project to be \nmanaged by the Bur Rec, county commissioners, local water irrigation \ndistricts, USDA and F Service and the Tribes, using some portion of \nthe money for a set-aside to match state and private wetland \nrestoration dollars from entities such as OWEB and Oregon Water Trust \nand designate some portion of the money for scientific work including \nscientific work by the Klamath Tribe Department of Natural Resources; \n$4,500,000 of new funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \nconduct in-stream flow studies in the basin deemed necessary by the \nSecretary, including in-stream flow studies below Iron Gate Dam; $20 \nmillion for the voluntary lease of water rights; $1 million for the \nevaluation of intentional winter flooding of volunteer agricultural \nlands: Dry Year Reserve--to idle basin irrigated acreage--promoted by \nWater Users through Bur Rec but could be done through shorter contracts \nin WRP; $15 million for the purchase of water easements; $10 million \nfor the construction of groundwater wells in conjunction with USGS \nsurveys; $5 million authorized for grants to local irrigation \ndistricts, through the Rural Development/Utilities accounts to improve \nirrigation of Klamath Basin practices that will conserve water and \nimprove water quality.\n\n  In addition to the above concerns, this money will not be available \nto the native American tribes in the basin, the Klamath, the Yurok, the \nKurok, and the Hoopa. This is a shame. These tribes make up an \nimportant user group in the basin and no real long-term solution will \nbe achievable without them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Wyden, where appropriate and within the \njurisdiction of the Committees on which I serve, I will be happy to \nwork with you in the pursuit of beneficial programs and funding for the \nKlamath Basin.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n                conservation programs in the everglades\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Harkin and Ranking \nSenator Lugar for their excellent work on the farm bill before us \ntoday. I am pleased to recognize that this legislation expands and \nimproves many of the conservation programs administered by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. Farmers are the best conservationists in the \nworld and this farm bill gives them more tools to be even better \nstewards of the environment.\n  I would like to engage Chairman Harkin and Senator Lugar in a \ncolloquy to elaborate a bit on the very good language in the Statement \nof Managers that calls upon the Secretary of Agriculture to work with \nappropriate State and Federal officials to use USDA conservation \nprograms to supplement the work of the Comprehensive Everglades \nRestoration Plan as it is implemented in the South Florida Ecosystem.\n  Our success in restoring the Everglades depends a great deal on the \nhealth of Lake Okeechobee and the systems which feed into that great \nlake, such as the Kissimmee River and its chain of lakes. It is my \nunderstanding that the direction in the Statement of Managers is \nintended to use conservation programs to enhance the health of those \necosystems as well. Am I correct in my interpretation of that very good \nlanguage?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely correct in his interpretation \nof that language and I wish to thank him for his assistance to the \ncommittee on this matter. There has been no stronger advocate of the \nEverglades through the years than the senior Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree with the Chairman. I, too, have been pleased to \nwork on behalf of Everglades restoration through the years. The \nconservation programs of USDA are improved by this legislation and I am \npleased that the conferees to the farm bill recognize the promise of \nthese programs to assist in Everglades restoration.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the distinguished Chairman and the ranking member \nof the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry for \ntheir work on the farm bill and the assistance it will render to \nrestore the Everglades. For instance, work in areas such as the \nKissimmee River system will serve, among other things, to enhance the \nnatural storage of water necessary for restoration further south in the \nsystem. Implementing the type of conservation practices included in \nthese Department of Agriculture programs in areas such as the Kissimmee \nRiver and Lake Okeechobee can improve restoration efforts \nsubstantially.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary of Agriculture Veneman, and \nother State and Federal officials to utilize these programs in a \ncoordinated and effective manner.\n\n\n                               wild fish\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, title X of the farm bill contains \nprovisions that would provide country of origin labeling for certain \ncovered products. This program will specifically inform consumers right \nat their local markets whether they are eating U.S. products, or \nproducts produced under the laws of another nation. In a time of \nuncertainty about our economic, environmental, and personal security, \nwe want to provide this level of assurance to our citizens and to our \nproducers. U.S. origin labeling is important because it will allow \nconsumers to vote with their wallets to support U.S. farmers, ranchers, \nand fishermen. This is important in the case of wild-caught fish, \nparticularly in Hawaii, where we have traditionally relied on our vast \nocean ``backyard'' for sustenance, chasing highly migratory species \nlike tuna and swordfish as well as closer to shore species.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from Iowa, one of the managers of the \nbill, if this is not the purpose of the country of origin provision?\n\n[[Page S4023]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Indeed, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii is correct \nabout the intent of the provision.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator. As Senator Harkin has since learned, \nthe provision contains a technical matter that would undermine this \nimportant purpose. As Hawaiian fishermen well know, because of their \nmigratory nature, certain species of fish are often caught outside of \nthe 200-mile U.S. exclusive economic zone--more than 50 percent of the \ncatch landed by Hawaii vessels are harvested on the high seas. These \ninclude tuna, swordfish, and squid. Whether U.S. fishermen are in U.S. \nwaters or on the high seas pursuing highly migratory species like tuna, \nfrom the time they leave the dock to the time they return to port, our \nfishermen are subject to U.S. law--some of the most stringent \nconservation, safety and health restrictions in the world. This has \noften led to economic hardship. I do not object to the purpose of such \ncostly measures, but what do I tell these fishermen when they are \nundersold in the market by the foreign-caught fish, which are harvested \nin an indiscriminate and environmentally unsound manner? I would like \nto tell them that they will benefit from a U.S. label, and that their \nlegal compliance will be rewarded in the marketplace. But the technical \nmatter in the farm bill will not allow this to happen. Moreover, it \nwill result in a labeling gap that will confuse consumers. Under the \nlanguage in the bill, a migratory fish that is harvested beyond the \n200-mile zone by a U.S. fisherman on a U.S. registered vessel, \nprocessed under U.S. regulations, and landed at a U.S. dock, does not \nqualify for a U.S. origin label.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank Senator Inouye for summing up a complicated \nissue in simple and clear language. When you and I discussed this \nissue, I was immediately concerned. There appears to be a simple \nsolution for labeling of wild-caught fish: allow fish caught by a U.S. \nflag vessel to be labeled with the U.S. as the country of origin. This \nwould have the added benefit of bringing the point of sale label into \nconformity with the approach taken by U.S. customs regulations. \nMoreover, the extreme perishability of some ocean products require \nprocessing at sea. For example, squid must be processed where ever it \nis caught or it will spoil--thus, if caught by a U.S. flag vessel on \nthe high seas, it would have to be processed on the high seas according \nto U.S. requirements.\n  I had shared Senator Inouye's hope that this technical correction \nmight be included in the farm bill, and I worked with him, and Senators \nDaschle and Harkin toward that end. Although time did not permit the \ninclusion of the provision, I believe that Senator Harkin may have a \nfew words to offer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank you Senator Hollings. When Senator Hollings and \nSenator Inouye brought this matter to my attention, I welcomed their \nexpertise in marine matters, and did my best to have the suggested \ntechnical amendment included. Regrettably, during the eleventh hour, it \nproved not to be possible.\n  I hope, however, that this amendment may find another vehicle for its \nspeedy passage.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for taking the lead on making the broadband \ninitiative a part of the farm bill. I also want to thank the ranking \nmember of the committee and Senator Daschle for their work on this \nprogram. The $100 million provided in the farm bill for broadband is \nunprecedented and long past due to ensure Rural America has the same \naccess to broadband service as its urban neighbors.\n  Several years ago, I introduced legislation to establish a new \nFederal broadband program. The chairman is a cosponsor of this \nlegislation. And now, after 2 years of a pilot program similar to my \nbill, the farm bill gives the rural broadband program under the Rural \nUtilities Service an authorization and funding. That funding will \ncreate hundreds of millions of dollars of broadband loans each year.\n  The Rural Utilities Service, RUS, once known as the Rural \nElectrification Administration, REA, has administered a \ntelecommunications program for over 50 years. It has been an \nunprecedented success. In 1949, about 40 percent of American farmers \nhad phone service. Today, that has changed dramatically and nearly \neveryone at least has a telephone. Not only do these investments need \nto be maintained, but we need to make new investments in the next \ngeneration of telecommunications technology, known as broadband, to \nensure that all Americans have access to the Internet.\n  The RUS lending record in its telecommunications program which would \nbe the envy of any financial institution in America. In over 50 years, \nthere has not been a single loan loss in the RUS/REA telecommunications \nprogram. In recent years, the agency has been leading the American \ninformation revolution by financing some of the most advanced \ntelecommunications systems in the Nation.\n  The broadband provisions of this bill should significantly advance \nthe deployment of broadband technologies in all regions of the country. \nIt should spur the deployment of new wireline, wireless, cable, and \nsatellite broadband infrastructure and service. It promotes \ntechnological neutrality and a definition of broadband, which is \nmeaningful, flexible and appropriate to spur significant advancement in \nall technologies.\n  For the purposes of ensuring a successful implementation of this \nprogram, it would be helpful if the chairman could respond to a few \nquestions about the legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would be pleased to answer the questions \nof the Senator from North Dakota. But first, I want to thank the \nSenator for your and your staff's work on this issue. Together, we've \ncome up with a great intiative that will serve Rural America in the \ninformation age. The Senator and his bipartisan group of supporters are \nto be congratulated for their work on this important legislation. It \nwill spur new investment in rural broadband.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Does the legislation give the Administrator of the Rural \nUtilities Service flexibility to adopt a definition of broadband, which \nencourages advancement in all modes of communications?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct. The legislation seeks to foster \nsignificant advancement in all rural applications of broadband. In this \ncontext, technological neutrality should not be used to preclude \nprogress in any given technology. For example, what is broadband in a \nfixed setting may be different than what is broadband in a mobile \nwireless setting. In both cases, the measure of broadband capability \nshould be based on capability of the network, not the individual \ndevices used to access the network. This legislation is intended to \nhelp rural citizens gain access to modern broadband information \nnetworks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Does the chairman expect the RUS to maintain its high \nstandards of determining the financial feasibility of broadband loans?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This expansion of authority should not be viewed by \nanyone as a loosening of financial feasibility standards at the RUS. \nSimply put, if there is not a reasonable likelihood of repayment, the \nloan should not be made. That is how the RUS and the REA have operated \nfor 65 years and that is how the agency should operate with this new \nauthority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Given that record of success and assuming a treasury rate \nof interest, would it be reasonable that the $20 million a year \nincluded in this bill for the early years of this program could fund a \ntreasury rate of interest broadband loan program of at least $750 \nmillion a year?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under credit reform, there are essentially two components \nto determining the subsidy rate for any loan program. Those components \nare any discount from the treasury rate of borrowing and the risk \nrelated to the loan. The RUS telecommunications loan program has not \nsuffered a loan loss. In fact, the RUS telecommunications loan program \nhas over its life, made money for the Government. Broadband lending \nwithin the RUS parameters does not necessarily bring with it a higher \nrisk profile.\n  The process by which the Office of Management and Budget determines \nsubsidy rates for Federal loan programs is sometimes viewed as a \nmysterious process to say the least, given the year to year swings in \nthe subsidy rates for the same or similar programs and classes of \nborrowers. Given the record of the agency, however, and\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\ngiven the treasury rate of interest assumption of your question, $20 \nmillion a year in direct budget authority provided could generate a \nminimum loan level of $750 million a year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as the author of S. 280, the Consumer \nRight-to-Know Act, and the provision in the new farm bill requiring \nretail-level country of origin labeling for beef, pork, lamb, fruits, \nvegetables, peanuts, and fish, I feel compelled to offer my views on \nhow country-of-origin labeling should be implemented by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA. This farm bill provision is not overly \nprescriptive because I believe USDA deserves some degree of discretion \nto develop rules and regulations to ensure this labeling program is \neffective. That being said, I believe it's equally important for USDA \nto adhere to the intent of Congress in passing this important labeling \nlegislation, and to comply with my intent as the primary author.\n  Well-funded opponents of country-of-origin labeling who like to \nimport cheap meat and other products into the United States and \ncamouflage those products as ``Made in the USA'' will make outrageous \nclaims about how country-of-origin labeling is difficult to administer, \nhow it will cost them and USDA resources, and how it just can't work. \nIt's awfully ironic they say these things, when virtually every single \nother item consumers buy at the retail level indicate their country-of-\norigin. The fact is that labeling can be implemented in a low-cost \nmanner, and Congress expects USDA to work with all interested parties \nto make labeling a reality.\n  Nevertheless, passage of country-of-origin labeling will not stop \nthose who don't want consumers to know the origin of meat and other \nitems at the retail-level to try to water-down and minimize this \nlegislation through the rulemaking process and other avenues. \nTherefore, it's important that USDA know my intent with respect to this \nprogram.\n  My labeling provision amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 \n(7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.) and adds subtitle D, a requirement for retail-\nlevel country-of-origin labeling for covered commodities at the final \npoint-of-sale for consumers.\n  This section mandates retail-level, country-of-origin labeling for \ncovered commodities, including beef, lamb, pork, farm-raised fish, wild \nfish, peanuts, and perishable commodities. The purpose of the section \nis to inform consumers about the origin of the meat, fish, peanuts, and \nperishable commodities they purchase at the retail-level. The items \nthat qualify as covered commodities must be labeled with their country-\nof-origin.\n  Under present law, most products require labeling according to their \ncountry-of-origin if they are produced outside of the United States. \nHowever, some products, such as fruits, vegetables, and peanuts have \nbeen excluded from this requirement. Further, meat from livestock or \nfish born outside of the United States, or born and raised outside of \nthe United States, and slaughtered or processed within the United \nStates, are not required to be identified as a foreign product.\n  With respect to meat, the labeling requirement in the farm bill shall \napply to all muscle cuts of beef, pork, and lamb, including, but not \nlimited to, steaks, roasts, chops, tips, ribs, and loins, as covered \ncommodities that must be labeled as to their country-of-origin. \nFurthermore, ground beef, including, but not limited to hamburger and \nground beef patties, whether frozen, chilled, or fresh, ground lamb, \nand ground pork qualify as covered commodities for purposes of country-\nof-origin labeling.\n  If, however, a covered commodity is an ingredient in a processed \nfood, the section does not require that item to be labeled as to its \ncountry-of-origin. For example, if beef, pork, or lamb is an ingredient \nin a can of soup, lunch meat, meat snack, frankfurter, meatball, meat \nsalad, stew, pasta, frozen dinner, frozen entree, or frozen pizza, than \nthe section does not require the food item containing beef, pork, or \nlamb to be labeled with its country-of-origin. However, this exemption \nshall not apply to ground beef or hamburger, as mentioned above, which \nmust qualify as a covered commodity for country-of-origin labeling at \nthe retail-level.\n  While retail-level country-of-origin labeling is required of grocery \nstores and supermarkets, food service establishments are not required \nto notify the country-of-origin of covered commodities that are \nprepared or served to consumers. Because many polls indicate consumers \nwish to know the origin of the food they eat, and many individuals \nconsume food items from food service establishments, food service \nestablishments and restaurants are encouraged to voluntarily notify the \nconsumers as to the country-of-origin of the food products sold at \nrestaurants.\n  At this point, I want to make it unconditionally clear that what is \nmeant by this provision with respect to ``retailer'' is that any \nretailer selling any covered commodity, beef, pork, lamb, fruits, \nvegetables, peanuts, or fish, is required to indicate the country-of-\norigin of that covered commodity at the retail-level or final point of \nsale. While the definitions section of the country-of-origin labeling \nprovision refers to ``retailer'' in the Perishable Agricultural \nCommodities Act, PACA, of 1930, this reference is made only to draw a \ndistinction between retailers and restaurants, because the labeling \nrequirement applies to retailers but not restaurants. Let me make it \nunquestionably clear right now that the only reason S. 280 and the farm \nbill country-of-origin labeling language refers to the word \n``retailer'' is that Congress wanted it to be understood that country-\nof-origin labeling would be required at the retail-level, the final \npoint of sale, as opposed to labeling in restaurants, regardless of \nwhether the product to be labeled by its country-of-origin was a cut of \nbeef or a fruit or vegetable. The intent is to require labeling of all \ncovered commodities at the final point of sale, regardless of what the \nretailer sells, and not to inadvertently allow any retailer to avoid \nthe labeling requirement simply because that retailer may only sell \nperishable agricultural commodities.\n  In the case of meat, the farm bill provision intends for retailers to \ndesignate a covered commodity as having a United States country-of-\norigin only if the meat is from an animal that was born, raised, and \nslaughtered in the United States. An exception is made for beef from \ncattle born and raised in Alaska or Hawaii, and transhipped for a \nperiod not in excess of a period of days through Canada into the United \nStates for slaughter. I understand that the World Trade Organization, \nWTO, committee on Rules of Origin has not yet completed its work on \nharmonizing rules of origin on Chapters 1 and 2 dealing with cattle and \nbeef. Therefore, I encourage the Secretary and U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to immediately develop a position constituting a born, \nraised, and slaughtered standard to determine the origin of meat within \nthe WTO which will be consistent with this section and the current \nvoluntary beef labeling program.\n\n  My legislation does not intend to prescribe the specific type or \nmethod of country-of-origin label that must be used on covered \ncommodities. The means by which the country-of-origin is designated may \ndiffer on a commodity-by-commodity basis. For example, an affixed-label \nmay designate the country-of-origin of a steak or package of ground \nbeef, while a sign on a holding bin may indicate the country-of-origin \nof fruit or vegetables. The section provides examples by which the \ncountry-of-origin of a covered commodity may be provided at the retail-\nlevel, including a label, stamp, mark, placard, or other clear visible \nsign on the covered commodity or on the package, display, holding unit, \nor bin containing the covered commodity at the final point of sale to \nconsumers. For purposes of consistency and equitable national \ntreatment, I encourage the Secretary to work with industry to create a \nlabel that includes the country-of-origin and the commodity. For \nexample, a cut of beef to be labeled as a product of the United States \nmay be labeled, ``United States beef.'' Similarly, a tomato from Mexico \nmay be labeled ``Mexican tomato.''\n  With respect to the type or method of country-of-origin label to be \napplied or used for covered commodities, the Secretary is encouraged to \nseek input from producer and farm organizations, consumers and consumer \ngroups, and industry and businesses affected by the\n\n[[Page S4025]]\n\nsection. The Secretary shall attempt to create a labeling program that \nis easy-to-understand and as uniform as possible for like commodities \nto be covered under the labeling requirement. Furthermore, retailers \nand those responsible for country-of-origin labeling are encouraged to \ndevelop labels that are legible, noticeable, uniform, and easy-to-\nunderstand for consumers.\n  My legislation gives the Secretary discretion to work with those \nresponsible for tracking the origin of items and for designating the \ncountry-of-origin to develop a system that meets the intent of the \nsection in an efficient and convenient manner. I recognize that USDA \nmust develop a system by which to verify the origin of animals for \ncountry-of-origin labeling to be effective. The section provides the \nSecretary with the authority to require a verifiable record keeping \naudit trail to help verify origin, as well as a requirement that anyone \nengaged in supplying a covered commodity to a retailer must provide \ninformation indicating the origin of the covered commodity. For the \nretailer to know the country-of-origin of a covered commodity, and for \nthe Secretary to enforce this section, all participants and businesses \naffected by this Section should cooperate to develop this verifiable \nrecord-keeping audit trail.\n  However, especially concerning meat labeling, it is not necessary to \nimpose a mandatory animal identification program in order to implement \ncountry-of-origin labeling because proven models already exist within \nUSDA to verify the country-of-origin or birth of animals for various \npurposes. One such model is the quality grade certification system that \nsignifies the quality grade of certain meat cuts, such as USDA \n``choice,'' ``prime,'' or ``select''. The USDA stated in a report ``The \nBenefits/Cost Analysis of Mandatory Country of Origin Labeling'' \nreleased in 2000 that the Agricultural Marketing Service, AMS, and \nindustry could model this certification program to implement country-\nof-origin meat labeling. Additional models that can be applied include \nthe existing voluntary country-of-origin labeling program for beef, \nwhich uses an affidavit to verify origin, ``Certified Angus Beef'' and \nsimilar programs that USDA implements to aid industry in promoting \ncertain meat cuts for breed, the National School Lunch Program, and the \nMarket Access Program, MAP. USDA has effectively administered these \nexisting programs. Therefore, I intend for the Secretary to capitalize \nupon these existing programs rather than creating a new mandatory \nanimal identification system in order to verify origin. The programs \nused by USDA were listed in the section to serve as models for the \ndepartment, producers, packers, retailers, and others to ensure the \nproper implementation of mandatory country-of-origin labeling.\n  Moreover, USDA Health Certificates issued by the Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service, APHIS, ensures the tracking of all imported \nanimals for slaughter without the need for a mandatory, animal \nidentification system. By law, no animal may be imported into the \nUnited States without being accompanied by a USDA-APHIS health \ncertificate. The application form for this certificate requires \ndocumentation as to the origin of the animal(s) being imported into the \nUnited States. The record keeping system applied for tracking imports \nmay be helpful to the Secretary in carrying out this section.\n  It is also my understanding that many livestock auction markets and \nsale barns in the United States have requested individuals selling \ncattle or other ruminant animals to sign affidavits verifying that the \ncattle were not fed mammalian parts, so as to ensure cattle buyers and \ncustomers that those cattle will not contract Bovine Spongiform \nEncephalopathy, BSE or mad cow disease. The Secretary is encouraged to \ndetermine if this system of tracking animals for prevention of the \nspread of BSE may work similarly for keeping records for country-of-\norigin.\n  I intend that the enforcement of this section be implemented in a \nmost reasonable fashion, so as to accommodate unintentional violations \nwith the program. As such, the section provides the Secretary with the \nauthority to first issue a warning to a retailer violating the section, \nrather than a fine. For example, on the first occasion a retailer is \nfound out of compliance with the labeling requirement, the Secretary \nmay notify or warn the retailer in writing, and provide the retailer 30 \ndays in which to take steps to comply with the labeling requirement. If \nsubsequent to the 30 day period the Secretary determines that the \nretailer has willfully continued to violate the section, the Secretary \nmust provide notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect to the \nviolation before any further enforcement action can be taken. Finally, \nafter such steps are taken, and a retailer remains in violation of the \nlabeling requirement, the Secretary may fine the retailer in an amount \ndetermined by the Secretary.\n  In the case of enforcement, I intend that the Secretary take into \naccount the special circumstances of small businesses affected by this \nsection. I recognize that this new program and its requirements may \nrequire some time and complexity to comply with, especially for small \nbusinesses, therefore, the Secretary is encouraged to cooperate with \nany small business affected by this section so that the requirements \nare understandable, reasonable, and simple. Small businesses may need \nadditional assistance to comply with this section, therefore, I \nencourage the Secretary to take into consideration these and other \nspecial circumstances which may make it difficult for small businesses \nto meet the requirements. Furthermore, to the maximum extent \npracticable, the Secretary shall enter into partnerships with States to \nenforce this section.\n  Finally, I intend for the Secretary to promulgate such regulations \nthat are necessary to implement the labeling requirements under this \nsection as soon as possible. The Secretary may be under pressure from \nopponents to country-of-origin labeling to delay the implementation of \nthis section. Those of us who wrote this legislation and worked hard to \nenact it will make sure that this section is implemented in an \nexpeditious fashion, without unnecessary delay.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President I am a strong supporter of the American \nfarmer. I represent the largest farm State in this Nation and I believe \nin protecting the family farmer and helping to provide for rural \nAmerica.\n  California's farm economy produces approximately $30 billion annually \nand I take pride in the great number and vast diversity of crops the \nState produces.\n  From the vegetables in the Imperial Valley to the dairy farms in the \nCentral Valley and the wineries of Napa Valley, the State of California \nproduces more of what goes on America's dinner table than anywhere \nelse.\n  In March, I visited the great Central Valley of California to hear \nwhat my constituents had to say about the agricultural policy we craft \nhere in Washington, DC.\n  I heard how much farmers depend on the programs in the farm bill and \nI am pleased that the Senate will be voting on the farm bill conference \nreport today. Even though I have some concerns about what is in the \nconference report and this is by no means a perfect bill, I will vote \nto send this legislation to the President's desk because virtually \nevery California farm and nutrition group has lined up to support it.\n  However, I want to highlight my serious concern over an egregious \nethanol program in this farm bill that was included at the last minute \nin conference.\n  Mr. President, only 2 weeks ago the Senate passed a terrible energy \nbill that mandates three times the amount of ethanol we produce in our \nfuel supply. Now after mandating a market for ethanol in the energy \nbill we are providing billions of dollars in subsidies to corn farmers \nin this farm bill.\n  On top of the subsidies to the corn growers in the Midwest, and the \nmandated market for ethanol, and high trade barriers that protect the \ndomestic ethanol industry, now, in a provision in this farm bill, we \nwill be subsidizing the expansion of ethanol production through the \n``Bioenergy Program.''\n  Many may wonder what the Bioenergy Program is. The Bioenergy Program, \ncreated in 2000 by the Department of Agriculture, provides cash \npayments to promote additional production of ethanol and biodiesel. \nBioenergy includes: Ethanol, made mostly from corn; and biodiesel, made \nmostly from soybeans.\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\n  Congress has never authorized this program until now. The farm bill \nauthorizes spending $150 million annually over the next 4 years for a \ntotal authorization of $600 million. The Congressional Budget Office \nanticipates that the program will not be fully subscribed and therefore \nscores the program lower at $204 million.\n  Essentially, the Bioenergy Program pays subsidies to firms when they \npurchase additional corn to make more ethanol or soybeans to make more \nbiodiesel. For example, if a company increases its ethanol production \nby 1,000 gallons, the government will reimburse the firm $320 for the \nadditional corn it took to make these 1,000 gallons of ethanol.\n  At best, this is an incentive to help small ethanol producers expand \ntheir production of ethanol. At worst, this is another government \npayout to ethanol firms like ADM to subsidize corn they would buy \nanyway to make their product.\n  In 2001, 26 ethanol firms, all based in the Midwest, received \npayments from USDA under the Bioenergy Program. Archers Daniels Midland \nreceived the most, $7.5 million out of $32.7 million in total payments \nor 23 percent of the overall amount. Under the Bioenergy Program \nauthorized in the farm bill, ADM will continue to be eligible to \nreceive $7.5 million each year for the next 4 years, a total of $30 \nmillion by 2006. ADM has sales of over $20 billion annually, yet under \nthis Bioenergy Program, the government is subsidizing its expansion and \ngrowth.\n  Consider the following:\n  No. 1. The Government already subsidizes farmers who grow corn, which \nis used to make ethanol.\n  No. 2. The Government subsidizes producers of ethanol by giving firms \na 5.3 cent ``tax break'' from the 18.4 cent per gallon tax on gasoline.\n  No. 3. In the recent energy bill, the Senate mandated a market for \nethanol that will force three times the amount we produce into the fuel \nsupply by 2012.\n  No. 4. Domestic ethanol producers are protected from foreign \ncompetition by a high 54-cent per gallon trade barrier.\n  No. 5. On top of all this, why is Congress subsidizing ethanol \nproducers to expand?\n  There is new information on the environmental and health impact of \nethanol.\n  During the debate on the energy bill, I mentioned that I have grave \nconcerns about the long-term effects of nearly tripling the amount of \nethanol in our gasoline supply because the impact on the environment \nand public health is largely unknown.\n  Although the scientific opinion is not unanimous, existing evidence \nsuggests that: one, reformulated gasoline with ethanol produces more \nsmog pollution than reformulated gas without it; and two, ethanol \nenables the toxic chemicals in gasoline to seep further into \ngroundwater and even faster than conventional gasoline.\n  And this week new evidence from the Environmental Protection Agency \ncasts an even darker shadow on ethanol's environmental record. A letter \nwas made public this week disclosing that toxic emissions from ethanol \nplants appear more dangerous than previously thought.\n  I wish we had known about EPA's recent testing of ethanol plant \nemissions while the Senate was debating the ethanol mandate in the \nSenate Energy Bill.\n  I would like to insert this letter for the Record and read from it.\n  The letter is to Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels \nAssociation, the ethanol lobby. It is from Stephen Rothblatt, the head \nof EPA's air and radiation division in Region 5. Region 5 covers part \nof the Midwest.\n  The letter begins:\n\n       Recent testing performed at several ethanol production \n     facilities indicates emissions of volatile organic compounds \n     and carbon monoxide many times greater than that stated by \n     the companies in the permitting process.\n\n  This finding by EPA raises new questions about the harm ethanol can \ncause the environment. Previously, emissions from ethanol plants were \nthought to be relatively benign. Under current law, ethanol plants are \nnot considered ``major sources'' of volatile organic compound, VOC, \nemissions and they face a less stringent permitting process.\n  However, the recent findings alluded to by EPA in this letter \nindicate that ethanol plants may now be major sources of VOC emissions \nand therefore subject to a more stringent permitting process. VOC \nemissions are of great concern because they contribute to the formation \nof ozone, the main component of smog.\n  And these new findings are not confined to one or two plants. The \nletter indicates that emissions of carbon monoxide, methanol, \nformaldehyde, acetic acid, and other carcinogens at levels many times \ngreater than the plant permits allow ``are not unique to the tested \nfacilities, but rather common to most, if not all, ethanol \nfacilities.''\n  In response to this letter from EPA, I wrote Administrator Whitman \nand I would like to include the two letters I sent yesterday in the \nRecord.\n  I have asked the Administrator why the agency's findings did not \nsurface until this week, and I asked EPA to report on the increase in \nemissions we can expect from ethanol plants if we triple the amount of \nethanol that needs to be produced, as the Senate Energy Bill would \nrequire.\n  I am also particularly concerned about a part in the letter that \nmentions EPA's desire to ``quickly address both State and Federal \nconcerns and resolve them on terms most favorable to the industry.'' \nWhy would EPA want to resolve this on terms most favorable to the \nindustry when it is children, the elderly, and people with respiratory \nproblems who will suffer most from these harmful emissions?\n  It appears EPA is attempting to placate the ethanol industry because \ninstead of enforcing the Clean Air Act by citing the ethanol plants for \nviolations, EPA is trying to meet with ethanol industry representatives \nto resolve the matter quietly.\n  I am concerned that the EPA will not crackdown on ethanol plants \nforcefully because, according to this letter, the agency's primary goal \nis to satisfy the industry and not the public interest.\n  I hope the EPA will be able to complete a full scientific and health \nstudy on the impact of these ethanol plant emissions on the air we \nbreathe. And I hope the agency will be forthcoming with the scientific \nresults that led to this April 24th letter.\n  I believe the testing conducted by the Region 5 office raises \nimportant questions on the health and environmental consequences of \nmore ethanol production and use.\n  It is clear to me that there is a lot about ethanol we do not know \nyet. I am very concerned about the mandate we passed in the energy \nbill.\n  I am also concerned about this egregious provision in the farm bill \nthat pays ethanol producers like ADM to buy more corn. This provision \nis unacceptable and I would hope that in the future when we authorize \nnew ethanol programs, they are the subject of extensive hearings and \ndebate, not just slipped into the conference report without notice.\n  Having said all this, I would just like to take a few moments to \nhighlight the provisions in the farm bill that will benefit California \nand explain why I support this legislation.\n  First, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee who have spend a tremendous amount of time on \nthis bill. And I want to thank all the members of the Conference \nCommittee who spent the last three months hashing out the differences \nbetween the House and Senate bill.\n  Mr. President, this farm bill will help provide economic stability \nfor producers, make farmers and ranchers more competitive in world \nmarkets, and give needed assistance to rural areas.\n  For California commodity crops like rice, cotton, and wheat, the farm \nbill provides loan rates and fixed direct payments to provide an \neffective safety net for our producers. Growers, lenders, and rural \nareas of California have anxiously been waiting for the farm bill to be \nsigned into law. This bill will alleviate a great deal of uncertainty \nfor commodity producers.\n  I am also pleased that this farm bill will increase conservation \nfunding by $17.1 billion over the next decade. California will make \ngreat use of the programs authorized in this farm bill to enhance wild \nhabitat, create new wetlands, clean up farm runoff, and curb suburban \nsprawl.\n\n[[Page S4027]]\n\n  For growers of California's fruits, vegetables, and nuts there are \nfunding increases for the purchase of speciality crops, including $94 \nmillion for apples, and more funding for the Market Access Program.\n  MAP funds are sought by many California growers to develop markets \nfor their products overseas.\n  I am happy to report that funding for the Market Access Program, MAP, \nwill be authorized well above the current level of $90 million \nannually. MAP funding will be ramped up to $200 million by 2006. Dollar \nfor dollar MAP funding is one of the best uses of money in this farm \nbill.\n  For California dairy farmers, the bill extends the milk price support \nprogram through 2006 at $9.90 per hundredweight.\n  One of the most controversial parts of the farm bill throughout this \ndebate has been the dairy section. The original Senate bill agreed to \nin the Agriculture Committee was drafted to benefit Northeastern dairy \nfarmers at the expense of California and other States. This so-called \n``national pooling'' proposal would have cost California dairy farmers \n$1.5 billion over 9 years and driven up prices for consumers by $1.5 \nbillion over 9 years.\n  After a great deal of negotiation in the Senate and again in \nconference, I believe we have achieved something California dairy \nfarmers can live with. We could not get everything we wanted, but dairy \ngroups in California are supportive of the provisions in the bill.\n  For example, Michael Marsh, CEO of Western United Dairymen writes, \n``This bill has received more than a year of debate. The conferees \nworked hard to balance the needs of diverse agricultural interests and \nproduce a consensus bill. We believe the bill is equitable and \nbalanced.''\n  The farm bill funds research at $1.3 billion over the next 10 years \nto combat pest and disease threats and to stimulate scientific advances \nin agriculture. California is at the forefront of advances in \nagricultural research and the State will benefit greatly from the \nresearch funding in this bill.\n  For example, the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems \nprogram is authorized at an average of $200 million annually.\n  This program awards research grants to California universities such \nas UC Davis on a competitive basis and usually a large percentage of \nthe funding goes to California research labs and projects.\n  The farm bill provides $6.4 billion for nutrition. For California, \nnutrition groups estimate this legislation will deliver more than $1.7 \nbillion to food stamp recipients in the State.\n  The farm bill also simplifies the food stamp program and restores \nbenefits to legal immigrants. By making all legal immigrant children \neligible for food stamps and making adult legal immigrants eligible for \nfood stamps after they have resided in the United States for 5 years, \nCalifornia will be relieved of some of the costs shifted to the State \nafter the 1996 welfare reform bill.\n  The following groups are among those who have written to me to ask \nthat I support this farm bill: the California Farm Bureau; National \nConference of State Legislatures; California Citrus Mutual; Western \nUnited Dairymen; the Alliance of Western Milk Producers; California \nFood Policy Advocates; the California Grape & Tree Fruit League; United \nFresh Fruit and Vegetable Association; the California Strawberry \nCommission; Calcot--the major cooperative representing California and \nArizona cotton growers; the California Rice Commission; the Sacramento \nCentral Labor Council AFL-CIO; the Milk Producers Council; the Nature \nConservancy; National Farmers Union; the Children's Defense Fund; and \nmany of the major food banks in California.\n  I believe this broad support demonstrates that the farm bill \nconferees were able to reach adequate compromises on most issues.\n  I would also like to highlight a few special provisions for \nCalifornia that the conferees agreed to:\n  No. 1. The farm bill includes provision to strengthen produce \nsmuggling penalties.\n  The conference report included language from a bill I introduced last \nyear to strengthen penalties for criminal violations of plant smuggling \nlaws. This provision in the farm bill conference report will protect \nagriculture from the invasion of foreign species by strengthening \ncriminal penalties for organized smuggling of fruits, plants, and \nvegetables into the United States. Under current law, violators are \ncharged low fines for violating plant smuggling laws--simply a minor \ncost of doing business, not an effective deterrent.\n  No. 2. The farm bill includes provision to give the Secretary of \nAgriculture the authority to reallocate sugar export quota shortfalls.\n  The conference report includes a compromise worked out with Senator \nHarkin, Senator Lugar, and Senator Breaux that would give the Secretary \nof Agriculture the option to reallocate any shortfall in exported sugar \nfrom supplying countries to other nations that would export more sugar \ncane to the United States.\n  This may help C Sugar, a struggling refinery in Crockett, CA, \nobtain more sugar cane from abroad to refine. In the past, C has had \nto temporarily shutdown and lay off some of its workers because they do \nnot have enough sugar cane to refine. This is a small step, but it may \nhelp some.\n  No. 3. The farm bill includes provision extending a crop insurance \npilot program to California.\n  The farm bill conference report includes a provision to allow \nCalifornia growers to qualify for Adjusted Gross Revenue Crop \nInsurance--a unique risk management tool provided by USDA to give \nproducers a ``self-help'' option of insuring a potion of their farm \nincome. Adjusted Gross Revenue Crop Insurance provides protection \nagainst low revenue due to unavoidable catastrophes.\n  The program was first made available on a pilot basis in 1999. This \nyear is the fourth year the program has been available and now \nCalifornia will join 17 other States where the program is currently \noffered. This program will benefit California specialty crop producers.\n  No. 4. The farm bill includes provision to allow California to grow, \nrefine, and market sugar cane.\n  The conference report includes a provision that will allow California \nto join Hawaii, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida as a State with a \nsugarcane allocation. Growers in the Imperial Valley in California have \nbeen growing sugar cane for about 4 years now with the hopes they would \nbe able to revive the area's stagnant industry. California farmers will \nnow be able to grow, refine, and market sugarcane--adding to the \nState's great and diverse agricultural production.\n  Although this farm bill is far from a perfect bill, I am supporting \nit because I believe sending it back to conference would be \ncounterproductive. Our farmers need a farm bill now and I believe this \nlegislation will be well received in agricultural areas across this \nnation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Christine Todd Whitman,\n     Administrator, United States Environmental Protection Agency, \n         1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Whitman: I was surprised to read that \n     the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) called for a \n     meeting this week with ethanol industry officials to discuss \n     findings by the agency that factories that convert corn into \n     the ethanol are releasing carbon monoxide, methanol, \n     formaldehyde, acetic acid, and carcinogens at levels many \n     times greater than previously thought.\n       It is interesting to me that EPA's study into these harmful \n     ethanol emissions was disclosed in an April 24 letter to the \n     industry's trade group, yet the correspondence was not made \n     public until this week. Why the delay? I am also concerned \n     that the EPA might use the unusual forum of an industry \n     meeting to cut a special deal for the ethanol industry \n     outside the regular EPA process of plant investigations for \n     emissions violations.\n       I believe that the science is pretty clear that the \n     environmental record on ethanol is mixed and smog increases \n     as a product of more ethanol use.\n       Therefore, based on the new information from EPA that \n     ``most, if not all, ethanol facilities'' and releasing carbon \n     monoxide, methanol, formaldehyde, acetic acid, and \n     carcinogens, I would like to ask how much these toxins will \n     be increased across the United States if we triple the amount \n     of ethanol currently produced--the scenario mandated by \n     recent passage of the Senate Energy Bill. Since this energy \n     legislation is\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\n     now being considered in a conference committee, I am asking \n     for an expedited response from your agency.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Christine Todd Whitman,\n     Administrator, United States Environmental Protection Agency, \n         1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Whitman: To follow up on my earlier \n     letter today, I am writing to request that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) provide my office with the scientific \n     data from the recent tests performed on several ethanol \n     facilities by your Region 5 office.\n       I would like to know more specifically what EPA has \n     discovered about carbon monoxide, methanol, formaldehyde, \n     acetic acid, and other carcinogenic emissions from ethanol \n     plants.\n       I am also particularly concerned that your agency has \n     chosen to remedy these harmful ethanol emissions by meeting \n     only with industry representatives. The April 24th letter \n     from EPA to the Renewable Fuels Association invites ethanol \n     industry representatives to meet and says, ``this approach \n     can give certainty to the industry by quickly addressing both \n     state and federal concerns and resolving them on terms most \n     favorable to the industry.'' Why would EPA want to address \n     this on terms most favorable to the industry when it is \n     children, the elderly, and people with respiratory problems \n     who will suffer most from these harmful emissions?\n       Please send me the ``stack tests'' that led to the April \n     24th letter as soon as possible. Thank you for your immediate \n     attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     U.S. Environmental Protection\n\n\n                                             Agency, Region 5,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, April 24, 2002.\n     Bob Dinneen,\n     President, Renewable Fuels Association, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Dinneen: Recent testing performed at several \n     ethanol production facilities indicates emissions of volatile \n     organic compounds and carbon monoxide many times greater than \n     that stated by the companies in the permitting process. As a \n     result, we believe that these facilities were not properly \n     permitted and controlled with respect to a number of \n     pollutants as they were initially constructed or modified. We \n     expect that this circumstance is not unique to the tested \n     facilities, but rather is common to most, if not all, ethanol \n     facilities.\n       Normally, U.S. EPA would remedy the violations at each of \n     these facilities, individually, through a lengthy period of \n     information-gathering followed by the traditional enforcement \n     process. By this letter, we would like to invite \n     representatives of the Renewable Fuels Association and Region \n     5 ethanol production facilities to attend a brief meeting on \n     May 6, 2002 from 1:00-3:00 pm at our Chicago office on the \n     3rd floor in Room 328 for the purpose of gauging your \n     interest in exploring an expedited resolution to these \n     issues. We feel that this approach can give certainty to the \n     industry by quickly addressing both state and federal \n     concerns and resolving them on terms most favorable to the \n     industry.\n       We expect that this initial meeting will last no more than \n     two (2) hours and will consist of a presentation, by the \n     regulatory agencies, which describes the issues and our \n     proposed path toward resolution. If you have any questions, \n     Ms. Cynthia King, of our Office of Regional Counsel, can be \n     reached at (312) 886-6831.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n                                                Stephen Rothblatt.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2646, the \nFarm Security Act of 2002.\n  This is the first time in my congressional career that I have been \nunable to support a farm bill. I voted for the Freedom to Farm Act in \n1996. And I supported the farm bill before that--the Food, Agriculture, \nConservation, and Trade Act of 1990. Many of my good friends support \nthis bill, people I admire and trust. This is not an easy decision for \nme, but I sincerely believe it is the right decision.\n  There are a number of problems with this conference report. First, it \nreflects a fundamental shift in federal agriculture policy, such a \ndramatic shift that I believe will only confuse our farmers and \neventually lead to more problems for rural America.\n  For years, federal agriculture policy has called for farmers to look \nmore to the free market and away from government dependence. Going back \nto the Freedom to Farm Act, we have attempted to direct agriculture \ntoward a market-oriented footing by reducing subsidies, cutting \nregulations and giving farmers more incentives and flexibility to plant \ncrops that would allow them to make a decent living.\n  I'll be honest in admitting that the Federal Government has not done \nenough to keep up its end of the bargain--so far. We haven't cut the \nregulatory burden quickly enough, and we need to do better when it \ncomes to passing improvements to the trade laws that open new foreign \nmarkets to our farmers. But that is no reason now to begin moving \nbackwards, to turn the tractor 180 degrees in the opposite direction. \nWe are on the verge of passing fast track legislation in Congress, and \nthe new administration is clearly more disposed toward easing the \nregulatory burden our farmers bear. Things are now moving in the right \ndirection.\n  However, the conference report before us completely undermines \ncurrent agriculture policy by drastically increasing subsidies and \nturning back the clock toward the days when farmers were more dependent \non the federal government than their own ingenuity.\n  I believe this will prove to be confusing to our farmers, and the \nlack of coherent federal farm policy will in the long run only lead to \nmore uncertainty and problems for our agricultural communities. Because \nwe know that American farmers produce the best crops in the world, we \nhave for years preached the need to move away from subsidies and \nregulations and toward the hope and opportunity of the free market. If \nwe pass this conference report today, the signal we send to rural \nAmerica will be mixed and counterproductive, and only lead it to wonder \nwhat sort of helter-skelter policy flip-flops Congress will make next.\n  In hard times, farmers need help. We all know that. But instead of \nsimply getting out the Federal Government's checkbook, the better \nsolution is to empower farmers and rural communities, not to encourage \nthem to become more dependent on a Federal Government that can't seem \nto decide from one day to the next what it's agriculture policy is \ngoing to be.\n  I also worry that this bill will contribute to the decline of the \nfamily farm. Instead of focusing on the small farmer who needs our help \nthe most, this legislation contains too many favors for the big \nproducers at the expense of the little guys. For instance, when the \nSenate passed its initial version of this legislation, it capped at \n$275,000 the amount of government support that any producer could \nreceive. Now the conference report not only increases that amount to \n$360,000, it contains so many loopholes that the actual ceiling is \ncloser to $2.5 million.\n  That's outrageous. By one estimate I have seen, 10 percent of the \ngrowers will be eligible to receive over \\2/3\\ of the support generated \nby this legislation. Considering that in Kentucky the average size of \nour farm is 150 acres and most produce less than $10,000 in income, \nthis bill does not do my State that much good. The big guys and the \ncorporate farms don't need our help; they're doing just fine. Now when \nwe have the opportunity to help our family farms, this bill falls \nshort.\n  I am also very concerned about the spiraling costs of this bill. \nPlain and simple, it's a budget-buster. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, this bill represents a 70 percent increase over current \nprojections for agriculture spending over the next ten years--74 \nbillion in all. Many of the subsidy rates in the bill are pegged at 10 \npercent annual increases. These price hikes are simply not sustainable \nor wise at a time when we are unfortunately facing in the 2002 fiscal \nyear a budget deficit of $100 billion.\n  If we are going to balance the budget and restore fiscal discipline \nto the federal budget, all of us have to bear part of the load. \nObviously, we cannot make up the entire budget deficit on the backs of \nfarmers and our rural communities. But at the same time it would be \nunfair not to ask for at least a modicum of fiscal responsibility in \nthis bill.\n  Additionally, there are problems with the fantastic complexity in \nthis bill. As my colleague, Senator Lugar, pointed out yesterday, the \nloan and payment formulae in this legislation are mind-numbingly \ncomplex, so complicated that the legislators who wrote the final \nversion of the bill often cannot agree on exactly how they work. If the \nbean counters in Washington are having a hard time figuring them out, I \nknow there are going to be serious problems when we try to implement \nthis legislation in the real world.\n  I know that the Farm Service Agencies in Kentucky and throughout the\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\nland are filled with fine folks who do a good job. But the payment \nschemes in this farm bill are so intricate that I am not sure anyone \nwill be able to make them work, let alone the staff at the FSA who are \nalready overworked and understaffed. In recent years, we have seen the \nclosing of many FSA offices around the country, especially in Kentucky. \nAnd we know that the USDA is looking to close more. To now turn around \nand ask these officials to do even more with less is unfair to them, \nunfair to our farmers and likely to lead to more consternation and \nworse farm policy. If our farmers do not already have agribusiness \nadvisors, they are going to hire them just to sort through what \npayments they are and are not eligible to receive under this \nlegislation.\n\n  On a personal note, I am also bitterly disappointed that this \nlegislation does not include specific help for the Kentucky \nthoroughbred industry. Over the past several years, our breeders have \ngrappled with devastation caused by Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome \n(MRLS). In Kentucky, we have many, many small thoroughbred operations, \nwho are all hoping to catch lightning in a bottle and to win the Derby. \nBut, sadly, many of these farms have suffered severe setbacks because \nof MRLS. The House proposal provided loans for small producers affected \nby MRLS. The final bill does not. That is a bitter pill that I cannot \nswallow.\n  I am afraid that this bill plays a cruel joke on our farmers. On the \none hand, it raises price supports quickly and holds out the \npossibility of putting a few more dollars in their pocket in short run. \nBut, on the other hand, I believe all of these extra production \nincentives will lead to so much overproduction of crops that it will \neventually drive commodity prices through the floor and cause an income \ndisaster in the long run. The legislation tells our farmers that they \ncan have their cake and eat it too, and I just can't in my heart go \nalong with this deception.\n  I do not cast this vote enthusiastically. I want a farm bill I can \nsupport. I want to agree with many of my friends in the agriculture \ncommunity who support this conference report. But I cannot, in good \nconscience, support a bill that helps corporate farms at the expense of \nfamily farms. I am also very much afraid that this bill will turn out \nto be a nightmare for farmers. I hope I am wrong; I certainly do not \nwish any more trouble for my farmers in Kentucky. I am just afraid that \nthis bill makes too many false promises that it cannot keep, and I \ncannot support legislation that I believe misleads Kentucky farmers.\n  Over time, I think my friends in agriculture will realize this bill \nis a mistake and that they have been sold a bill of goods.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have been privileged over the past 18 \nyears to serve what I believe to be the greatest men and women on the \nface of the earth, that is the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nServing the people of Kentucky means, among other things, looking out \nfor the best interests of farm families and farming communities.\n  When I came to Washington, my first priority was to become a member \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee. A few years later, I was able to \nsecure a spot on the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. Over \nthese past two decades, I have had the good fortune to develop strong \nand close relationships with the men and women in Kentucky who work the \nland and who put food on our tables. We have worked together through \ngood times and through lean times. Let me say that we have had some \nmemorable moments and historic victories. In fact, some of those \nvictories have been called ``miracles'' by the farmers I proudly serve.\n  We will have more victories in the future, but this year's farm bill \nis not one of them.\n  Every farm bill, because of the nature of regional interests and \npolitical compromise, has winners and losers. However, I am \nparticularly struck by the amount of money and the way it will be spent \nin this farm bill. Not because I do not believe the Federal Government \nhas a financial role in assisting our farmers and rural communities, I \ndo. But because I believe the Government's financial role should be \nfair and equitable and based on good farm policy. Far, far too many of \nthe Federal tax dollars spent in this bill, will go to far, far too few \nfarmers. I don't believe that is good for agriculture and I don't \nbelieve it is fair for Kentucky. Here's the central weakness of this \nbill, big farm operators will be made stronger and the small family \nfarmer will be made weaker. For this reason, I cannot vote ``yea.''\n  The winners in this farm bill include: Large farm conglomerates who, \nbecause of the three entity rule and commodity certificates, will be \nable to receive almost unlimited Federal payments. Big landlords are \nalmost certain to receive far higher cash rents for their land. State \nand local governments will recoup higher property taxes as a result of \nescalating farmland prices. Argentina and Brazil will be winners \nbecause they are likely to face less competition from the United States \nin soybeans. Trade lawyers will be retained to defend the United States \nfrom numerous complaints in the WTO. And, tax specialists will be hired \nto help millionaires defer or shelter incomes so as to keep their \nadjusted gross income below $2.5 million per year so they can continue \nto receive farm subsidies.\n  It is a fact that in the United States only 40 percent of farmers \nreceive Federal payments under the farm bill. And from 1996 to 2001, \nthe top 10 percent of that 40 percent received 69 percent of all USDA \npayments and the top 20 percent of recipients received 85 percent of \nall payments. The remaining 80 percent of recipients received only 15 \npercent of all payments.\n  In Kentucky, only 25 percent of our 90,000 farms receive Federal \npayments under the farm bill. From 1996 to 2001, the top 10 percent of \nthat 25 percent received 78 percent of all payments. This left 90 \npercent of Kentucky's farmers who are recipients receiving only 22 \npercent of the payments. In short, 3 out of 4 Kentucky farms will \nreceive almost no direct Federal benefit from this bill.\n  Surprisingly this is all in a bill written by proponents proclaiming \nthat their goal in writing it was to provide a safety net for the small \nfamily farm. Yet in this farm bill, Federal subsidies to the largest \nand richest farmers are the hallmark of their work. These same \nproponents, who oppose ending the death tax, which would do more for \nthe family farm than any amount of subsidies, write a bill that \nconcentrates federal farm subsidy payments even more in the hands of \nvery few large crop farmers.\n  In fact, the commodity title essentially tells the farmer that the \nmarket doesn't matter anymore. The target prices now become the \nproducer's price guarantee. This policy will encourage over-production \nwhich, in turn, will lead to lower prices. This, of course, favors \nlarger farms, because the more you produce the more Federal payments \nyou receive. The more money you have will also enable you to purchase \nmore land to produce even more. This will put pressure on the smaller \nfamily farms to keep up. That will be difficult and I fear more and \nmore family farms in Kentucky and across America will eventually \ndisappear.\n  Now let us look at some of the losers. The U.S. taxpayer will be \npaying a lot more and receiving very little in return. American \nfamilies ultimately will have to pay more for produce, peanuts, fish \nand meat. Market-driven farm policy is taking a step backwards. Young \nand aspiring farmers will find it even harder to buy farmland. Cash \nrenters of farmland will be faced with higher cash rents.\n  I do commend a number of the bill's provisions such as the \nconservation and rural development programs. The cattlemen in Kentucky \nwill be able to apply for EQIP funds to make environmental improvements \non their ranches. Dairy farmers, particularly those in Kentucky, will \nbenefit under a new national program. The hardwood tree farmers in my \nState also gain under the Conservation Reserve Program, but some of the \nmost important provisions regarding hardwoods were deleted from the \nconference report at the last minute, which disappoints me. And the \nNutrition Title makes improvements in our food assistance programs that \nhelp the neediest of our citizens. But these bright spots are not \nenough for me to vote for an agriculture commodity policy that \noverwhelmingly benefits the larger farm operators at the expense of the \nsmall family farm.\n\n  I find myself in agreement with some of my colleagues on the House \nside.\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\nCongressmen John Boehner (R-OH) and Cal Dooley (D-CA), both members of \nthe Agriculture Committee and the Farm Bill Conference who voted \nagainst the conference report, stated that ``On the whole, this bill \nignores the lessons of the past and the truth of the free market. It \nrepresents the most sweeping non-military expansion of the Federal \nGovernment since the Great Society and will create more problems than \nit will solve.''\n  I also agree with editorials in some of the newspapers across the \ncountry and in my State which have roundly criticized this farm bill. \nThe Bowling Green Daily News editorial had this headline: ``It's Good \nOle Politics Down On The Farm,'' observing it's just election year \npolitics deciding how our tax dollars are being spent. And the Kentucky \nPost/Cincinnati Post called the bill ``Congressional Hogwash.'' The New \nYork Times, with whom I don't usually agree, stated that ``The farm \nbill agreed to by a House-Senate Conference Committee last week is a \nregrettable reversion to some of the worst policies of the past.'' Even \nthe Wall Street Journal called it ``one of the porkiest farm bills in \nhistory . . .''.\n  Other opponents of this bill include: Senators Pat Roberts, Richard \nLugar, Charles Grassley, and Chuck Hagel, all strong supporters of \nAmerican agriculture; the Center for Rural Affairs; the Organization \nfor a Competitive Marketplace; the Sierra Club; the Environmental \nWorking Group; Environmental Defense; the Humane Society; and the \neditorial board of the Washington Post.\n  During an election year it's not uncommon for politicians to hold \ntheir noses and vote for expediency. I could just vote yes and try not \nto upset anyone, because there will be many in Kentucky who will \ndisagree with my vote. I cannot in good conscience say to my farmers, \nthe overwhelming number of whom operate small family farms, that I \nbelieve this farm bill would be good for them in the long run. I don't.\n  I am therefore going to oppose this farm bill because it spends too \nmuch on too few, sets U.S. agriculture policy back 10 years by taking \nthe forces of the market-place out of agriculture, probably violates \nour trade agreements, and most importantly I believe it hurts the small \nfamily farm, and therefore rural Kentucky.\n  To understand my decision on this farm bill, you have to understand \nthe nature of the Kentucky farmer. We are proud to have more than \n90,000 farms in our State. These farms, however, are not large farms. \nThey are not the large, plantation-style farms managed and controlled \nby corporate boards. The average farm in Kentucky is 151 acres and is \ndwarfed by the size of the average 434 acre farm in the United States. \nThese are the family farmers that I look out for and fight for every \nday.\n  It is these small family farms, that I believe are ultimately \nshortchanged by this bill, a bill that will put the government in \ncharge of America's farms, cost roughly $180 billion over 10 years \nduring a time of war and growing budget deficits, increase subsidies by \n70 percent, including America's first national dairy subsidy, and \nfunnel the bulk of those subsidies to a handful of large corporate \nfarms.\n  This farm bill may be good politics, but it's terrible policy. It \nwill serve some farmers in Kentucky, but not enough. For those reasons, \nI have no choice but to vote no.\n\n\n                           HARDWOOD FORESTRY\n\n  Mr. President, hardwood forests and related industries comprise one \nof the lead agricultural commodities in my State of Kentucky. I was \npleased that versions of the farm bill considered by the Senate \nAgriculture Committee included incentives for expansion of hardwood \nacreage in Kentucky and throughout the United States. Particularly, I \nwas pleased to have helped develop provisions in the Conservation \nReserve Program recognizing hardwood forests for their unparalleled \nconservation value. Hardwood forests are one of our Nation's greatest \nnaturally renewable resources providing a diverse landscape for \nwildlife, soil conservation, and improvements in water and air quality. \nAnd the aesthetic value of trees with seasonal changes in foliage \ncannot be disputed among tourists and our constituents enjoying their \nsurrounding landscapes.\n  Unfortunately, in the final hours of the House-Senate Conference the \nincentives for hardwood forestry were scaled back with no opportunity \nfor re-consideration, and in my opinion, no justification. In reviewing \nthe final conference report, I was particularly concerned to see that \nan uncontentious provision with no financial impact was removed. This \nprovision would have instructed the Secretary of Agriculture to ``take \nsuch steps as may be necessary to ensure that all hardwood sites \nannually enrolled in the conservation reserve program are reforested \nwith hardwood species appropriate for the site being planted, and that \nthe highest possible enrollment priority and conservation value is \nassigned to hardwood sites being offered for planting with hardwood \nspecies''.\n  I state my strong support for this hardwood target within the \nConservation Reserve Program.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as one of seven conferees representing the \nSenate, I rise today to speak in support of the conference report and \nurge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill. This farm bill will \nassist America's family farmers, expand economic opportunity in rural \ncommunities, strengthen programs to protect the environment and improve \nthe nutritional safety net for low-income Americans. But one aspect of \nthis new bill that makes it historic is the fact that, for the first \ntime in a long, long, time, dairy farmers across our nation will have \nan adequate safety net that they can count to provide income support \nshould prices remain low.\n  The national dairy program in this bill represents a carefully \ncrafted compromise between many competing interests. First, it is a \ncompromise among those regions of the country who support dairy \ncompacts and those that don't. It's no secret that I would have \npreferred an extension of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. It \ncost taxpayers nothing. After Members of Congress from other regions \nand the opposition of President Bush and Vice President Cheney blocked \nthese efforts, the Vermont Congressional Delegation--against great \nodds, but joined by allies from across the nation--urged creation of a \nnational dairy program as a compromise. What we came up with is a new \nnational dairy program that will provide cash assistance to dairy \nfarmers comparable to what dairy farmers from Vermont and other New \nEngland States received under the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n  There should be no doubt that what the conferees intended was for \nUSDA to implement this program in a manner as similar to the compact as \npossible. Indeed, the formula for determining the monthly payments is \nnearly identical to the formula used under the Compact--it even is \nbased on the price of Class I fluid milk in Boston.\n  The Statement of Managers summarizes the provision by noting that \n``Under this program, participating dairy producers will receive \nmonthly payments equal to 45 percent of the difference between $16.94 \nand the price per hundredweight of Class I fluid milk in Boston under \nthe applicable federal milk marketing order. No payments will be made \nfor months during which the fluid milk price in Boston is $16.94 or \nhigher.'' Obviously, no negative assistance or negative ``payments'' \ncan be paid to producers because that would not represent assistance or \npayments.\n  It is a very straightforward program. My staff met with several key \nUSDA officials with significant responsibilities regarding the dairy \nprograms, and with Keith Collins the USDA Chief Economist, to ensure \nthat the language and time frames would work. I appreciate that the \nOffice of Congressional Relations, USDA, helped set up that meeting.\n  We also requested more than one analysis from FAPRI showing how this \nnew program would pay out to farmers, and to understand its possible \nimpacts on production of milk by dairy farmers.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked how this formula was developed. \nAfter Congress consented to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact in \n1996, the Northeast Interstate Compact Commission decided to support \nthe price of Class I fluid milk sold into the six New England states \ncovered by the Compact (Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, \nConnecticut, New Hampshire) at a level that at times would be\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\nabove minimum established under the prevailing federal milk marketing \norder in the Northeast.\n  The Compact Commission took testimony and held hearings and decided \nto establish a floor of $16.94 per hundred weight under the Class I \nprice. The floor was based on the price in Boston, so the floor for \nmilk marketed outside of Boston but within the Compact region would \nvary, based on the local differential. The Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact only regulated sales of Class I fluid milk--which represents \nonly about 45 percent of the total milk produced in New England. The \npercentage varies on a monthly basis. The rest of New England's milk is \nused to make other fine dairy products, such as Ben and Jerry's Ice \nCream, or Cabot cheese. In other words, under the Compact, producers \nreceived payments on only about 45 percent of their total milk \nproduction.\n  The conferees tried to emulate this formula as closely as possible, \nwhile making sure it would work on a national basis. Like the compact, \nwhenever the federal minimum price for fluid milk in Boston falls below \n$16.94 per hundred weight, participating dairy farmers will receive a \npayment. Like the Compact, payments will be made on only 45 percent of \nthe milk marketed by a producer--a rough approximation of the Class I \nutilization rate in the Northeast that is fixed, rather than varying on \na monthly basis.\n  The conferees didn't just try to emulate the payment formula \nestablished under the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, they also \nemulated other elements of the Compact. For instance, the conference \nreport requires the Secretary to make payments on a monthly basis not \nlater than 60 days after the end of each month for which a payment is \nmade. Timing of these payments is critical the Conferees wanted these \ncounter-cyclical payments to be made when they're needed the most which \nis when the milk is marketed.\n  Under the time line set forth in the conference report, producers \nshould begin receiving payments under this new national dairy program \nearly this fall. USDA is required to begin signing up farmers to \nparticipate in the program not later than 60 days after the new farm \nbill is signed into law. As under the compact, all producers will \nreceive payments on a monthly basis: USDA is required to pay producers \nnot later than 60 days after the end of each month for which a payment \nis made.\n  In addition to representing a compromise among those supporting dairy \ncompacts and those opposed to compacts, the national dairy program \nrepresents a compromise among those who wanted a counter-cyclical \nincome support program for dairy farmers and those who wanted no such \nprogram. Much to my chagrin, the program is authorized only through \nSeptember 30, 2005, and payments under the program are capped.\n  Now, I know others also lament the fact that there is a cap on \neligible production. While some of us believe the cap is too low, \nothers complain that the cap is too high. But this is a compromise that \nwill ensure that producers across the country benefit. Some of my \ncolleagues have suggested that payments from this program will \nstimulate additional production and drive down prices. I don't believe \nthis will be the case. Here's why:\n\n  First, this program is not permanent, it is temporary--it ends in \n2005. Producers are not likely to make long-term investments to expand \nproduction based on a program that ends before they have had a chance \nto recoup their fixed costs.\n  Second, in the short term, there are practical limits to how quickly \ndairy farmers can expand production. Currently, there is a shortage of \nanimals that would limit any production increases.\n  Third, our experience with the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has \nshown--as the General Accounting Office Reports have documented--that \npayments comparable to these--at least in the Northeast--have not \nstimulated massive expansions. In fact, last year, producers in the \nNortheast expanded at a rate below the national average.\n  But nevertheless, the Conferees agreed to cap the quantity of milk on \nwhich a producer can receive payments each fiscal year. While it is \nclear from the text of the law, and it was clearly the intent of the \ndrafters, I want to point out that any milk production marketed in \nmonths when no payment is made to farmers is not to be counted toward \nthe 2.4 million pound cap.\n  In other words, the cap only applies to the volume of milk produced \nin months which generated payments by USDA under section 1502, not on \nall the milk produced during the year. This is set forth in subsection \n(d) where it states that amounts to be counted toward the 2.4 million \npound limit are counted ``during the months of the applicable fiscal \nyear for which the producers receive payments . . .''\n  Related to this point is another issue concerning the cap. Note that \nif all pounds are counted when a USDA payment is made, larger family \nfarms could hit their cap in the first few months of any year when \npayment rates per hundredweight might be lower. But it would not make \ngood policy sense to see a large family farm get a very small payment, \nfor example, $.10 per cwt. in the fall and then exceed the cap and get \nno payment when payments could reach $1.00 per cwt. in the spring.\n  Since this national program was intended to be counter cyclical, \nfarmers should be allowed to pick which months they want to submit for \npayments, for months when a payment is due.\n  The easiest way to implement this intent, would be that a farmer must \nnot only market the milk but the farmer or agent must also report it to \nUSDA. If a farmer chooses not to report his or her production in a \nmonth, the farmer gets no payment that month but also his or her \nproduction does not count against his or her cap. This maximizes the \nopportunity this program offers for a strong counter cyclical \nprotection.\n  Under this approach, USDA would then keep track of the first \n``countable'' 2.4 million pounds of production each year, and then \nreduce the last check or eliminate checks for the remainder of the \nyear. This would represent a very simple way for USDA to implement this \nprovision and meet the 60-day deadline for ``monthly'' prospective \npayments set forth in subsection (e).\n  This approach will allow a larger farm operation to use the program \nwhen it is most needed. However, keep in mind that regardless which \nmonths are selected for payment, the cap of 2.4 million pounds per \nfiscal year still applies. This is the fairest way to be responsive to \nlarger family farms under a tight cap in a program which was designed \nto be counter cyclical.\n  This would not be unprecedented: Grain and oilseed producers have \nthis sort of flexibility--they are able to lock in loan deficiency \npayments and marketing loan gains at time of their choosing--at any \npoint before they lose beneficial interest in their crops. Some \nproducers even travel to neighboring counties to lock in higher LDPs. \nMost are successful in locking in LDPs during harvest-time lows, even \nthough the season average price at which they market their crop \ngenerally is significantly higher. USDA should provide similar \nflexibility to dairy producers, allowing them to elect when to receive \npayments.\n  I am concerned about language which the other body insisted upon \ntoward then end of the process. I am concerned about larger family \noperations where several family members have joined together for \nefficiency but the farm is still supporting more than one family. USDA \nshould be open to viewing those farms as true multiple operations under \nthis program. For other programs, and in other areas such as the South, \nUSDA permits these multiple operations.\n  USDA should look at the totality of the circumstances in determining \nwhether producers should be treated as having single or multiple \noperations. Farmers should not be penalized for working together to \nenhance efficiency. That was the whole point behind the definition of \nproducer found in 1502(a)(5). That definition would have automatically \nincluded husbands and wives, fathers or mothers and adult children, \nadult siblings, and the like, working on the same farm. In most cases, \neach of the above would have each been entitled to application of a \nseparate 2.4 million pound cap because they would naturally share in \nthe risk of producing milk and would likely make significant \ncontributions to the\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\ndairy farming operation, as required by section 1502(a)(5).\n  For example, for a spouse living on the farm it would be hard to \nimagine a situation where the spouse would not ``share in the risk'' \nsince part of the household income would come from milk sales. Also, in \nmost situations a spouse would be making contributions of labor or \nmanagement or some other valuable contribution. There is nothing in \nUSDA Notice LD-505, dated March 14, 2001, regarding the definition of \ndairy operation which would preclude the family members mentioned above \nfrom being in, or setting up, separate operations. Since the intent of \nsection 1502(a)(5) was to make the farm bill friendly to family \noperations the implementation of the ``diary operation'' definition \nshould not undercut that pro-family approach.\n  On page 4 of that Notice, ``dairy operation'' is defined as ``any \nperson or group of persons who as a single unit produce and market milk \ncommercially produced from cows and whose production and facilities are \nlocated in the United States.'' There is no reason to suspect that USDA \nintended that this should be interpreted as inherently anti-family. \nMany statements about this farm bill talk about its focus on the family \nfarm.\n\n  In this regard, I would encourage the Farm Services Agency, USDA, to \nwork with other USDA agencies and milk handlers and cooperatives to \nlessen the administrative burden on farmers. The intent is to provide a \ncountercyclical safety net when needed most--and USDA should be aware \nof that goal when they are writing regulations to the extent \nregulations are needed.\n  While the text makes this very clear, it should be noted that this \nprogram is not a straight subsidy. It is a targeted safety net program \nto take the bottom out of crushingly low prices for small and medium \nfarms that also provide so many benefits to rural communities and the \nenvironment even beyond the milk they produce.\n  Note that fresh drinking milk (Class I) prices fell $.33 per gallon \nthroughout the Federal Order system--which governs sales of 70 percent \nof all U.S. milk--on December 1, 2001 because of fewer consumers going \nout to eat after September 11, and other factors.\n  Of course, the focus of this national program and the focus of the \nformula which is used to compute the benefits is on ``Class I milk.'' \nPayments are based on $16.94 minus ``the Class I milk price per \nhundredweight in Boston.'' This is based, of course, on the formula \nused in calculating benefits under the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact Commission.\n  A significant feature of the new national dairy program is that it \nwill be retroactive, covering market losses due to low prices since \nDec. 1, 2001. On that date, there was a devastating drop in the price \nfor Class I fluid milk. Producers should receive these retroactive \npayments at the same time they receive their first payments early this \nfall.\n  This ``transition rule'' found in subsection (h), provides that those \npayments are ``[i]n addition to any payment that is otherwise available \nunder this section . . .''\n  As I pointed out more than once during discussions, the goal of this \nsubsection is to address the steep drop in dairy prices to farmers \nstarting in December, 2001. The benefits of the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact ended on October 1, 2001. The adverse impact of that \ntermination started hurting New England farmers during that crash in \nmilk prices in December.\n  The goal of subsection (h) for those farmers was to hold them \nharmless regarding the loss of the Congressional consent to the \nCompact. A second goal, since this now is a national program, is to \ncompensate all dairy farmers for their market losses--not just New \nEngland farmers--since December 1, 2001.\n  Of course, that is a different goal than the prospective ``monthly'' \nprogram which provides monthly payments, for future months when they \nare due, and operates until September 30, 2005. That prospective \nprogram has a 2.4 million pound cap as set forth in (d). Indeed, (d)(2) \n``Limitation,'' states that, ``The payment quantity for all producers \non a single dairy operation during the months of the applicable fiscal \nyear for which the producers receive payments under subsection (b) \nshall not exceed 2,400,000 pounds.''\n  In addition, (d)(2) sets forth a limitation regarding each dairy \noperation and (d)(3) gives the Secretary authority to issue rules to \nensure that producers do not reconstitute dairy operations for the sole \npurpose of receiving additional payments under this section.\n  This ``limitations'' language was inserted out of a concern that an \nuncapped program would lead to significant increases in production of \nmilk. Also, there was a concern that farmers would reorganize in the \nfuture just to get higher payments under the national program.\n  These concerns do not apply to the benefits paid out under subsection \n(h) because farmers would need time machines to go back in the past and \nincrease their production or to change their legal structure \nretrospectively. Indeed, the amount of production covered by (h) is the \namount of ``eligible production'' as defined in section 1502(a)(2).\n  This approach to those dairy market losses in a sense makes up for \nthe fact that programs for others farmers, non-dairy farmers, continued \nto exist after September 30, 2001, and were to be continued until the \n1996 farm bill was to end on September 30, 2002. Thus, non-dairy \nfarmers continued to receive some types of countercyclical, or other \nbenefits, from the existing provisions of the 1996 farm bill. Dairy \nfarmers did not enjoy those protections except for the price support \nprogram scheduled to end soon.\n  Thus, subsection (h) gives dairy farmers some relief from the huge \ndrop in milk prices which they have suffered since December 1, 2001. In \norder to allow these farmers to pay off their debts, pay their bills, \nand keep in the dairy farming business, it is hoped that USDA will \nquickly compute the ``transition'' payment to be made on the ``quantity \nof eligible production of the producer marketed during the period \nbeginning on December 1, 2001, and ending on the last day of the month \npreceding the month the producers on the dairy farm entered into the \ncontract [with USDA].'' These payments should be made with the first \n``monthly'' prospective checks to be issued under subsection (b).\n  Although I am pleased with the dairy provisions, I want to express my \ndisappointment in the outcome of the downed animal provision in this \nbill. The intent of the Senate Agriculture Committee was to end the \nunnecessary suffering of downed livestock, animals that are not even \nhealthy for us to eat, by calling for their humane euthanasia when they \nare brought to intermediate markets. The provision was included in both \nthe House and Senate versions of the bill, but was changed \nsubstantially in conference.\n  I want to make it clear that I am unhappy with the changes made and \nthat I am committed to passing the provision, as it was originally \nwritten, either through this committee or on another vehicle. I \nunderstand that Chairman Harkin is interested in revisiting this issue \nas well and I hope that he will join me in completing the work that \nneeds to be done for downed animals.\n  I request that the Secretary of Agriculture complete the study \nrequired in this bill within 6 months and I ask that she include, \nwithin the conclusions of the study, exactly how she plans to make \nevery step from the farm through the slaughterhouse a humane trip for \nnonambulatory animals. I hope she will find, as 165 of my colleagues in \nthe House and Senate have, that the only humane action to take is \neuthanasia at the intermediate market.\n  I also want to make a few comments about the conservation programs in \nthe new farm bill. Although I am disappointed we were unable to sustain \nthe level of funding for conservation that was included in the Senate-\npassed bill, I am pleased we were able to increase the level of \nconservation funding by roughly 80 percent.\n  The conference report includes a provision to increase funding for \nthe successful Agriculture Management Assistance program created in the \nAgriculture Risk Protection Act of 2001. This program targets 15 states \nthat have been traditionally underserved by crop insurance programs, \nincluding Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine, \nNevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\n  This program was also expanded in the final House-Senate bill to \ninclude aid for all organic agriculture activities and to help \nproducers develop new marketing opportunities, including opportunities \nfor value-added processing. I expect this program to be administered in \na very similar manner to the successful way in which it has been run \nover the past two years, with minor changes to accommodate the \nexpansion of eligible activities. The program has been highly \nsuccessful for the eligible states and I expect that it will continue \nto address the conservation and other critical needs of those states.\n  Also, during debate over the Senate version of the farm bill, Senator \nHarkin included in the bill, at my request, a provision establishing a \n$12 million minimum ``floor'' on conservation payments per State to \naddress concerns I and many of my colleagues raised about previous farm \nbills, which tended to allocate the bulk of their funds to a minority \nof producers in single regions of the country.\n  With this language, I felt the Congress could truly show its concern \nthat all states, in all regions of the country, receive a minimum level \nof much-needed conservation assistance to protect farms, community \nwatersheds, open space, and wildlife habitat. The language was clear in \nits intent to ensure each state received at least $12 million in \nconservation assistance by April 1 of each fiscal year if it had \nqualified applications for that amount of funds. The language also \nensured that funds unused by a state would be returned to USDA and \nreallocated to other States, not the General Treasury.\n  This ``regional equity'' language was altered slightly in the final \nbill to minimize paperwork at USDA and maximize the ability of the \nSecretary of Agriculture while continuing to ensure at least $12 \nmillion be made available to all states with eligible applications. The \nSecretary may do this however it is most effective: for example, with a \nreserve fund set aside to ensure all states receive needed funds.\n  As written in the conference report, the $12 million includes \napplications for all programs under Subtitle D of Title XII of the Food \nSecurity Act of 1985, 16 U.S.C. 3830 et seq., excluding the \nConservation Reserve Program, CRP, Wetlands Reserve Program, WRP, and \nConservation Security Program, CSP. Before April 1 of each fiscal year, \napplications from producers in States that has not yet received at \nleast $12 million in conservation funding would have priority for \nfunding for all conservation programs except CRP, WRP, and CSP. With \nrespect to CRP, WRP, and CSP, producers in these under-served states \nwould compete for funds without specific priority--on an equal footing \nwith all other national applications. Because the Agriculture \nManagement Assistance conservation program is not under Subtitle D, for \neligible states, this program also effectively would not count toward \nthe $12 million total, and would continue to be administered as it has \nbeen, successfully, since its creation in the Agriculture Risk \nProtection Act of 2001.\n  There are a number of other conservation programs that also are very \nimportant to Vermont and other New England States. I especially am \npleased that funding for the farmland protection program--which began \nas a pilot program in Vermont--was increased to nearly $1 billion. \nNever before has FPP received such levels of mandatory funding.\n  In addition, the conference report authorizes a new ``farm \nviability'' program. It was the conferees intent that this program be \nmodeled after the very successful Massachusetts Farm Viability Program \nfor purposes of farmland protection. The farm viability program will \nallow USDA to make grants--through eligible States or private land \ntrust--to producers to help them assess the long-term viability of \ntheir farming operation. Using these funds, producers can hire experts \nto help them develop and implement a plan to improve their long-term \nbusiness prospects. This might entail shifting to a different mix of \ncrops or livestock, engaging in direct marketing through farmers \nmarkets or setting up a road-side stand, or even taking advantage of \nopportunities to profit from agri-tourism.\n  This program will help the limited funding for farmland protection go \nfurther. Many farm families enroll land in the farmland protection \nprogram in order to be able to pass along the family farm to their \nchildren. They want to know, before enrolling in the program, whether \ntheir children will be able to make a living on the farm. The farm \nviability program will help them determine this, and will help others \nwho already have enrolled their land in FPP to continue to use their \nland as working lands.\n  Of course, the farm bill isn't just about farmers. I particularly am \nproud of the nutrition title of this year's farm bill. It will \nsignificantly strengthen nutrition assistance in this country. Food \nstamp benefits have been improved and simplified, funding for emergency \nfood providers has been increased and numerous other advancements--\nnotably funding for seniors' farmer's markets are included in this \ntitle.\n  I am proud that the nutrition title of this farm bill contains so \nmany important simplifications in the program. All of the conferees, \nfrom both sides of the aisle and both chambers, were united in our \ndesire to do what is right for working poor families and others \nthat need help assuring that their families receive a nutritionally \nadequate diet.\n\n  I also am grateful for all of USDA's help and support throughout the \nconference. Time and again, Undersecretary Bost and his staff gave us \ninvaluable perspective. They helped us understand where we needed to \nact and where we could count on them to fix a problem. In this context, \nI would like to highlight a few of the most important of the provisions \nwe adopted.\n  One of the provisions that excited all of us the most was \ntransitional food stamps for families leaving cash assistance. Although \nwe gave states broad discretion in this area, we hope they will apply \nthis option to the maximum number of households.\n  Only those that have been found guilty of wilful misconduct of one \nkind or another are ineligible for transitional food stamps. The many \nhouseholds leaving TANF for procedural reasons, such as failure to keep \nan appointment, would remain eligible. Many families that decide to go \nit alone without further cash assistance simply stop communicating with \nthe welfare office. The family may be unable to get through to an \neligibility worker to inform her or him of its decision to withdraw \nfrom cash assistance or may not see the reason. Some of these families \nmay have low-wage jobs. Others may be hoping to piece together various \nmeans of support to get by until they find work. Either way, these \nfamilies need the help that transitional food stamps can offer. We urge \nstates to provide it.\n  Once a family begins to receive transitional food stamps, we intend \nfor those food stamps to continue for the full five-month transitional \nperiod. Even if the state takes the option to act on changes it learns \nabout through other programs, it should not take any adverse action \nagainst the household's food stamps unless the state has definite \ninformation that the household is ineligible. Requiring households to \ncontact the food stamp office or provide verification during the \ntransitional benefit period would defeat the entire purpose of granting \nhouseholds a period of repose.\n  The other side of this, of course, is that since states would not be \nexpected or allowed to take the usual measures to review the accuracy \nof the household's benefit level during the period, the state would not \nbe held accountable through the quality control system for any errors \nin that household's benefits. As long as the state correctly adjusted \nthe household's benefits from the last month it was receiving cash \nassistance, the state would not be subject to a finding of error during \nany of the months of the transitional benefit period even if the \nbenefit amount in that prior month turned out to be in error. The error \nin the prior month could result in an error only if the household's \ncase was sampled in that prior month.\n  In this connection, a state should be free to designate certain types \nof changes, such as cost of living increases in Social Security \nbenefits or the addition of new members to a household, that it would \nact upon if it received word from another program and other kinds of \nchanges it would disregard. As usual, the QC system\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\nwould only measure how well the state carried out the tasks it had \nelected in its plan to perform. Thus, a state that had elected to act \nonly on new members added to a family might be liable for failing to \nprovide food stamps to a new infant that was being added to the \nfamily's Medicaid coverage but would not be liable for processing \nchanges in wages. In no event, however, should the household be \nrequired to provide information or verification or threatened with \ntermination of its benefits.\n  The simplified definitions of income and resources also should \nsimplify the program in important ways. We repeatedly added items to \nthe list of things that states could not exclude at USDA's suggestion \nso that the Department would not have to add to that list by \nregulation. We were pleased that the final provisions met with the \nDepartment's satisfaction and that states can move forward in reliance \non the list in the statute. Only under extraordinary circumstances do \nwe expect USDA would need to add to either list.\n  Although cash in bank accounts that was readily accessible to the \nhousehold would still count as a resource, a state could exclude the \ninterest on those bank accounts from income calculations. This \nrelatively tiny source of income is easy to forget and difficult to \ntrack. Excluding it is exactly the kind of simplification state \nagencies and households need as we move the food stamp program away \nfrom its old focus on serving welfare recipients to its new emphasis on \nthe working poor and other diverse low-income populations.\n  States could, however, exclude accounts that households could not \nreadily access, such as funds that states' TANF programs designate only \nto be spent for education, home or car purchases, or other specific \npurposes. States also could exclude any designated retirement savings, \nincluding individual retirement accounts, to the extent current \nregulations do not already exclude those items.\n  Jointly-held property also could be excluded if the household could \nincur legal liability by withdrawing the funds. Eligibility workers \nhave neither the time nor the expertise to sort out potentially \ncomplicated ownership interests.\n  One of the simplifications that we expect will help states and \nhouseholds the most is the change to the standard utility allowance or \nSUA. In a cold state such as mine, heating and other utility bills \ninevitably affect low-income families' ability to purchase a \nnutritionally adequate diet. We believe we have crafted a provision \nthat simplifies the treatment of utility expenses without reducing \nbenefits for any significant number of households. The substantial cost \nestimate for this provision reflects that assumption.\n  Achieving our goals obviously depends on states having and \nmaintaining adequate SUAs. Although the shift to a mandatory SUA should \nnot increase federal costs except in the two respects addressed in this \namendment, neither should it save money at low-income households' \nexpense. States that shift from an optional SUA to a mandatory one \nshould be able to increase it somewhat in the transition without \nincreasing federal costs.\n  Perhaps even more importantly, states need to faithfully observe \nUSDA's regulation requiring annual reviews of the SUA's adequacy. In \nthe past, some states let their SUAs stagnate for many years at a time. \nWe were pleased to hear that USDA has been moving recently to achieve \ngreater compliance with the updating requirement and that it intends to \ncontinue to do so. We know that many states lack the technical capacity \nto conduct detailed economic surveys to determine just what the optimal \nSUA might be. USDA, however, has allowed a state simply to compute the \nincrease in utility costs from the time the state last changed its SUA \nand apply that percentage to increase the SUA. We trust that this \nsensible approach will continue and will be made available to all \nstates.\n\n  At the same time we simplified in many respects, we did not intend to \ncreate new complexities. A question has arisen about the standard \ndeduction provision of our bill. Obviously, 8.31 percent of the net \nincome limit will not be an even dollar number since the net income \nlimit figure is expressed in an even number of dollars. We do not \nintend to require state agencies to process standard deductions \nexpressed in pennies. USDA could not give households a standard \ndeduction that is less than 8.31 percent of the net income eligibility \nlimit, but it clearly has authority to round that number up to the next \nlargest whole dollar. This has not presented a problem in the past and \nsee no reason why it would now.\n  We set up a new system of bonuses for high-performing states. We in \nno way intend to pre-judge what system USDA will select to give out \nthose funds. USDA could rely on statistical measurements, as it does \nnow, but it also could allow states to apply for bonuses in particular \ncategories. Allowing states to compete for recognition and bonus awards \nfor the most innovative means of correcting problems in program \nadministration could provide useful lessons that could benefit other \nstates.\n  A couple of ideas were advanced that we did not adopt. We rejected an \nAdministration proposal to cut back on categorical eligibility for food \nstamps. Current regulations give states broad flexibility to determine \nwhat items receiving TANF or MOE funding should be considered benefits \nthat trigger categorical eligibility. USDA approval is required only in \nlimited, clearly delineated circumstances.\n  The Department argued that this policy is too broad, but we were not \npersuaded. The Department is free, of course, to renew its proposal \nwith us if it feels strongly about this issue. It should not, however, \nact unilaterally to restrict flexibility states have under current law \nand regulations.\n  Also, we made no change in the procedures for approving state plans \nto certify elderly and disabled households for food stamps based on \ninformation in the Social Security Administration's files. These would \nstill go through the research waiver process, although as states and \nthe Department gain more experience with these projects, we anticipate \napproval should become much easier. The waiver process is important, \nhowever, to ensure that we are not shortchanging households with high \nhousing or medical costs. Also, the Department needs to make sure that \neligible people are not losing out on food stamps during the period \ntheir applications for disability benefits are pending with SSA.\n  All in all, I believe that this package of simplifications and \nbenefit expansions represent a significant step forward on the path the \nprogram has been traveling over the last several years. This package \nshould strengthen the food stamp program's role as a work support and \nas a nutrition safety net for those going through difficult times. It \ndeserves our full and enthusiastic support.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to comment more extensively on \none of the most important aspects of the nutrition title, the \nrestoration of benefits to legal immigrants. As my colleagues know, I \nremain deeply opposed to the benefit cuts to legal immigrants enacted \nas a part of the 1996 welfare law. I have worked ever since the passage \nof that law to ease the eligibility restrictions on legal immigrants in \na wide array of programs. Immigrants are admitted into this country as \nlegal permanent residents with the assumption that they will be a part \nof our communities, work and pay taxes, and serve at our nation's \ndefense. It is unjust to exclude these hardworking individuals from \naccess to critical work support programs and the safety net if they \nfall on hard times.\n  The legal immigrant restrictions in the food stamp program were the \nharshest of all of major federal benefit programs, causing more than \none million legal immigrants to lose eligibility. Unfortunately, \nimmigrants have not been the only group affected by the food stamp \nrestrictions. Over 85 percent of immigrant families are households that \ninclude at least one citizen child. From 1994 to 1998, 1.2 million \nimmigrants left the program, mostly due to the eligibility \nrestrictions. Over the same period, 1 million citizen children of \nimmigrant parents also left the program, representing a 74 percent \ndecline for this group.\n  Immigrant advocates and emergency food providers believe that these \nlegal immigrant parents are confused about their children's eligibility \nand that the parents believe if their children receive food stamps that \nit could have a negative impact on immigrant family members' \nimmigration status.\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\n  Children of immigrants now make up a significant share of the \nchildhood poverty population. Nationally, one in four children in \npoverty have immigrant parents. In order to continue to make meaningful \ninroads in reducing child poverty, it is key to find new ways to serve \nmore effectively the children of immigrants.\n  Of course, the best way to resolve this problem would be to restore \neligibility to all legal immigrants. Unfortunately, we did not have the \nresources in this farm bill to provide for such a restoration. \nNonetheless, we have taken major strides to significantly ameliorate \nthe restrictive rules. The final bill is based largely upon the \nimmigrant restorations in the Senate-passed farm bill, which were \nexpanded upon with overwhelming bipartisan support on the Senate floor.\n  We decided that if the eligibility for legal immigrant children is \nrestored the food stamp eligibility rules for children will become less \ncomplex and easier to explain. This should encourage immigrant parents \nto apply for benefits on behalf of their children. If states, the anti-\nhunger community and the immigrant community can inform families that \nall poor children are eligible for food stamps, there will be a much \ngreater chance of reaching those families confused about the current \nrules.\n  Another significant component of the immigrant provision is that it \nrestores benefits to qualified legal immigrant adults who have lived in \nthe U.S. for 5 or more years with that status. Of course, there are \nmany types of qualified immigrant statuses. It will not matter if the \nimmigrant held one qualified status such as asylee and then changed \ntheir status to something else such as a legal permanent resident. The \nfive year clock begins from the time the immigrant first held a \nqualified status.\n\n  The adult restoration provides basic conformity in food stamp \neligibility rules to those already in place in Medicaid, SCHIP and \nTANF. It is our hope that these new food stamp rules will make it \neasier for states to administer and for immigrants to understand. \nFinally, the legislation would allow legal immigrants receiving \nbenefits under specified disability-based programs to qualify for food \nstamps.\n  Children will no longer be subject to sponsor deeming rules, although \nsponsor immigrant adults will continue to be subject to these rules. As \na part of our deliberations, we reviewed USDA's recent regulations on \nsponsor deeming and found them to be an appropriate policy consistent \nwith our understanding of how deeming should operate in the food stamp \nprogram--a balance of ensuring that needy immigrants are able to access \nfood assistance while not providing assistance to immigrants who are \nbeing supported by their sponsors. We also appreciate that USDA was \nsensitive to not restricting food assistance to immigrants whose \nsponsors refuse to cooperate by providing requested paperwork. We do \nnot expect USDA to make any changes in this area.\n  When we were evaluating how to design these provisions, we placed \ngreat weight on the cost estimates that CBO provided for this package, \nas well as the price tag the Administration gave its own proposals in \nits FY2003 budget. Neither estimate assumed that any sponsors had to \nrepay the federal government as a result of immigrants receiving food \nstamps. Under the new affidavits of support now in place, most sponsors \nare likely to be a very close family member of the immigrant's. This \nmeans that they are likely to live together and be a part of the same \nfamily unit or food stamp household.\n  In all the years that I have worked on the food stamp program, \nCongress has never required food stamp households to repay benefits for \nwhich they were eligible. Sponsor liability should not and does not \ncircumvent that principle. We do not intend for a low-income sponsor to \nincur a debt for food stamps that he or she receives along with the \nsponsored immigrants.\n  Of course, we have no intention of allowing affluent sponsors to \nabdicate their responsibilities. But low-income sponsors who are a part \nof the food stamp household or family unit should not be billed for \nsigning up other family members for food stamps. Consider a step-father \nwho sponsored his new wife and step-child into the country some years \nago. If he loses his job and he and his new family become eligible for \nfood stamps, we want them to avail themselves of this critical \ntemporary assistance. There should be no penalties for being eligible \nfor and participating in the food stamp program.\n  With these restorations, we will come closer to righting a great \nwrong. Immigrants and immigration are a part of the history and \nheritage of our country. I am pleased that hard working immigrants who \nfall on hard times will be able to gain access to this important food \nassistance program. No member of our society should go without enough \nto eat. This legislation moves us further toward fulfilling that goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this conference report.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is with heartfelt regret that I must \nvote against the 2002 farm bill conference report. It had been my \nsincere hope this farm bill would improve conditions for the nation's \nfarmers. Unfortunately, it is a budget buster that stimulates \noverproduction, devastates the Virginia peanut industry, and does not \nadequately protect the Chesapeake Bay. While I recognize the hard work \nand good intentions that went into this bill, I cannot in good \nconscience vote for it. It is not good for Virginia and it is not good \nfor the nation.\n  Agriculture is a crucial industry in Virginia. Farming has been a way \nof life in Virginia since the first English settlers arrived at \nJamestown in 1607. Virginia is a recognized leader in tobacco, peanuts, \nand poultry production while cotton, corn and soybeans are rapidly \ngaining in importance. Farming represents almost 10 percent of the jobs \nin Virginia.\n  And there is no doubt farming is vital to the Nation as a whole. Our \nfarmers produce the safest, most reliable, and most abundant food \nsupply in the world. A stable supply of food and fiber is essential to \nour national economy and our national security. We do not want to \ndepend on imported food the way we rely on foreign oil. Unfortunately, \nthis conference report does little to ensure the long term health of \ndomestic agricultural production.\n  This conference report will increase farm spending by 70 percent or \nabout $82.8 billion over ten years while the budget agreement only \nallows $73.5 billion in new farm spending. These farm subsidies will \ncost $200 billion over ten years or $20 billion annually. While all \nthis is done in the name of preserving the family farm, government \nsubsidies since the 1930s have not prevented their disappearance.\n  Recently, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the Federal \nbudget will operate at a deficit of $100 billion this year. We are \nfighting an expensive war on terrorism. Now is not the time to increase \nspending on farm programs that may hurt the American farmer more than \nthey help. Every dollar of deficit spending now puts the solvency of \nsocial security in jeopardy for future generations.\n  But while the conference report is bad for the country, it is \nparticularly bad for Virginia. When the Senate passed the 2002 farm \nbill, I supported it because of some key improvements over the House \nfarm bill for the peanut program and the Chesapeake Bay nutrient \nreduction pilot program. Now that the bill has emerged from conference, \nthese important gains have been stripped out.\n  After the House of Representatives passed its version of the farm \nbill, Senator Allen and I worked to improve the bill and were able to \nachieve significant improvements in the peanut program. First, the \ntarget price in the Senate bill was $520 per ton while it was $480 in \nthe House bill. Second, the loan rate in the Senate bill was $400, \nwhile it was $350 in the House Bill. Finally, the Senate version \ncontained an 11-cent per pound quota buyout for 5 years, and the House \nversion provided only 10 cents.\n  Make no mistake, the Senate target price was not as high as I \nbelieved it should be, but under the circumstances, it was a \nsignificant improvement over the House-passed bill. In years past, the \npeanut-producing States have stuck together during debate on the farm \nbill. Unfortunately, this year, Virginia was left with few allies on \npeanuts. We simply did not have the votes to make the improvements to \nthe peanut program we wanted. In both the Cochran-Roberts and the \nHutchinson substitute amendments, we had\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\nnegotiated to include a $550-per-ton target price. Unfortunately, both \namendments failed.\n  So while the Senate farm bill was far from perfect, I voted for it to \nsupport the Senate's position in conference. Now that the House-Senate \nconference on the farm bill is complete, I am extremely disappointed \nwith the results. The target price has been reduced to $495 per ton, a \nlevel far below the break even point for most Virginia peanut farmers.\n  And the conference report makes this new peanut program effective for \nfiscal year 2002. Peanuts have already been planted in Virginia. In the \ninterest of basic equity, this new program should begin in fiscal year \n2003. Farmers planting under one farm bill and harvesting under another \nillustrates that Congress is out of touch with rural America.\n  While the old peanut program was supposed to be a ``no-net cost \nprogram'', the new peanut program will cost the taxpayer upwards of $4 \nbillion. This is a bad deal for the taxpayer and a disaster for \nsoutheast Virginia.\n  Finally, the conference committee stripped out the $70 million \nChesapeake Bay nutrient reduction pilot program. The bay is a national \ntreasure and vital to the economy of Virginia. This pilot program would \nhave encouraged farmers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to use less \nfertilizer and compensated them if this resulted in lower yields, \ncreating a win-win situation for farmers and environmentalists. \nUnfortunately, the House did not agree to this provision.\n  This conference report hurts the very farmers it is meant to help. \nThis farm bill is not good for Virginia and not good for America. It \nhurts Virginia peanut farmers. It endangers the Chesapeake Bay. It \ncosts the taxpayers too much. And, it raids the Social Security trust \nfund. Accordingly, I must vote no on the 2002 farm bill conference \nreport.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the House-Senate \nconference report on the farm bill.\n  I do so, with deep regret. While I now live in a suburban New Jersey \ncommunity and have for 25 years, I was raised on a 120-acre family \ngrain farm in central Illinois. I know from experience the rewards of \nworking the soil and tending the fields. And I know, too, the very real \nexperience of living life on the economic edge, as so many of our \nNation's farmers do.\n  But this legislation is not the way to help our farmers.\n  I opposed the Senate version of this legislation when it passed the \nSenate in February because I believed it was fiscally imprudent, hurt \nconsumers as well as many of the farmers it was intended to help, \nsubsidized one sector of the American economy to the exclusion of \nothers, and because it provided relatively little assistance to New \nJersey's farmers. Unfortunately, the bill that has come out of \nconference committee is worse on all these counts. For that reason, I \nmust vote no again.\n  As I stated when I opposed the Senate version of this bill, the \ncurrent system of subsidies is the wrong way to support America's \nfarmers. These subsidies naturally lead to overproduction which \ndistorts the market, unfairly benefit a limited number of the largest \nproducers and impose excessive costs on all consumers and taxpayers. \nFurthermore, the system distributes these subsidies in a manner that \nleaves farmers in many States, including the Garden State, with little \nassistance. In fact, the amount New Jersey receives is estimated at a \nfraction of 1 percent. Let me repeat, a fraction of 1 percent of the \ntotal.\n  When the Senate first considered the farm bill, it took some steps to \nmake an inequitable system somewhat more fair. It imposed a cap on \npayments so that no farmer would receive more than $275,000 of \nsubsidies per year. And it took the savings and used them, in part, to \nincrease funding for conservation programs to a record $21 billion, a \ngood thing. These would have been good changes to a system that gives \ntwo-thirds of the commodity subsidies to 10 percent of our Nation's \nfarms.\n  Unfortunately even those small reforms were lost in conference. The \ncap on payments was raised to $360,000, but now includes several \nloopholes for agribusinesses to get around the limit. It is this \nprovision that may wind up hurting many of those this legislation is \nintended to help, as family farms unable to compete with heavily \nsubsidized agribusinesses are swallowed up by their very competition.\n  Making matters worse, the conservation funding was cut by $4 billion \nto $17.1 billion over current spending and is largely deferred until \nlater years, making it less likely that it will be available at all.\n  I also am very concerned that the legislation's large increase in \ncommodity subsidies would undermine U.S. trade policy and make it much \nharder to win concessions in international trade negotiations. That's \nbecause huge U.S. subsidies would drive down global crop prices, and \nadversely affect the economies of many other countries, especially \ndeveloping nations. These nations then would be much less likely to \nopen their markets to American companies. The end result would be that \ngenerous subsidies to a small handful of agribusinesses would end up \nundermining a much broader range of U.S. manufacturers and service \nproviders, and would cost American jobs.\n  Another major concern of mine is that this legislation is \nfundamentally unfair to my State of New Jersey. The bill would \nperpetuate a system of agricultural subsidies that provides assistance \nto only 7 percent of New Jersey's farmers. This compares, for example, \nto other States in which as many as 60-75 percent of farmers receive \nassistance.\n  The reason why some States do so much better than New Jersey is that \nproducers of row crops, like corn, wheat, grain and rice get the bulk \nof the support. These commodities, by and large, are not produced in \nthe Garden State to a significant degree. In New Jersey, our farmers \ngrow large amounts of specialty crops, such as blueberries, eggplant \nand asparagus. In fact, New Jersey ranks second in the Nation for \nblueberry production, and fourth in the Nation for eggplant and \nasparagus production. Yet, though New Jersey's farmers meet much of the \nNation's needs for these crops, none of our blueberry, eggplant or \nasparagus farmers receive support under the existing commodity \nprograms. That is one reason that New Jersey got less than one-tenth of \n1 percent of the total commodity assistance provided by the Federal \nGovernment in fiscal year 2001. Less than one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  The farm bill that the Senate considered in February made a few \nimprovements to the existing system. And I voted in favor of those \nimprovements, as well as improvements to the Food Stamp Program that \nare badly needed. However, as I have said, many of those improvements \nwere lost in conference with the House of Representatives. As a result, \nwe have a bill that tells New Jersey farmers that they are not equal to \nthe corn, wheat, rice and grain growers in the South and Midwest. That \ntheir efforts do not deserve much federal support. I cannot support \nsuch a measure.\n  New Jersey ranks 49th in our return on tax dollars paid to the \nFederal Government. We don't receive enough for our mass transit needs. \nWe don't receive enough for our housing needs. We don't receive enough \nto clean up our environment, even though we have more Superfund sites \nthan any other state. New Jersey's situation merely highlights the \nimbalance in support for our nation's competing needs. I cannot support \nlegislation that continues this inequitable distribution of Federal \nfunds.\n  In fact, I wish I could support the excellent nutrition title \ncontained in this conference report. It is outrageous that we subsidize \nfarmers for disposing of surplus food and yet we prohibit low-income \nworking immigrants who live in this country legally from receiving \nnutrition benefits. This bill would restore benefits for about 380,000 \nlegal immigrants, which while a good first step, is still too little. \nThe food stamp application simplifications and extension of \ntransitional food stamps for families moving from welfare to work are \nmeasures that will ensure more children and families receive adequate \nnutrition and I strongly support these provisions. While there is a \nsignificant increase for nutrition programs, this conference report \ninvests only $6.4 billion in nutrition programs, which again is a \nfraction of one percent of the total cost of this bill.\n  In conclusion, this conference report is flawed in many ways. It \nperpetuates the existing inefficient and unfair system of farm \nsubsidies and significantly\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\nincreases subsidies for favored crops. That means we will continue to \nsubsidize a limited number of producers. We will continue to distort \nthe market. We will continue to impose higher costs on consumers and \ntaxpayers. And we will continue to treat my state of New Jersey \nunfairly.\n  For these reasons, I cannot in good conscience support this \nconference report.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, the ranking member, conferees and \nstaff members who worked so hard to bring the new farm bill to the \nfloor of the Senate for final passage.\n  I especially want to applaud them for the inclusion of a strong \nprovision to encourage the deployment of broadband technology to rural \nAmerica. Ensuring that all Americans have the technological capability \nis essential in this digital age. It is not only an issue of fairness, \nbut it is also an issue of economic survival. But, as the demand for \nhigh speed Internet access grows urban America is quickly gaining high \nspeed access, while rural America is, too often, being left behind.\n  Historically, our economy has been defined by geography, and we in \nCongress were powerless to do anything about it. Where there were \nports, towns and businesses got their start. Where there were railroad \ntracks, towns and businesses grew up around them. The highway system \nbrought the same evolution.\n  But the Internet is changing all of that. No longer must economic \ngrowth be defined by geographic fiat. Telecommunications industries and \npolicymakers are proclaiming, ``distance is dead!'' But, that's not \nquite right: distance will be dead, only as long as we ensure that \nbroadband services are available to all parts of America, urban and \nrural, and the bill we pass today is an important step toward improving \nInternet access in rural America.\n  To remedy the gap between urban and rural America, several years ago \nI introduced legislation to establish a new broadband loan program \nwithin the Rural Utilities Service. I am very pleased to have worked \nwith the chairman and others to craft a broadband provision modeled \nafter that bill that will give the rural broadband program an \nauthorization and funding. This funding will create hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of broadband loans each year.\n  This issue is not a new one. When we were faced with electrifying all \nof the country, we enacted the Rural Electrification Act. When \ntelephone service was only being provided to well-populated \ncommunities, we expanded the Rural Electrification Act and created the \nRural Utilities Service to oversee rural telephone deployment. In place \nfor over 50 years the RUS telecommunications loan program has been an \nunprecedented success. In 1949, about 40 percent of American farmers \nhad phone service. Not only has that changed dramatically, with almost \neveryone having access to basic telephone service, but it is important \nto note that in over 50 years there has not been a single loan loss in \nthe telecommunications program.\n  Today's legislation seeks to build on that success to make new \ninvestment in the next generation of telecommunications technology, \nknown as broadband, to ensure that all Americans have access to the \nInternet. This will give RUS new authority to make hundreds of millions \nof dollars in low interest loans each year to companies that are \ndeploying broadband technology to rural America. Loans will be made on \na company neutral and a technology neutral basis so that companies that \nwant to serve these areas can do so by employing technology that is \nbest suited to a particular area.\n  Again, I commend the chairman and ranking member, and the staff of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee for their work on this provision. This \nprogram and the loans that will flow from it will be the biggest \nbroadband investment program ever enacted in the United States and will \ngo a long way toward ensuring that rural Americans have access to the \nnext generation of technology.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about \nthe farm bill conference report on which the Senate will soon be \nvoting.\n  Let me say at the outset that there is a lot of good in this bill. I \nwish I could vote for it. However, I will not vote in favor of this \nbill today, and I will explain why shortly.\n  Senator Harkin and his staff have worked very hard to craft this farm \nbill in the face of very strong and competing State and regional \ninterests. I know their task was not an easy one and it is not always \npossible to please everyone. Clearly, there are some provisions in this \nbill that will benefit New Mexico.\n  In particular, I would like to cite Chairman Harkin's steadfast \ncommitment to strengthening the agriculture conservation programs that \nhelp protect the environment.\n  I do believe the conservation programs should be the real centerpiece \nof this legislation. Unfortunately, funding for these vital programs \nwas cut $4 billion below the level in the Senate-passed bill. I am \ndisappointed the Senate did not prevail in the conference with the \nHouse. Nevertheless, existing conservation programs, such as CRP and \nEQIP, as well as the new Conservation Security Program, will help \nprotect New Mexico's farm and ranchland for future generations, though \nnot as much as they would have under the Senate bill. There is a new \nWater Conservation Program that will help slow the depletion of the \nSouthern Ogallala Aquifer in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas.\n  This bill has funding for a new Grassland Reserve Program and a Water \nConservation Program that will be helpful to farmers and ranchers in my \nState, especially with New Mexico now in the throes of an extended \ndrought.\n  There is also mandatory funding in this farm bill for the Small \nWatershed Rehabilitation Program, which I cosponsored in the last \nCongress. This program supports reconstruction of the 100 small \nwatershed dams in my State, many of which are 30 to 50 years old and \nreaching the end of their expected life.\n  Funding for the Market Access Program has been increased, which will \nhelp all farmers increase exports of their products.\n  I am pleased the conferees adopted my language that will allow New \nMexico's Valencia peanut pool to continue to operate as an effective \nmarketing association.\n  Within this farm bill's nutrition programs, I am pleased that \nCongress is finally restoring benefits for adult legal immigrants who \nhave lived here for at least 5 years and all children of legal \nimmigrants. I also support increased funding for the WIC and senior \nfarmers' market nutrition programs.\n  This bill continues important rural development programs that have \nbeen critical to helping New Mexico's smaller communities improve \ninfrastructure and promote economic development. There are new programs \nto train rural firefighters and to extend broadband service to rural \nareas. The additional funding for water and wastewater projects will be \nespecially important to rural communities in my state facing major \nconstruction costs to meet EPA's new standard for arsenic in drinking \nwater.\n  Finally, I cosponsored Senator Johnson's bill that requires country \nof origin labeling of meat, fruits and vegetables, fish and peanuts. \nThe farm bill includes these new labeling provisions. I do believe \nconsumers deserve to know the source of their commercial food products.\n  That is some of the good in this farm bill. However, as I said, I \nwill not be voting in favor of the bill, and I would like to take a few \nminutes to explain why.\n  This farm bill does nothing to stem the staggering cost to the \ntaxpayers of subsidies for agricultural commodities. In fact, this \nlegislation will increase Federal subsidies by nearly $50 billion over \nthe next decade; this is on top of the baseline funding of $77 billion. \nThe Federal Government's role in agriculture will grow dramatically \nunder this legislation. By some estimates, forty percent of net farm \nincome now comes from the Federal Government.\n  Nearly three-quarters of all of the new money in this bill goes to \ncrop subsidy programs. As we all now know from the analysis does by the \nEnvironmental Working Group, the vast majority of these federal \nsubsidies go to growers in 10 central and southern States for only a \nfew specific crops. Such massive subsidies drive up land\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\nprices and do nothing to stem over production, especially when \ncommodity prices are low.\n  Even more troubling to me is the new national dairy subsidy program \nin this farm bill, which will cost taxpayers at least $1.3 billion over \nthe next 3 to 4 years. At the same time it will actually lower the \naverage revenue for milk producers in New Mexico by an estimated 17 \ncents per hundredweight.\n  That is correct, you heard it right. This program costs taxpayers \n$1.3 billion and will actually hurt dairy producers in my State. \nMoreover, we estimate that every producer with more than about 800 cows \nin all 50 States will lose revenue under this program. Because the \naverage size of New Mexico's dairies is about 1,580 cows, nearly every \nproducer in my State will be hurt by this legislation.\n  In the past decade, New Mexico has quietly come to the forefront of \nthe nation's dairy industry. Milk production in my State has more than \ntripled since 1990. New Mexico is now seventh in the nation in total \nmilk production and fifth in average milk production per cow. In the \nfirst 3 months of this year, production has grown 17 percent over the \n2001 level. In Roosevelt and Curry Counties, production is up a \nwhopping 32 percent.\n  There is no secret for my State's booming dairy industry. New Mexico \nis an ideal location for dairies because of our mild climate, which \nboosts milk production and does not require sheltering the animals from \nthe weather. In addition, producers are moving to New Mexico because of \nthe strong dairy infrastructure, moderate land prices, and well-\nintegrated alfalfa industry. Currently, there are plans for 35 new \ndairies in new Mexico, most of which will have between 1,500 and 3,000 \ncows. These are not some kind of mega-industrial operations, but \nfamily-run farms just like dairies all over America.\n  The growth in dairy production in New Mexico is coupled with rapid \ngrowth in milk processing, including production of powder, cheese, and \nultra-filtered milk. Soon, the Nation's first commercial plant \nproducing milk protein concentrate will open in Portales, New Mexico. \nThe economic impact of the dairy industry on New Mexico is now \nestimated at $1.8 billion per year.\n  Because New Mexico has mostly large, efficient, family-owned dairies, \nmy State is the big loser under this new daily subsidy program. \nIndependent analyses show the $1.3 billion Federal subsidy will \nencourage overproduction and depress market prices nationwide. \nAccording to FAPRI's preliminary analysis of this legislation, the \nexcess production will drive down national class III and IV milk prices \nby 17 and 28 cents/cwt, respectively. This means every dairy producer \nin America will get a lower price for all of his or her milk.\n  Meanwhile, under existing law, the Federal Government must step in \nand purchase the surplus. The government already owns nearly a billion \npounds of surplus nonfat dry milk, equal to an 18-month supply In just \nthe last month alone, the government has had to purchase 80-million \npounds of nonfat dry milk at a cost of about $70 million. This \nlegislation will add still more to the government's already bulging \npowder inventory. The taxpayers, of course, will be asked to bear the \ncost of purchasing all of this excess production on top of the new $1.3 \nbillion subsidy. Sadly, this ill-conceived program will continue to \nerode the dairy industry for years to come.\n  Finally, we do not really know how much this program will cost \nbecause it depends on milk prices in the future and the number of \nparticipants in the program. The lower the price of milk, the higher \nthe cost to the taxpayer. As I indicated, CBO scored the program at \n$1.3 billion. However, the Food and Agricultural Policy Research \nInstitute has performed an independent analysis and estimates the total \ncost to the taxpayers at $3.6 billion--nearly three times more than \nCBO's estimate. Unfortunately, only time will tell how big the final \nbill will be for this program.\n  In short, the new dairy program is a real lose-lose proposal for the \nAmerican people. There simply is no need for Congress to ask taxpayers \nto subsidize the dairy industry to the tune of billions of dollars.\n  From the outset, I said I could not support a farm bill that \ncontained any massive new national dairy subsidy program. This bill \nsuffers the added defect that it actually harms the dairy industry in \nmy State. In fact, New Mexico's producers are hurt more than producers \nin any other state.\n  I would like to read part of a letter addressed to me from the Dairy \nProducers of New Mexico:\n\n       The Farm Security Act of 2002 is not good for New Mexico. \n     It introduces a new, expensive, and counter productive direct \n     payment provision to dairy producers on some of their milk.\n\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       This is not good policy for dairy farmers--it turns them \n     from business people in the market to people on the \n     government dole. It is not good for taxpayers because it \n     misspends their money. It is not good for our Nation because \n     it interferes with international trade.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nExhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would have liked to be able to vote for this farm \nbill, but regrettably, I cannot.\n  I will vote no on this conference report.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                Dairy Producers of New Mexico,\n\n                                         Roswell, NM, May 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of Dairy Producers of New \n     Mexico and its membership, I want to thank you and your \n     entire staff, particularly Dr. Dan Alpert, for representing \n     our New Mexico dairy producers. We recognize that national \n     dairy policy is very complex and regionalized, and often \n     contentious. It is indeed very comforting to us to know that \n     our U.S. delegation takes a stand to protect New Mexicans in \n     the face of national politics.\n       The Farm Security Act of 2002 is not good for New Mexico. \n     It introduces a new, expensive, and counter productive direct \n     payment provision to dairy producers on some of their milk. \n     The over one billion dollars thrown into the dairy economy \n     will result in reduced milk prices on all milk regardless of \n     the size of farm that produces it. The family run dairy farms \n     in New Mexico will be especially hard hit.\n       According to FAPRI, the average payment will be about 85 \n     cents a hundredweight but that will only be on the first 2.4 \n     million pounds produced or a maximum payment of about \n     $20,400. This payment will be more than offset by the average \n     milk price on all milk of 14 cents a hundredweight. For the \n     average dairy farmer in New Mexico that is about $52,500 per \n     year.\n       This is a real loss of income. It is not a loss just to the \n     dairy farmers, but to their families, their employees, and \n     their vendors. The economics of the rural New Mexico \n     communities will suffer this loss as well.\n       The Farm Security Act brings us anxiety--anxiety as to when \n     and how the government will again adversely impact our \n     industry.\n       This is not good policy for dairy farmers--it turns them \n     from business people in the market to people on the \n     government dole. It is not good for the taxpayers because it \n     misspends their money. It is not good for our Nation because \n     it interferes with international trade.\n       History will show that your amendment offered last December \n     was wise and those who voted for it and stuck by their votes \n     had a better vision for dairy than the Farm bill now before \n     the Senate. It's a battle that we appreciate you taking on \n     and fighting on our behalf.\n       Yes, there are some provisions that we like. These include \n     dairy price support program extension of $9.90/cwt for six \n     years; authorization of a new national Johne's disease \n     control program; the extension of the Dairy Export Incentive \n     Program (DEIP); fixing the statutory mandatory inventory and \n     price reporting language to prevent further costly reporting \n     errors by the USDA; and funds for dairy and other livestock \n     producers through the Environmental Quality Incentives \n     Program (EQIP). Those were by and large non controversial and \n     they do not need to come at the great cost imposed by the \n     dairy market loss program.\n       Again, Senator, we appreciate all of your hard work for the \n     dairy industry in New Mexico. We sincerely appreciate your \n     efforts on behalf of arc family farmers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Sharon L. Lombardi,\n                                               Executive Director.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today is a sad, sad day in \nAmerica. It is a said day for the U.S. taxpayer and a sad day for the \nfamily farmers of our country. I believe the Wall Street Journal said \nit best when they editorialized, ``that great rooting,\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\nsnooting noise you hear in the distance, is the sound of election-year, \nfarm-state politics rolling out of the U.S. Congress.''\n  My colleagues know I stand for fiscal conservatism, so I don't \nimagine that many are surprised by my opposition to the farm bill 2002 \nconference report. But a ``no'' vote does not adequately describe my \ndisappointment, my disgust, or my dismay at this, the largest non-\nmilitary expansion of the Federal Government since the Great Society.\n  House and Senate conferees approved a farm bill that expands payments \nto farmers by nearly $50 billion over the next decade. More than 90 \npercent of this increase will go to farmers producing just five crops: \nwheat, corn, rice, cotton and soybean. Two-thirds of this money will \nbenefit a mere 10 percent of farmers. If the goal of the so-called \nFreedom to Farm Act of 1996 was to wean farmers off the trough of \ngovernment assistance, this bill represents a bloating of agriculture's \ndependency on the taxpayer's dime.\n  In these times of war and deficit spending, should we really be \ndirecting precious taxpayer dollars in such an irresponsible manner? I \nread an estimate that this legislation will cost the average American \nhousehold $4,377 over the next 10 years, $1,805 in taxes and $2,572 in \ninflated food prices because of price supports. And for what, I ask? To \nprop up wealthy corporate farmers? To encourage farmers to continue \noverproducing unprofitable crops for which there is more supply than \ndemand? To reinstate subsidies for honey, wool, and mohair?\n  Even the one provision in the Senate-passed version of the bill that \nmade it somewhat palatable, payment limitations, was gutted to the \nextent that it is no longer meaningful: the cap was raised and \nloopholes, the prized toy of our top legislators, included to make the \none attempt at payment control utterly ineffective. What good is a \npayment limitation that can be completely circumvented?\n  In response to some of the criticism that has been ladled on this \npork-barrel monstrosity, Senators Harkin and Daschle point to the $17.1 \nbillion included for conservation programs. I find it ironic that they \ncontinue to do so when environmentalists are critical and have pledged \nopposition to the bill. As the ranking Republican member of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I have to say, at what price \nconservation? It is worth the total price tag? I think not. What the \nconservation title represents is a transparent attempt to buy votes \nfrom those States that do not benefit from the commodities title. I am \nsupportive of the conservation programs this bill funds. My State of \nNew Hampshire relies on these programs. But I will not fall for it. Why \nshould New Hampshire taxpayers, or any taxpayers, be asked to foot the \nbill for encouraging farmers to get on the Federal dole when our goal \nshould be to do just the opposite?\n  This bill is a step backwards, as far as I am concerned, in \nagricultural policy. Our Chamber's two working farmers, Senators Lugar \nand Grassley, oppose its passage. I only hope that fiscal sanity will \ntake hold of my colleagues and prevent this fat-laden conference report \nfrom ever reaching the President's desk.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to commend Chairman \nHarkin and all of the farm bill conferees on their work related to H.R. \n2646, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. The Senate \npassed its version of this legislation on February 13, 2002 and I am \npleased that the conferees were able to finish their work so we can \nsend this legislation to the President for his signature and quick \nenactment. I am confident that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will \nwork expeditiously to implement the new programs created in this \nlegislation in time for the 2002 crop year. Rural America needs the \nassistance provided through this ``rural'' economic stimulus bill, and \nI am pleased that today we will respond to their needs.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation includes the creation \nof a new, national dairy program that supports all dairy farmers \nregardless of location and regardless of the end use of their milk. I \nam also pleased with the increased investment in nutrition funding for \nprograms like food stamps, the WIC and Seniors Farmers Market program. \nFinally, I am supportive of the enhanced commitment to conservation \nspending on programs like the Farmland Protection Program, the \nConservation Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentive \nProgram and the new Conservation Security Program.\n  Of particular interest to my State of Wisconsin is the creation of a \nnew, national dairy program that will, for the first time, create a \nmore meaningful and credible safety net for all of our Nation's dairy \nfarmers. This new program, while not perfect for any one region, moves \nus beyond the regional and divisive debate over dairy compacts. I am \npleased that gone are the days of regional trade barriers and milk \nprice fixing cartels that artificially support the price of milk in one \nregion at the expense of farmers in others.\n  In addition to extending the very important dairy price support \nprogram at $9.90 per hundredweight, this farm bill creates a new \ncounter-cyclical program that will provide assistance to farmers when \nthe price of milk falls below $16.94 per hundredweight. A payment rate \nwill be calculated by taking 45 percent of the difference between \n$16.94 and the class I, fluid, price in Boston. That payment rate will \nbe made on the first 2.4 million pounds of a producer's production, or \napproximately 133 cows. The payment rate per hundredweight will be the \nsame for all dairy farmers regardless of location and regardless of \nwhat their milk is used for. We in the Upper Midwest have argued over \nthe years that all dairy farmers should be treated the same regardless \nof the end use of their milk and I am pleased that this conference \nreport supports that position.\n  In addition to increased support for our dairy farmers, the Farm Bill \nConference Report also provides nearly $6.4 billion in funding for \nnutrition programs. These nutrition programs include food stamps, the \nWIC and Seniors Farmers Market Nutrition Programs and the emergency \nfood assistance program. This legislation also provides food stamp \nbenefits to legal immigrants. The nutrition title of the bill is very \nimportant to our producers who provide the commodities for the \nprograms, as well as low-income and less fortunate individuals who need \nhelp in getting access to a more nutritious and well-balanced diet.\n  Beyond the much needed increase in nutrition funding, the Farm Bill \nConference Report also provides a much needed increase in conservation \nspending. The Farm Bill Conference Report reflects a total increase of \n80 percent for conservation programs. Specifically, this legislation \nprovides a new 20-fold increase for the Farmland Protection Program, a \n10-fold increase for the Wildlife Incentives Program and phases up to \nachieve a $1.1 billion annual funding level for the Environmental \nQuality Incentive Program, EQIP. I am also pleased that there is an \nadditional enrollment of 1.2 million acres for the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram which works extremely well in Wisconsin.\n  Despite the many positive provisions in this farm bill, I am \ndisappointed that the House Conferees refused to adopt two very \nimportant Senate provisions. I am disappointed that the House Conferees \nrefused to adopt the Senate language regarding the ban on packer \nownership of livestock, which the majority of the Senate supported in \ntwo separate votes. I am also disappointed that the House Conferees did \nnot accept a meaningful limitation on farm payments.\n  First, this conference report does not include the so-called \n``Johnson Amendment,'' which would ban packer ownership of livestock. \nOn December 11, 2001, with my support, the Senate adopted this \namendment in order to provide ranchers who raise livestock with more \nmarketing opportunities and hopefully a higher price for their product. \nHowever, the House Conferees, under pressure from the meat industry \nincluding large packers, refused to accept this provision. Without a \nban of packer ownership of livestock, independent producers will \ncontinue to be shut out of markets, face lower prices and less \ncompetition while packers continue to give preference to their own \nsupplies of livestock. I support Senator Johnson's call for hearings on \nthis important issue in the Senate Agriculture Committee, and to \ninvestigate abusive market practices in the livestock sector.\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\n  Second, I am disappointed that the conference report does not include \na meaningful limit on the level of farm subsidies going to large \nfarmers located predominantly in the south. This conference report, \nwhile reducing the overall payment limit to $180,000 annually is \nmeaningless as the ``triple-entity'' rule remains in place. The final \nbill retains loopholes that not only permit a recipient to double the \n$180,000 level to $360,000 through the ``triple-entity'' rule but also \nmakes it effectively limitless for the purpose of marketing loan gains \nand loan deficiency payments. The conference report also allows for the \ncontinued use of the generic certificate program. This program allows \nthe largest of producers to enjoy the benefits of the marketing loan \nprogram without repayment while allowing the producer to hold onto \ntheir commodity for future sale on the open market. The loopholes that \nremain make the payment limitation provisions in the conference report \nmeaningless and I am disappointed that the conferees could not agree on \na way to prevent large payments from going to those producers who need \nthe assistance the least.\n  I realize this bill is not perfect. There are provisions and changes \nthat I wish could have been included in the final conference report. \nBut this bill restores a much needed economic safety-net to an industry \nthat experiences wide fluctuations in prices. The combination of a new \ncounter-cyclical dairy program, increased nutrition spending and an \nincrease in funding for conservation programs makes this new farm bill \none that I can support and one that I think will help our farmers and \nranchers across the country. We have a commitment to rural America to \nensure farming remains a viable industry in our Nation and I commend \nSenator Harkin for his leadership on this very important legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments on my \nopposition to the farm bill conference report. While I strongly support \nthe dairy provision that Senator Kohl and I helped secure for \nWisconsin's dairy farmers, I am deeply concerned that the conference \nreport eliminated a number of important Senate-passed provisions that \ntargeted assistance to small and medium-sized family farmers.\n  Specifically, I am concerned that the conference committee weakened \nthe Senate-passed payment limitation amendment and reduced the \nconservation funding. It then used these funds for the misguided \npurpose of increasing payments to corporate owned farms and \nagribusinesses. I am also deeply disappointed that a number of Senate-\napproved amendments aimed at providing competition in rural America \nwere completely eliminated in the conference committee.\n  I am disturbed that the conferees stripped the payment limitations \nprovision that both the House and Senate supported. As my colleagues \nwill recall, the Senate voted 66-31 to target Federal assistance to \nsmall and medium-sized family farmers by imposing a $275,000 payment \nlimitation on overall payments.\n  I support the Senate-passed provision of a $275,000 payment \nlimitation, but this conference report permits up to $360,000 and \nincludes significant loopholes. I am not sure who this increase is \nmeant to benefit. I know it isn't benefitting many people in Wisconsin, \nwhere only 14 out of our 60,000 farms receive over $275,000 in \ngovernment payments.\n  At the same time that the bill provides increased funds to the \nlargest producers and agribusinesses, it reduces funding for important \nconservation programs that benefit family farmers of non-traditional \ncrops such as those produced in Wisconsin. Many Wisconsin commodities--\nsuch as potatoes, sweet corn, green beans, cranberries, and cherries--\nare simply not eligible for most commodity programs, but do receive \nbenefits under a number of the conservation programs.\n  Wisconsinites certainly support a strong safety net for America's \nfarmers, but this bill is fiscally irresponsible. The Congressional \nBudget Office now estimates that the bill before us would cost $124.6 \nbillion through 2007, or almost $21 billion annually. That is about $2 \nbillion more a year than previously calculated. I cannot support a bill \nwhere payments are targeted to larger agribusinesses instead of family \nfarmers. Moreover, these new numbers indicate that this bill would \nforce Congress to retreat from other budget priorities, including \nshoring up Social Security and Medicare.\n  This bill also does not contain important Senate-passed provisions \nthat would have added much needed competition to rural America. It \nmakes little sense that the conferees rejected the Senate-passed ban on \npacker ownership and my amendment giving farmers a choice of venue to \nresolve disputes associated with agricultural contracts.\n  The Senate-passed packer ownership ban would have been an important \nfirst step to provide a competitive marketplace, and curtail the \nvertical integration by agribusinesses. My amendment reforming \nmandatory arbitration clauses would have ensured that the decision to \narbitrate is truly voluntary and that the rights and remedies provided \nfor by our judicial system are not waived under coercion. Again, more \nthan 60 Senators supported my amendment, but it was dropped in \nconference.\n  I do want to join Senator Kohl and my other colleagues to commend the \ndairy provision included in this farm bill. This provision finally \nbegins to move our dairy policy in the right direction by treating all \ndairy farmers the same--regardless of where they live. I am proud to \nhave worked with my senior Senator to have defeated efforts to extend \nand expand the northeast dairy compact and to have established a \nnational safety net that provides equal support to producers regardless \nof where they live. I am also pleased that this program has a sensible \nlimitation in terms of its payment structure. By capping these payments \nat the first 2.4 million pounds of production, we will help to ensure \nthat large factory farms out west do not flood the market with milk and \ndepress the price for those in the upper Midwest.\n  So it is with regret that I must oppose this legislation, because I \nam proud of what Senator Kohl and I were able to secure through the \ndairy safety net. But Wisconsin taxpayer dollars should not be used to \nsupport agribusinesses and others who put our farmers on an un-level \nplaying field in the marketplace.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the farm bill has been the subject of a \nlengthy debate among many diverse interests. This bill is the product \nof compromise and like any compromise, it is an effort to satisfy a \nwide range of viewpoints.\n  California agriculture is itself very diverse, and I have heard from \nmany groups in the State on this Farm bill. What I have heard from \nCalifornia constituents overall is that on balance, this farm bill is a \nnet positive for the State.\n  I have a stack of letters from Californians on this bill--and I have \nlistened carefully to what they have had to say. I have been asked to \nsupport the bill by a long list of California groups, including: the \nCalifornia Farm Bureau; Western United Dairymen; the Alliance of \nWestern Milk Producers; California Citrus Mutual; California Apple \nCommission; California Walnut Commission; Diamond of California; \nCalifornia Dried Plum Board; California Strawberry Commission; Sunsweet \nGrowers, Inc.; California Rice Commission; Farmer's Rice Cooperative; \nSacramento Central Labor Council/AFL-CIO; International Longshore and \nWarehouse Union, Local 17; Calcot, Ltd. representing 1700 grower \nmembers; Dunavant of California--California Cotton Farmers; Anderson \nClayton Corp.--Serving the California Cotton industry; California Food \nPolicy Advocates--representing food banks throughout the State; Los \nAngeles Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness; Health Access; \nNational Council of La Raza; Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of \nLos Angeles; National Immigration Forum; Jack Fleming Ranches; Big \nValley Packers; and Meyers Farming.\n  These groups represent many different interests--from California \ndairy to specialty crops, cotton and rice farmers, labor unions, \nadvocates for food banks, advocates for humane treatment of legal \nimmigrants on food stamp policy, just to name a few.\n  These groups have one thing in common. Each has asked for my support \non final passage of the Farm Bill Conference Report.\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\n  Some wish California could do better in the farm bill. I do not \ndisagree.\n  I am particularly disappointed that the farm bill conference report \nincludes $4.2 billion less for agriculture conservation programs than \nthe Senate passed bill. The Senate version of the bill set aside a \nrecord $21.3 billion for conservation. Unfortunately, the House did not \nmaintain this level of support. However, the conference report contains \nan 80 percent increase in conservation funding over previous farm \nbills. This represents an important step in the right direction.\n  The conferees also decided to drop a provision that I authored to \ndeal with Sudden Oak Death Syndrome. This syndrome has already killed \nmany of California's beloved oak trees and has hurt our wood product \nand nursery industries.\n  It is my understanding that the Sudden Oak Death language was the \nvictim of a broader controversy over other provisions of the forestry \ntitle. I hope I can count on my colleagues to move this desperately \nneeded and non-controversial legislation as a stand-alone bill.\n  I also remain concerned about the equity in the distribution of \nresources in this bill. California specialty crops, in particular, \nshould get a greater share of Federal resources. There are improvements \nin several programs available to specialty crop growers, but the bill \ndoes not go nearly as far as it should to ensure an equitable \ndistribution of Federal dollars to California.\n  At the same time, there are many good things about the bill for \nCalifornia, and on the whole, I believe the strengths of the conference \nreport outweigh the weaknesses. Let me take a few minutes to explain \nwhy.\n  The California dairy industry benefits from a price support program \nthat assures an important safety net in difficult times. California \ndairy farms will also benefit from a new formula that will provide \nadditional access to environmental improvements funding through the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program.\n  Specialty Crop producers in California--such as walnuts, dried plums, \nand pears also benefit from a number of programs in this bill, \nincluding a minimum of $200 million per year authorized for purchases \nof surplus commodities for school lunch and other programs.\n  The Market Access Program has been substantially increased in the \nconference report from the current $90 million per year increasing to \n$200 million over 6 years. This program helps California agriculture \nmarket its products abroad, including our dairy, specialty crops and \nour wine industry. I have worked for years to save this program and \nincrease its funding. The substantial increase authorized in this bill \nis a real victory for California farmers.\n  Rice and cotton farmers and the communities they live and work in \nhave suffered difficult economic times. The commodity payments in this \nbill give these farmers a light at the end of the tunnel. An important \nreform included in the bill are new limitations on payments to multi-\nmillionaire farmers. This is a reform I strongly supported and I am \npleased that it is included in the final conference report.\n  I am also particularly grateful that the House and Senate conferees \nset aside $50 million to be used specifically for water conservation \nefforts in the Klamath region. I would have preferred the $175 million \nin the Senate bill, but the $50 million provided will make a \nsignificant contribution to the needs of the people and the wildlife in \nthe Klamath basin.\n  The Nutrition title of the farm bill will also provide substantial \nbenefits to my State. In California, the nutrition title has the \npotential to deliver more than $1.7 billion in new assistance to more \nthan 3.5 million people. According to the California Food Policy \nAdvocates, an organization that works with food banks throughout the \nState, ``this is one of the most important pieces of Food Stamp \nlegislation since the landmark 1977 Act.''\n  The conference report also restores eligibility for participation in \nthe Federal food stamp program for many legal immigrants who lost those \nprivileges in 1996 as a result of welfare reform.\n  Legal immigrants pay taxes, are eligible for the draft, and many \nproudly serve in the Armed Forces. Yet, 1 in 10 immigrant families with \na citizen child report not eating for at least one day during the past \n6 months. One in four is forced to cut the size of their children's \nmeals due to lack of resources. This bill will provide critical \nassistance to the neediest members of our immigrant communities.\n  Along with Senator Graham, I also sponsored an amendment that is in \nthe final bill authorizing $10 million over 10 years for farm worker \ntraining.\n  Training farm workers to upgrade and expand their skills leads to \nadded value for agricultural crops and increased worker productivity. \nIt also improves worker pay, thereby helping to alleviate poverty in \nfarm communities.\n  On balance, this farm bill includes key provisions that are important \nto the agriculture economy in California. After carefully considering \nthe pros and cons on this important legislation, I have decided to \nsupport final passage of the Farm Bill Conference Report.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe farm bill conference report. It has taken us months to get to this \npoint, but we now have a comprehensive farm bill that addresses the \nneeds of our farmers, as well as our consumers. I thank the members of \nthe conference committee for their hard work and dedication, and I urge \nmy colleagues to recognize their good work by voting in favor of final \npassage.\n  The 2002 farm bill represents a step forward on many issues. This is \nevident in several of the provisions in the bill, especially those \nrelating to dairy, conservation, nutrition and preservation. In these \nareas, the new farm bill goes well beyond current policy, building on \nthe successes of yesterday, to help meet the demands of today.\n  I am particularly encouraged by the program this farm bill puts in \nplace to protect our Nation's dairy farmers. House and Senate conferees \nhave achieved consensus on legislation that provides direct, counter-\ncyclical payments when the Boston Class I price falls below a target \nprice of $16.94 per hundredweight. When the price of fluid milk drops \nbelow this level, farmers will receive a payment on 45 percent of the \ndifference between $16.94 and the market price. These payments, capped \nat 2.4 million pounds of milk per year, will be paid to all producers \nacross the Nation. To ensure the counter-cyclical nature of these \npayments, the 2.4 million pound cap is intended to apply only to milk \nproduction marketed during months when payments are made to producers.\n  These counter-cyclical payments are especially important in my home \nState of Vermont, and throughout New England, where the expiration of \nthe Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has left producers vulnerable to \nvolatile dairy markets. Since July of 1997 until September of last \nyear, the Northeast Dairy Compact made payments to producers during \nmonths when Class I prices fell below the compact over-order price of \n$16.94. If the compact had been in place, producers would have \ncollected payments each of the last 5 months due to the steep decline \nin prices last December. Since then, dairy markets have remained \ndepressed, with no recovery forecasted in the near future.\n  Recognizing that the loss of the compact has significantly impacted \ndairy farms in New England, this legislation makes payments under this \nprogram retroactive to December 1, 2001. Retroactive payments will not \nonly help our farmers in New England, but they will make up for the \nlosses that all producers have endured since last December. These \nlosses have been incurred on all milk, and it is my expectation that \nretroactive payments will be made to cover each gallon produced during \nthat period.\n  The dairy program included in the 2002 farm bill will continue to \ndeliver payments almost identical to those producers received under the \ncompact. And, although my farmers would rather see these payments taken \nout of the marketplace than out of the treasury, I know for many of my \nproducers, these payments will mean the difference between staying in \nbusiness, rather than calling the auctioneer.\n  While the dairy program is by far the most important provision in the \nfarm bill for my farmers, I am pleased that this legislation includes \nan 80 percent boost in funding for conservation programs. This money \nwill increase the\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\nfunding levels of programs that have proven successful, as well as \nestablish a new program to provide incentives to producers for \ncontinuing and adopting conservation practices on working lands.\n  Although some of us would have preferred that additional funding be \nprovided for conservation programs focused on improving water quality \nand protecting wildlife habitat, this legislation offers important \nresources that will help agricultural producers improve their \nstewardship of the land. The Conferees have included a provision in the \nbill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into \nstewardship agreements with State and local agencies, Indian tribes, \nand nongovernmental organizations and to designate special projects to \nenhance technical and financial assistance provided to agricultural \nproducers. This provision will help agricultural producers meet the \nrequirements of the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and \nother environmental requirements.\n  The Senate passed farm bill had included a number of provisions that \nwould have encouraged the development of pilot programs and new efforts \nto promote this kind of cooperation and partnership. Although these \nprovisions were not included in the final bill, the Conferees have made \nclear in the Statement of Managers that they intend for the Secretary \nto use her authority to establish such partnerships. I believe such \npartnerships could be a valuable tool in addressing water quality \nissues, particularly nonpoint source pollution. There couldn't be a \nbetter time to encourage water utilities, landowners and the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to work together to utilize the conservation \nprograms to protect drinking water source areas.\n  Farmers are great caretakers of our land. I am encouraged that we \nhave given them greater resources with which to preserve our open \nspace, protect our rivers and streams, and sustain the vitality of our \nrural communities and economies. I support the Senate's emphasis on \nconservation in this farm bill and believe that it will provide an \nimportant foundation for promoting sound environmental practices in \nagriculture.\n  I am also delighted that this farm bill authorizes such sums as \nnecessary for the Office of Rural Development of USDA to establish a \nnational historic barn preservation program. This provision allows \nfarmers to receive funds administered through States and non-profit \norganizations to bring older barns into productive use, or make \nnecessary investments in functioning facilities to prevent them from \nfalling beyond repair. I strongly urge my colleagues to appropriate the \nSenate authorization level of $25 million that was included in the \nSenate farm bill.\n  In my home State of Vermont, the State Historic Preservation Office \ncurrently administers a small-grant program for barn preservation that \nhas been funded by the Vermont Legislature since 1993. While this \nprogram has been very successful, applications continue to \nsignificantly outnumber the grants made through this program. Federal \nfunding through the new national historic barn preservation program \nwill help address the growing backlog of requests for barn preservation \ngrants in Vermont and across the country.\n  Historic barns are some of America's greatest national treasures, \nsymbolizing the agricultural foundations upon which our Nation was \nbuilt. Preserving these barns will not only ensure their survival for \ngenerations to come, but will also provide practical benefits to \nfarmers, and the communities and economies that surround them.\n  Finally, I would like to commend the Senate Conferees for their \nefforts on the nutrition title of the farm bill. Although the \nconference report includes less funding than was originally included in \nthe Senate bill, conferees fought to include $6.4 billion over 10 years \nfor nutrition programs. This title includes several provisions that \nwill improve and enhance the food stamp program. Although there was \nresistance in the House, I am pleased that the restoration of food \nstamp benefits to legal immigrants was included in the final bill. The \nbenefits that were taken away from immigrants in the 1996 Welfare bill \nhave finally been returned to immigrants that have been in the United \nStates for 5 years.\n  Other important modifications to the food stamp program serve to \nextend transitional benefits to those leaving welfare and allow States \nto better align food stamp regulations with other public programs such \nas TANF and Medicaid. These provisions strengthen the existing food \nstamp program and extend eligibility to those in need of assistance.\n  In closing, I would like to praise the Conferees for their vision in \ncrafting this Conference Report. I believe this legislation takes a \nstep in the right direction in improving the regional equity of \nAmerica's farm policy. It is only fair that we work to help all of our \nfarmers receive a fair price for their product regardless of size, \nregion or commodity. I know that my farmers in Vermont work as hard as \nany in the Nation, and because of that they deserve the same protection \nagainst the volatile markets that others share. I'm pleased that this \nbill provides them with this protection.\n  Finally, I would like to commend Majority Leader Daschle and \nAssistant Majority Leader Reid for their leadership in getting a \ncontentious bill through the Senate, and for seeing the farm bill \nthrough to final passage. Majority Leader Daschle was instrumental in \nthis effort, and I am personally most grateful.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 6 years ago, Congress passed a farm bill \nthat simply did not work for farmers in Washington State.\n  It destroyed the safety net for Washington State wheat growers and \ndid little for other farmers and ranchers in my State. Congress was \nforced to respond with four consecutive years of emergency payments.\n  The farm bill before us is not intended to guarantee any Washington \nfarmer a profit. It simply guarantees what it should guarantee: A \nsafety net for our commodity producers when prices are low. That is a \nfair approach and one I believe the nation can and must support to \nensure our long-term food security.\n  I support this bill because it is a victory for our farmers and \nranchers, the working poor and seniors, rural communities, and the \nenvironment.\n  However, this new farm bill is not a perfect one for Washington \nState. The final bill strikes some provisions that I believe in very \nstrongly, and it makes new policy choices that do not work for my \nState's producers.\n  The Senate farm bill would have expanded Washington State exports by \nlifting the restriction that prohibits private financing of sales of \nfood and medicine to Cuba. Unfortunately, the House leadership remains \ncommitted to an irrational, lose-lose policy toward Cuba. As a result, \nthe Senate amendment died in conference.\n  The House leadership was also responsible for defeating an amendment \nby Senator Baucus to provide emergency assistance to farmers and \nranchers hurt by drought and other natural disasters. Farmers and \nranchers throughout the West deserved better on this issue.\n  I want to say how disappointed I am with the direction this bill \ntakes on dairy policy. On many fronts, from exports to conservation, \nthe bill will help all dairy producers. Unfortunately, the new dairy \nmarket loss payments strongly discriminate against West Coast dairy \nfarmers. We had an opportunity to craft a dairy policy that worked for \nall producers nationwide. Instead, Congress again chose to create \nregional winners and losers.\n  The Senate farm bill included my amendment to promote better \ncooperation between Native American tribes and the U.S. Forest Service. \nIt also included an amendment sponsored by Senator Cantwell that would \nrequire the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \ninvestigate any future deaths of forest firefighters in the line of \nduty. The House refused to adopt these common-sense amendments.\n  Finally, the Senate farm bill included my amendment that would allow \ncommunities to develop plans to bring high-speed access to rural areas. \nUnfortunately, the House conferees refused to accept it, and it is not \nincluded in the final bill.\n  I look forward to working to pass my legislation to promote rural \nbroadband development and to promote a stronger relationship between \ntribes and the Forest Service. I also look forward to\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\nrevisting the other issues I mentioned above in future legislation.\n  While I am disappointed with a number of decisions made by the \nconference committee, this new farm bill includes many of the \npriorities I identified prior to the debate.\n  I am very pleased the farm bill restores food stamps for legal \nimmigrants who have been in the United States for five years, and it \nrestores food stamps for all children and disabled individuals \nregardless of how long they have been in the United States. The legal \nimmigrant provision is the centerpiece of a new $6.4 billion investment \nin better nutrition policy. The bill will also streamline the Food \nStamp Program and rationalize the quality control system.\n  The conference bill helps Washington state recover salmon and improve \nconservation practices. The $17.1 billion in new conservation spending \nover the next ten years will promote water conservation, help dairy \nproducers, ranchers, and farmers protect water quality and save \nfarmland and open space from development through an expanded Farmland \nProtection Program.\n  The bill enhances economic development in rural communities by \nproviding $100 million in loans and loan guarantees to establish high-\nspeed, high-quality broadband service. The bill also makes an important \nattempt to reduce the backlog of water and wastewater projects in rural \nareas.\n  This new farm bill strengthens our Nation's energy security by \ninvesting $405 million in renewable energy and biodiesel development. \nThe Senate bill included the first energy title ever included in a farm \nbill. Given the uncertain future of the energy bill passed by the \nSenate, I am pleased this section survived the conference negotiations.\n  With respect to an issue I have worked for three years on, the farm \nbill sustains struggling apple growers through $94 million in direct \nassistance. With Senator Cantwell, I fought hard to include this \nfunding, and I want to thank Senators Daschle and Harkin for their work \nin protecting this vital assistance in conference.\n  The conference bill establishes a new safety net program for many \neastern Washington farmers by creating marketing loans and loan \ndeficiency payments for producers of dry peas, lentils, and small \nchickpeas. I was an early cosponsor of similar Senate legislation. \nPeas, lentils, and chickpeas are important rotational crops for our \nwheat growers, and they help to break disease cycles.\n  The bill increases the Market Access Program to $200 million by 2006. \nIn 1999, and again in 2001, I introduce legislation to enhance our \nagricultural trade promotion programs. The final bill supports my \nefforts to open and expand overseas markets for U.S. farm products.\n  The farm bill mandates country-of-origin labeling for meat and fish, \nand fruits and vegetables. I believe this is a great idea for farmers \nand ranchers, but also for consumers. However, it is my understanding \nthe conference report would not allow fish caught by U.S. fishermen in \ninternational waters to be labeled as produced in the United States. \nThat is a concern to fishermen in my state who fish in international \nwaters.\n  In another win-win situation for farmers and consumers, the final \nbill increases purchases of fruits and vegetables for federal feeding \nprograms. That means better nutrition for our young people and a larger \nmarket for our fruit and vegetable growers.\n  Finally, I want to mention an amendment I authored that was included \nin the Senate bill and the final bill. My amendment authorizes \nemergency assistance for farmworkers when natural disasters strike. \nWhile Congress has often been slow to provide natural disaster \nassistance to farmers and ranchers, it has rarely provided meaningful \nassistance to farmworkers. We should not ignore these workers when \ndisaster strikes.\n  Implementing this farm bill will not be easy and there will be \nchallenges along the way. I look forward to working with my farmer, \nranchers, and rural communities to ensure that we implement this bill \nquickly and fairly.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to support the 2002 farm bill \nconference report because it is good for Oregon producers at home and \nin the world market.\n  Agriculture in Oregon is a $3.5 billion business. There are 40,000 \nfarms in Oregon, totaling over 17 million acres. The average farm size \nis 430 acres, with a stunning variety of crops, made up of 10,000 plus \nwheat farms in the eastern part of the State to 100 acre vineyards in \nthe western part of the State.\n  Overall, the Oregon Farm Bureau supports this farm bill. Oregon wheat \nand barley growers are anxious to see the workings of the new loan \nrates and market transition payments. They are also pleased to hear \nthat all changes are in effect for the 2002 crop.\n  Oregon dairy producers tell me the compromise that maintains a \npermanent $9.90 milk price support program will help them in the long \nterm, whereas the establishment of a 3.5 year National Dairy Program to \nprovide assistance to all U.S. dairy producers will help them in the \nshort term.\n  Oregon's wool producers are pleased that the conference report \nprovides marketing loans or loan deficiency payments to them based on a \nloan rate of $1 per pound for graded wool and $.40 per pound for non-\ngraded wool.\n  This conference report also provides $94 million, nationally, for \napple producers who have suffered low market prices.\n  But those are just specific examples of how this conference report \nwill be good for Oregon producers. In a more general sense, this \nconference is good for Oregon's specialty crop producers in the \nfollowing ways: specialty crop purchases for section 32 requiring not \nless than $200 million for fruits and vegetables. At least $50 million \nof that amount is for schools through the DoD Fresh Program; MAP \nfunds--$650 million over the life of the bill, hitting the authorized \nceiling of $200 million in the fifth year; Technical Assistance for \nSpecialty Crops provides $19 million for exporter assistance to address \nbarriers that restrict US specialty crop exports; $400 million for food \nassistance of which some is destined for specialty crop purchases; in \naddition, increased funds for school lunch programs, the WIC program, \nand the Seniors Farmers Market program, of which Oregon is one of the \npilot States; and, Country of Origin Labeling for fresh meats, fruits, \nvegetables and fish will help Oregon's producers.\n  In addition, while some environmental organizations are not pleased \nby the increases provided in the conservation title of this conference \nreport, Oregon farmers will benefit overall from the 80 percent \nincrease in conservation programs. Specifically, $50 million is \nprovided for the Klamath Basin under a new Water Conservation Program \nthat provides cost-share incentives and assistance for efforts to \nconserve ground and surface water.\n  The nutrition title is supported by Oregonians who strongly \nsupported, and were successful in maintaining, the provision that \nreinstates food stamp benefits for legal immigrants. Oregonians will \nbenefit from simplifications to the TANF and food stamp programs.\n  Oregonians will also benefit from the $1.03 billion Rural Development \ntitle that will, in addition to other new and improved rural \ndevelopment programs, make $100 million available nationally to allow \nrural consumers to receive high-speed, high-quality broadband service. \nIt also provides $50 million for the Rural Firefighters and Emergency \nPersonnel Grant Program which will help as rural Oregon communities \nface increasing fire danger from public lands.\n  For years I have supported increased funding for agricultural \nresearch. Research dollars have been important to Oregon agriculture \nbecause they enable Oregon agriculture to be competitive in the world \nmarkets. This title increases funding from $120 million/year to $200 \nmillion/year in fiscal year 2006.\n  This conference report contains a new $100 million cost share program \nto assist private non-industrial forest land owners in adopting \nsustainable forest management practices. It also authorizes research \npilot programs in carbon sequestration for agriculture producers and \nforest land owners. Both of these programs will be available to \nOregonians, regarded as leaders in these areas.\n  There are additional programs in this conference report that will \nbenefit Oregonians that I have not specifically mentioned. However, the \nreal work will begin when the President signs this conference report \ninto law, as he has\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\nindicated he will do. We will start the arduous process of \nimplementation. I will be there, with my Senate and House colleagues, \nas that process moves forward to make sure the intent and spirit of \nthis law is adhered to: to encourage environmentally sound, \neconomically stable agriculture.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the farm security and rural development \nact of 2002 contains two important provisions for the protection and \nrevitalization of Alaska's wild salmon industry. One is country of \norigin labeling and whether the fish is farm raised or wild caught and \nthe other, a report on efforts to promote and use pouched and canned \nsalmon within the food and nutrition programs of the Agriculture \nDepartment.\n  Last year, Chilean pen-raised, farm salmon was purposefully delivered \nthe same time as Alaskan fishermen brought their salmon to market. It \nwas and is the intent of Chile to devastate and erase the Alaskan wild-\nsalmon market. Canada, Norway and China are increasing their farmed \nsalmon capabilities and are flooding the U.S. market with pen-raised, \npellet-fed, and chemically-enhanced salmon. In fact, dye is injected \ninto the flesh of pen-raised salmon in order to obtain the orange and \nreddish salmon color that occurs naturally in wild salmon, which are \nborn in fresh water streams, then travel out to the deep ocean and back \nagain to the same stream to spawn.\n  The conference committee report includes a provision that will \nrequire any retail seafood product in the United States to be labeled \nat the time of sale with its country of origin and whether the fish is \nwild-caught or farm-raised. This will help consumers make informed \ndecisions about the seafood they put on their dinner tables. Alaskans \nknow that wild fish from our waters are healthier and better tasting \nthen farmed fish from overseas. This provision will allow the rest of \nAmerica to make a more informed choice between pen-raised and wild \nsalmon and learn about all the benefits of Alaskan seafood.\n  The conference committee also retained an amendment which calls on \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to report to Congress on efforts to expand \nthe promotion, marketing, and purchase of U.S. pouched and canned \nsalmon within the food and nutrition programs of the Agriculture \nDepartment. It is imperative to the short term success of Alaska's \nsalmon industry to move existing inventories of pouched and canned \nsalmon. The farm bill does a great deal to insure the commodities \nmarkets for southern and midwestern farmers, and these provisions will \nbegin to provide some assistance and much needed protections for \nAmerica's fishermen, the farmers of the sea.\n  An amendment that did not remain in the conference committee report, \nbut is absolutely necessary considering how pen-raised salmon are \naltered and chemically developed, is the eligibility of wild seafood \nfor an organic product promotion effort. This amendment by my good \nfriend and colleague Frank Murkowski, would have directed the Secretary \nof Agriculture to incorporate wild seafood into the organic labeling \nprogram. Wild salmon that go out into the oceans and feed in their \nnatural habitat are by definition organic and completely natural, void \nof hormones or other chemicals and are undeniably deserving of the \n``organic'' label.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Senator Harkin \nfor his hard work in bringing this farm bill together. As Chairman \nHarkin said yesterday, this conference report is not anyone's idea of \nperfection. It's not the bill Senator Harkin passed in the Senate, nor \nis it, I think it's fair to say, the bill that Senator Harkin or any of \nus might have written were legislation written to match an ideal \nstandard. But the legislation before us today is a product of hard work \nand tough negotiating, and U.S. Senators are only afforded the \nopportunity to vote on what's before us, to make a judgment about \nwhether we're going to provide relief and support to farmers in \nMassachusetts and nationwide in need of relief today, or whether we're \ngoing to vote it down and hope for an ideal farm bill the legislative \nprocess itself has proven will not be forthcoming.\n  Given that choice, I will support this farm bill--I will support it \nbecause it will meet needs in Massachusetts and all around the country \nthat are absolutely critical and which we cannot afford to leave unmet.\n  This legislation includes record amounts of funding for land and \nwater conservation programs, nutrition spending and reestablishing a \ndairy program that keeps small dairy farmers in business. This bill \nincreases spending for land and water conservation programs by $17 \nbillion an 80 percent increase. This funding allows producers to \nqualify for assistance if they voluntarily incorporate conservation \npractices on their lands. In addition the bill provides $1 billion for \nthe Farmland Protection Program, which provides for protection around \nurban areas and prevents sprawl. Massachusetts has a model program for \nprotecting farmland and this funding will only allow us to preserve and \nprotect more farmland in the Commonwealth.\n  Nutrition and food programs under this bill total $6.4 billion. Like \nmost of us I would have preferred the Senate number, however as we all \nknow compromises have to be made in large bills such as this. We all \nshould be proud of the fact that this bill restores benefits to legal \nimmigrant adults who have lived in the United States for at least 5 \nyears. This bill also restores benefits to children and the disabled \nwithout a 5-year waiting period. The bill will also provide benefits \nfor working families moving from welfare to work.\n  The dairy provision in the bill is very important to Massachusetts as \nwell. I wish to thank Senator Leahy for all of his work in this area. \nHe has crafted a compromise that allows small dairy farmers in the \nNortheast to compete with larger producers in the Midwest. I am \nespecially grateful that the dairy provisions are retroactive to \nDecember 1, 2001 so that these small diary farmers who have been \nseverely impacted by the expiration of the old Northeast Dairy Compact, \nin October of last year, can now look forward to much needed help as \nthey struggle to survive. This is yet another way that we can protect \nopen space and prevent urban sprawl by giving these small dairy farmers \na helping hand.\n  This bill contains an authorization for a $10 million buyback of \ngroundfish permits in New England. I strongly believe that we need to \nhelp family fishermen just like we lend a hand to farmers. The \nfishermen in New England are reeling from a recent court decision that \nhas reduced their ability to fish by a minimum of 20 percent and in \nsome cases by 75 percent. These fishermen are going to need some help \nand I intend to work with my colleagues to get these fishermen some \nassistance so that they can retire with dignity and seek opportunities \nelsewhere.\n  As I stated earlier, this is not a perfect piece of legislation. I am \ndisappointed that the bill does not contain the strong payment \nlimitations that were contained in the Senate bill nor does this \nconference report prohibit meat packers from owning livestock. I \nsupported both of these amendments when we debated this bill in the \nSenate and I believe that both of these provisions would go along way \nto protecting rural America and small family owned farms. I wish to go \non record as saying that I will work with my colleagues Senators \nJohnson and Wellstone to have these measures enacted in the future.\n  I remain very concerned about a flaw of this legislation, one which I \nknow many Democrats worked very hard to avoid but which remains a \nserious problem in this bill. Without meaningful payment limitations we \nrun the risk that large, powerful, corporate farms will continue to \ngobble up America's small, family-owned, environmentally responsible \nfarmers. We cannot allow this to happen. This bill should protect rural \nAmerica rather than subsidize another round of corporate giveaways that \nput at risk our environment, endanger the livelihood of family farmers, \nand lavish hard earned taxpayer money on corporations that need it the \nleast. By that measure, this farm bill is a far cry from what our \nfamily farms need the most, and I would respectfully suggest that in \nthe future we consider a whole host of efforts that do better than this \nbill does today.\n  We all should remain concerned about the cost of this legislation as \nwell. The bill will increase the cost of Federal agricultural programs \nby $45 billion over the next 6 years and $73.5 billion over the next 10 \nyears. With our\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\ncountry at war against terrorism and our economy still not recovered we \nshould all be concerned about the deficits that this country could \npotentially face.\n  Lastly, the conference report contains a number of animal protection \nprovisions that I do not support. Particularly troubling were the \nprovisions on animal fighting and downed animal protection that were \nnearly identical in both bills and yet the conference report contains a \nweakened provision. I strongly believe we should revisit these issues \nat the earliest possible time.\n  In summary, this bill is not perfect, but it is the choice before us, \nand in the Senate this year I see no better choices being offered. And \nwhile I think it's critical that we do better in the future, that we \nstrike a better balance, I do not believe it would be in the best \ninterests of our nation to deny family farmers and America's small \nfarms the lifeline they so desperately need today.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the conference \nreport for H.R. 2646, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002, FSRIA Act. This is the eleventh farm bill since the Congress \nenacted the Agricultural Act of 1949, the last permanent farm \nlegislation, and the first farm bill of the 21st century.\n  The previous farm bill, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \nReform Act of 1996, the FAIR Act, contained at least three favorable \nobjectives--to instill market discipline upon U.S. agriculture, to \nfoster agriculture exports, and to eliminate Government-mandated \nplanting requirements. That legislation represented the most radical \nchange in farm policy since the inception of Federal farm programs in \nthe 1930s, and in my view was a step in the right direction.\n  I would have preferred a farm bill which would assist family farmers \nin becoming more efficient and more productive, thereby becoming more \ncompetitive. Instead of strengthening market oriented agricultural \nsector, I am concerned this bill will make farmers more dependent upon \ngovernment subsidies.\n  Our farm policy should promote the strength and ability of American \nagriculture to produce more and safer food and fiber with fewer \nchemical inputs. The United States has a competitive advantage in the \nproduction of many crops and most kinds of livestock. However, American \nfarmers and ranchers are plagued by low prices. While this bill \nattempts to deal with low farm gate prices, it does not address the \nfact that U.S. agricultural producers sell in a world market where low \nprices are the norm. A U.S. agricultural policy that results in \nAmerican food and fiber products being produced at higher than world \nprices does no good for American farm families.\n  I am very concerned about the regional bias in this bill. Southern \ncotton, rice, and peanut farmers, particularly large family farms State \nwill be adversely affected by the payment limitations. These large \nfarms are some how construed to be corporate farms when, in fact, most \nare family farms. Also, I am not satisfied that our peanut farmers are \nbeing treated fairly. This bill ends the peanut quota program, the last \nof the old style farm quota programs, and enacts a peanut marketing \nloan program, affecting both farmers and rural communities. We should \nhave a farm bill that treats all farmers equally, that allows them to \nbe competitive, and that continues to provide the American consumer \nwith wholesome, good quality food and fiber.\n  I note that this bill authorizes considerable spending for \nconservation. There is nothing more important to agriculture than \nconservation. In South Carolina, it is said that if you do not take \ncare of your land it will not take care of you. It is encouraging that \nsuccessful programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentive Program \nare strengthened in this bill. However, I question the addition of \nprograms, which in my State could lead to land being taken out of \nagricultural production. Once taken out of agriculture, the land rarely \nreturns to the farm and that increases the demand for land thereby \nraising the price of land or the land rental.\n  I am disappointed the FSRIA Act does not do enough to strengthen our \nagricultural research assets including our land-grant university system \nand the Agricultural Research Service. The research done by these \ninstitutions and agency have materially added to the competitiveness \nand productivity of American agriculture. They should be cultivated and \ngiven the funding they need to continue their outstanding research. \nEmphasis should be directed at ensuring these results are translated \ninto practical measures that can be used by the food and fiber sector \nof our economy. More could also have been done to help beginning \nfarmers. However, no piece of legislation is perfect.\n  I thank the conferees for retaining my amendment regarding farm \nreconstitutions in the conference report. As I said in prior statements \nI made earlier this year, the Department of Agriculture could have \nhandled the problem itself without legislation. Flue-cured tobacco \nproducers and quota owners in the Carolinas and Virginia will be better \noff with this amendment. This amendment will allow flue-cured tobacco \nallotments and quotas to continue to be transferred through the process \nof farm reconstitutions.\n  Despite my concerns regarding the shortcomings of this bill, I will \nvote in favor of the conference report. Throughout my long career in \npublic service, I have fought for the farmers of my State. This bill \nwill provide farmers with financial resources to improve their \nefficiency and productivity.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, since Congress passed the 1996 farm bill, \nfarmers throughout America have been pointing out the holes in the farm \nsafety net that was intended to help family farmers and prevent the \ndemise of America's agriculture industry. The new farm bill, The Farm \nSecurity and Rural Investment Act of 2002, authorizes a wide variety of \nU.S. Department of Agriculture programs and strengthens the safety net \nfor America's farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.\n  This farm bill, not unlike other authorizing bills that have moved \nthrough the Congress in recent years, approves, in one broad stroke, \nhuge amounts of spending on the mandatory side of the budget. Without \nadequate controls and without the political will to make tough \ndecisions, mandatory spending has been annually eating up greater \nportions of the nation's budgetary resources.\n  That is not to say that there are not a number of worthwhile, and \nnecessary, provisions in this bill. Certainly we do not wish to see our \nagricultural industry go the way of others that have drifted overseas, \nwhere costs are lower and health and safety precautions are weak or \nnonexistent. Moreover, at a time when we are becoming more attuned to \nthe real threats of bioterrorism and agroterrorism, our farming \nindustry and the need to preserve it can be seen in a new and different \nlight. But Senators need to be more aware of the fact that voting for \nauthorizing legislation is not just supporting policy. It is advocating \nspending, often uncontrolled mandatory spending, that has a real effect \non our national budget. It also meets expectations for additional \ndiscretionary spending by authorizing new and expanded discretionary \nprograms. I hope that Senators will remember that later this year when \nwe debate the overall discretionary spending levels.\n  I am disappointed about a few items that are not included in this \nfarm bill. For example, I had hoped that this bill would include \nfunding for livestock producers who are suffering from drought \nconditions that we know are going to worsen. Previous farm bills had \nprovided this sort of assistance, and I wish that this one had. On the \npositive side, this bill provides funding for a number of programs \nimportant to America's family farmers and rural communities. It, as \nwell, makes important repairs to the farm safety net. But, \nunfortunately, the conference report also allows significant holes to \nremain when it comes to the humane treatment of animals.\n  Procedurally, it is discouraging that certain provisions to protect \nanimals included in both the House-and Senate-passed versions of H.R. \n2646 were eliminated or weakened during conference committee action. \nFor example, both the House and the Senate versions included an \nidentical provision to prohibit the interstate transport of animals for \nthe purpose of fighting, but this language was weakened during \nconference. At the same time, a provision included only in the Senate\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\nversion of the bill that would permanently limit the scope of Animal \nWelfare Act protections--the so-called birds, rats, and mice \nprohibitions--was retained during conference.\n  The conference report, however, also eliminates the Senate-passed \nprovisions that would have improved the standards of care and treatment \nfor certain puppies intended for sale as pets. It is unfortunate and \ndisappointing that the conference committee made these decision. \nClearly, there is still so much more to do to promote the humane \ntreatment of animals. Animals cannot vote, and cannot write or call to \nvoice their concerns, but they do have many advocates, and I count \nmyself as one of them.\n  While the farm bill conference report is deficient in its protections \nfor animals, the bill includes provisions that will greatly help family \nfarmers and rural communities in West Virginia, and throughout the \nnation.\n  By providing $17.1 billion for conservation activities, for example, \nthe bill will help farmers in their efforts to be good stewards of \ntheir land, even while they continue to cultivate crops. Farmers from \nmany states, including West Virginia, will also benefit from the \nexpansion of assistance for producers who grow non-commodity crops--\ncrops like apples, peaches, and many types of vegetables. In addition, \ndairy farmers can look forward to counter-cyclical payments that will \nprovide more assistance when prices are low.\n  The new farm bill will also make a significant investment in rural \ncommunities. The Rural Development programs authorized in this bill \nwill help rural communities invest in the kind of basic infrastructure \nnecessary for economic development. Most notable is the $360 million \nprovided to fund the backlog of applications for water and wastewater \ndevelopment projects.\n  Although I am disappointed with the limited protections for animals \nincluded in the new farm bill, overall, The Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act of 2002 conference report is a compromise I shall \nsupport.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, many Senators have not had the time to \ndigest the many pages of the conference report and final legislative \nlanguage of the nutrition title. I would like to take this opportunity \nto provide some detail on the provisions so that Senators will have a \nfull understanding of what we have achieved in their conference report.\n  When we set out to re-authorize the food stamp program our goals were \nto improve benefits for the neediest families and to simplify the food \nstamp program, making it easier for States to administer and to remove \nobstacles for working poor families. We wanted to strengthen the \nprogram and ensure that eligible needy families can participate in this \ncritical nutrition and work support program.\n  We have taken significant steps to improve benefits for households \nwith children by improving and reforming the standard deduction. \nCurrently, all households, regardless of their size, receive the same \n$134 standard deduction from their income before food stamp benefits \nare calculated. This approach effectively limits benefits for larger \nhouseholds, which typically include children. The legislation solves \nthis problem by making the deduction more responsive to household size. \nNow, all households will receive a standard deduction set at 8.31 \npercent of that year's poverty line. Another aspect of this change is \nthat the standard deduction will be indexed for inflation each year. \nIndexing the standard deduction will help maintain the food purchasing \npower of food stamp benefits over time. This provision will take effect \nwith all of the other annual adjustments in the food stamp program's \nbenefit structure. Some States apparently are concerned that this will \nbe a difficult deadline to meet. USDA should take a pragmatic approach \ntoward those States that are working in good faith to implement the \nprovision in a timely manner, but who may miss the deadline.\n  One of the most significant benefit improvements included in the \nnutrition title is restoring food stamp eligibility to legal \nimmigrants. The Senate passed food stamp restorations for legal \nimmigrants with overwhelming support. It is gratifying to see the \nmajority of the Senate proposal in the final package. The bill restores \neligibility to three groups of legal immigrants. First, it restores \neligibility to qualified low-income legal immigrant children regardless \nof their entry date into the United States. Second, it makes qualified \nlegal immigrant adults who have lived in the United States for 5 or \nmore years with that status eligible. Finally, the legislation allows \nlegal immigrants receiving benefits under specified disability-based \nprograms to qualify for food stamps.\n  Children who are made eligible under this provision are exempt from \nsponsor deeming, although adult sponsored immigrants are still subject \nto sponsor deeming rules. The policy USDA implemented last year on \ndeeming represents a reasonable and balanced approach to providing food \nstamps to low-income families in need, while still ensuring that \nsponsors remain responsible for immigrants that they bring into this \ncountry. USDA should maintain this policy.\n  Immigrants frequently live with their sponsors. Over the years, \nCongress has consistently rejected proposals to require food stamp \nrecipients to repay properly issued food stamp benefits. That principle \nis not incompatible with sponsor liability. Low income immigrants may \nbe deterred from participation if they believe that their family \nmembers may be sent a bill if they participate in the food stamp \nprogram. We do not intend for low-income sponsors who are a part of the \nfood stamp household or family unit to incur a liability as a result of \ntheir family's or household member's participation in the food stamp \nprogram.\n  The broad restoration for adults will bring food stamp rules into \nconformity with Medicaid and TANF immigrant eligibility rules for \nrecent immigrants. Now, under all three programs, an adult becomes \neligible for benefits 5 years after obtaining a qualified status. The 5 \nyear waiting period begins when the immigrant gains qualified status \nregardless of what type of immigrant status he or she had prior to that \npoint. This alignment should make it much easier for immigrants to \nunderstand the immigrant eligibility rules in the three programs and \nfor States to administer them.\n  Since 1996, the proportion of food stamp recipients who work has \nincreased dramatically and the proportion who receive welfare has \nplummeted. Food stamps is no longer a mere adjunct to cash welfare \nprograms. It is a work support program and a nutritional safety net for \na wide spectrum of low-income people. Paperwork and administrative \nrequirements that might have been appropriate when food stamps were a \nsupplement to welfare have become unnecessary barriers to meeting the \nnutritional needs of more diverse eligible low-income households.\n  Although some States have shortened their applications, current rules \nrequire information on too many obscure types of income and resources, \neven though few households have these items. This approach is the \nresult of a policy that seeks to cast a very wide net in collecting \ninformation about households' incomes and resources. A solution to this \nproblem is to narrow the applications' scope to those relatively few \ntypes of income and resources that would make a significant difference \nin the food purchasing power of applicants.\n  Sections 4102 and 4107 of the bill allow states to conform their \ndefinition of income and resources in the food stamp program to \ndefinition in their TANF and Medicaid programs. Each section lists \nmajor items that fairness requires to be counted. USDA will have the \nauthority to add to the list of items states cannot exclude. Since we \nworked closely with USDA in crafting the statutory list, the Department \nshould not have reason to exercise that authority in the absence of \nunforeseen circumstances. In addition, the legislation does not require \nstates to wait for new regulations before simplifying their programs.\n  States now have the option of semi-annual reporting in the \nDepartment's current regulations. This bill allows States to extend \nsemi-annual reporting to the vast majority of the food stamp caseload. \nStates will be able to conform their food stamp reporting rules more \nclosely to those of Medicaid and other work support programs.\n  Separate rules and requirements for each program burden both families \nand\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\nstate administrators. Joint guidance or regulations from USDA and HHS \ncan make a real difference. Families should be able to comply with both \nprograms' requirements by completing a single report. An eligible \nfamily should not put its food stamps at risk by complying with \nMedicaid reporting requirements. The Department should ensure that this \nno longer happens.\n\n  The same procedural protections the Department has long applied to \nmonthly reporting are just as appropriate for any other system of \nperiodic reporting. Just as a household that files a late or incomplete \nmonthly report needs a second chance, so too does a family having \ntrouble with a quarterly or monthly report. In addition, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and rules for individuals with limited English \nproficiency would apply equally no matter what period is covered by the \nreport.\n  USDA should further reduce reporting burdens for the elderly and \npersons with disabilities using the broad regulatory authority it used \nin late 2000 to reduce burdens for many types of households.\n  To reduce the number of reports required of households, the \nconference report provides states the option to freeze households' \ndeductions between eligibility reviews with two limited exceptions. \nFirst, if the household reports that it has moved, the food stamp \noffice will have to provide the household a shelter deduction based on \nits new circumstances. Second, whenever the Department's regulations \nrequire the food stamp office to act on a change in earned income, it \nwill have to apply the 20 percent earned income deduction to the new \namount. Any household that believes this freeze is causing it a \nhardship may reapply and have its benefits recalculated without waiting \nfor the next scheduled review of its eligibility. States may imple- \nment this change as soon as it becomes effective. Significant new \nregulations from USDA in this area are not expected.\n  The conference report does not include a Senate provision that would \nhave replaced the current food stamp re-certification process with a \nre-determination process. In years past, the rigidity of certification \nperiods was a serious problem, but USDA has taken steps in recent years \nto introduce flexibility and allow certification periods to be extended \nsimply and easily. The allowance of transitional food stamp benefits, \nboth as they exist today under USDA regulations and as expanded in this \nlegislation, further reduces the need for fixed certification periods.\n  Families leaving welfare can face particular difficulties with the \nfood stamp program's current procedural requirements. Recent studies \nhave shown that as many as 60 percent of families leaving cash \nassistance do not continue to receive food stamps even though almost \nall are still eligible.\n  To ensure a much smoother transition from cash assistance to work, \nthis legislation provides States with a new option to provide up to 5 \nmonths of transitional food stamps to families leaving cash assistance. \nSince virtually all of these families are already eligible for food \nstamps, the goal of the program is to eliminate any unnecessary \nadministrative hurdles that families or States might face. When a \nhousehold leaves the State's cash assistance program, the state will \nsimply subtract the cash benefit from the family's income and \nrecalculate food stamp benefits. There will be no contact between the \nState and the household and no procedural requirement on the household. \nThis transitional benefit amount will be the correct food stamp benefit \nfor all purposes. The benefit will essentially be frozen for the next 5 \nmonths, except that States will have to update the benefit to reflect \nany general changes in food stamp benefit amount such as an increase in \nthe thrifty food plan.\n  States may also elect to adjust the transitional benefit if they \nbecome aware of changes in the household's circumstances. For example, \nif a mother reports the birth of a child to the Medicaid program, the \nState can elect to increase the food stamp allotment to reflect the new \nchild. In addition, the household retains the right to reapply to have \nits food stamps recalculated based on current circumstances. This is \nespecially important in cases where the wage-earner in the family loses \na job.\n  Families that pay or receive child support can have special \ndifficulty under current rules. These payments may fluctuate for any \nnumber of reasons. Keeping track of them can be difficult for both the \nfood stamp office and the household. In addition to established \nregulations, USDA circulated some useful guidance on this subject last \nyear and may want to do more.\n  Many States do not have computers in their child support enforcement \nagencies that can communicate effectively with the systems that \ncalculate food stamps. The bill requires USDA to establish simplified \nsystems for using data from child support agencies even if it is a few \nmonths older than most information used to calculate food stamp \nbenefits. Unless a household submits more current information, the \nState would use what it has. This legislation only addresses families \nthat pay child support. A State should not rely upon State data about \nchild support a family receives unless, under the income anticipation \nrules, it is reasonably certain that the family will continue to \nreceive those amounts.\n  Although the focus of the bill is on procedural simplifications, we \ndid simplify the program's benefit calculation rules in some respects. \nSimplification is not intended to be applied in ways that would reduce \nbenefits. New rules for estimating households' utility costs in this \nbill will allow States to elect to allow use of a flat, standardized \namount used to calculate the shelter deduction for families with \nutility bills other than telephone. States do not have to inquire \nfurther into the family's living arrangements. This simplification as \nlong as USDA and states ensure that these standardized estimates keep \npace with increases in utility costs. States do not have to inquire \nfurther into the family's living arrangements. This simplification will \nnot reduce benefits as long as USDA and states ensure that these \nstandardized estimates keep pace with increases in utility costs.\n  The Senate bill included a simplification in the procedures states \nuse to convert weekly and biweekly earnings into monthly income. \nHowever, the Department's current regulations already allow states to \ndo that if they follow these same conversion procedures in TANF. \nAccordingly, the legislative provision was not adopted, but USDA should \nencourage more states to take this regulatory option.\n  The other simplification we made in the food stamp benefit structure \ninvolves people who live in institutions and are unable to manage their \nown food stamps. This will primarily involve people who are recovering \nfrom substance abuse problems and some people with severe disabilities. \nAlthough these procedures can apply to homeless people or to women \nliving in shelters for victims of domestic violence, we expect many \npeople in those facilities will choose to retain their own food stamp \nbenefits because of their relatively brief stays or because they need \nto obtain some of their meals outside the shelter. Where, however, the \nrecipient consents or is incapable of managing his or her own affairs, \nthis provision will allow the benefit to be calculated under a \nstandardized formula that will not require the institution to gather a \ngreat deal of detail about the circumstances of each resident. USDA's \ncurrent rules that define an institution as a facility consistently \nproviding more than half of a recipient's meals will continue to apply \nand limit this provision's scope. We also included safeguards to ensure \nthat persons leaving centers in mid-month will receive their fair share \nof benefits for the remainder of the month and will get help from both \nthe center and the food stamp office to re-enter the regular food stamp \nprogram.\n\n  Many States have been operating EBT for some time now and have a \ngreat deal of experience. This legislation requires USDA to issue a \nreport on the current status of EBT. It requires USDA to provide a wide \narray of information on how systems are operating, including issues \nwith contract renewals and client access. The report will include \nvaluable information about how states ensure that claimants have full \naccess to their food stamps within EBT systems and on how they ensure \nthat EBT complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \nRehabilitation Act.\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\n  The Senate bill included a provision to ensure that households that \nhave accumulated benefits in an electronic system would not have their \nbenefits made inaccessible for some time. Elderly and disabled \nhouseholds who often receive very small food stamp benefits and store \nthem, might otherwise lose food stamp benefits. The Department is \nalready planning to implement this policy via regulation, so the bill \ndoes not include the provision.\n  Reforms to the food stamp quality control system in the bill are \nbased to a great extent on the recommendations of the National Academy \nof Sciences. The current quality control system, for measuring program \nperformance, only focuses on payment accuracy. Under the new system, \npayment accuracy will not override the program's basic goal of \nproviding food assistance to eligible families.\n  Under current law, States with payment error rates in excess of the \nnational average face fiscal sanctions each year. Thus, close to one-\nhalf of the States are in violation each year. The new system focuses \non those states with persistent payment accuracy problems. Only those \nStates which USDA is statistically certain have payment error rates \nabove 105 percent of the national average will be targeted as problem \nStates. When a State exceeds this threshold for 2 consecutive years, \nUSDA will be required to take action and may use any combination of \nthree specific options as its response.\n  First, USDA may require the State to reinvest up to 50 percent of the \nsanction to improve administration of the program. The bill does not \nspecify in what activities States should reinvest, although states may \nuse reinvestment funds to improve program access. States have \ndiscretion to determine what type of reinvestment will most improve its \nprogram. Second, USDA can designate up to 50 percent of state's \npotential liability to be held at risk, but cannot collect sanctions \nduring the year in which they are assessed. The State must pay at risk \namounts from the previous year if the State's error rate is subject to \nsanction in the current year. If the State is not subject to sanction \nin the following year, the amount held at risk is auto- matically \nwaived. Finally, USDA can waive any portion of the sanction amount. \nSanctions that are not reinvested or held at risk must be waived.\n  USDA should consider the causes of the State agency's problems, and \nwhether the State's error rate is declining along with other relevant \nfactors when determining how much of a State's sanction to waive. If a \nState is making progress on reducing its error rate, USDA should \nconsider a waiver of its sanction. As under the current system, States \nmay appeal these decisions. If a State loses an appeal, USDA may \nwithhold funds that have not yet been reinvested pending appeal. The \nDepartment should not use this authority in a way that undermines \nreinvestment plans when a State raises an appeal in good faith.\n  The Senate bill would have adjusted sanctions for States doing a \nparticularly good job of serving low-wage working families or immigrant \nhouseholds. USDA assured the conferees that it would continue its \ncurrent practice of adjusting sanctions to account for enrolling high \nor rising numbers of participants more likely to involve errors, such \nas working poor households. USDA should also continue to adjust for the \nimpact of high numbers of legal immigrant households and, in the \nfuture, to adjust for other factors, as the need arises.\n  The current system will remain in place for fiscal year 2002. USDA \nmay use its authority to waive the fiscal year 2002 sanctions for those \nStates that would not have faced sanctions under the new system. \nSimilarly, it may waive sanction amounts in excess of the new sanction \nformula.\n  The new system begins in fiscal year 2003. No State will be subject \nto paying a sanction until 2005. The administration requested this \ndelayed implementation timetable. USDA must now ensure that this \ndelayed effective date does not undermine the progress states are \ncurrently making toward lowering error rates.\n  The legislation provides $48 million each year for new quality \ncontrol performance bonuses to States. Bonuses will be provided to \nStates with the best or most improved performance relating to \ncorrecting errors, reducing rates of error, and improving eligibility \ndeterminations and other indicators of effective administration \ndetermined by USDA in consultation with the States. Correcting errors \nis crucial. USDA should recognize and reward States that improve their \nstaff training and establish systems that give State administrators \nearly warning when eligibility workers encountering problems. USDA \nshould also consult other program experts such as client advocates, \nresearch organizations and academics.\n  The bonuses should be balanced and reflect many important aspects of \nState administration, in addition to payment accuracy and program \nintegrity. Timeliness and denying benefits only to those applicant \nhouseholds that are truly ineligible, should be a significant portion \nof the bonus calculation.\n\n  Regrettably, the conference agreement does not include the Senate \nprovision to move toward the more reasonable version of the time limit \nfor able-bodied adults without dependents that the Senate passed in \n1995 and again in 1996. Congress should revisit the issue in the near \nfuture, but in the meantime, the administration should continue to do \neverything possible to limit harsh and inequitable effects of this \nprovision.\n  In addition, the bill restructures the employment and training \nfunding to eliminate the requirement that 80 percent of employment and \ntraining funds be set-aside for individuals subject to the time limit, \nalthough it does reserve a small mount of money specifically for that \npopulation. USDA should give this group of people and the States that \nelect to serve them special consideration when distributing employment \nand training funds. States that have agreed to ensure that no one who \nis willing to work is denied benefits under the time limit should \nreceive the funds to do so.\n  In this bill, States have a greater flexibility to provide employment \nand training services to people that are subject to the time limit yet \ndo not meet the definition of a work activity. Such individuals can \nstill benefit from, for example, job search activities and training \nprograms that are less than 20 hours per week. USDA should respect the \nbroad authority states already have to decide how to coordinate and \napply these various employment-related requirements under the act.\n  This bill also eliminates the current $25 cap on the amount States \nmay reimburse E participants for expenses other than dependent care. \nThis cap had not kept pace with inflation and limited States' ability \nto provide needed work support as part of their education and training \nprograms. USDA should continue its longstanding policy of providing \nStates with broad flexibility in providing these funds to employment \nand training participants.\n  This nutrition title is among the strongest that the Congress has \never passed. It will improve benefits, support families' efforts to \nmove from welfare to work, and simplify program rules. The bill will \nimprove nutrition benefits for low-income Americans and reduce hunger \nand poverty in our country for a number of years into the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to close \nmy part of the debate on this farm bill. We will be voting very soon. I \nwant to say a few things.\n  This is a comprehensive bill. This isn't a bill just for commodities \nfor one part of the country or other. This is a comprehensive bill that \ntakes into account a lot of different factors. This is a farm bill that \nhas taken a long time and a lot of hard work, both in our committee and \nin the Senate, under the leadership of, first, Senator Lugar, and under \nmy chairmanship beginning in the middle of last year; also, on the \nHouse side, under the chairmanship of Congressman Combest, and his \nranking Member, Congressman Stenholm.\n  We have had a lot of debate on this bill in the committee and on the \nfloor, and, quite frankly, a lot in conference also.\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\n  Out of this has come, I think, a good bill, a strong bill--a bill \nthat is good for all of America.\n  Is it a perfect bill? No, it is not perfect, at least not from my \nviewpoint. And I daresay, there isn't one Senator here who would think \nit would be perfect from his or her viewpoint. I am sure that everyone \nhere can find one or two things they do not like in the bill. But keep \nin mind, it is a comprehensive bill for America and for our future.\n  The bill comprises a number of different parts which I think enable \nus to turn the corner. If I were to say what was my view on this farm \nbill, it turns the corner from where we have been in the past.\n  In commodities, we have strengthened income, we have provided \nstability and predictability. We have ended the Freedom to Farm. \nFreedom to Farm was built on a two-legged stool: low loan rates and \nAMTA payments--direct payments.\n  Well, if you ever tried to sit on a two-legged stool, you know it is \nunstable, it is unpredictable, you never know which way you are going \nto fall.\n  So this bill puts four legs under that stool for our farmers and our \nranchers: higher loan rates, a target price, a direct payment, and \nconservation--four strong legs under that stool by which we support and \nenhance our farmers' livelihoods. So we have turned the corner.\n  Large farms in the past got everything. Under Freedom to Farm, it was \na dog-eat-dog world. And in a dog-eat-dog world, the biggest dog gets \nit all. We have turned that corner. Now, for example, people like \nScottie Pippen and Ted Turner and Sam Donaldson will not be able to get \na dime from this farm bill. I cannot tell you how many editorials I \nhave seen lately saying the farm bill continues to give all this money \nto people like Ted Turner and Scottie Pippen, and people like that. \nAbsolutely untrue. We have turned that corner. They now will not get \none single dime.\n\n  We have more help for our moderate and mid-sized farms, with the \nhigher loan rates, with the conservation payments, with the target \nprice. We have support in here for beginning farmers. We even have a \nspecific provision in here for organic farmers, which we have never had \nbefore. We have a provision in this bill for specialty crops, a floor \nof $200 million a year for the purchasing of fruits and vegetables. \nThat helps small orchards, small vegetable farmers, in every state, \nlike in Washington, in Michigan, and in New England. This is good not \nonly for them but for the health and welfare of America. So we have \nturned the corner in just focusing on the biggest farmers and in \nfocusing only on a few crops.\n  We now are saying to moderate and mid-sized farmers: You, too, will \nhave support and help. We say to farmers who are growing specialty \ncrops: You now have support and help. We say to organic farmers: You \nnow have support and help. We say to farmers who want to practice \nconservation: You now have help. And especially to our smaller and mid-\nsized farmers.\n  So we have turned the corner. On conservation, we have an 80-percent \nincrease in conservation, a huge increase over 1996 Farm Bill. We have \nturned the corner. The Conservation Reserve Program, nearly 3 million \nmore acres will be added; the Wetlands Reserve Program, we have more \nthan doubled it; the Wildlife Habitat Program, a fourteen-fold \nincrease; the EQIP program, to help our livestock farmers clean up and \nstop runoff into places such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Mississippi \nRiver and the Missouri River and the Great Lakes and our crop producers \nto reduce their nutrient run-off, among many other important \nconservation activities, five and a half times more money. More money \nfor EQIP than we have ever had before, going from $2 billion to $11 \nbillion.\n  There is a new provision for ground water protection that we have \nnever had before; $600 million to help conserve ground and surface \nwater. There is a brand new conservation program called the \nConservation Security Program that will help all farmers, especially \nour moderate and mid-sized and small farmers be good conservationists, \nlike they want to be, like many of them are already. This will help \nsupport them and encourage them to be even better conservationists in \nthe future. We have turned the corner on conservation. This is a \nprogram that many farmers are eagerly waiting for and I strongly \nencourage the Secretary to expedite implementation of CSP so we no \nlonger leave producers out of conservation programs and so we no longer \ncontinue to ignore the stewards of our nation's natural resources.\n  On nutrition, as I mentioned, the last farm bill did not even include \na nutrition title. We included it in this farm bill at a level of $6.4 \nbillion, almost twice what the House level was. Yes, I say to my friend \nfrom Texas, you bet we restored food stamp benefits to legal immigrants \nwho have lived in the United States for at least 5 years. The President \nhimself wanted that. We also said that children and people with \ndisabilities don't have to wait 1 day to get food stamps. Yes, we \nanswered that need.\n  We also did away with a lot of the red tape and the paperwork \nassociated with the food stamp program. In addition, we provide 5 \nmonths of food stamps for people who are making the transition from \nwelfare to work.\n  On the Emergency Food Assistance Program--the TEFAP program it is \ncalled--we provide more money for commodities that are distributed in \nfood banks and food pantries.\n  There are 33 million Americans--13 million of whom are children--who \ngo to bed hungry every night. This farm bill speaks to them. That is \nwhy 51 organizations, including Second Harvest, Bread for the World, \nthe Children's Defense Fund, the Food Research Action Center, and many \nothers--51 food groups--in America support this bill and urge its \npassage. Our bill sticks up for needy people. We say, they, too, are \npart of our great country.\n  Someone said we are buying votes in this bill for commodity programs. \nHow about nutrition? How about all the money we put in for nutrition, \nfor all the poorest people in America, for legal immigrants? Many of \nthem cannot vote. We are not buying any votes there. But we are meeting \na humanitarian need and we are meeting our obligations as a decent and \ncaring society.\n  Rural development: We provide the funds to clear up the backlog of \nwater and wastewater. Broadband access: This is the first time we have \nmoney in there to bring broadband access to our small towns and \ncommunities. We have a Rural Equity Capital Fund we have never had \nbefore, a provision to provide for grants and loans for value-added \nbusinesses owned by farmers around small towns and communities. We have \nturned the corner on rural development.\n  Energy: This is the first time ever we have had a title in the farm \nbill dealing with energy, to provide grants and loans to farmers and \nranchers for renewable energy--wind, solar, biomass, that type of \nenergy--to build biofuels processing plants for soy diesel, soy \nlubricants, ethanol. Yes, we are providing new markets for our farmers \nout there, and the new market is energy--energy for our country, to \nmake us energy independent, to provide us the kind of independence that \nwe need in energy, based on renewable resources on our farms and \nranches. It is the first time ever. We have turned the corner.\n  On trade, we provide more money for the Market Assistance Program, to \nmake sure we are able to sell our value-added products overseas, and we \nhave the Foreign Market Development Program to get our bulk commodities \noverseas. We have provided more money for that. So we have turned the \ncorner there.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about competition. I will say this, we \nhave done more in this bill on fairness and transparency than any bill \nsince the Packers and Stockyards Act was passed in 1921--more. Farmers \nand consumers scored a big win, and the big meat processors suffered \ntheir biggest loss in decades when we kept the country of origin \nprovision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleagues for giving me this time.\n  The big meat processors lost out. We got country-of-origin labeling, \nas well a crucial amendment to the Packers\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\nand Stockyards Act that brought swine production contractors under the \nPackers and Stockyards Act. So now farmers who have swine production \ncontracts have the same protections against unfair practices as poultry \ngrowers and livestock owners. This provision makes sure that the \nPackers and Stockyards Act evolves with the changing industry.\n  We were also able to keep a provision to make it clear that farmers \nwho have marketing and production contracts have the right to discuss \nthose contracts with their close advisors and family, no matter what \nthe contract or the meatpacker says.\n  Let me say this about payment limits. Do I wish we could have done \nmore? Yes. But I want to point this out: Right now the payment \nlimitation is $460,000, the maximum that any one person can get or any \none entity can get under the freedom to farm bill. The House came with \n$550,000. They raised it. We brought it down to $360,000. It is \n$460,000 now. We brought it down to $360,000. We were at $275,000 in \nthe Senate. The House was at $550,000. So we actually came in closer to \nthe Senate at $360,000. As I mentioned, we cut out the Scottie Pippens \nand the Ted Turners and all those people who were getting payments. \nThat has ended.\n  We set up a commission that will have members appointed from the \nSenate, from the House, and from the administration, to advise us on \nfurther processes that we should do to address the issue of payment \nlimitations.\n  And this is another thing we did: We provide for transparency. From \nnow on, we will be able to track every payment made to every farmer, \ntrack it right from the beginning right down to who gets it. Right now, \npeople hide behind entities, such as partnerships and co-ops and \ncorporations. Now, with transparency, we will see who gets what, for \nthe first time ever. So now we have transparency in all of our \nprograms, transparency in the EQIP program, transparency in the \ncommodity price support program.\n  So, yes, we have turned the corner on competition. Maybe we did not \nget to the goal of where we want to be, but we have turned the \ncorner. From now on we are going to have transparency. We are going to \nhave a better handle on exactly who is getting what.\n\n  I conclude my remarks by saying: You can vote no on this bill. I \ncould pick out two or three things, if I wanted to, and vote no myself. \nBut this bill moves us forward, to turn that corner, to turn away from \nthe Freedom to Farm bill and what it stood for, and to chart a new \ncourse for the future. We can vote no on this bill. All that means is \nwe go back to Freedom to Farm, with none of the provisions I just \nmentioned applicable. They would all be gone. Is that what we want to \ndo? Step back in time? Step back to where we were? I don't think so.\n  The bill is not perfect, but it is a good, strong, fair, and \nequitable bill for farmers and ranchers all over this country. It is \nfair and equitable to our consumers because they are still going to \ncontinue to get the most reliable, safest, cheapest food anywhere in \nthe world. We meet our social obligations in ensuring that we provide \nfood and food stamps to those most needy in our society. That is why I \nurge Senators to vote for this bill and move it ahead.\n  I thank all of our staff members who have worked so hard on this \nbill. In particular, I thank Mark Halverson, my staff director. When \nthis is all over, I will tell him he has to go to bed and get some \nsleep because I don't think he has slept in about a month or two or \nthree. I thank Charlie Rawls, our general counsel; Bob Sturm, chief \nclerk, who made sure everything was set up for us in our meetings, took \ncare of all the paperwork; Rich Bender; Karil Bialostosky; Seth \nBoffeli; Kevin Brown; Alison Fox; Amy Fredregill; Sara Hopper; Ellen \nHuntoon; Eric Juzenas; Susan Keith; Jay Klug; Stephanie Mercier; Frank \nNewkirk; Doug O'Brien; Vershawn Perkins; Erin Peterson; Lloyd Ritter; \nTerri Roney; John Moreland; Bob Soukup. I thank all of those.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute to continue to thank my \nstaff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank particularly the family members of these \nindividuals, the spouses, significant others, the children. I know they \nhaven't seen spouses, loved ones, parents, father and mother, in this \ncase, for some time because of the long hours we have worked. Sometimes \nwhen Members would go until 9 or 10 at night, we went home. Staff \nstayed until 1 or 2 in the morning to clean up the mess we made and do \nall the paperwork and get us ready for the next day. I particularly \nthank their families.\n  I close by saying my special thanks to my ranking member and my good \nfriend Senator Lugar from Indiana. I know we disagree on this bill, but \nthere are a lot of things on which we do agree. There are a lot of \nthings we worked very closely on when we developed the bill in \ncommittee. I look forward to working with him in the future.\n  This is not the last farm bill. This is not the end of what we will \ndo to address the needs of rural America and our people who live there. \nI look forward to working with Senator Lugar.\n  As I said, we may have a disagreement, but I echo what someone said \nthe other day: Senator Lugar has been from the beginning intellectually \nhonest and forthright in his approach on this farm bill. No one can \nfault that. We just see it differently; that is all. But he has been a \ngreat friend. He has helped move the process forward. Even though he \ndidn't agree with the bill, he wanted to make sure the process moved \nforward. I think that is the mark of a true Senator and a statesman--to \nmake sure, even though you don't agree, that the process must continue \nforward.\n  I thank my good friend and my ranking member Senator Lugar for his \nhelp and his support in getting us to this point where we now are \napproaching a final vote on the bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished \nchairman, for his generous remarks. I will simply say, as I did at the \nbeginning of the debate, he came into the chairmanship of the committee \nat a difficult time. This is a long process. He and his staff have done \na remarkable job, and our staff has worked with them. We look forward \nto continuing to do so.\n  We are going to have much more of an agenda before the Agriculture \nCommittee. The distinguished chair will be a part of that as well as \nthe distinguished majority leader who is on the floor whose remarks we \nnow await.\n  I do have a disagreement with my chairman, but we have expressed our \nviews at length and hopefully to the profit of all who have listened to \nthis debate.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wanted to thank the legislative \ncounsel who worked so hard on this: Gary Endicott; Darcie Chan; Janine \nJohnson; Heather Flory; and Tim Trushel. They were indispensable in \nhelping us work through this bill.\n  I thank the Congressional Research Service: Geoff Becker; Joe \nRichardson; and Jeff Zinn. I thank the Congressional Budget Office \nanalysts. When we always asked them, in the middle of the night, they \nwould come through with the information we needed. They are David Hull, \nJim Langley, Greg Hitz, Valeri Baxter-Wolmer, and Lanette Walker. And \nat the USDA Office of General Counsel, I thank Dave Grahn and Pia \nRuttenburg.\n  I will yield the floor, but someone asked me what was the best thing \nwe had going for us when we went into conference with the House. I \nsaid: We had our secret weapon. We had the majority leader of the \nSenate.\n  The majority leader is a valuable member of our Agriculture \nCommittee. I can't think of anyone who has worked longer and harder for \nour farmers and ranchers in America than Tom Daschle. Since the day he \nfirst came to the House of Representatives, we have been close friends. \nWe have worked together. He has been one of best leaders on agriculture \nin all these years. It is a source of pride to me to have him on the \nAgriculture Committee with us.\n  I can tell you, it was a great source of pride in getting the job \ndone and getting us to this point that Senator Daschle was there with \nus every step of the way, helping us out and bringing us to the point \nwhere we are.\n  I publicly thank my good friend, my leader, Senator Daschle, for all \nof his help on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senate majority leader.\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use my leader time to finish \ncomment on this bill before we go to a vote. I will try to be brief \nbecause I know Senators are hoping to have the opportunity to vote very \nshortly.\n  Let me simply return the compliment of the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, the chairman of the committee. He and I have spent more hours \nthan either of us have been able to count over some long months with \nthe hope and expectation that we would be coming to this point. His \nextraordinary tenacity, his leadership, his vision for agriculture, his \nability to work with all sides, his ability to articulate positions of \nour caucus and of Senators with whom he both agreed and disagreed is \nremarkable.\n  The people of Iowa have had many proud moments in their history. I \ncannot think of a prouder moment for the State of Iowa, this special \ntime for us as we bring this very important issue to a close in the \nSenate.\n  In the most heartfelt way, I offer my congratulations to Senator \nHarkin for his leadership.\n  I must say, without being repetitive, his comments about the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana are so true. There isn't anybody in \nthis Chamber I have greater respect for than Dick Lugar. I am reminded \nagain why, as I watch how effectively he presented his arguments. The \nold adage about disagreeing without being disagreeable applies \nexponentially in so many ways to Dick Lugar. He is never disagreeable. \nHe will disagree and he will make his voice known and heard, but he is \na remarkable Member of this body. I am honored to serve with him and to \nwork with him on all issues, especially this one.\n\n  My colleagues have thanked their staffs. I could not go to the vote \nwithout thanking publicly Bart Chilton, Jonathon Lehman, and Mark \nChildress of my staff, especially. As Senator Harkin has noted, we \nwould not have accomplished what we did were it not for their \nremarkable work, their tremendous effort, night and day, and well into \nthe night, sometimes into the wee, early morning hours, in order to \nachieve what we were able to accomplish over these past several weeks \nand months. But those three individuals deserve special thanks.\n  I must say, whatever I can accomplish as leader is only \naccomplishable because of the tremendous professionalism my staff \ndemonstrates daily. Mark, Bart, and Jonathon certainly have done that \nin this case in ways for which I will never be able to thank them \nadequately.\n  It is no secret that many of us have had difficulty supporting farm \nlegislation in the past. So I can sympathize with Senator Lugar as he \narticulates his reasons for opposing this particular piece of \nlegislation. He has been an advocate of prior farm bills because he \nbelieved in them. I am an advocate of this bill because I believe in \nit. I believe in it because I think it does so many things we have \nheard the chairman so eloquently articulate just now. I will not \nrecount them; to do so would be redundant. But I really believe that, \nfor the first time in a long time, we will be able to send a message of \nhope to farmers and ranchers all over the country; hope to farmers in \nSouth Dakota who may have lost some of the reason for hope in recent \nyears; hope to young farmers who really want to become part of rural \nlife and productive citizens, as the farmers and ranchers of the \nfuture; hope to those who believe we can do better in nutrition and \nfind ways to do a better job with conservation; hope to those who \nbelieve we can figure out a way to balance the imbalance that exists \nnow in the unfair trading practices used by some, and make sure \nconsumers have the ability to know where their products are coming from \nnow with country-of-origin labeling.\n  So I must say, this is a great day for agriculture. This is a great \nday because we send a strong message to our farmers and ranchers of all \ngenerations, and to those who look to us for some expectation that they \ncan survive and achieve great things, having chosen this wonderful \nprofession. So I am very pleased with the result. I am hopeful that our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this result with a \nresounding vote this afternoon.\n  I hope we can continue to build on what we have done. I have heard my \ncolleagues come to the floor and suggest that now what we have to do is \nfocus our attention on packer concentration. I heard Senator Harkin \nspeak powerfully about his determination to continue that effort. So we \nknow our work is not done, but we do know we have accomplished a good \ndeal. We have created a foundation for the next 6 years upon which we \ncan build even more--sending hope and creating even better and more \npromising days in the future for our farmers and ranchers, the likes of \nwhich I didn't think we would see this year.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues, and I thank those on the \ncommittee. I thank the conferees, and I thank our staffs for a job well \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his very thoughtful and generous comments. It is my privilege now \nin the remainder of our time to thank people who have been very vital \nto this farm bill and with whom certainly I have had the pleasure of \nserving in this committee. They are our minority staff and detailees. I \nwould like to name each one.\n  Obviously, Keith Luse, my right-hand person, who is right by me now, \nour staff director throughout all of this; Dave Johnson, chief counsel; \nCarol Dubard; Andy Fisher; Michael Knipe; Walt Lukken; Andy Morton, our \neconomist, who has been so helpful during this debate and for many \nyears; Terri Nintemann; Carol Olander; Chris Salisbury; Erin Shaw; \nDaniel Spellacy; Pat Sweeney; Mark Tyndall; Dave White; and Benny \nYoung. All of them are very able people, with great futures ahead of \nthem. We look forward to continuing our work with the majority staff \nand with our distinguished chairman.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, on this vote, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2646. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I voted today for the farm bill \nbecause\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\nI believe that it provides some needed relief to our strapped farm \nindustry as well as provides some new and much-appreciated assistance \nto the farmers of Connecticut. Our farm economy right now is in dire \nshape, and farmers from across the nation have pleaded with the \nCongress to give them the assurances that this bill possesses. I do not \nbelieve it is a time at which we can turn our back on the nation's \nfarmers.\n  The bill also provides some precedent-setting relief to the often \nignored farm industry in my home state of Connecticut. In particular, \nthe extension of the dairy program, the new assistance for the \nspeciality crops that dominate our farmland, the increases in \nconservation funding over the status quo, and the various incentive \nprograms for organic agriculture all will bring benefits to Connecticut \nfarmers. Finally, the provision of $600 million annually in new \nnutrition programs, including the restoration of food stamps to many \nlegal immigrants, will allow many Connecticut residents to provide \nessential supplies of food for their families.\n  While this bill does provide support for who depend on the land for \ntheir living, like most legislation it is not perfect, and so I cast \nthis vote with some reservations. I am concerned that several of the \nfeatures that made the Senate-passed bill desirable have been weakened \nin conference. In particular, the conservation funding has been reduced \nand appears to be backloaded far into the future. The payment \nlimitations that were adopted in order to ensure that funds were \ndistributed more equitably, and not disproportionately to large \ncorporate farms, also appear to have been weakened. While I cast my \nvote today for this bill, I hope that we can revisit these important \nissues in the near future.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the majority leader has asked me to \nannounce there will be no further rollcall votes tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4052-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4052-S4054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXPANSION ACT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to take this time to talk \nin some detail about the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act, the \nunderlying bill. This is a bill which is a renamed version of S. 1209, \nwhich was reported out of the Finance Committee last December. It is \nthe first part of a trade package to which the pending motion--actually \nit is the first part of the substitute underlying the bill.\n  I think it is important to put this bill in context. That is why I \nwant to spend some time reviewing the history of the TAA program, its \npurpose, and recent proposals for reform, and how those factors are \nreflected in the bill.\n  I also want to review some important points about what this bill does \nand does not do. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation out \nthere. I want to clear up some of the inaccuracies that have cropped up \nabout specific parts of the bill.\n  Last, I want to review my efforts to make this a bill with bipartisan \nappeal. That has been my goal--and, I think, one I share with Senator \nDaschle and Senator Bingaman--from the beginning. I really believe we \nhave achieved that goal. So I want to touch on how that happened as \nwell.\n  First, I will start with a little history.\n  Trade Adjustment Assistance--what we call TAA--was created in the \nTrade Expansion Act of 1962 and revised to its current form in the \nTrade Act of 1974. It was last revised in the 1993 NAFTA Implementation \nAct, which created a special program for NAFTA-impacted workers.\n  The purpose of the TAA program is to help workers who lose their jobs \nand firms that face layoffs as a consequence of international trade.\n  In 1962, President Kennedy said.\n\n       Those injured by . . . trade competition should not be \n     required to bear the full brunt of the impact. There is an \n     obligation [for the Federal Government] to render assistance \n     to those who suffer as a result of national trade policy.\n\n  When President Kennedy said those words, the United States had a \ntrade surplus. Imports amounted to less than 5 percent of GDP. But the \nPresident and a bipartisan majority of the Congress were wise enough to \nrealize that the benefits of increased trade are not evenly \ndistributed. They realized that we, as a government, have an obligation \nto help those who are displaced by trade policy to get back on their \nfeet.\n  Today, as well all know, there is a huge trade deficit. Imports as a \nshare of GDP have tripled. These facts can lead to only one \nconclusion--the rationale for having a strong, effective trade \nadjustment assistance program are even stronger today than they were \nwhen the program was created. That is why 66 percent of Americans \nresponding to a recent poll agreed with the following statement:\n\n       I favor free trade, and I believe that it is necessary for \n     the government to have programs to help workers who lose \n     their jobs.\n\n  Congress has regularly reauthorized the TAA program--about every 5 \nyears--and always with bipartisan support. It was with that history in \nmind that Senator Bingaman, Senator Daschle, and I embarked on this \ncurrent exercise to reauthorize and reform the program.\n  But before turning to the specific provisions of the bill, I want to \nspend a moment on what the current TAA program does.\n  There are currently three TAA programs: regular TAA for workers, \nNAFTA-TAA for workers, and TAA for firms.\n  The two worker programs run out of the Department of Labor. They help \nworkers who lose their jobs due to trade to get retrained for new \ncareers. To achieve that goal, TAA provides a very modest level of \nincome support to tide over workers while they retrain. It also pays \nfor training and provides job search and relocation assistance where \nneeded.\n  The TAA for firms program provides technical assistance to mostly \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses that face layoffs due to import \ncompetition. The program helps firms become more competitive so they \ncan retain and expand employment.\n  People sometimes call TAA the ``Cadillac'' of U.S. displaced worker \nprograms. I find that misleading. It is true that TAA provides more \nbenefits that other U.S. programs for displaced workers. But please \nremember that no one wants to be in TAA. The prospect of a government \ncheck for about $250 a week is not an incentive to linger in this \nprogram when you have a mortgage to pay, a family to feed, and medical \nexpenses to pay. I hope we can get past this ``Cadillac'' discussion \nand get down to the real issues.\n  The TAA program has a 40-year history, and we have learned some \nthings from experience. Over the last few years there has been a \ngrowing consensus that it was time to take another look at this program \nand see how it could work better.\n  In the past 2 years, the GAO has done four very comprehensive studies \nof every aspect of the TAA program. GAO has noted some problems in the \nway the program operates and made some concrete recommendations for \nreform.\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\n  In addition, the bipartisan Trade Deficit Review Commission has \nlooked at TAA. The Commission included our current USTR, Ambassador \nZoellick, as well as Secretary Rumsfeld, former USTR Carla Hills, and \nothers representing a wide range of views. As you probably know, they \ndid not agree on much of anything. But their report contains one \nunanimous chapter recommending revision and expansion of the TAA \nprogram.\n  The GAO and the Trade Deficit Review Commission's recommendations for \nimproving the TAA program include expanding TAA to cover secondary \nworkers and assisting TAA participants with health insurance.\n  Also, they recommend making sure income support lasts as long as \ntraining. After all, you need work while you are getting trained.\n  They recommend creating a performance evaluation system to track \nprogram outcomes to see if it is working.\n  They recommend providing wage insurance.\n  They recommend assisting trade-impacted communities and assuring \nadequate funds for training.\n  That is the unanimous recommendation of the Trade Commission.\n  That, in a nutshell, is how this bill began. We didn't start out \ntrying to add as many bells and whistles as possible to this program. \nWe didn't add too much in the expectation of negotiating down later.\n  We simply took the nonpartisan and bipartisan recommendations of the \nGAO and the Trade Deficit Review Commission and wrote them into \nstatutory language. This is basically what we did along with Senators \nDaschle and Bingaman. And we tried to do it in a fair and sensible way \nthat would make the program work better and treat all trade-impacted \nworkers equally.\n  Let me take a few minutes now to walk through some of the major \nprovisions of the bill.\n  The first thing this bill does is unify the two TAA programs for \nworkers--regular TAA and NAFTA-TAA. The unified TAA program pretty much \nadopts the existing NAFTA-TAA rules, which are the more recent. \nConsolidating these two programs creates a single set of application \nprocedures, eligibility criteria, and training requirements. This makes \nthe program a lot more user friendly for workers and easier for the \nDepartment of Labor to run. Unlike current law, the unified program \nwill provide income support for the full length of training. That way \nworkers can finish the training they need instead of dropping out when \nincome support runs out. The Administration supports these changes.\n  The second thing this bill does is extend TAA coverage to workers who \nlost their jobs when their plants relocate abroad.\n  Right now, these so-called ``shifts in production'' are covered under \nNAFTA-TAA, but not under regular TAA. That means that if a factory \nrelocates to Mexico or Canada, the displaced American workers are \ncovered. But if the factory relocates to Thailand or Chile, they are \nnot. That is not fair. It is not sensible.\n  This is not a fair or sensible way to run a trade adjustment program. \nThere is no difference between a worker whose job moves to Mexico and \none whose job moves to China. Their adjustment needs are exactly the \nsame. The bill cures the unfairness of current law by extending TAA to \ncover shifts in production to any country.\n  The third thing this bill does is extend TAA coverage to secondary \nworkers. Secondary workers are workers who supply parts to or perform \nfinishing operations on a product produced by another so-called \n``primary'' firm.\n  Right now, regular TAA does not cover secondary workers. Think about \na case where an auto assembly plant closes because of import \ncompetition from Japan or Korea and that forces the nearby plant that \nsupplies tires for the cars to close. All these worker lost their jobs \nfor the same reason. But right now, the auto plant workers get TAA \nbenefits while the workers at the nearby tire plant do not.\n  In 1993, secondary worker coverage was added in NAFTA-TAA. But \nworkers can only get the benefits when the imports are from Mexico or \nCanada. At that time, it made some sense to extend this coverage for \ntrade between the three countries in the new NAFTA agreement.\n  But now, nearly ten years later, it is time to extend the same \nbenefits to all secondary workers. When we added secondary workers in \nNAFTA, it was understood that eventually it would only make sense to do \nit for everyone. Since then, the WTO Uruguay Round agreements have \nexpanded trade with 145 countries, we have granted permanent normal \ntrading relations status to China, and we have entered an FTA with \nJordan and a trade agreement with Vietnam. It doesn't make sense \nanymore to limit these benefits to imports from Mexico and Canada. It \nis time to apply them across the board.\n  Now there have been a lot of misunderstandings about the secondary \nworker coverage in this bill. You have probably heard someone say that \nthis is a radical expansion of the concept of secondary workers--that \nit will sweep in all sorts of people with very tenuous ties to the \nimports at issue. I have to say that the people making those claims \nhave not read the bill very carefully. The definitions of secondary \nworkers in the bill are based closely on the definitions used in the \nNAFTA. We have broadened the definition of supplier firms slightly, to \ncatch some people we think are unfairly left out under current law. But \nother than that, this bill does not change how secondary workers are \ndefined--it just makes secondary worker coverage universal.\n  The fourth thing this bill does is reauthorize the TAA for firms \nprogram. This is a jewel of a little program that operates out of the \nCommerce Department. It has helped small- and medium-sized companies in \nMontana and nationwide that face layoffs due to import competition. \nTechnical assistance provided under this program helps these firms \nbecome more competitive so they can retain and expand employment. The \nprogram is very cost effective. It requires the firms being helped to \npay a share of the cost of assistance, and it pays the government back \nin federal and state tax revenues when the firms succeed.\n  The fifth feature of the bill is a new TAA program for communities.\n  Communities that experience mass layoffs due to trade competition are \nreally in a bind. This is especially true in smaller and rural \ncommunities, such as we have in Montana. These communities may not have \na lot of job opportunities for displaced workers, even with TAA \nretraining. Indeed, one of the main criticisms of the current TAA \nprogram is that it does nothing to make sure there are jobs for workers \nat the end of the retraining process.\n  There are a number of federal programs out there that might offer \nsome help. They are all over the map--in Commerce, Treasury, Labor, \nAgriculture, HUD, and the SBA, just to name a few. But these \ncommunities have no way to start, no go-to person or resource to guide \nthem through the maze of potential help. And the federal government \ndoesn't make it any easier. There is very little coordination of \nresponse among the various agencies. Finally, even if communities can \nfind these Federal resources, most existing programs are not tailored \nto the special needs of trade-impacted communities.\n  This bill tries to make federal economic assistance work better for \ntrade-impacted distressed communities in a few simple ways. It creates \na single office responsibility for coordinating the federal response. \nAnd it creates a single point of contact for the community throughout \nits recovery process. It gives communities the technical assistance \nthey need to develop a strategic plan--basically a roadmap for economic \nrecovery. That helps ensure that Federal resources are being used in \nthe most coordinated and cost-effective way possible. Finally, it makes \nsure that there are expertise and resources tailored to the special \nneeds of trade-impacted communities.\n  The next real innovation in this bill is the TAA program for farmers, \nranchers, and fishermen.\n  Family farmers, ranchers and fishermen are nominally covered by the \ncurrent TAA programs for workers. But hardly any have participated. \nThey usually can't qualify, because they don't become unemployed in the \ntraditional sense and they often don't qualify for unemployment \ninsurance--two TAA prerequisites.\n  In NAFTA-TAA, there was an attempt to shoe-horn family farmers into\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\nthe program by waiving some of the eligibility requirements. But even \nthat has not worked to bring trade-impacted farmers into the program.\n  After several decades of trying with little success to squeeze \nfarmers into eligibility rules designed for manufacturing workers it is \ntime to try something new.\n  What this bill does is create a TAA program better tailored to the \nneeds of farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. Basically, the program \ncreates a new trigger for eligibility. Instead of having to show a \nlayoff, the farmer, rancher or fisherman has to show commodity price \ndeclines related to imports.\n  The trigger is different, but the program serves the same purposes. \nIt is basically a hybrid of the TAA for workers and TAA for firms \nprograms, using parts of each that make sense for agricultural \nproducers. It assists the farmer, rancher or fisherman to adjust to \nimport competition, to retrain, to obtain technical assistance, and to \nhave access to income support to tide them over during the process. And \nthe income support is capped and is subject to gross income limitations \nto make sure that the program is not being abused.\n  The last important innovation in this bill deals with health \ninsurance. One common criticism of the existing program is that it does \nnothing to help workers with health insurance.\n  It is virtually impossible for a worker to pay the mortgage, feed his \nfamily, and pay health insurance premiums on $250 a week. The worker \nfaces a terrible choice. He can retrain under TAA in the hope of a \nbetter job--but risk going without health insurance for his family for \nup to two years. Or he can pass up the opportunity to retrain for a \nbetter future and take a dead-end job right away to make ends meet.\n  The bipartisan Trade Deficit Review Commission concluded that lack of \nassistance with health insurance is a significant disincentive to \ncomplete TAA training. As I said before, this group unanimously \nrecommended that the Government help workers bridge the insurance gap \nbetween old and new jobs. And that is what we have done with this bill. \nAgain, Secretary Rumsfeld, Ambassador Hills, and Ambassador Zoellick \nagreed to this point.\n  The bill before us today includes a 73-percent advanceable, \nrefundable tax credit for COBRA premiums for workers eligible for TAA \nbenefits. TAA participants who are not eligible for COBRA can use the \ntax credit to purchase health insurance from various State-sponsored \ngroup plans.\n  This issue has been surprisingly controversial. I am not saying that \nthere is only one right way to address this issue. But what has shocked \nme is the number of voices suggesting that we should do nothing at all; \nthat is, that we not help people, who are displaced on account of \ntrade, with health insurance. That is just not acceptable. I hope we \nare past that now and headed toward a reasonable compromise and that we \ncan move forward constructively to help people who need health \ninsurance.\n  Now that I have gone over the main parts of the bill, I want to speak \na little about the tradition of bipartisanship on trade adjustment \nassistance.\n  Since its inception, the TAA program has always enjoyed wide \nbipartisan support. As I said before, a lot of work has gone into \nmaking sure this bill is no exception.\n  Before the bill was drafted, we consulted widely with our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle. We have continued that outreach throughout \nthe process. I thank again, Senator Bingaman and Senator Daschle for \ntheir leadership on this issue. But I also thank Senator Grassley, \nwhose proposal with Senator Conrad for a TAA for farmers program became \nthe core of the farmers and fishermen portions of this bill. And I \nthank Senator Snowe, who has made some very important contributions to \nthe bill dealing with fishermen, small businesses, and other issues. \nHer support and cosponsorship are very much appreciated.\n  We have also talked with the administration. They raised some \ntechnical and not-so-technical issues, and we have been able to come to \nunderstandings on many of them.\n  The administration wanted us to tighten up training waivers, and we \ndid. They wanted us to cap the wage insurance program, and we did. They \nwanted us to revise TAA's on-the-job training provisions to work more \nlike WIA. We did. They wanted us to clarify the definition of secondary \nworkers and to make sure the Department of Labor has enough time to \nconsider secondary worker petitions. We did that, too.\n  This process of give and take has been healthy. It has been useful. \nAnd I think the result is a good, solid, thoughtful bill, one that will \nmake this program more fair, more efficient, and more user friendly.\n  If we want to rebuild the center on trade, improving trade adjustment \nassistance is critical. It is an integral part. It is a necessary part. \nI urge all my colleagues to support this provision and support the \nlarger trade package, particularly when we proceed to consider it at a \nlater point either this week or next.\n  I thank the Chair. And I particularly thank my friend from Alaska for \nhis indulgence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4054-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, in recent years, some of my colleagues have \nopposed elevating the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet-level \nstatus. You and I have argued that the protection of our public health \nand environment, EPA's mandate, is as important as the congressional \nmandates which guide other Cabinet-level agencies. If the EPA enjoyed \nthe same status as the Department of Energy or the Interior Department, \nmaybe EPA's policies would carry the day occasionally.\n  As things stand, EPA is certainly losing the battle within this \nadministration from clean air to climate change to snowmobiles in our \nnational parks. EPA's views are overridden, undervalued, and watered \ndown.\n  Take the issue of snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National \nParks. I have spoken about these issues before. I have offered \namendments that have been adopted in this regard. Snowmobiling in \nYellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park has become \npopular in recent years; so popular, in fact, that the activities \noverwhelm the parks, its employees, and its wildlife.\n  Up to 1,000 snowmobilers enter the Yellowstone Park on winter \nweekends, most of them through the gateway community of West \nYellowstone, MT. On steel cold days, a visible haze hangs over the \npark's gate and surrounding area. Rangers at this park wore Park \nService-issued respirators this winter because the air quality had been \nso degraded by emissions from snowmobile engines.\n  I repeat, park rangers at Yellowstone National Park wore respirators \nbecause the air was so bad because of snowmobiles. These respirators \nwere issued by the Park Service.\n  What have we come to when rangers have to wear a respirator in our \nnational parks? At the very least, it is an embarrassment. I think it \nis a tragedy.\n\n  EPA, the protector of the air we breathe, wisely advocated banning \nsnowmobiles due to their air quality impacts, but those were not the \nonly impacts EPA raised. Snowmobiles also\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\nstress Yellowstone's wildlife. The noise generated by so many \nsnowmobiles, coupled with the vehicle's capacity to reach speeds of up \nto 90 miles an hour, force the park's wildlife, to say the least, to \nexpend valuable energy to avoid contact with these snowmobilers.\n  The National Park Service studied the snowmobiles' impact on the \nparks for the better part of 10 years, receiving hundreds of thousands \nof public comments on this subject. The comment included those from the \nEPA. As I have said, EPA recommended a ban based on air quality \nconcerns.\n  In November of 2000, the Park Service ordered the snowmobiles be \ngradually phased out in Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton \nNational Park and the 8-mile road connecting the two.\n  By the year 2004, snowmobiles would be banned completely from these \nparks. With so many proconservation Clinton-era policies, the Bush \nadministration balked at implementing this rule. With the snowmobile \nindustry in mind, rather than the millions of Americans who visit our \nparks, the White House ordered the Park Service to restudy the impact \nof snowmobiles on park resources.\n  The writing was on the wall that this administration expected the \nPark Service to reach a different conclusion when it reexamined the \ndata. Perhaps they hoped the evidence would support the position they \nfavored, some sort of a faith-based approach to science.\n  As part of the new review, EPA had the integrity and the courage to \nstick to the position it held throughout the history of this debate. I \ncommend Governor Whitman for that.\n  In its public comments, EPA repeated the assertion from 3 years ago \nthat banning snowmobiles is the best available protection for air \nquality and health of workers and visitors alike. EPA said even a \nlimited number of snowmobiles may violate air quality standards.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the comments of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to the Assistant Superintendent at Grand Teton \nNational Park setting out their position be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Environmental Protection\n\n\n                                          Agency, Region VIII,\n\n                                       Denver, CO, April 23, 2002.\n     Re Draft supplemental EIS for winter use CEQ #020130.\n\n     Steven F. Iobst,\n     Assistant Superintendent, Grand Teton National Park, Moose, \n         WY.\n       Dear Mr. Iobst: As a Cooperating Agency in the Supplemental \n     Winter Use Planning Process, and in accordance with our \n     responsibilities under the corresponding Memorandum of \n     Agreement with the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the Draft \n     Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (DSEIS) for \n     Winter Use Plans at Yellowstone and Grand Teton National \n     Parks and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway (the \n     Parks). We provide the following comments to assist NPS in \n     producing a document that meets the intent of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the terms of the \n     Settlement Agreement that led to this Supplement. These \n     comments are provided in accordance with EPA's \n     responsibilities under NEPA and Section 309 of the Clean Air \n     Act, and we hope they will be useful to you as you complete \n     this supplemental analysis.\n       EPA thanks the NPS for the opportunity to participate in \n     this SEIS as a Cooperating Agency. NPS has again fully \n     involved the Cooperating Agencies at every point in this \n     process. NPS was extremely responsive to the Cooperating \n     Agencies, and we appreciate the almost weekly opportunity to \n     provide input and ask questions. We also appreciate NPS' \n     efforts to fully evaluate and utilize applicable information \n     and input from the Cooperators. While the Settlement \n     Agreement set a very tight time frame for this analysis, and \n     though NPS received much of the new information much later \n     than expected, the NPS planning and analysis team is to be \n     commended for doing a remarkable job in assembling this \n     DSEIS.\n       This DSEIS amends the Final Winter Use EIS (FEIS) issued in \n     October, 2000. The two primary purposes of the DSEIS are as \n     follows: (1) to solicit more public input, and (2) to include \n     data from new snowmobile technology and other new \n     information. This DSEIS analyzes four alternatives that fall \n     within the range of those alternatives presented in the FEIS.\n       Alternative 1a represents the November 2000 Record of \n     Decision (ROD), fully phasing in he transfer of motorized \n     access to snowcoaches by 2003-2004. The existing ROD \n     implements FEIS Alternative G with minor modifications.\n       Alternative 1b is identical to 1a except implementation is \n     extended one additional year, with full implementation in \n     2004-2005.\n       Alternative 2, at full implementation, requires 50 percent \n     lower emissions on all snowmobiles, and caps snowmobiles in \n     Yellowstone at 1,300/day pending a carrying capacity \n     analysis.\n       Alternative 3, at a full implementation, requires ``best \n     available technology'' for reducing emissions and noise for \n     all snowmobiles entering the Parks, and all snowmobiles would \n     be accompanied by a NPS licensed guide. Alternative 3 caps \n     use in Yellowstone at 930 snowmobiles per day until a \n     carrying capacity analysis is completed.\n       EPA fully supports continued winter access to these \n     National Parks. Given the analysis presented in the DSEIS, \n     EPA is satisfied that if applicable regulation, law, and \n     federal policy are followed. Park resources can be protected \n     while maintaining motorized winter access to these Parks. \n     While this comment letter will suggest some adjustments and \n     additional analyses, EPA finds the Park Service again used \n     the best-available information, scientific analyses, expert \n     agency comment, and public input in assembling both the DSEIS \n     and FEIS (as required by 40 CFR 1500.1(b)). The assessment of \n     impacts in the DSEIS and FEIS is supported by an extremely \n     thorough and credible body of human health, environmental, \n     and wildlife science, much of which is site-specific to the \n     Yellowstone ecosystem. NPS, academic and agency researchers \n     have actively studied the impacts of snowmobile use for over \n     10 years in these Parks. The Yellowstone ecosystem has the \n     benefit of more peer-reviewed scientific research on the \n     effects of motorized winter recreation than any other place \n     on earth.\n       EPA's primary concern with this supplemental analysis is \n     that three of the four DSEIS alternatives (1b, 2 and 3) \n     threaten to exceed National or Montana Ambient Air Quality \n     Standards for carbon monoxide in the first year of \n     implementation (2002-2003). NPS has the ability, information \n     and authority to set interim limits to vehicle numbers that \n     would assure compliance with Air Quality Standards. EPA \n     encourages interim vehicle limits be sufficiently reduced in \n     the FSEIS to assure compliance with these standards. Although \n     complying with Air Quality Standards does not assure \n     elimination of the impairment to visibility of human health \n     caused by vehicle exhaust, it is an achievable first step \n     toward resolving the impaired air quality in these Parks.\n       In November, 2000, NPS issued a Record of Decision (ROD) \n     that resolved the winter-use threat to National and State air \n     Quality Standards as well as the significant impairments to \n     human health, visibility, wildlife and soundscapes. This \n     remedy was to being with actions taken this past winter \n     (2001-2002), with full implementation in 2003-04. EPA \n     recently learned that some actions required by the ROD to \n     reduce impacts to air quality this past winter were not \n     implemented. The ROD is an active policy document and \n     represents an agreement with the public for managing \n     winter use in these Parks. EPA is concerned that air \n     quality, human health and visibility continued to be \n     impaired this past season. As discussed in our enclosed \n     Detailed Comments, EPA is suggesting that interim limits \n     be adjusted in each of the SEIS alternatives to assure \n     compliance with air quality standards beginning this \n     coming season (2002-2003).\n     Environmentally preferred alternative\n       EPA has carefully considered the new information, analysis \n     and alternatives presented in the DSEIS, and we find FEIS \n     Alternative G remains the environmentally preferred \n     alternative. The analysis presented in this EIS clearly \n     indicates FEIS Alternative G would provide the best available \n     protection to human health, wildlife, air quality, water \n     quality, soundscapes, visitor experiences, and visibility \n     while maintaining motorized and non-motorized winter access \n     to these Parks. We are confident that Alternative G will \n     fully comply with all applicable environmental regulations, \n     policy and Executive Orders. EPA has no objections to this \n     alternative.\n     EPA rating\n       Based primarily on the disclosure in this DSEIS that \n     Alternatives 1b, 2 and 3 would likely result in noncompliance \n     with air quality standards and that air quality could \n     negatively impact human health, EPA is rating these three \n     action alternatives EO-2 (Environmental Objections, 2--\n     Insufficient Information). Alternatives 2 and 3 are likely to \n     be inconsistent with NPS environmental policy regarding \n     protection of air quality and related values. ``EO-2'' \n     indicates that the EPA review has identified environmental \n     impacts including possible violation of environmental \n     regulations that can and should be avoided in order to fully \n     protect the environment. Corrective measures may require \n     substantial changes to the alternatives or consideration of \n     additional project alternatives. The identified additional \n     information, data, analyses or discussion should be included \n     in the Final SEIS (FSEIS). While Alternatives 1b, 2 and 3 all \n     receive the same EO-2 rating, EPA notes that there are \n     substantial differences in environmental performance between \n     these alternatives (see enclosed Detailed Comments). EPA \n     finds no environmental objection to the No Action Alternative \n     (1a). A full description of EPA's EIS rating system is \n     enclosed.\n       Because the decision maker can select from among \n     alternatives in both the DSEIS and the FEIS, EPA is providing \n     a brief assessment of the alternatives in the FEIS as\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\n     well. Because FEIS Alternatives A, B, C, D, E and F would \n     likely not comply with environmental regulation, policy and \n     executive orders, EPA has expressed environmental objections \n     with these alternatives (see EPA comments on Draft and Final \n     EISs). Again, EPA finds no environmental objection with \n     Alternative G.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to review this DSEIS and \n     provide comments. A set of detailed comments on the DSEIS is \n     enclosed. Thank you for your willingness to consider our \n     comments at this stage of the process, and we hope they will \n     be useful to you. Should you have questions regarding these \n     comments, please contact Phil Strobel of my staff.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Max H. Dodson,\n\n                              Assistant Regional Administrator for\n                            Ecosystems Protection and Remediation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is important to print this in the Record \nbecause the administration had already signaled it expected the EPA to \nagain sacrifice its own best scientific judgment to the political will \nof special interests. Again, the administration is signaling that the \nagency views will not be afforded weight.\n  When the comments were revealed this past weekend, Administrator \nWhitman immediately came under fire to repudiate the longstanding \npolicy of the EPA. While they have not gotten that for yet, EPA \nimmediately instituted new policy designed to ensure that its views \nwere in line with Cabinet-level counterparts. Perhaps elevating EPA to \na Cabinet-level department would begin to change the outcome of these \ncases and elevate the importance of environmental protection to this \nadministration. In this case, it is critically important that EPA and \ntheir views prevail.\n  I ask Governor Whitman to stand strong. Yellowstone and Grand Teton \nare national treasures. People visit from all over the world in all \nseasons to see Old Faithful and the Grand Teton range.\n  As I have said here before and other places, snowmobiling is an \nimportant form of recreation for many Americans. I snowmobile, and it \nis a lot of fun. Thousands of Nevadans snowmobile. But banning these \nvehicles from Yellowstone and Grand Teton will have almost no impact on \nthe opportunities open to snowmobilers around this country. There are \n130,000 miles of snowmobile trails in the United States. These two \nnational parks have a combined total of 600 miles. If the Park Service \nbans snowmobiles from these places, there will still be 129,400 miles \nof trail for snowmobilers.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the value of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. To the administration, I hope they \nwill join me in recognizing the value of our national parks and the \nneed to preserve these wonderful national treasures of which Nevada has \none, the Great Basin National Park, and it is a beauty. The Great Basin \nNational Park is the second newest. We have a mountain peak that is \nabout 13,000 feet high, but yet below that the park has some of the \ndesert foliage. It represents everything in the Great Basin.\n  In addition to that, the park has the oldest living attractions in \nthe world in it, such as bristle corn pines more than 5,000 years old. \nSo it is one of our great national parks.\n  I have talked about two national parks today that I am particularly \nconcerned about and hope we do not have snowmobiles rushing through \nthere and we do not see park rangers with their Smokey the Bear hats \nwith a respirator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4056-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4056-S4057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HAPPY BIRTHDAY, EVY DUBROW\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

With delight, I want to \ntake a few minutes to extend a very warm and sincere, if a little \nbelated, birthday greeting to a dear friend, Ms. Evelyn Dubrow, whose \nbirthday was May 6.\n  Affectionately, as well as professionally, known throughout Congress, \nWashington, D.C., and the labor unions around the country as ``Evy,'' \nshe has been involved in the American labor movement for more than \nsixty years, most of the time as a labor lobbyist. She was with the \nInternational Ladies Garment Workers Union, ILGWU, for more than forty \nyears. More recently, she has been vice president and legislative \ndirector of the Union of Needles Trades, Industrial and Textile \nEmployees, UNITE.\n  Today, women lobbyists are quite common on Capitol Hill.

When Evy first arrived \nas a lobbyist in 1956, women lobbyists were rare, and the U.S. Senate \nwas still overwhelmingly a men's club.\n  Evy was not deterred. She had come with a determination and a cause--\nto improve the living and working conditions of American workers--and \nshe was not to be denied.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a bill that \nSenator Cantwell and I introduced yesterday that will make it easier \nfor States and localities to secure meaningful work for dislocated \nworkers. Senator Cantwell is a true advocate for unemployed workers and \nfor economic development, and it has been a pleasure to work with her \non this and other initiatives designed to strengthen our workers and \nour communities.\n  This is designed to increase the ability of States and local \nworkforce investment boards, under the Workforce Investment Act, WIA, \nto match trained workers with productive jobs and also to create \nsystematic change in a targeted industry or occupation. Our bill \ncreates a three-step process for States and local workforce boards to \naccomplish this goal:\n  The first step involves a study. Using the latest labor market and \neconomic information, States or local workforce boards will prepare \ndetailed assessments of local areas that identify the gaps between the \nexpected and demand and supply of labor in industry sectors. The second \nstep involves plan. Local workforce boards will join with partners from \nindustry, labor, and the economic development and training sectors to \ndevelop comprehensive plans for implementing the assessments, in order \nto fill the gap between supply and demand. The third and final step \ninvolves grants. The local boards will make seed grants for training \nindividuals to meet the demand for workers in certain industries.\n  In my home State of Maine, I have worked with local workforce boards, \nregional technical colleges and high schools, businesses, workers and \ncommunity leaders to develop training programs that focus on particular \nmarket sectors within a particular region. I secured federal \nappropriations for programs to train workers in the metal trades in \nnorthern and western Maine. Today, dislocated workers in Aroostook \nCounty and Rumford, Maine are being trained as metal workers.\n  I also secured funding for a training pilot project in the Central \nMaine area that will introduce a photonics curriculum in the regional \ntechnical high school to train students for careers in the growing \nfield of photonics. This year I am hopeful that a request to fund a \nprogram targeted at training in the health care area in Southern Maine \nwill be granted.\n  This bill takes an innovative approach and provides tools to states, \nlocalities and regions to implement the provisions of the Workforce \nInvestment Act more effectively. By retraining dislocated workers, we \ngive them access to productive and well-paying work. We also make our \nworkforce stronger to face the challenges of the global marketplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4057-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4057-S4059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IN HONOR OF SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL'S 65TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a milestone in the \nlife of one of America's most honored and honorable leaders on the \noccasion of his 65th birthday, our 65th Secretary of State, Colin \nPowell.\n  Time and again, when Colin Powell's country has needed him, he has \nanswered the call. He spent 35 years as a professional soldier, in \nwhich he rose to the rank of four-star general and then served as \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the first President Bush. \nIn 1991, Secretary Powell led the American effort to liberate Kuwait \nfrom Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf War.\n  In 1997, then-General Powell helped found America's Promise the \nAlliance for Youth--designed to marshal Americans to get involved in \nthe lives of young people so that every child, regardless of race or \nincome, has a life with caring adults, safe places, a healthy start, \nmarketable skills, and opportunities to serve. In this capacity, Colin \nPowell proved that his tenacity, skill, and focus could just as easily \nhelp inspire a child as it could help win a war.\n  Now, as our Secretary of State, Colin Powell faces yet another \nformidable challenge, and he is once again leading with confidence, \ncompetence, and a principled vision. Our country is deeply grateful for \nhis service as he guides our foreign policy, including the twin \nchallenges of coordinating the diplomatic component of the war against \nterrorism and attempting to guide the Middle East toward peace. America \nneeds his sharp mind, calm voice, and sound judgment now more than \never, and I know that Secretary Powell will not let us down. He will \nhelp this country protect its people, live up to its most precious \nvalues, and build a safer, freer, and more democratic world.\n  Thomas Jefferson, our nation's first Secretary of State, once said \nthat, ``A character of justice . . . is (as) valuable to a nation as to \nan individual.'' I can't think of a life that exemplifies that \nsentiment more powerfully than that of Colin Powell.\n  Secretary of State Powell talked candidly about his life's \naccomplishments, and the many challenges before him, in a revealing \nprofile on the occasion of his birthday, written by White House and \nState Department correspondent Trude Feldman. To pay tribute to one of \nour strongest and most admired leaders, I ask unanimous consent that \nMs. Feldman's article, syndicated, by International Press Syndicate, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Colin Powell at 65: A Dynamic Statesman\n\n                         (By Trude B. Feldman)\n\n       At an age when most Americans are looking towards a \n     comfortable and secure future for themselves and their \n     families, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is confronting \n     two of the most serious crises the U.S. has faced in the past \n     50 years.\n       Between the war on terrorism and the powder keg in the \n     Middle East, there was little time for reflection as Mr. \n     Powell marked his 65th birthday last month.\n       ``I'm not terribly sentimental about birthdays,'' he told \n     me in an interview. ``But frankly, I don't feel any different \n     at 65. Aging is part of living and I'm not bothered by it. \n     Every now and then, I realize that there are fewer years \n     ahead, but that is also part of living. Most important is \n     that I've been blessed with continued good health, a loving \n     family and sincere friends.''\n       While Colin Powell grew up in modest circumstances, he has \n     always been rich in spirit and an inspiration to others. He \n     personifies success, achieved not because it was handed to \n     him, but because he earned it.\n       Today, a major player on the international scene, he has a \n     strong presence, a calm voice and his demeanor generates \n     confidence and admiration. He is the one President Bush sent \n     to the Middle East to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel \n     Sharon and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat to arrange a \n     ceasefire between the parties.\n       He is not content to retire and enjoy leisure activities \n     like playing golf or fixing old Volvos (one of his hobbies). \n     His attention and energy are focused on making safer a \n     troubled, dangerous world.\n       In the Middle East, Mr. Powell is demonstrating diplomatic \n     elegance by relating, respectfully, to each of the \n     participants, however intractable they may be. His dynamism \n     and apparent empathy are qualities much in need for his \n     current challenge.\n       I asked the Secretary if he would do anything differently \n     if he were able to relive his 65 years.\n       ``I never look back to see what I could do or might have \n     done differently,'' he responds. ``I guess I'm a total \n     pragmatist. I can't relive my life, not for one minute, so \n     why reflect on that instead of thinking about today and \n     tomorrow? Each day I do the best I can, and move on. I also \n     learn from lessons of the past by improving on the present \n     and future.''\n       What are some of his regrets? ``Oh, what good are regrets? \n     Regrets slow you down. Regrets cause you to fail to pay \n     attention to\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\n     the future. So I never log, count or inventory my regrets. I \n     move on.''\n       Colin Powell has used his years to break down barriers. He \n     has been a role model, not only for America's men and women \n     in the Armed Forces, but for millions of people the world \n     over.\n       Since becoming America's 65th Secretary of State on Jan 20, \n     200l, he has visited 49 countries, including Russia, China, \n     Nigeria, South Africa, and most of the capitals in Europe and \n     the Middle East.\n       According to the Secretary's chief of staff, Bill Smullen, \n     Secretary Powell relies on intellect, integrity and instincts \n     to get the job done. ``And that is coupled with a loyalty \n     that works both ways--to those he works for and who work for \n     him,'' Smullen adds. ``It's an Army work ethic that works \n     well for a man who has been a public servant for nearly 45 of \n     his 65 years.''\n       Smullen also notes that Colin Powell is armed with a \n     healthy sense of himself and a firm set of values. ``He is \n     flattered to be seen as a role model, complete with G.I. Joe \n     Action Figure,'' he says. ``The Secretary has achieved \n     considerable success through careers as a soldier, author, \n     champion of children and now, statesman.''\n       These qualities are used in the service of problem-solving \n     such as alleviating poverty around the world, as attested to, \n     for example, by one who should know--World Bank Group \n     President James D. Wolfensohn.\n       ``I believe that Colin Powell has combined his capacity for \n     effective management with a true understanding of global \n     humanitarian issues,'' President Wolfensohn says.\n       ``In all that I have seen him do, he shows great \n     sensitivity to the issue of poverty and to the concerns of \n     those less fortunate than we are. I believe he acts in this \n     way out of a sense of moral and ethical principles combined \n     with an understanding that poverty anywhere is a domestic \n     issue for the U.S. in this interdependent world in which we \n     live.''\n       James Wolfensohn, former Chairman of the Board of Trustees \n     of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in \n     Washington, DC, adds: ``I not only wish Colin Powell a happy \n     birthday and many more, but I hope he will be able to give \n     the world his sensitive and enlightened leadership for many \n     more years.''\n       Stuart E. Eizenstat, former Deputy Secretary of the \n     Treasury and Special Representative of The President and \n     Secretary of State on Holocaust Issues, echoes similar \n     sentiments. ``I know, from my former State Department \n     colleagues, that, in just over a year, Colin Powell has \n     established himself among the career professionals as the \n     most respected and admired Secretary of State in a \n     generation.\n       ``During the first six months of this Bush Administration, \n     when I continued to serve the State Department as Senior \n     Adviser to implement our Holocaust agreements, I could always \n     depend on Secretary Powell's full support. In general, he has \n     been an important ballast in this Bush Administration's \n     foreign policy, adding a significant element of wisdom and \n     good judgment.''\n       I asked Secretary Powell whether he has changed, in a \n     personal or official manner, since September 11th when \n     terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, \n     murdering over 3000 people.\n       ``You know, that tragedy struck the U.S., and put us in a \n     war,'' he cautiously responds. ``I have been in wars before; \n     and I knew what I had to do as Secretary of State--to pull \n     together a coalition, and take our case to the world. Today, \n     some seven months later, the greatest public diplomacy \n     challenge is to take our case to the Moslem world.''\n       Born in 1937 in the Harlem section of New York City, and \n     raised in the South Bronx, Colin Luther Powell is the son of \n     Jamaican immigrants, whom he credits for his success. At City \n     College of New York, his main interest was in the Reserve \n     Officers Training Corps (ROTC). His degree, however, was in \n     geology.\n       After he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Army, \n     he served in Germany; in Korea; and for two tours in Vietnam, \n     where he was wounded twice. In 1971, he earned a Master of \n     Business Administration from The George Washington University \n     in Washington, DC. In 1990, he returned to George Washington \n     to receive from its President, Stephen Trachtenberg, an \n     Honorary Doctorate of Public Service.\n       ``We take pride in watching one of our own graduates go \n     `from strength to strength,' '' Dr. Trachtenberg says. ``And \n     Colin Powell is a splendid person.''\n       As a White House Fellow in 1972-3, he worked in the Office \n     of Management and Budget under Directors Frank Carlucci and \n     Caspar Weinberger. Later, Colin Powell served as Military \n     Assistant to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger.\n       Now Chairman of Forbes Magazine, Secretary Weinberger \n     observes: ``It is hard to believe that Colin Powell is 65 \n     years old because he looks exactly the same as he did when I \n     met him more than 30 years ago. He keeps himself in excellent \n     shape, another attribute that not everyone has. He also has a \n     lovely wife, Alma, who is a great help to him.\n       ``I have always known Colin Powell to be extremely able. He \n     frequently knew more about a meeting than anyone else there \n     because he prepared himself so very well. He has \n     extraordinary leadership qualities, and although his only \n     real ambition was to lead the troops in the field, those \n     leadership qualities brought on the numerous other things \n     that came his way.\n       ``And because of those qualities he was unable to turn away \n     from things that needed to be done. I know he will continue \n     to serve our country in different capacities for many years \n     to come.''\n       When Colin Powell was Commander of the U.S. Army's Fifth \n     Corps in Frankfurt, West Germany in 1986, President Ronald \n     Reagan asked him to return to the White House as his Deputy \n     National Security Adviser. On October 1, 1989, President \n     George H.W. Bush selected General Powell as the l2th Chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the first African American \n     and the youngest man to hold that office.\n       After the General's retirement, President Bush told me: \n     ``He was the ideal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He was \n     always a soldier and advocate for a strong military, but his \n     personal style, his decency and his sense of loyalty and \n     honor made him great.''\n       In recalling his relationships with the last four \n     presidents, Secretary Powell notes: ``What a privilege it was \n     for me to serve each of these presidents. I consider myself \n     fortunate to have been given that opportunity. Each one is \n     different. Each is totally committed to our nation and what \n     it stands for.''\n       In 1993, upon Gen. Powell's retirement as chairman, \n     President Bill Clinton stated: ``I have come to see firsthand \n     why our citizens view Gen. Powell as a man of stature and \n     statesmanship. He stands as a model to all who believe that \n     merit, hard work and integrity are the real foundation of \n     achievement. America is in particular debt to Colin Powell. \n     He has served our nation brilliantly.''\n       That year, the Board of Trustees of The Ronald Reagan \n     Presidential Foundation selected Colin Powell as the \n     recipient of the 1993 Ronald Reagan Freedom Award for his \n     ``commitment to safeguard the freedoms and liberties of our \n     nation and advance the spirit of these ideals worldwide.''\n       General Powell was presented the award by President Reagan \n     at his Presidential Library and Center For Public Affairs in \n     Simi Valley, California on November 9, 1993. In an interview \n     soon after, President Reagan described Colin Powell as a man \n     of the highest integrity, intelligence and skills.\n       ``I came to know him as someone I could rely on as a steady \n     and wise adviser,'' the former president told me. ``Colin is \n     a man of tremendous decency. I admire him for his depth of \n     character and steady determination to work for what is right \n     and good. He has served our country well, and earned the \n     respect of all who know him. I will always consider him a \n     dear friend.''\n       Thomas R. Pickering, Senior Vice President of the Boeing \n     Company and respected diplomat, who served as Ambassador to \n     Russia, India, Israel, Jordan, El Salvador and Nigeria, and \n     who, as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 1989-92, \n     worked with Gen. Powell during the Gulf War, concurs.\n       ``No one has earned congratulations for his 65th birthday \n     more than Colin Powell,'' Ambassador Pickering says. ``He is \n     a marvelous leader and is making a huge difference in \n     American foreign policy from the Middle East to the Far East \n     and from Russia to China.''\n       Richard Perle, now chairman of the Pentagon's Defense \n     Policy Board, worked with Gen. Powell in the Pentagon in the \n     1980's and came to know him well. He is, Mr. Perle says, a \n     man of ``immense experience and talent, much wisdom, and rare \n     candor. He is also a key part of the most impressive national \n     security team since the end of the Cold War.''\n       In December, 1993, Gen. Powell was given a private audience \n     with Britain's Queen Elizabeth at London's Buckingham Palace, \n     where she presented him with an honorary knighthood. (Gen. \n     Powell's parents were born as British subjects). He was cited \n     in recognition of his contribution to the Gulf War campaign \n     (1991) to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait.\n       In describing his philosophy of life, Secretary Powell \n     maintains: ``I strongly believe in living for today and \n     preparing for tomorrow. I tell young people that the world \n     is before them; that the only limitation to their success \n     in the U.S. is that of their own dreams.''\n       As to his secret for success, he puts it this way: ``I \n     still haven't found a secret for success because there isn't \n     one. But I would say perseverance, working hard, studying \n     hard, liking people and being loyal, tend to be traits for \n     people who are successful.\n       ``I have always worked extremely hard and been loyal to \n     those for whom I worked, as well as to those who work for me. \n     And like I did in school, or in the Army or in the Pentagon, \n     or here at the Department of State, I diligently study the \n     subject at hand, and I try to be well prepared on all \n     issues.''\n       How does Colin Powell view race relations in the U.S. \n     today?\n       ``My sense is that there is too much intolerance of one \n     another,'' he replies. ``That has manifested itself in many \n     ways and places--in our colleges, workplaces and on the \n     streets. Intolerance is destroying our communities. It is \n     unfortunate when those who have suffered hate and cruelty \n     turn their bitterness on one another. That violates every \n     sense of what America is all about.\n       ``If one brief lifetime of perseverance could pull down the \n     Iron Curtain between the East and West, then our perseverance \n     in America can bring down the iron curtain of hate that, in \n     too many places, separates Americans from each other.''\n       Like most cabinet officers, Secretary Powell has his \n     critics, but he shrugs them off, with a grin. ``I don't find \n     it necessary to try to seek relief from critics,'' he \n     asserts. ``I\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\n     have accomplished a public record of which I am proud.''\n       Colin Powell is able to use any of several titles. Which \n     one gives him the most satisfaction?\n       ``I don't compare my positions with respect to which is \n     better or most satisfying,'' he muses. ``I care that I do \n     each job well, whether it is that of battalion commander or \n     Secretary of State.''\n       So which title does he now prefer?\n       ``I still prefer General, but am now used to Secretary. In \n     fact, this was a subject of considerable discussion when I \n     first arrived here at State. Word went out that I wanted to \n     be called General. Not so. Call me anything. I like all my \n     titles, from Lieutenant to Secretary. Secretary seems to have \n     won out and that is appropriate. On the phone, I say, `Hello, \n     Secretary Powell here.' ''\n       Prior to his secretaryship, Colin Powell was chairman of \n     America's Promise--The Alliance for Youth, a national non-\n     profit organization dedicated to mobilizing people from every \n     sector of American life to build the character and competence \n     of young people.\n       He also wrote his best-selling autobiography, ``My American \n     Journey'', published seven years ago.\n       Bill Smullen also recalls that, often, during the past \n     twelve years that he has worked for Colin Powell, he \n     (Smullen) was asked whether the real Colin Powell is at all \n     like the Colin Powell the public sees.\n       ``My answer is always the same--Colin Powell is the real \n     article. For all the right reasons, he has become someone the \n     American people have come to know and trust. Now, as the \n     President's chief foreign policy adviser, his exposure to \n     foreign diplomats and publics around the world has expanded \n     his popularity and respectability ratings.''\n       In a l993 interview, then-General Powell told me about the \n     obstacles he confronted in his climb to become the first \n     African American to reach the top in the military.\n       ``The military is a very demanding profession,'' he \n     recalled. ``I was examined and screened at every level and in \n     a thousand different ways over a period of 35 years. There \n     was a process of reducing obstacles as I went through that. I \n     might have had some earlier obstacles coming out of the inner \n     city and being a product of a public school system.\n       ``But it turned out that the school system in New York City \n     was pretty good. Any disadvantages I had as a young person or \n     because of my background, I overcame by my motivation to \n     succeed.''\n       And he succeeded in becoming the first African American \n     Secretary of State.\n       Colin Powell has long had a vision of the U.S. and its role \n     in the world. ``I'm not embarrassed to call America a \n     superpower because our power is one that underwrites peace in \n     the world,'' he also told me in that interview--almost nine \n     years ago.\n       ``When we have to go somewhere to use our power we don't go \n     to stay. We don't go to rule populations. We don't go to \n     exploit anyone. We go to help and we come home when we are \n     done. Even after WW II, the only land we claimed from anyone \n     was the land we needed to bury our honored dead . Because of \n     who we are, we have an obligation to be a strong leader in \n     the world.''\n       How does Colin Powell want to be remembered?\n       ``I hope to be remembered as one who served his country \n     faithfully and loyally,'' he told me. ``Also, I'd like to be \n     remembered as one who raised a nice family and devoted much \n     time to making a difference in other people's lives.''\n       And, if he were granted three wishes for his 65th birthday, \n     what would they be?\n       ``On a personal level, I've had a good life with every wish \n     fulfilled I could imagine,'' he concludes. ``I also have had \n     a satisfying career. But if it were possible to have three \n     wishes fulfilled in my lifetime, I would hope for real peace \n     throughout the world; for prosperity for all Americans; and \n     that we could reconcile all the differences that exist among \n     people in our country, differences which keep us from \n     achieving the dreams of our forefathers.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4059-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4059-S4060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      RECOGNIZING BRAIN TUMOR WEEK\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize May 5-11, \n2002 as Brain Tumor Action Week. In addition, I ask to include in the \nRecord a truly inspirational account written by a young, Wharton MBA \nstudent.\n  The material follows:\n\n                     My Journey With a Brain Tumor\n\n                      (By Adrienne McMillan Burns)\n\n       A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted the fact \n     that a brush with death can temporarily change our \n     perspective on life for the better. Experiencing more than a \n     brush--an extended fight against a potentially fatal \n     disease--has served to sustain such a view for me. I believe \n     these experiences, both brushes and extended fights with \n     death, can ultimately be used to benefit many people. And I \n     believe that those of us with these experiences serve our \n     fellow humans well by sharing our stories.\n       Three years ago, after giving birth to my first child, I \n     had a grand mal seizure. I awoke the next day in an ICU, and \n     ultimately I was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The diagnosis \n     was good as far as brain tumors go, but it was still a brain \n     tumor, and the overall effect was a fast and harsh \n     realization of my own mortality. I was 33 years old.\n       Life changed for me. As you might expect, I became \n     interested in brain structure and function, and specifically \n     in my own diagnosis and treatment. But life also changed for \n     me in a more unexpected way. After living a life focused, to \n     a great degree, on my own career goals and personal pleasure, \n     I came to a different point of reference. I began to more \n     fully appreciate that we have responsibilities in our journey \n     on earth, not the least of which is the one to our fellow \n     humans. I came to believe that the responsibility is simply \n     to help one another--from the heart--in whatever way we can \n     do it.\n       I changed my definition of success. Ralph Waldo Emerson \n     once said, ``To know even one life has breathed easier \n     because you have lived, that is to have succeeded.'' I \n     immediately needed to know that not one, but many lives \n     breathed easier because of me. As I lay down for my surgeon \n     to cut my head open, it became amazingly clear what really \n     mattered to me. It mattered how I treated people--how I \n     developed and conducted myself in relationships, especially \n     my relationship with my maker. It mattered how proud I could \n     be of the way I conducted my life, something no person in the \n     world but me could know. My personal integrity, my adherence \n     to my core beliefs, mattered. That's it. Nothing else.\n       I survived brain surgery and recovered, and I desperately \n     wanted to share my good fortune. I wanted to make someone \n     ``breathe easier.'' My husband and I left established careers \n     in Washington, DC (mine in the energy industry), and I \n     returned to school to pursue an MBA focused on healthcare \n     management. I was determined to use my experience to \n     influence what I believed to be the most significant way to \n     help others: improving the patient's experience in health \n     care delivery. Personally, I experienced exceptional \n     technical care, but I also experienced tender, compassionate \n     care. It mattered greatly to me that a nurse who handed me \n     medications in the middle of the night smiled as she did so. \n     Her tender smile assured me, as I lay in great vulnerability, \n     that the people to whom I entrusted my life cared abut my \n     life. There were other smiles in the hospital, and they had \n     the same effect of me. In retrospect, I'll never know if the \n     smiles really indicated such a care. People could have been \n     smiling for any number of reasons. But, I believed it was \n     care, and that made a difference to me. There was an \n     overall feeling of compassion in the hospital, and I know \n     it had as much to do with my healing as did the expert \n     hands of my surgeon.\n       My plans focused on systemic change. While not attributing \n     health outcomes solely to smiles (!), I wanted to foster \n     compassionate health care delivery. I wanted to provide \n     hospital environments that allowed doctors, nurses and every \n     other employee to deliver compassionate care along with the \n     very important technical care. I believed that basic respect \n     and appreciation of all employees was at the heart of \n     inducing the much-appreciated smile and compassionate care.\n       With a newly found passion, I set an ambitious goal. I \n     believed systemic change could primarily be effected from the \n     top of an organization, therefore, that's where I wanted to \n     be. I envisioned personally catalyzing movement to a higher \n     health service standard by which every patient in the world \n     eventually would be treated!\n       Two years later I had a recurrence of the tumor. Again, my \n     surgeon expertly brought me through surgery, and this time I \n     received radiation therapy in hopes of being done with the \n     patient side of the health care world! Other than the affront \n     to my vanity from lost hair, brain radiation wasn't all that \n     bad, and getting to know other patients in the waiting room \n     was a blessing.\n       In the interim two years, I've worked towards my goal. I \n     completed half of the MBA, and I worked at a major academic \n     medicine center. What I learned most during that time is that \n     there are a lot of compassionate, smart people out there \n     working to make patients breathe easier. I learned that we \n     are a fortunate people to have so much effort directed at the \n     goal of improving the lives of others.\n       I'll finish school this year and God willing, I'll work to \n     effect smiles of compassion in health care delivery. But the \n     recurrence gave me another, perhaps more important, insight. \n     Not only can I improve lives through systemic efforts in \n     health care delivery, but I also can improve the lives, in \n     small ways, of the people with whom I come into contact each \n     day. I can look people in the eye and smile. I can give \n     people the respect we each deserve. I can seek out the good \n     in all people; if I'm looking for the good, perhaps it's what \n     I'll see, and it will probably influence my relationship with \n     that person. That person probably needs to experience a \n     relationship based on that view of him or herself. M.K. \n     Gandhi once said, ``Be the change you want to see in the \n     world.'' I can do that, and I can do it now. That is \n     significant.\n       In my experience, appreciation of mortality becomes a \n     filter through which everything is forevermore received. This \n     appreciation brought an amazing shift in my perception, and \n     it's made the world seem an ever better place to me. I look \n     for and I find more serenity, compassion, and integrity in \n     the world. I find things more beautiful, and I find more \n     beautiful things. I looked up--to God--and I remembered that \n     He is my compassionate and tender caregiver. After \n     experiencing acute depression, He (and a very\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\n     good psychiatrist!) led me to rediscover pure, unaltered \n     joy--the kind my three year old seems to feel when I allow \n     him to choose any one thing he wants in the bakery near our \n     home.\n       So, that tumor, as unwanted as it was, changed my life for \n     the better--forever. It's been said that it's easy to forget \n     a lesson from a brush with death, and I do catch myself \n     taking life for granted on occasion. Yet, there's an \n     underlying permanence to the shift in perception that cannot \n     be reversed for me. I've talked with other patients--brain \n     tumor and otherwise--who've said the same thing. It amazes \n     me. It takes something terribly frightening to make us \n     appreciate all the fortunes we have.\n       I'll close by going back to my thoughts on responsibility. \n     It seems that many of my friends are searching--soul-\n     searching or otherwise--and it seems that others are too. I \n     want to do my small part to help someone in their search, or \n     to make them breathe easier. Perhaps we all can help. Perhaps \n     those of us who have had the occasion to contemplate \n     mortality, at any level, can perpetuate the important lessons \n     we each learn from the experience. We can tell our stories, \n     thereby reminding ourselves and informing others of what \n     we've found when everything but the basics of life are \n     stripped away. By telling our stories, maybe we help each \n     other to help each other. Maybe then we all breath a little \n     easier. What a success!!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4060-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SPECIAL AGENT TIMOTHY LATTERNER\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I want to bring to your attention \na true American hero, FBI Special Agent Timothy Latterner.\n  Almost one year ago to the day, Special Agent Latterner confronted an \narmed suspect in the lobby of a busy Manhattan hotel. But putting his \nlife on the line was nothing new to Tim. After all, he was a decorated \narmy veteran who bravely served as an enlisted infantryman and officer \nin the 82nd Airborne.\n  However, during the early morning hours of May 11, Special Agent \nLatterner came face to face with a violent felon and one of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation's Most Wanted. Following a lead, Latterner and \nhis colleagues entered the hotel lobby taking by surprise a man wanted \nfor sexual assault, kidnaping, armed robbery, and murder. With shouts \nof ``he's got a gun'' echoing throughout the lobby, bewildered hotel \nguests sought cover while Special Agent Latterner struggled with the \nsuspect, who had drawn his weapon. Due to Special Agent Latterner's \ninstinctive and heroic actions, the fugitive was subdued without injury \nto innocent civilians or law enforcement officers. Indeed, Special \nAgent Latterner's lightening quick reflexes saved the lives of his \npartners, hotel guests and staff.\n  One year later, Special Agent Latterner continues to be a role model, \ndedicated to his family, community, country, and the Bureau. On another \nfateful day, September 11, Tim provided invaluable assistance to the \nvictims of the attack on the World Trade Center, again disregarding his \nown safety to help others.\n  Today, this honored eight-year veteran of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation focuses his indefatigable efforts on a different type of \ncriminal--terrorists who threaten our very way of life.\n  I am proud that such a man is one of my constituents, residing in the \nbucolic Borough of Allendale. His devotion to duty and professionalism \nwill long be remembered and appreciated.

Mr. President, I proudly rise today among my \ncolleagues to pay tribute to one of the greatest thoroughbreds that \nhorse racing has ever known: Seattle Slew. Yesterday morning, 25 years \nto the day after his victory in the 1977 Kentucky Derby, Seattle Slew \ndied peacefully in his sleep in his stall at the Hill 'n Dale Farm near \nLexington, KY. He was the last living winner of the Triple Crown and \ntruly a great champion.\n  On July 19, 1975, Dr. James Hill, a New York veterinarian, and his \nwife helped Karen and Mickey Taylor pick out a yearling at the Fasig-\nTipton's sale. The horse they bought that day for a mere $17,500, a \nnear-black beauty, was the ideal confluence of strength, grace, and \nclass. In the 1940s, the American thoroughbred industry began importing \nEuropean stallions in a concentrated effort to produce the greatest \nspecies of thoroughbreds in the world. One such stallion, Nasrullah, \nhad begotten Bold Ruler and this genealogical line led to an amazing \neight Kentucky Derby Winners in the 1970s, including Seattle Slew.\n  During the 1970s, the sport of horse racing was at its ultimate peak. \nThere were great speed horses such as Mr. Prospector, Danzig and \nRuffian. And how can anyone forget such classic winners as Secretariat, \nAffirmed, Alydar and Spectacular Bid? Although these horses were great \nchampions in their own right, none were able to combine amazing raw \nspeed with distance-running capability like Seattle Slew. As owner \nMickey Taylor stated, ``He was the most complete thoroughbred the \nindustry has seen.''\n  From the very beginning of his racing career, Seattle Slew was \ndestined for greatness. He won his first three starts as a 2 year-old, \nincluding the prestigious Champagne Stakes, which he won by nearly 10 \nlengths, running a mile in an astounding 1 minute 34\\2/5\\ seconds and \nsmashing the record set in 1942 by the great Count Fleet. After these \nthree victories, he was named champion 2 year-old colt. In 1977, \nSeattle Slew became one of only 11 horses in history to win the coveted \nand elusive Triple Crown. On May 7 after breaking slowly from the gate \nand swerving to the outside, Slew won the Kentucky Derby in a heated \nand intense battle with For the Moment by just 1\\3/4\\ lengths. Two \nweeks later, he won the Preakness by an impressive 1\\1/2\\ lengths with \nthe second fastest time, 1:54\\2/5\\, ever in that race. In June of '77, \nhe captured the Triple Crown with a 4-length win at the Belmont Stakes \nand become the first horse to win the illustrious Triple Crown while \nstill undefeated. As a 4-year-old, Seattle Slew continued to build on \nhis reputation for greatness. In two epic battles of Triple Crown \nwinners, Seattle Slew outsped Affirmed at the Marlboro Cup and easily \ndefeated him in a race at Belmont Park. In 1979, Seattle Slew retired \nto stud at Spendthrift Farm having won 14 of his 17 career races. \nAlthough his racing career was now over, Seattle Slew's impact on the \nindustry was just beginning. Overall, Seattle Slew sired 102 stakes \nwinners including the great horses Swale and A.P. Indy. As of last \nyear, there were 1.066 Slew foals around the world. In 1984 when Swale \nwon the Kentucky Derby for Clairborne Farm, Slew became the first \nKentucky Derby winner in more than\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\n20 years to sire a Derby winner. In 1985 after 7 years at Spendthrift \nFarm, Seattle Slew was moved to Three Chimneys Farm in Woodford County. \nAfter surgeries in April of 2000 and March of 2002, Slew was moved to \nHill 'n Dale Farm in April of 2002. At the age of 28, with his loving \nowners by his side, Seattle Slew passed away.\n  I ask that my fellow colleagues join me in honoring Seattle Slew. He \nwas a great champion. The racing industry has lost one of its ultimate \ntreasures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4061-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING KENTUCKY'S TOP YOUTH VOLUNTEERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to congratulate and \nhonor two young Kentucky students who have achieved national \nrecognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. \nElizabeth Scoville of East Bernstadt and David Tao of Bardstown have \nbeen named State Honorees in The 2002 Prudential Spirit of Community \nAwards program, an annual honor conferred on only one high school \nstudent and one middle-level student in each State, the District of \nColumbia and Puerto Rico.\n  Elizabeth Scoville, a junior at North Laurel High School, is being \nrecognized for her entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to community. \nShe started a computer collection project that provided refurbished \npersonal computers to 26 low-income students in the Appalachian region \nof eastern Kentucky. Elizabeth asked businesses that were upgrading \ntheir computer systems to donate their old hardware to needy children. \nShe cleaned and repaired every donated machine, and then worked with \nteachers and counselors at her school to select students to receive \nthem, based on need and effort in school. Elizabeth also trained each \nrecipient in basic computer skills.\n  David Tao, a seventh-grader at Bardstown Middle School, designed and \ncreated a candle and broom-making exhibit for a log cabin in the Old \nBardstown Village and Civil War. When David found out that the village \nneeded a new display for pieces of donated Shaker broom-making tools, \nhe saw a unique opportunity to contribute to Bardstown's historical \npreservation. He researched the history of brooms and candles, then \ntraveled across the Commonwealth to learn Shaker broom-making \ntechniques. After the individual components were finished, David and \nhis mother set up the display, which is now a permanent part of the Old \nBardstown Village exhibits.\n  It is vital that we encourage and fully support the kind of selfless \ncontributions these young people have made. People of all ages need to \nthink more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at \nthe local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and \nneighborhoods. Young volunteers like Elizabeth and David are inspiring \nexamples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better \ntomorrow.\n  The program that brought these young role models to our attention, \nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, was created by Prudential \nFinancial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary \nPrincipals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that their \ncontributions are critically important and highly valued, and to \ninspire other young people to follow their example. Over the past 7 \nyears, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition \neffort based solely on community service, with nearly 125,000 \nyoungsters participating since its inception.\n  Elizabeth and David should be extremely proud to have been singled \nout from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of their \nrecognition, they visited Washington on May 5 for several days of \nspecial events, including a Congressional breakfast reception on \nCapitol Hill. While here in Washington, 10 will be named America's top \nyouth volunteers of the year by a distinguished national selection \ncommittee.\n  I heartily applaud Elizabeth and David for their initiative in \nseeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the \npositive impact they have had on the lives of others. I also would like \nto salute other young people in the Commonwealth of Kentucky who were \nDistinguished Finalists by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards \nfor their outstanding volunteer services. They are: Robert Campos of \nLexington, Daniel Knausz of Neon, Lydia Kullman of Owensboro, and \nKathryn Reynolds of Louisville.\n  All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and \ndeserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that \nyoung Americans can, and, do play important roles in their communities, \nand that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous \npromise for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4061-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATIONS TO THE JOHNSON CENTRAL ACADEMIC EAGLES\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Johnson \nCentral High School Academic Eagles for winning the prestigious and \ncoveted Derby Festival Academic Challenge. The 14th Annual LG Energy \nFoundation Derby Festival Academic Challenge is a quick recall \ntournament which began in 1989 with just 16 middle schools from \nJefferson County. Over the years, the tournament has grown to include \nboth middle and high school quick recall teams from around the \nCommonwealth. In this year's competition, 105 middle and high school \nteams throughout Kentucky competed in each of the two divisions for 3 \ndays for the $1,000 prize and the right to be named the Derby Festival \nchampion.\n  Led by coaches Brenda Porter and Freda Spencer, the Johnson Central \nteam dominated the competition from the onset and proved to everyone \ninvolved that they are the best-of-the-best. Josh Daniel, the captain \nof the Academic Eagles, deserves special recognition for placing an \nimpressive second in the Catherine Burmleve Individual Achievement \nAward competition for performance on individual assessment exams. By \ncapturing the Derby Festival Academic Challenge crown, the Eagles were \npresented with a crystal trophy, $1,000 prize, medals, commemorative \nKentucky Derby Pins, and Derby Festival Academic Challenge Championship \njackets. Furthermore, the team participated in the 128th annual \nKentucky Derby Pegasus Parade as Kentucky's premier academic team.\n  I once again congratulate the members of the Johnson Central High \nSchool Academic team on their amazing accomplishment. They proved that \nteamwork, hard work, and dedication lead to success. I thank them for \ntheir commitment to education and urge them to continue to reach for \nthe stars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4061-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4061-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4061-5", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4061-S4062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:41, a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, \ndelivered by Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the \nHouse has passed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 378.

A bill to provide for the independent investigation of \nFederal wildland firefighter fatalities; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would direct the Inspectors General of the Departments of Interior \nand Agriculture to conduct independent investigations any time there is \na fatality within the ranks of our Federal wildland firefighters. I \nbelieve this is a modest, but critical important, proposal that begins \nto address the fundamental issue of accountability within our federal \nwildland firefighting agencies.\n  This morning the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on which I \nserve, held a hearing on the Department of Interior's and Forest \nService's preparations for the 2002 fire season. I am glad we held this \nhearing, because the importance of fire preparedness was driven home \nfor many of my constituents last year, when Washington State suffered a \nparticularly devastating fire season.\n  On July 10 near a town called Winthrop, in the midst of the worst \ndrought on record in our State, the Thirtymile fire burned out of \ncontrol. Four courageous young firefighters were killed. Their names \nwere: Tom Craven, 30 years old; Karen FitzPatrick, 18; Jessica Johnson, \n19; and Devin Weaver, 21.\n  I believe we all must recognize the courage and commitment of the men \nand women who fight wildland fires, and the important work the Forest \nService and Department of Interior do on our behalf. We know that \nfirefighting is a dangerous profession, or in the case of these young \npeople, summer jobs that they had taken to help pay for college. But \ndespite the inherent danger, I believe we owe it to the firefighters \nwho lost their lives, and to their families--to ensure that, when \nplanning for this year's fire season, our federal agencies have taken \nmeaningful actions to avoid a reoccurance of the Thirtymile tragedy.\n  Because in the words of the Forest Service's own report on the \nThirtymile incident, this tragedy ``could have been prevented.''\n  I want to again thank Chairman Bingaman, as well as Senator Wyden who \nchairs the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, for holding an \noversight hearing last November on the Thirtymile tragedy, which \ncemented in my mind the three areas in which the Forest Service needs \nto improve its commitment to the safety of its employees: \naccountability, from the firefighter on the line all the way up to the \nChief; training our firefighters to put safety first; and independent \nand consistent review of incidents in which safety rules have been \nbroken, whether or not they result in fatalities.\n  I believe these observations were further reinforced by an OSHA \ninvestigation released in February that found the Forest Service had \ncommitted two serious and three willful violations of employee safety \npolicy during the Thirtymile Fire, even stronger citations than those \nhanded down after 1994's Storm King fire, in which 14 Federal \nfirefighters died.\n  One of the issues that came to our attention in our oversight of the \nThirtymile fire is that no one, not the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, not the families of the victims, not the public, is at all \nsatisfied with how firefighter fatalities are investigated. After the \nThirtymile Fire, the Forest Service basically investigated the incident \nitself. When concerns were raised that the investigation's conclusions \nwere simply not fair to the victims, who, afterall, are no longer here \nto tell their side of the story, the Forest Service saw fit to reopen \nthe investigation and modify some of its conclusions.\n  While the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, did \nconduct a subsequent investigation, OSHA simply doesn't have binding \nauthority over the Forest Service.\n  I believe this entire investigatory process is flawed. To inject \naccountability into federal agencies' approach to firefighter safety, I \nfirmly believe these agencies and their chiefs must know that, if \nemployees under their command are injured or killed in the line of \nduty, there is no question that there will be a thorough, independent \nand balanced investigation of the incident. This investigation will \nhappen regardless of politics and regardless of whether a member of \nCongress takes a particular interest in the incident.\n  I understand that after-the-fact investigations do not soothe the \npain of the families and communities involved in such incidents. \nHowever, my hope is that a proactive system of accountability, which \nincludes a rational investigatory process, will help prevent these \ntragedies from occurring time and time again.\n  As some of my colleagues may be aware, I added a provision to the \nForestry Title of the Senate's farm bill, with the help of Senator \nHarkin and support of Senators on the Energy Committee, that was very \nsimilar to this bill. It would have directed the Inspector General of \nthe Department of Agriculture to conduct an independent investigation \nany time a Forest Service firefighter death occurs as a result of \nentrapment or burnover.\n  Unfortunately, despite the fact a modified version of the forestry \ntitle did survive the Farm Bill conference, this small yet crucial \nprovision was deleted. While my office worked very closely with Senate \nconferees, this provision encountered a great deal of resistance from \nHouse conferees, who tied it to the unrelated issue of stewardship \ncontracting authority.\n  On February 17, 2002, the Yakima Herald-Republic editorialized that \nthis measure would be ``a good start to change one of the biggest flaws \nin last summer's investigations into the needless deaths of the four \nlocal firefighters.'' On May 1, 2002, after it was killed in \nconference, the paper wrote: ``In another disgusting display of \npolitics over principle, a move to stop federal agencies from \ninvestigating themselves when people are killed fighting fires has been \nscuttled. Incredibly, there was little disagreement about the value of \nmore oversight of the U.S. Forest service after its bungled handling of \nboth a fire and follow-up investigation of the deaths of four local \nfirefighters.''\n  On May 2, 2002 a Seattle Times editorial called the fight for \nindependent investigations ``. . . a cause worth fighting for.'' It \nwent on to say, ``The changes championed by Cantwell and Representative \nHastings are all about accountability and the difficulty of getting the \nForest Service to correct known training deficiencies and leadership \nproblems.''\n  During negotiations on the farm bill, the Department of Agriculture \ndid not oppose this language and it is my sincere hope that the \nrelevant agencies will support the legislation that I am introducing \ntoday. I believe it is good policy, and it is ultimately in the best \ninterest of both the management of these agencies and their employees \nwho are out on the lines fighting fires.\n  Moreover, congressionally mandated IG investigations are not \nunprecedented. Already, the Department of Agriculture's IG must conduct \nautomatic investigations for the proper disclosure of costs associated \nwith pesticide registration. The Department of Defense's IG must \nconduct investigations for the effectiveness of voting assistance \nprograms. HUD, and the Department of Commerce's IGs have also been \ndirected to conduct investigations of this sort. And the list goes on. \nI hope we will soon add to this list the investigations proposed in \nthis legislation.\n  There must be an automatic, independent investigation of any fire-\nrelated fatality. The families who have lost loved ones are asking for \nthese independent investigations. The impacted communities are asking \nfor this. And editorials from major dailies across my home State of \nWashington have cited the lack of investigatory independence as a \ncritical problem during the Thirtymile tragedy's aftermath.\n  I believe we can go a long way to begin addressing these concerns if \nwe were to enact the legislation I have introduced today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 2473. A bill to enhance the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program \nfor the National Park Service, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Recreation \nFee Authority Act of 2002. This legislation modifies the \ncongressionally created Recreation Fee Demonstration Program.\n  The issue of user fees on public lands is a difficult one. As you \nknow, our Nation's parks and recreation areas are in serious trouble \nand have significant\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\nmaintenance and infrastructure needs. The National Park Service alone \nhas roughly an $8 billion blacklog in maintenance and infrastructure \nrepair. There are a number of reasons for this funding shortage, \nincluding poor park management, congressional inaction and apathy from \nthe American public.\n  Currently, the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program allows the \nNational Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife \nService and the U.S. Forest Service to collect and expend funds for \nareas in need of additional financial support. Agencies collect fees \nfor admission to a unit or site for special uses such as boating and \nback country camping fees and are able to use 80 percent of the \nreceipts for protection and enhancement of that area. Fees are \ntypically used for visitor services, maintenance and repair of \nfacilities as well as cultural and natural resource management. The \nremaining 20 percent is used on an agency-wide basis for parts of the \nsystem, which are precluded from participating in the Recreation Fee \nDemonstration program.\n  The legislation I am introducing today allows permanent authorization \nof the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program for national parks, and \nprovides some new flexibility. For example, many visitors frequent \nnational and State parks, but are not allowed to use State and national \npasses interchangeably. In cooperation with State-agencies, the \nSecretary of the Interior will be authorized to enter into revenue \nsharing agreements to accept State and national park passes at sites \nwithin that State, providing cost savings and convenience for the \nvisitor.\n  In the past, concerns have been expressed about ``nickel and dime'' \nefforts where there appears to be a lack of planning and coordination \nby agency officials. Fee programs under this legislation would be \nestablished at fair and equitable rates. Each unit would perform a \nmarket analysis to consider benefits and services provided to the \nvisitor, cumulative effect of fees, public policy and management \nobjectives and feasibility of fee collection. This review would serve \nas a business plan for each site so that managers could utilize scarce \nresources in the most efficient manner.\n  The Recreation Fee Demonstration program was an effort by Congress to \nallow public land agencies to obtain funding in addition to their \nannual appropriations. This legislation will help provide resources for \nbadly needed improvement projects and ensure an enhanced experience for \nall visitors.\n  We need to guarantee our national treasures are available for \ngenerations to come. I believe that Congress, the Park Service and \nthose interested in helping our parks should cooperate on initiatives \nto protect resources, increase visitor services and improve management \nthroughout the system. Working together, we can ensure that these areas \nwill remain affordable and accessible for everyone.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2473\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today represents \na significant modification to S. 1320, which I introduced in the last \nCongress. This modification represents a large body of work that \nreflects my belief that forest planning and public land management \ncontinues to evolve and that underlaying law needs to be updated. It is \nalso represents thousands of hours of hearings and working with a \nvariety of interests to modernize the laws governing our stewardship \nover federally-managed, multiple-use lands.\n  I first undertook an effort to improve our National Forest lands' \nforest planning process in the 104th Congress with the introduction of \nS. 1253. I then refined that effort when I reintroduced the legislation \nin S. 1320. Today, I am introducing legislation that represents a \nrefinement of earlier efforts in S. 1253 and S. 1320.\n  For those of you who have just tuned in, this bill is the result of \n15 oversight hearings that my Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land \nManagement held during the 104th Congress. These hearings involved more \nthan 200 witnesses, representing all points of view, and reviewing all \naspects of the management of the Forest Service and Bureau of Land \nManagement lands. The overwhelming conclusion from all of these \nwitnesses, developers and environmentalists alike, public and private \nsector employees alike, was that the statutes governing federal land \nmanagement, the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the \n1976 National Forest Management Act, are antiquated, and in need of \nupdating. These statutes were passed by Congress in the mid-1970s to \nhelp solve land management problems. Today, they are a large part of \nthe problem.\n  It also represents my continued frustration with the process \nparalysis that grips the planning and implementation of much needed \nland management activities on our National Forests. Our new Chief of \nthe Forest Service, Dale Bosworth, tells me that it now takes up to ten \nyears to produce a forest plan that has a life expectancy of 15 years. \nWe have seen example after example of projects that require three to \nfive years to plan. In the case of many fire rehabilitation projects, \nthe financial viability of the project demands that NEPA be completed \nin a matter of months, not years.\n  More importantly, we are spending months and sometimes years planning \nand documenting the need for the rehabilitation of these burned areas, \nand then failing to get the land management underway before natural \nevents over take the health of our forests. This is occurring to the \ndetriment of the environment.\n  While our current forest planning and project planning processes \nstumble along, delaying important rehabilitation work, these burned \nareas are assailed by the elements of wind and rain. Almost every \nsingle person heard from agrees that the planning and environmental \ndocumentation process are broken. If we leave the agency in utter \ngridlock, we have done nothing to protect the environment. If during \nall of our careful planning and environmental documentation, an area \nsuffers a series of thunder storms that washes thousands of tons of \nsoil into critical fish habitats, as occurred after the 1990 fires on \nthe Bitteroot National Forest, we and our system have failed the \nforests, the environment, and the American Public.\n  By imposing a cumbersome, if not impossible, planning process on our \nfederal land managers we guarantee more fires, more destruction of \ncritical wildlife habitats, more water and air pollution, and the \nincreased likelihood of dangerous and destructive catastrophic fires.\n  We do nothing good for the environment by spending two or three years \nto design, document, and plan salvage operations to halt the spread of \ninsects or disease as they rampage through our forests. We can see this \ntoday in the Red River drainage of the Nez Perce National Forest.\n  I look at laws as ``tools'' for use by professional land managers and \nresource scientists that help them to establish priorities and make \nmanagement decisions. These tools are as antiquated as the slide-rule \nand computer punch cards that were the tools used by land managers at \nthe time that these statutes were passed.\n  As a consequence of oversight review during the 104th Congress, and \nsubsequent oversight hearings, I drafted and circulated S. 1253 at the \noutset of the 105th Congress. That draft, and the subsequently-\nintroduced bill were, in turn, the subject of six informal workshops \nand another eight legislative hearings to review the concepts embodied \nin both the first draft and the introduced version of S. 1253. The \nideas that emanated from the oversight hearings were modified to \nreflect the suggestions of witnesses, and in recognition of how \nresource management problems have subsequently evolved. A similar \nreview was conducted upon the introduction of S. 1320 which has helped \nme improve upon my previous efforts.\n  As you know I continued to hold hearings during both the 106th and \nthe beginning of the 107th Congress and enjoyed additional dialogue \nabout how to best modify the 1976 statutes. For instance, at one \nhearing all four of the former Chiefs of the Forest Service and one \nformer Bureau of Land Management Director shared their views about the \ncurrent state of Federal land management, and where legislative action \ncould assist their successors in discharging the public trust more \neffectively.\n  During that time period there was at least one seminal decision from \nthe Supreme Court. In Ohio Forestry Association versus Glickman, the \nSupreme Court, in my view, clarified the interrelationship between \nforest plans and project level decisions. In that decision, the Court \ndenied standing to challenge resource management plans, essentially on \nthe basis that no real decisions were made. We now have several years \nof court rulings that reflect that ruling. And we believe that the \nForest Service will soon be proposing forest planning regulations that \nwill reflect\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\nthe process certified by the Supreme Court.\n  The bill I am introducing today would refine current planning law, \nrather than rewrite the law to alter our course. I believe this bill is \nmore of a refinement than a revision and that it will be complementary \nto what we hope to see in the Forest Service's new forest planning \nrules, rather than in conflict with those rules. In various other ways \nof a less significant nature, the bill I am introducing today also \nreflects the product of court decisions that have been rendered during \nthe period that we were reviewing these issues.\n\n  In many ways my frustration with the forest planning and project \nplanning process that our Federal land managers are saddled with, is a \nlot like the Hubble Telescope when it was first launched into space in \n1990. You'll recall that initially the Hubble telescope didn't work. \nThe pictures it sent back were fuzzy and useless. It had a design flaw, \na mirror was not ground correctly and as a result its images were \nunclear. NASA has spent millions of dollars to design and launch this \nmarvel of technology and it didn't work.\n  Our National Forest planning process, the result of the 1979 Federal \nLand Policy and Management Act, the 1976 National Forest Management Act \nand subsequent Federal regulations, is broken. It has cost the public \nseveral hundred million dollars, and we continue to get fuzzy images of \nwhat the solution should be. The problem is that the public and land \nmanagers do not believe or trust the results. Now we learn we are \nspending up to ten years to complete plans that will remain in place \nfor only 15 years.\n  In the case of the Hubble Telescope, NASA identified the problem, \ndesigned a fix, and went into space and corrected the problem, all \nwithin a very short 3 year time period. In the case of the forest \nplanning process, most undertook the regulations would need periodic \nupdating. During the late 1980's and early 1990's the Forest Service \nworked to develop and propose new forest planning regulations. Election \nyear politics prevented the agency from finalizing those regulations.\n  In the last two years of the Clinton years, the Forest Service again \nmade an effort to make changes to its planning regulations. Again \nelection year politics intervened and now the current Administration is \nworking toward some changes.\n  The bottom line here is that we can repolish the regulations over and \nover again but it still produces fuzzy pictures. It is my estimation \nthat it is time to make some changes to the underlying law, so to speak \nthe design of our telescope. It is time to make the changes our Federal \nmanagers need to assure reasonable, environmentally sound, and timely \nland management.\n  It is my hope that we will now move forward with additional hearings \non this proposal, confident that we are on the correct path to improve \nthe quality of Federal land management, and through a variety of means, \nincrease public support for the future management of our Federal forest \nlands.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Wyden, the chairman for the \nSubcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, and to hold hearings to \nfurther refine this regulation. It is my hope that Senator Wyden and I \ncan build on our efforts to end the Federal forest grid-lock that we \nstarted with the passage of Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act of 1999.\n  I invite both the administration and Members on both sides of the \naisle to join us in this effort. We will move forward knowing that this \nproposal, like any other, is a working draft that will by necessity \nchange, probably significantly.\n  We also move forward knowing that legislative change in this arena is \nboth inevitable and vital. It is clear to me that this area of public \ndiscourse vitally needs a vibrant legislative debate and a new \nlegislative charter so that our Federal land managers can be provided \nwith tools a little more modern that the slide-rule and maniframe \ncomputer punch cards.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 2478. A bill to promote enhanced non-proliferation cooperation \nbetween the United States and the Russian Federation; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the United States Government and all of \nus personally have conducted a serious reassessment of our priorities \nin the months since the horrific events of September 11, 2001. The work \nof this body has been radically reshaped as we work together to \neffectively combat the menace of international terrorism. We have \nappropriated billions of dollars so our military can wage war in \nAfghanistan and prepare for the possibility of future military \noperations. We have devoted billions of dollars to strengthening our \nhomeland defense capabilities, everything from beefing up border and \nport security to manufacturing additional vaccines to prepare for the \npossibility of a biological weapons attack. The time has also come to \nreassess what needs to be done to ensure that nuclear weapons and other \nweapons of mass destruction and the expertise to employ them do not \nleak out of the former Soviet Union and find their way into the hands \nof terrorist or terrorist states.\n  Last year, I sponsored the Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 2001, S. \n1117, which called for expanding and accelerating programs to prevent \ndiversion and proliferation of Russian nuclear weapons, and fissile \nmaterials; reducing the number of nuclear warheads in the United States \nand Russian arsenals; and for reducing the number of nuclear weapons of \nthose two nations that are on high alert. The NTRA enjoyed success on a \nnumber of fronts: U.S.-Russia threat reduction and non-proliferation \nprograms were expanded and accelerated; the Senate, working with the \nAdministration, paved the way for the deep cuts that Presidents Bush \nand Putin generally agreed to in November 2001; and the possibility of \ntaking some weapons off high alert was studied as part of the Nuclear \nPosture Review. Solid steps were taken, but we all know that more needs \nto be done.\n  I rise today to introduce legislation that will help to address what \nis probably the most serious threat to U.S. national security: the \npossibility that terrorists or terrorist states will acquire nuclear \nweapons and materials, and other weapons of mass destruction from the \nmassive and poorly secured former Soviet nuclear weapons complex.\n  The scope of the problem that we face is difficult to fathom, but I \nwill attempt to illuminate it by citing a few facts. Today, Russia \npossesses approximately 20,000 nuclear weapons and enough weapons-grade \nmaterial to fabricate over 60,000 more. Not including the United \nStates, Russia possesses approximately 95 percent of the world's \nnuclear weapons and weapons-grade material, a testimony to the great \nresources and effort that both sides devoted in waging the cold war. \nThese weapons and material are stored in literally hundreds of sites \nacross Russia's 11 time zones. Making this problem even more \ndisconcerting is the fact that Russia is unable to reliably account for \nits huge stock of warheads and materials, having inherited a sub-\nstandard accounting system from the totalitarian Soviet state. \nAdditionally, there are over 20,000 scientists and technicians in the \nformer Soviet Union that are considered proliferation risks.\n  As the Members of this Chamber will recall proudly, Senators Sam Nunn \nand Richard Lugar, along with others, took the lead in the early 1990s \nto put together a suite of programs that still work to address the \nthreat posed by the possible proliferation of former Soviet nuclear \nweapons and other materials. As the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact fell \napart, there was a palpable fear that nuclear weapons and materials \nwould proliferate widely. In conjunction with the work in the Senate, \nthe first Bush administration also took up the challenge by backing the \nNunn-Lugar programs as well as supporting initiatives to help Soviet \nPremier Gorbachev as he attempted to keep the Soviet Union from radical \ncollapse. The events of September 11 serve as another wake-up call. \nThere is a growing realization that Russia desperately needs our help. \nBut more remains to be done--much, much more.\n  Fortunately, the Bush Administration has devoted considerable time \nand effort to working to increase cooperation between the United States \nand Russia on these matters, as exemplified by U.S.-Russian cooperation \nin the war\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\nagainst terrorism, the Bush-Putin summit in November 2001, and the May \n2002 U.S.-Russia summit in Russia. The administration wisely realizes \nthat only through greater cooperation with Russia can we deal \neffectively with this problem.\n  As I mentioned, Russian nuclear weapons and materials are stored in \nhundreds of sites. While helping to improve the security of these sites \nis a daunting task, we should ponder how much more difficult preventing \nan attack would become if even a miniscule portion of these warheads or \nmaterials were to proliferate. As members of this body know, the \nwarning signs are growing. It is well known that groups such as al \nQaeda and states such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea wish to develop or \nacquire WMD. Even more disconcerting are reports that members of al \nQaeda have attempted to break into Russian nuclear weapon facilities. \nWe would do well to meditate on these reports and ask ourselves if the \nUnited States is doing enough to prevent the myriad groups and states \nthat wish to acquire WMD from Russia from being able to do so.\n  Mindful of this serious challenge to U.S. and global security I am \nintroducing the Nuclear and Terrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2002, \nNTTRA. The NTTRA would promote policies that will greatly reduce the \nlikelihood of nuclear terrorism.\n  First, the NTTRA states that it is the policy of the United States to \nwork cooperatively with the Russian Federation in order to prevent the \ndiversion of weapons of mass destruction and material, including \nnuclear, biological and chemical weapons, as well scientific and \ntechnical expertise necessary to design and build weapons of mass \ndestruction. As a review by the Bush administration found last year, \n``most U.S. programs to assist Russia in threat reduction and \nnonproliferation work well, are focused on priority tasks, and are well \nmanaged,'' The NTTRA proposals complement the increases that the Bush \nadministration has proposed for these programs.\n  The NTTRA also calls for the President to deliver to Congress, no \nlater than six months after the enactment of the NTTRA, a series of \nrecommendations on how to enhance the implementation of U.S.-Russia \nnon-proliferation and threat reduction programs, including suggestions \non how to improve and streamline the contracting and procurement \npractices of these programs and a listing of impediments to the \nefficient and effective implementation of these programs.\n\n  Second, recognizing the shortcomings in the Russian system for \naccounting for nuclear warheads and weapons-grade material, the NTTRA \nstates that it is the policy of the United States to establish \ncooperatively with Russia comprehensive inventories and data exchanges \nof Russian and U.S. weapons-grade material and assembled warheads with \nparticular attention to tactical, or ``non-strategic,'' warheads--one \nof the most likely weapons a terrorist organization or state would \nattempt to acquire--and with particular attention focused on weapons \nwhich have been removed from deployment.\n  Only through such an accounting system will we be able to reliably \nsay that Russian warheads and materials are sufficiently secure.\n  Third, the NTTRA calls upon the President to deliver to Congress a \nplan laying out progress toward irreversibility involving the \nelimination of launchers and transparency measures involving warheads. \nAs the Bush administration works to lock in the gains that the United \nStates and Russia have generally agreed to, this plan will help keep \nthe Senate fully apprised.\n  Fourth, the NTTRA calls for the establishment of a joint U.S.-Russia \nCommission on the Transition from Mutually Assured Destruction to \nMutually Assured Security. The U.S. side of the Commission would be \ncomposed of private citizens who are experts in the field of U.S.-\nRussia strategic stability. The NTTRA also calls upon the President to \nmake every effort to encourage the Russian Government to establish a \ncomplementary Commission that would jointly meet and discuss how to \npreserve strategic stability during this time of rapid and positive \nchange in the U.S.-Russia relationship.\n  Working with Russia to address the many serious issues which still \nexist over 10 years after the end of the cold war should be one of the \ntop U.S. priorities in the overall battle against global terrorism. \nAllow me to be frank and to say that this work will not be easy and \nthere will certainly be testing times as the United States and Russia \nwork to fully put the cold war to rest and to reach a level of foreign \nand defense policy cooperation which was unfathomable only a few years \nago. But we are faced with few other options. We must shore up our \nfirst line of defense against the possibility of terrorism turning \nnuclear.\n  I call upon the members of this body to collectively redouble our \nefforts to prevent the unthinkable from happening by supporting the \nNuclear and Terrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2478\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear and Terrorism Threat \n     Reduction Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ENHANCING THREAT REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) Statement of Policy.--\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to work \n     cooperatively with the Russian Federation in order to prevent \n     the diversion of weapons of mass destruction and materials \n     relating thereto, including nuclear, biological, and chemical \n     weapons, as well as the scientific and technical expertise \n     necessary to design and build weapons of mass destruction.\n       (2) With respect to enhancing threat reduction, there \n     should be three primary objectives, as stated in the \n     President's review of 30 different United States-Russia \n     cooperative programs, as follows:\n       (A) To ensure that existing United States cooperative non-\n     proliferation programs with the Russian Federation are \n     focused on priority threat reduction and non-proliferation \n     goals, and are conducted as efficiently and effectively as \n     possible.\n       (B) To examine what new initiatives might be undertaken to \n     further United States threat reduction and non-proliferation \n     goals.\n       (C) To consider organizational and procedural changes \n     designed to ensure a consistent and coordinated United States \n     Government approach to cooperative programs with the Russian \n     Federation on the reduction of weapons of mass destruction \n     and prevention of their proliferation.\n       (3) The goal of United States programs to assist the \n     Russian Federation should be to have them work well, be \n     focused on priority tasks, and be well managed.\n       (4) In order to further cooperative efforts, the following \n     key programs should be expanded:\n       (A) The Department of Energy Material Protection, Control \n     and Accounting (MPC) program to assist the Russian \n     Federation secure and consolidate weapons-grade nuclear \n     material.\n       (B) The Department of Energy Warhead and Fissile Material \n     Transparency Program.\n       (C) The International Science and Technology Center (ISTC).\n       (D) The Redirection of Biotechnical Scientists program.\n       (E) The Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction \n     project to construct a chemical weapons destruction facility \n     at Shchuch'ye, Russia, to enable its earliest completion at \n     no increased expense.\n       (5) Other programs should be adjusted, refocused, or \n     reexamined, including--\n       (A) approaches to the current plutonium disposition program \n     in the Russian Federation, in order to make the program less \n     costly and more effective;\n       (B) the project to end production by the Russian Federation \n     of weapons-grade plutonium, in order to transfer the project \n     from the Department of Defense to the Department of Energy;\n       (C) consolidation of the Department of Energy's Nuclear \n     Cities Initiative (NCI) with the Initiative for Proliferation \n     Prevention (IPP), with a focus on projects to assist the \n     Russian Federation in reduction of its nuclear warheads \n     complex; and\n       (D) acceleration of the Department of Energy's Second Line \n     of Defense program to assist the Russian Federation install \n     nuclear detection equipment at border posts.\n       (b) Increased Funding of Certain Key Programs.--In order to \n     guarantee that the United States-Russia non-proliferation and \n     threat reduction efforts operate as efficiently as possible, \n     certain key programs should receive additional funding above \n     current levels, including--\n       (1) the United States-Russia Highly Enriched Uranium \n     Purchase Agreement;\n       (2) the Second Line of Defense program;\n       (3) the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention;\n       (4) the Fissile Materials Disposition program;\n       (5) the Redirection of Biotechnical Scientists program;\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\n       (6) the Department of Energy Material Protection, Control, \n     and Accounting (MPC) program;\n       (7) the International Science and Technology Center; and\n       (8) the Warhead and Fissile Material Transparency program.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than six months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress \n     a report containing recommendations on how to enhance the \n     implementation of United States-Russia non-proliferation and \n     threat reduction programs, which shall include--\n       (1) recommendations on how to improve and streamline the \n     contracting and procurement practices of those programs; and\n       (2) a listing of impediments to the efficient and effective \n     implementation of those programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE INVENTORIES AND DATA EXCHANGES BETWEEN \n                   THE UNITED STATES AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON \n                   WEAPONS-GRADE MATERIAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that inventories of weapons-\n     grade material and warheads should be tracked in order, among \n     other things--\n       (1) to make it more likely that the Russian Federation can \n     fully account for its entire inventory of weapons-grade \n     material and assembled weapons; and\n       (2) to make it more likely that the sources of any material \n     or weapons possessed or used by any foreign state or \n     terrorist organization can be identified.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States to establish jointly with the Russian Federation \n     comprehensive inventories and data exchanges of Russian and \n     United States weapons-grade material and assembled warheads, \n     with particular attention to tactical, or ``nonstrategic'' \n     warheads, one of the most likely weapons a terrorist \n     organization or terrorist state would attempt to acquire, and \n     with particular attention focused on weapons that have been \n     removed from deployment.\n       (c) Assistance in Developing Comprehensive Inventories.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United States \n     Government shall work with the Russian Federation to develop \n     comprehensive inventories of Russian weapons-grade plutonium \n     and highly enriched uranium programs and assembled warheads, \n     with special attention to be focused on tactical warheads and \n     warheads that have been removed from deployment.\n       (d) Data Exchanges.--As part of this process, to the \n     maximum extent practicable, without jeopardizing United \n     States national security interests, the United States is \n     authorized to enter into ongoing data exchanges with the \n     Russian Federation on categories of material and weapons \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (e) Report.--Not later than six months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter until a \n     comprehensive inventory is created and the information \n     collected from the inventory exchanged between the \n     governments of the United States and the Russian Federation, \n     the President shall submit to Congress a report, in both an \n     unclassified and classified form as necessary, describing the \n     progress that has been made toward that objective.\n\n     SEC. 4. COMMISSION TO ASSESS THE TRANSITION FROM MUTUALLY \n                   ASSURED DESTRUCTION (MAD) TO MUTUALLY ASSURED \n                   SECURITY (MAS).\n\n       (a) Statement of Policy.--With the end of the Cold War more \n     than a decade ago, with the United States and the Russian \n     Federation fighting together against global terrorism, and \n     with the Presidents of the United States and the Russian \n     Federation agreeing to establish ``a new strategic framework \n     to ensure the mutual security of the United States and \n     Russia, and the world community'', the United States and the \n     Russian Federation should increase significantly their \n     efforts to put dangerous and unnecessary elements of the Cold \n     War to rest.\n       (b) Establishment.--In order to assist with the policy \n     expressed in subsection (a), the President is authorized to \n     conclude an agreement with the Russian Federation for the \n     establishment of a Joint United States-Russia Commission to \n     Assess the Transition from Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) \n     to Mutual Assured Security (MAS) (in this section referred to \n     as the ``Commission'').\n       (c) Composition.--The United States delegation of the \n     Commission shall consist of 13 members appointed by the \n     President, as follows:\n       (1) Three members, after consultation with the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Three members, after consultation with the Majority \n     Leader of the Senate.\n       (3) Two members, after consultation with the Minority \n     Leader of the House of Representatives.\n       (4) Two members, after consultation with the Minority \n     Leader of the Senate.\n       (5) Two members as the President may determine.\n       (d) Qualifications.--The United States members of the \n     Commission shall be appointed from among private United \n     States citizens with knowledge and expertise in United \n     States-Russia strategic stability issues.\n       (e) Chair.--The chair of the Commission should be chosen by \n     consensus from among the members of the Commission.\n       (f) Russian Commission.--The President should make every \n     effort to encourage the Government of the Russian Federation \n     to appoint a Russian Federation delegation of the Commission \n     that would jointly meet and discuss the issues described in \n     subsection (g).\n       (g) Duties of the Commission.--The duties of the Commission \n     should include consideration of how--\n       (1) to ensure that the reduction of strategic nuclear \n     weapons announced by the United States and the Russian \n     Federation in November 2001 take effect in a rapid, safe, \n     verifiable and irreversible manner;\n       (2) to preserve and enhance START I monitoring and \n     verification mechanisms;\n       (3) to develop additional monitoring and verification \n     mechanisms;\n       (4) to preserve the benefits of the unratified START II \n     agreement, especially those measures that affect strategic \n     stability;\n       (5) to ensure the safety of warheads removed from \n     deployment;\n       (6) to safely and verifiably dismantle warheads in excess \n     of the ceiling established by the President Bush at the \n     November 2001 United States-Russia summit;\n       (7) to begin a new high-level dialogue to discuss United \n     States and Russian Federation proposals for a global and \n     theater level missile defense systems;\n       (8) to extend presidential decision-making time as it \n     relates to nuclear weapons operations;\n       (9) to improve Russian-American cooperative efforts to \n     enhance strategic early warning, including but not limited to \n     the Joint Data Exchange Center and the Russian-American \n     Observation Satellite; and\n       (10) to increase cooperation between the United States and \n     the Russian Federation on the programs and activities \n     described in sections 2 and 3.\n       (e) Cooperation.--In carrying out its duties, the \n     Commission should receive the full and timely cooperation of \n     United States Government officials, including providing the \n     Commission with analyses, briefings, and other information \n     necessary for the fulfillment of its responsibilities.\n       (f) Report.--The Commission shall, not later than six \n     months after the date of its first meeting, submit to \n     Congress an interim report on its findings and, not later \n     than six months after submission of the interim report, \n     submit to Congress a final report containing its conclusions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2479. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \nin the criteria for selecting any project for the low-income housing \ncredit whether such project has high-speed internet infrastructure; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am very proud to introduce legislation \ntoday with Senator Hatch that would amend the Low-Income Housing Tax \nCredit to make access to Internet and broadband technology one of the \ncriteria that State housing agencies must consider when awarding the \ncredits. This bill will help more low-income families gain access to \nthe new technologies and services that are driving today's modern \neconomy, and it will do so at very minimal cost to developers. The bill \nwill take effect for all new housing built with the credit beginning on \nJanuary 1 of next year.\n  My colleagues should understand that the Kerry-Hatch bill would not \nrequire that new housing units have Internet or broadband capability; \nit is not an unfunded mandate. Rather, our bill simply adds broadband \naccess to the list of things that State agencies would have to consider \nwhen they award the credits each year. Our bill also does not specify \nany particular technology, meaning that developers and providers can \ndecide for themselves which technology will work best for a given \ncommunity.\n  This bill has the support of many well-known companies and \nassociations from the technology and telecommunications industries, \nincluding Corning, Nortel Networks, BellSouth, SmartForce, the \nTelecommunications Industry Association, Siemens, and Cisco Systems. \nThis is just a partial list. A number of well-known national nonprofit \norganizations and representatives of the housing industry, such as \nHabitat for Humanity, the National Leased Housing Association, and the \nNational Housing Conference also support the bill. Senator Hatch and I \nhope that the Finance Committee, of which we are both members, will \nconsider adding this provision when it marks up charity-related \nlegislation later this month. There is no revenue cost associated with \nthe bill, making it more likely that the committee will be able to \ninclude it.\n  Several States are running ahead of the Federal Government and are \nenacting their own local policies to do what the Kerry-Hatch \nlegislation will do nationally. To date, the States of Oregon and \nNebraska have re-written their\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\npolicies with technical assistance from One Economy Corporation, a \nnational nonprofit organization that works to bring technology to low-\nincome populations and make that technology a tool to help them build \nassets and raise their standards of living. Oregon and Nebraska now \nhave an incentive for broadband in awarding the low-income credits. \nDialogues are currently underway with housing finance agencies from the \nStates of North Carolina, Michigan, Kentucky, and Minnesota, several of \nwhich may change their policies very soon.\n  Understandably, there may be some Senators that believe that building \naccess to broadband technology into these new low-income housing units \nwill be prohibitively expensive. Well, I am happy to report that this \nis not so. Engineers from Cisco Systems have evaluated the costs of \nwiring buildings at the time of construction. When wiring a new \nbuilding, the baseline cost to run telecommunications infrastructure \ninto a unit, a fixed cost in new construction, is approximately $150. \nWhen adding conduit for high-speed connectivity, the cost increases \nanywhere between $1 and $25. So for a 50-unit building, that's an added \ncost of about $1,250 if you assume the highest cost. This is likely to \nbe less than one-quarter of 1 percent of total construction costs, a \nsmall increase that is more than offset by the increased value of the \nproperty. The added cost is insignificant, and the added value is \ngreat.\n\n  This legislation is critical because having access to and \nunderstanding of technology is increasingly a prerequisite for \nsucceeding in today's knowledge-based economy. Technology can be a \nsignificant tool to help low-income families move up and out of \npoverty. I believe that this small change to section 42 of the tax code \nwill help to close the digital divide in the United States by getting \nmodern technology into the homes of more low-income Americans.\n  Recently, some influential opinion leaders in Washington and the \npress have begun to ``debunk'' the digital divide. They claim that \nsince so many more people have access to technology in the workplace, \nthe percentage of families with incomes between $15,000 and $25,000 \nthat now use computers at home or in the workplace is now close to 50 \npercent, concerns about the digital divide are overstated.\n  These statistics only tell part of the story, because there are key \nInternet services that people will only feel comfortable using at home \ndue to privacy concerns, such as those related to one's health or \npersonal finance. Access to computers in the workplace is not \nsufficient. Sure some people might check out Yahoo when they have a \nfree moment at work. They might perform an Internet search, check \ndriving directions on MapQuest, or bid on something on eBay. But they \nare not going to seek financial advice, research their kids' health, or \ndo anything of a truly personal nature from the workplace. And in terms \nof computer use in the home, there is still a huge digital divide: Even \nwith all of the technological advances and price reductions of the past \nfew years, less than 30 percent of households earning under $35,000 are \nonline at home. In fact, more than one-quarter of zip codes with median \nincomes under $35,000 do not have a single high-speed Internet \nsubscriber, despite the fact that the services are available. In my \nopinion, this is a real problem if we want these millions of Americans \nto participate in the Information Economy and access the online \nservices that the rest of us take for granted.\n  Here are some real stories from the Columbia Heights neighborhood \nhere in Washington, brought to my attention by One Economy Corporation, \nthat speak to the power of access to technology in the home: A mother \nof three young children uses her computer to take an online course to \nget A+ Certification from the Department of Employment Services. Having \na computer at home means that she can take the classes online at night \nwhen her kids are asleep. Once she has the certification she will \nqualify for a better, higher-paying job; a young woman in her mid-20s \nuses her home computer to look for jobs and pursue educational \nopportunities. After September 11, she went online to find people to \ntalk to for support; and a 50-something grandmother has a three-year \nold grandson who suffers from recurring ear infections. The doctor said \nthat the little boy needed to get an operation to put tubes in his \nears. His grandmother used the computer to research this treatment on \nthe Internet and ultimately decide that it was the best thing for her \ngrandson. When asked what she would have done without the Internet, she \nsaid that she would have ``left it up to God.''\n  These are just a few examples. The central point is that access to \ncomputers and Internet technology in the workplace is no substitute for \nhaving similar access in the home.\n  Another important issue to consider is the amount of time that many \nfamilies of modest means spend interacting with public agencies. I've \nbeen told that can often be as high as 10 hours a month, sometimes \nmore. Many of these services could undoubtedly be provided online, \nwhich would allow parents to spend more time at work and less waiting \non line. Parents would also be able to spend more time with their \nchildren. In other words, Internet access at home could alleviate some \nof the stresses in these families' daily lives. I guess the best way to \nput it is: Being online is far better than waiting on a line.\n  I look forward to promoting this important bill in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I would like to take a moment to speak about the housing crisis in \nthe country more generally.\n  My colleagues know that I have spoken frequently on the Senate floor \nabout the lack of affordable housing throughout the country. Recent \nchanges in the housing market have further limited the availability of \nhousing, while the growth in our economy over the last decade has \ndramatically increased the cost of the housing that remains. Many \nworking families have been unable to keep up with these increased \ncosts.\n  While the bill I am introducing today does not specifically address \nthe supply of housing, I want to reiterate my concern about and \ndedication to this issue. The low-income housing tax credit is only one \ntool, but is an effective one, generating about 85,000 new housing \nunits per year. It is an important program, but it only helps a small \nfraction of the more than 5 million American households that the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development estimates to have ``worst \ncase'' housing needs, an increase of 12 percent since 1990. Many of \nthese families are spending more than half their income on housing, or \nare living in severely substandard housing. On average, a person needs \nto earn more than $11 per hour just to afford the median rent on a two-\nbedroom apartment in the United States. This hourly figure is \ndramatically higher in many metropolitan areas, an hourly wage of $22 \nis needed in San Francisco; $21 on Long Island; $17 in Boston; $16 in \nthe D.C. area; $14 in Seattle and Chicago; and, $13 in Atlanta. I have \nmentioned these statistics before. In fact, there is not one \nmetropolitan area in the country where a minimum wage earner can afford \nto pay the rent for a two-bedroom apartment. A person trying to live in \nBoston would have to make more than $35,000 annually just to afford \nsuch a home. This means teachers, janitors, social workers, police \nofficers, and other full-time workers may have trouble affording even a \nmodest place to live, segregating our communities by class and \noccupation.\n  We can no longer ignore the lack of affordable housing, and the \nimpact it is having on families and children around the country. It is \nnot clear to me why this crisis has not caused more concern here in \nCongress. How many families need to be pushed out of their homes and \ninto the streets before action is taken? Do we not act because these \npeople vote less often, or because they don't give to political \ncampaigns? Do we not believe that most of these Americans would prefer \nmore affordable housing to the measly tax cut they received in last \nyear's tax bill?\n  I believe it is time for our Nation to take a new path, one that \nensures that every American has the opportunity to live in decent and \nsafe housing. Everyone knows that decent housing plays an enormous role \nin shaping young lives, and we need to do more to address this quiet, \nbut simmering, crisis. While the bill I am introducing today with \nSenator Hatch will certainly help\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\nbring more Americans of modest means into the Information Age, it won't \nhelp those Americans with substandard housing, or no homes at all. \nAddressing that problem requires a greater commitment from all of us, \nand our mayors and Governors back home will all thank us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Domenici, \n        Mr. Cleland, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 2480. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to exempt \nqualified current and former law enforcement officers from state laws \nprohibiting the carrying of concealed handguns; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation \nto permit current and retired Federal, State and local law enforcement \nofficers to carry a concealed firearm, the Law Enforcement Officers \nSafety Act of 2002. I am pleased that Senators Hatch, Baucus, Domenici, \nCleland, McConnell, and Sessions are joining me as original cosponsors \nin this effort to make our communities safer and to protect law \nenforcement officers and their families.\n  I am introducing this companion measure to H.R. 218 at the request of \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, which strongly supports this legislation \nto protect officers and their families from vindictive criminals and to \npermit officers to respond immediately to a crime when off duty. Many \nof my friends in the law enforcement community believe that national \nlegislation is necessary due to the patchwork of conceal-carry laws in \nState and local jurisdictions, and that off-duty and retired officers \nshould be permitted to carry their firearms across state and other \njurisdictional lines.\n  Our bipartisan bill will allow thousands of equipped, trained and \ncertified law enforcement officers continually to serve and protect our \ncommunities, regardless of jurisdiction, at no cost to taxpayers. This \nbill is designed to promote better law enforcement and improved public \nsafety.\n  Our legislation would permit qualified law enforcement officers and \nqualified retired law enforcement officers across the nation to carry \nconcealed firearms in most situations. The bill, however, preserves any \nState law that permits citizens from restricting a concealed firearm on \nprivate property and preserves any State law that restricts the \npossession of a firearm on State or local government property. While I \nsupport this approach to strike a proper balance between providing law \nenforcement officers with the uniformity in the law needed to protect \npublic safety, I still have some federalism concerns about the \nlegislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues as the bill \nmoves through the legislative process to further preserve essential \nrights of the states.\n  To qualify for the bill's uniform standards a law enforcement officer \nmust be authorized to use a firearm by the law enforcement agency where \nhe or she works, be in good standing with that agency, and meet any \nstandards established by that agency to regularly qualify to use a \nfirearm. A qualified retired law enforcement officer under the bill \nmust have retired in good standing, been employed at least five years \nas a law enforcement officer unless forced to retire due to a service-\nrelated injury, have a non-forfeitable right to benefits under the law \nenforcement agency's retirement plan, and annually complete a State-\napproved firearms training course. As a result, our bipartisan \nlegislation maintains the State or local jurisdiction's power to \ndetermine whether a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement \nofficer is qualified in the use of a firearm.\n  Representative Randy Cunningham introduced a similar bill in the \nHouse, H.R. 218, which has garnered more than 250 bipartisan \ncosponsors. In 1999, the House of Representatives adopted similar \nlegislation, by a vote of 372-53, as a floor amendment during its gun \nsafety debate before the overall legislation was defeated. I applaud my \ncolleagues in the other legislative body for such strong bipartisan \nshowing of support for this legislation.\n  As a former state prosecutor, I know that law enforcement officers \nare never ``off-duty.'' They are dedicated public servants trained to \nuphold the law and keep the peace. When there is a threat to the peace \nor to our public safety, law enforcement officers are sworn to answer \nthat call. Our legislation enables law enforcement officers across the \ncountry to be armed and prepared when they answer that call, no matter \nwhere or when it comes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Law Enforcement Officers Safety \nAct to make our communities safer and to protect law enforcement \nofficers and their families.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise along with Senator Leahy and \nothers to introduce the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2002. \nThis bill, which exempts qualified active and retired law enforcement \nofficers from certain local and State prohibitions on the carrying of \nconcealed firearms, will help protect the American public, our Nation's \nofficers and their families.\n  Over the past several Congresses, Senator Campbell has been a leader \nin this area. As a former deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, \nCalifornia, he has a first-hand understanding of the challenges law \nenforcement officers face as they cross state lines. Last March, he \nintroduced a similar bill, S. 442, the Law Enforcement Protection Act \nof 2001, which I co-sponsored. I will continue to support S. 442 as we \nseek to enact such legislation during this Congress.\n  Like S. 442, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2002 permits \nqualified law enforcement officers and retired officers to carry, with \nthe appropriate identification, a concealed firearm that has been \nshipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce regardless of \nState or local laws. However, like S. 442, this bill does not supersede \nany State law that permits private persons to prohibit or restrict the \npossession of concealed weapons on their properties, or prohibits or \nrestricts the possession of firearms on any State or local government \nproperties, installations, buildings, bases or parks. Additionally, \nboth bills clearly define what is meant by ``qualified law enforcement \nofficer'' and ``qualified retired [or former] law enforcement officer'' \nto ensure that those individuals permitted to carry concealed firearms \nare highly trained professionals.\n  Such legislation not only will provide law enforcement officers with \na legal means to protect themselves and their families when they travel \ninterstate, it will also provide added security to the American public. \nBy enabling qualified active duty and retired law enforcement officers \nto carry firearms while off-duty, retired or outside their own \njurisdictions, more trained law enforcement officers will be on our \nstreets to enforce the law and to respond to crises.\n  I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis with my colleagues in \nboth Houses to ensure that this legislation is enacted into law.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 2481. A bill to amend the Communications Act and the Miscellaneous \nAppropriations Act, 200, to require auction of 700 megahertz spectrum \nin compliance with existing statutory deadlines and to give the Federal \nCommunications Commission discretion to set the auction date for all \nother spectrum auctions in the future; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, several years ago, after a period had \ngone by wherein spectrum available to the FCC to relicense had been \ninvolved in a lottery process, I suggested that we auction spectrum. \nAnd after some time passed, Congress did see fit to follow that \nsuggestion, and we have been having spectrum auctions by the FCC.\n  There is currently pending the auction of spectrum in the 747 to 762 \nmegahertz and 777 to 792 megahertz bands. That has been postponed \nseveral times now, and I think that is wrong.\n  I do believe spectrum should be made available, in a competitive \nprocess, to those people who want to use it, and to improve our \neconomy, to put into effect new technologies. But it should not be used \njust for speculation. And it should not be auctioned just because of \nmarket demands for spectrum, per se, in order to get the Government the \nhighest level of return for the spectrum.\n  The highest level of return to the taxpayers, in the long run, comes \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\ndeveloping the spectrum, from enhancing the economy, and providing a \nlong period of development for new technologies and new income streams, \nwhich will provide a new tax base for the Treasury. I believe we should \nreiterate to the FCC that it has the authority to proceed.\n  I will send to the desk a bill which would create the Auction \nCompletion Timing Act, and it really is saying: Act now. The Commission \nhas its authority, and it should act within its own discretion.\n  In order that this situation may not develop again, my bill also \nsuggests future spectrum auction deadlines will be determined by the \nCommission alone, unless Congress specifically passes a law that the \nPresident signs that would interfere with that authority.\n  I believe the Federal Communications Act of 1934 should be amended to \nmake clear that notwithstanding any other provisions we put in any \nbills to the contrary in the past, the Commission may determine the \ndate of any auction conducted pursuant to section 309(j) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934, as amended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2482. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to grant to \nDeschutes and Crook Counties in the State of Oregon a right-of-way to \nWest Butte Road; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation transferring \nfrom Federal to county jurisdiction the West Butte Road, located in the \ncounties of Crook and Deschutes, Oregon. In exchange for the new right-\nof-way for the West Butte Road, Crook and Deschutes counties will \ntransfer their right-of-way on the George Millican Road to the U.S. \nDepartment of Interior Bureau of Land Management, BLM.\n  The right-of-way exchange authorized by this legislation would clear \nthe way for a paved road, pursued for more than 30 years by Prineville, \nin Crook County, OR, to connect their community with U.S. Highway 20. \nSuch a road would substantially enhance the economic development \npotential for Prineville, a community suffering from 15 percent \nunemployment, by providing an alternative route for passenger and \ncommercial traffic traveling between Portland and Boise, ID. It would \nalso encourage commerce in Prineville by efficiently directing traffic \nto the Prineville/Crook County Industrial Parks, areas set aside for \nthe sole purpose of promoting industrial diversification within Crook \nCounty. By increasing the traffic to these areas, the opportunity to \npromote and increase their occupancy would be greatly improved.\n  In addition to economic advantages, the paved road would provide \nimportant environmental benefits. It would reduce traffic congestion on \nthe overloaded highway 97 passing through Bend and Redmond, OR. It \nwould eliminate the prospect of major improvements to the Crooked River \nHighway. The Crooked River Highway follows the meander of the Crooked \nRiver, a tributary of the salmon-bearing Deschutes River. Improvement \nof that road would entail substantial impacts to riparian areas, \nexpensive bridge maintenance, and likely adverse effects to the river. \nIn contrast, the proposed new road would reclaim a straight section of \nthe old Prineville-Lakeview highway, surveyed in 1915, which crosses \nflat desert lands and no riparian zones. In addition, the legislation \ndirects the BLM to propose affirmative measures to protect wildlife and \ngame habitat in the area traversed by the new road.\n  Some suggest that this legislation is not necessary because the BLM \nalready has the authority to issue a right-of-way. That may be true, \nbut it is also true that the BLM decided it can make a decision on the \ncounty right-of-way application only thought an extended process, which \nclose observers tell me could take anywhere from four to six years, \nwith no guarantee of success. I am not willing to stake Prineville's \neconomic or environmental future on such an uncertainty.\n  Improvement of the Millican/West Butte road is supported by the City \nof Prineville, Crook County, Deschutes County, the City of Bend, the \nCity of Redmond, the Oregon Department of Transportation and the \nCentral Oregon Transportation Commission. They have identified the new \nright-of-way as a means of reducing environmental impacts associated \nwith the existing road, reducing traffic congestion, improving the \nnorthwest-southeast connections between the state's wealthiest and \npoorest regions, and offering the community the chance to retain its \nlargest employers so as to address some of the economic woes of the \nregion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2483. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to direct the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration to establish a pilot \nprogram to provide regulatory compliance assistance to small business \nconcerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, in order to provide regulatory compliance \nassistance to small businesses, Senator Kerry and I are introducing the \nSenate companion bill to H.R. 203, the ``National Small Business \nRegulatory Assistance Act,'' which passed the House last year by voice \nvote. I also want to thank Senators Landrieu, Jeffords, Harkin, \nBingaman, Carnahan, Leahy, Lieberman, and Johnson for their co-\nsponsorship.\n  In today's business environment, one of the greatest obstacles \nblocking the path to prosperity for America's small businesses is \nregulatory compliance. Small businesses regularly find themselves lost \nin a maze of Federal regulations that are designed to create safer and \nhealthier workplaces. Chairman Kerry and I want all of our businesses \nto comply with the regulations that preserve the health, environment, \nand well-being of our workers and our communities. But, too often, \nsmall businesses do not have access to the information they need in \norder to comply with regulations in good faith.\n  The National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act calls for the \nestablishment of a pilot project in which 20 selected Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, SBDCs, would provide regulatory compliance \nassistance to small businesses. This pilot project would be \nadministered by the Small Business Administration, SBA, which would be \nauthorized to award grants between $150,000 and $300,000 to selected \nSBDCs. The bill also requires that the Congress receive a progress \nreport annually on the pilot program's accomplishments at each SBDC.\n  Under our legislation, SBDCs would need to form partnerships with \nFederal compliance programs, conduct educational and training \nactivities and offer free-of-charge compliance counseling to small \nbusiness owners. Further, the measure would guarantee privacy to those \nwho receive compliance assistance. This privacy provision has also been \nextended to all small businesses that seek any assistance from their \nlocal SBDC.\n  The adoption of the National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act \nwill provide small businesses with the support they need to navigate \nthe often complicated world of Federal regulations.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to join me in support of the \nNational Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act of 2002.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Max Cleland, and the cosponsors of our legislation \nin introducing the National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act.\n  The bill we are introducing today is the Senate version of H.R. 203, \nwhich bears the same name as our legislation. H.R. 203 passed the House \nby voice vote in October of last year with the strong support of the \nHouse Committee on Small Business. However, our version deals with \nseveral issues that have been raised since House passage and will help \nensure that small businesses receive the regulatory compliance \nassistance the legislation envisions.\n  I am pleased to say that we have the full support of the Association \nof Small Business Development Centers, which has been working closely \nwith us since January of this year to draft the Senate version of this \nlegislation, correcting several issues with the House passed bill. I am \nalso pleased to say that we have kept Congressman\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\nSweeney, the House sponsor, and Congressman Manzullo, chairman of the \nHouse Committee on Small Business, informed of our actions throughout \nthe process to ensure our changes would have the support of the House \ncommittee, as should be the case.\n  Small businesses, especially small businesses with few employees, \noften face a daunting task when seeking advice on how to comply with \nFederal regulations, particularly when implementation varies for \ndifferent regions of the country, or from State to State. Many small \nbusinesses fail to comply with important and needed labor and \nenvironmental regulations not because they want to break the law, but \nbecause they are unaware of the actions they need to take to comply. \nOften, small businesses are afraid to seek guidance from Federal \nagencies for fear of exposing problems at their business.\n  One important way to help small business comply with Federal \nregulations is to provide them with free, confidential advice outside \nof the normal relationship between a small business and a regulatory \nagency. The Small Business Administration's, SBA, Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, SBDC, are in a unique position to provide this \ntype of assistance.\n  Our bill establishes a pilot program to award competitive grants to \n20 selected SBDCs, two from each SBA region, which would allow these \nSBDCs to provide regulatory compliance assistance to small businesses. \nThe SBA would be authorized to award grants between $150,000 and \n$300,000, depending on the population of the SBDC's State.\n  Under our legislation, the SBDCs would need to form partnerships with \nFederal compliance programs, conduct educational and training \nactivities and offer free-of-charge compliance counseling to small \nbusiness owners. Further, the measure would guarantee privacy to those \nwho receive compliance assistance. This privacy provision has also been \nextended to all small businesses that seek any assistance from their \nlocal SBDC.\n  The legislation we are introducing today uses only SBA funds and will \nserve to complement current small business development assistance as \nwell as existing compliance assistance programs. Versions of this \nlegislation introduced in previous Congresses used Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, enforcement funds to pay for these grants.\n  Small businesses can succeed when it comes to complying with Federal \nregulations, if provided with the necessary tools and information. The \nNational Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act will go a long way \ntoward assisting our Nation's small businesses who want to comply with \nFederal Regulations.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2484. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to reauthorize and improve the operation of temporary assistance to \nneedy families programs operated by Indian tribes, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the American \nIndian Welfare Reform Act of 2002, an important step in improving the \nlives of this country's Native Americans. I am glad to be joined by \nSenators Johnson and Daschle in this effort.\n  In 1996 we enacted a sweeping welfare reform law. It was a long-past-\ndue fundamental change and ended a failed system for helping low-income \nfamilies in America. I was a strong supporter of that law. This year, \nwe are reauthorizing it. As we in the Finance Committee have reviewed \nthe evidence I have been struck by how successful it has been. The \nranks of those dependent on welfare in this country has been reduced by \nhalf in just five years. There is more to be done, of course. Child \npoverty has declined but not by as much as the fall in the welfare \ncaseload, for example. I am at work with my Finance Committee colleague \nSenator Grassley on comprehensive legislation to renew and improve the \n1996 law.\n  One important aspect of the 1996 law which is often overlooked is \nthat it didn't just devolve authority to States, it also permitted \nIndian tribes to operate their own welfare programs for the first time. \nThe new welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, \nis very flexible. Tribes can take advantage of that flexibility to \ndesign culturally-appropriate programs to move people from welfare to \nwork. This is smart policy and is consistent with the important value \nof tribal sovereignty. I support it.\n  My own State of Montana is home to several tribes and I have given \nmuch thought to how we can build upon the provisions of the 1996 \nwelfare law to help them and their members. Too often in Montana, and \nelsewhere, poverty has an Indian face. The numbers are cold and hard. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, 25 percent of American Indians live in \npoverty, more than twice the national poverty rate. The average \nhousehold income for Indians in 2000 was only 75 percent of that of the \nrest of Americans. This is simply not right. We must do better. Welfare \nreform needs to work for everyone.\n  Luckily, the provisions of the 1996 law provide a good start. Now we \nmust build upon them. The legislation I introduce today, the product of \nextensive dialogue and consultation, does that in several important \nways.\n  First, more than 30 tribes, including the Confederated Salish-\nKootenai and Fort Belknap tribes of Montana, have taken advantage of \nthe opportunity to operate their own TANF programs. This bill contains \nprovisions to help those tribes improve their programs. For example, \ntribes operating TANF are not eligible for the TANF high performance \nbonus or the TANF contingency fund while state TANF programs are. This \noversight is rectified by this bill.\n\n  Second, there are many tribes interested in operating TANF programs \nwhich do not believe the current set-up allows them to do so. They want \nto exercise their sovereignty and adapt their program to better fit the \nneeds of their people. We should help them do so. To that end, I \nproposed creating a new grant fund to improve tribal governmental \ncapacity. We have funded State administrative capacity for decades, \nhelping states buy computer systems and train workers. We should do the \nsame for tribal human services administration. Under this bill, a tribe \nwhich wants to operate TANF but needs to upgrade its computers to do it \ncould receive the funding it needs, which will enable it to take over \nTANF.\n  Third, there are some tribes not interested in running a TANF program \nor a long time from being able to do it. Their low-income families will \ncontinue to receive assistance from State programs. I have included \nprovisions to facilitate State-tribe dialogue in these cases so that \nthe state can better understand the unique circumstances of each Indian \nreservation. We must ensure all Indian families are able to get help \nwhen they need it.\n  Finally, there is the all-important issue of economic development. A \nGeneral Accounting Office review of Census Bureau data found that 25 of \nthe 26 counties in the U.S. with a majority of American Indians had \npoverty rates ``significantly'' higher than average. Welfare reform is \nabout moving people to work. On most of our Indian reservations there \nis simply far too little work to be had. Like everyone else, Indians \nwant to work. We need to do better in giving them the opportunity.\n  This legislation provides tribes with an expanded authority to issue \nbonds, which will encourage additional economic activity on \nreservations, such as housing construction. This means more jobs, as \nwell as a better quality of life. It also includes grants to help \ntribes improve their own economic development strategies. Tribes with \nuniform commercial codes and effective micro-enterprise programs can \nsee more business activity on their lands. This bill helps tribes helps \nthemselves. We need to let Indians find their own way to prosperity, \nnot impose top-down strategies. But we must make sure they have the \ntools to get there.\n  This is an important bill. It includes other key provisions. One is a \nfine bill originally introduced by Senators Daschle and McCain to allow \ntribes to receive direct Federal reimbursement for operating foster \ncare programs. Another provision funds research on tribal welfare \nreform programs so we can learn what works as well as providing funds \nfor ``peer-learning'' so that tribes can learn from one another. I am a\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\nstrong supporter of welfare reform. We need to make sure it works for \neveryone. This bill does not.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        The American Indian Welfare Reform Act of 2002--Summary\n\n\n                              I. Findings\n\n       The Federal Government bears a unique trust responsibility \n     for American Indians. Despite this responsibility, Indians \n     remain remarkably impoverished. According to the Census \n     Bureau, 25.9 percent of American Indians live in poverty, \n     more than twice the national poverty rate. The average \n     household income for Indians in 2000 was only 75 percent of \n     that of the rest of Americans. In some States with \n     substantial Indian populations the welfare caseload has \n     become increasingly Indian because it has been harder for \n     Indians to leave welfare for work. A General Accounting \n     Office review of Census Bureau data found that 25 of the 26 \n     counties in the U.S. with a majority of American Indians had \n     poverty rates ``significantly'' higher than average. Further, \n     many Indian tribes are located in isolated rural areas, far \n     from economic opportunity. Welfare reform has not brought \n     enough change to Indian Country.\n\n\n                  II. The Tribal TANF Improvement Fund\n\n       The 1996 welfare reform law permits tribes to opt to \n     operate their own Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, \n     TANF, programs. A new Tribal TANF Improvement Fund of $500 \n     million, to be available for five years, would be created to \n     build upon these programs and allow more tribes to start \n     them. It would have four parts:\n       Tribal Capacity Grants.--State governments have benefitted \n     from decades of federal investment in their administrative \n     capacity, particularly in their information management \n     systems. $225 million of the Fund would be reserved for \n     grants to improve tribal human services program \n     infrastructure, with a priority for management information \n     systems and training. Tribes applying to operate TANF would \n     be given priority. Tribes already operating TANF or applying \n     to operate IV-E foster care programs with direct federal \n     funding would also be eligible for grants. HHS would be \n     required to assure that tribes of all sizes received funding \n     and to maximize the number of tribes which receive funding. \n     Tribes would be eligible for one grant per year.\n       Adjusted Tribal TANF Grants.--Tribes which take over \n     operation of TANF often experience significant increases in \n     caseload as poor families apply for help for the first time \n     because they are more comfortable asking assistance from the \n     tribe or simply because they are more able to access \n     services. Yet tribal TANF allocations are based on estimates \n     of Indians served by state programs in 1994, which can leave \n     the tribe facing funding levels which are too low. To better \n     support families in tribal TANF programs, $140 million of the \n     fund would be reserved for grants to tribal TANF programs \n     where the tribe can demonstrate it has a significantly higher \n     true caseload than originally estimated. Tribes with cash \n     assistance caseloads two years after beginning operation of a \n     TANF no program which are 20 percent higher than originally \n     estimated would be eligible for additional funding. The \n     funds would be allocated proportionate to a tribe's size \n     and service population as well as the caseload increase, \n     on the basis of a formula to be determined by HHS in \n     consultation with tribes. The funding level would be $35 \n     million per year, from FY 2004-2007.\n       Tribal TANF MOE Incentive.--A key factor in tribes being \n     able to operate TANF programs has been the willingness and \n     ability of states to contribute funding as part of the \n     broader state maintenance of effort, MOE, requirement. To \n     encourage states to do this, up to an additional $120 million \n     would be available for ``rebates'' of TANF funds to states \n     which provide MOE support to tribal TANF programs. For each \n     $1 in MOE funds provided, the federal government would \n     provide an additional 30 cents in TANF funding to the state. \n     If funding is insufficient, HHS would provide pro-rata \n     funding to ensure each state contributing MOE receives a \n     share of the incentive funds.\n       Technical Assistance.--HHS would receive $15 million to \n     provide technical assistance to tribes. At least $5 million \n     on these funds would be reserved to support peer-learning \n     programs among tribal administrators and at least $7.5 \n     million would be reserved for grants to tribes to conduct \n     feasibility studies of their capacity to operate TANF.\n\n\n   III. Tribal TANF High Performance Fund and Contingency Fund Access\n\n       There are separate sources of funding within TANF that \n     tribes do not have the ability to access. To better support \n     tribal TANF programs, three percent of the current TANF \n     ``high performance'' bonus, or $6 million/year, would be \n     reserved for distribution to tribal TANF programs. The \n     criteria would be determined by HHS through consultation with \n     tribes, but should involve effectiveness in moving TANF \n     recipients into employment and self-sufficiency. In addition, \n     $25 million of the $2 billion TANF Contingency fund would be \n     reserved for tribal TANF programs operating in situations of \n     increased economic hardship. The criteria for tribal access \n     to the Contingency Fund would also be determined by HHS \n     through consultation with the tribes, but would include a \n     worsening economic condition and loss of reservation \n     employers. In addition, current restrictions on the use of \n     ``carryover'' TANF funds would be eliminated, permitting \n     tribes to spend prior year TANF funds with just as much \n     flexibility as current year TANF funds.\n\n\n                        IV. Economic Development\n\n       There are three elements in the bill to stimulate more \n     economic activity on economically-depressed reservations.\n       Expanded Tribal Authority To Issue Tax-Exempt Private \n     Activity Bonds.--Currently, tribes have a limited authority \n     to issue private activity bonds for ``essential'' \n     governmental functions and for certain manufacturing-related \n     purposes. This provision would allow bonds to be used for \n     residential rental properties and qualified mortgage \n     bonds, spurring construction. In addition, tribes could \n     allocate authority for financing businesses that would \n     qualify as enterprise zone businesses if the reservation \n     were a zone. All property financed would have to be on the \n     reservation of the issuing tribal government and qualified \n     tribal governments would have to have an unemployment rate \n     of at least 20 percent. Casinos and certain other forms of \n     businesses could not be financed by the bonds. The \n     authority would be for calendar years 2003-2007, and up to \n     $10 million total would be available for each qualifying \n     tribe.\n       Tribal Development Grants.--A key part of tribal economic \n     development is the investment climate on the reservation. \n     Tribes with clear legal codes and which encourage micro-\n     enterprise activities are more likely to generate economic \n     growth. To facilitate this, the Administration for Native \n     Americans within HHS would receive $50 million to distribute \n     in grants to tribes, tribal organizations and non-profit \n     organizations to provide technical assistance to tribes in \n     the areas of: development and improvement of uniform \n     commercial codes; creating or expanding small business or \n     micro-enterprise programs; development and improvement of \n     tort liability codes; creating or expanding tribal marketing \n     efforts; for-profit collaborative business networks; and \n     telecommunications.\n       Job Access and Reverse Commute Grants.--A lack of \n     transportation often hinders tribal economic development. To \n     help address this need, tribes would be made directly \n     eligible to receive Job Access and Reverse Commute grants \n     from the federal Department of Transportation, which would \n     permit tribes to pursue innovative TANF strategies around \n     transportation. A tribal set-aside of 3 percent would be \n     established in the program. Matching funds could be provided \n     by tribes on an in-kind basis or with other federal funds, \n     such as TANF.\n\n\n                    V. Tribal Job Training Programs\n\n       There are currently two tribal job training programs, the \n     NEW program and Welfare-to-Work grantees. To simplify and \n     better co-ordinate programs, a new Tribal Employment Services \n     Program, TESP, would be created in the Department of Labor by \n     combining the two programs. It would be funded at $37 million \n     annually and distributed to current Tribal NEW and Welfare-\n     to-Work grantees as well as new applicants. TESP funds could \n     be used for employment training efforts for those on, or at-\n     risk of being on, public assistance. Tribes could also use \n     the funds to assist non-custodial parents of children on, or \n     at risk of being on, public assistance. To encourage state-\n     tribal partnerships, TANF funds transferred to tribal TESP \n     programs would be governed by TESP rules, not TANF rules. The \n     bill also clarifies that the single plan, single budget, and \n     single reporting requirements of PL 102-477 should be \n     respected.\n\n\n                         VI. Tribal Child Care\n\n       The availability and quality of child care is basic to the \n     success of welfare reform. Tribal welfare reform efforts are \n     no exception. The tribal set-aside within the Child Care \n     Development Block Grant, CCDBG, would be increased to 5 \n     percent to better support tribal welfare reform programs. HHS \n     would be required to go through a negotiated rulemaking \n     process, in consultation with tribal representatives, to \n     determine an equitable allocation of funds among tribes. In \n     addition, each tribe receiving CCDBG funding would develop \n     their own health and safety standards, subject to approval of \n     HHS. Tribal child care programs would have additional \n     authority to use funds for construction and renovation.\n\n\n                         VII. Equitable Access\n\n       Many American Indians are--and will continue to be--served \n     by state TANF programs. States will be required to consult \n     with tribes within their borders on TANF state plans. Under \n     current law, States are required to provide ``equitable \n     access'' to services for Indians. State and tribal TANF plans \n     would be required to describe how ``equitable access'' is \n     provided to encourage better state-tribal co-operation. HHS \n     would also be required to include in the annual TANF report \n     to Congress state-specific information on the demographics \n     and case load characteristics of Indians served by state TANF \n     programs.\n       In addition, HHS would be required to convene a new \n     advisory committee on the status of non-reservation Indians. \n     Too little is known about how these Indians are faring. The \n     committee is to make recommendations for ensuring these \n     Indians receive appropriate assistance. The committee would \n     include Federal, State, and tribal representatives as well as \n     representatives of Indians\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\n     not residing on reservations. A majority of those on the \n     committee should be representatives of Indians not residing \n     on reservations. GAO would also be required to conduct a \n     study of the demographics of Indians not residing on \n     reservations, including economic and health information, as \n     well as reviewing their access to public benefits.\n\n\n                           VIII. Joblessness\n\n       As acknowledged by the 1996 welfare law, the federal time \n     limit on assistance is not an appropriate policy on Indian \n     reservations with severe unemployment. This provision would \n     be adjusted so that the time limit will not apply during \n     months where the joblessness is above 20 percent, provided \n     that TANF recipients are not in sanction status. In addition, \n     in these areas of high joblessness, states would have \n     flexibility to define work activities required for TANF \n     participants, provided the recipient is participating in \n     activities in accordance with an Individual Responsibility \n     Plan and the state has included information in its state plan \n     describing its policies in Indian Country areas of high \n     joblessness. Tribal TANF programs already have flexibility in \n     work activity definition.\n\n\n                         IX. Alaska provisions\n\n       The 1996 provision limits the ability of tribes in Alaska \n     to design and operate programs. These provisions involving \n     differential treatment for Alaskan Natives, such as those \n     requiring tribal TANF programs to be ``comparable'' to the \n     state program, would be removed.\n\n\n                     X. Tribal Foster Care Programs\n\n       Due to a long-standing oversight, tribes are not allowed to \n     receive direct federal reimbursement when they operate foster \n     care programs to take care of abused and neglected children. \n     The provisions of S. 550, the Daschle-McCain legislation to \n     rectify this oversight and allow tribes to receive direct \n     federal funding to operate foster care programs, are \n     included.\n\n\n                  XI. Food Stamps, Medicaid, and SCHIP\n\n       Tribes operating TANF programs would be given clear \n     authority to perform eligibility determination for Food \n     Stamps, Medicaid, and SCHIP. Quality control measures in each \n     program would apply to tribes making such decisions, although \n     states and tribes may negotiate separate agreements on these \n     measures.\n\n\n                     XII. Child Support Enforcement\n\n       HHS would be required to promulgate final regulations \n     concerning tribal child support programs within one year of \n     enactment.\n\n\n                XIII. Social Services Block Grant, SSBG\n\n       When funding for SSBG exceeds $2.4 billion in a year, $10 \n     million plus 2 percent of all funds beyond $2.4 billion is \n     reserved for tribes. All tribes operating social service \n     programs would be eligible for a share. HHS is required to \n     develop a distribution formula through a consultation process \n     with the tribes.\n\n\n                             XIV. Research\n\n       $2 million would be provided to HHS for research on tribal \n     welfare programs and efforts to reduce poverty among American \n     Indians in general. To expend the funds, HHS would first have \n     to issue a planned course of research and consultation with \n     the tribes. Research funding applicants which propose to \n     include tribal governments and tribal colleges in their work \n     would have priority.\n\n\n                       XV. Faith-Based Initiative\n\n       The HHS Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives \n     would be required to convene an advisory committee of Indians \n     expert in social services and the spiritual aspects of \n     traditional Indian cultures. This committee shall issue a \n     report within 18 months of enactment with ``best practices'' \n     advice for tribal and state TANF administrators.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Miller, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mrs. Carnahan, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2486. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to limit \nthe deduction for advertising of FDA approved prescription drugs by the \nmanufacturer of such drugs to the level of such manufacturer's research \nand development expenditures, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fair Advertising \nand Increased Research Act, the FAIR Act. The FAIR Act is designed to \nlower prescription drug prices by limiting taxpayer subsidies to \npharmaceutical companies for advertising to those for research and \ndevelopment. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators \nDaschle, Miller, Durbin, Carnahan, and Wellstone.\n  American taxpayers contribute about $16 billion a year to drug \nresearch through the National Institutes of Health. But what do they \nget for their investment? They get the highest drug prices in the \nworld.\n  At the same time, drug companies spend nearly $16 billion a year on \nadvertising, marketing and promotion of prescription drugs. What does \nthis mean for Americans? It means life-saving drugs become \nunaffordable. And unaffordable means unavailable or it means making \ncruel choices. For seniors it can mean choosing between food and \nmedicine.\n  We need to do something to address excessive advertising that leads \nto higher and higher prescription drug prices. The FAIR Act will help \ndo so. Simply, it will limit pharmaceutical companies' deduction of \nannual expenditures for advertising, promoting or marketing--in any \nmedium--of any Food and Drug Administration approved prescription drug \nto the amount of research and development expenditures in any taxable \nyear. For example, if a company spends $110 million on advertising, \npromoting or marketing FDA approved prescription drugs and but spends \nonly $100 million on research and development in one year, the company \nwould not be able to deduct $10 million of advertising expenses in that \nyear. Any savings resulting from this legislation will be credited to \nthe Medicare Trust Fund.\n  This is necessary because recent evidence shows that advertising, \nmarketing and promotion of prescription drugs is out of control. \nAccording to an analysis of company earnings reports, the top 11 \npharmaceutical spend 30 percent of their revenues on advertising, \nmarketing, promotion, and administration and only 12 percent on \nresearch and development. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies have \ndramatically increased their direct-to-consumer advertising by 300 \npercent from 1996 to 2000. Direct to consumer advertising includes all \nof those television, radio and print ads you see and hear daily.\n  I would like to provide one example of excessive advertising to \ndemonstrate the need of this legislation. In the year 2000, Merck spent \n$160 million advertising Vioxx, a drug to treat arthritis. This is more \nthan PepsiCo spent on promoting Pepsi--$125 million--and more than \nAnheuser-Busch allocated to get the American people to buy Budweiser--\n$136 million.\n  This bill does not prevent the pharmaceutical companies from \nadvertising as much as they want. Under our Constitution, they are free \nto do so. All we are seeking to do is limit how much the taxpayers \nshould subsidize this advertising. We think the logical limit should be \nthe amount that companies spend on research in a given year.\n  While there is much compelling evidence that pharmaceutical companies \nspend more on advertising, marketing, and promotion than research and \ndevelopment, the trade association representing these businesses, \nPhRMA, claims that they spend more on research than on advertising. If \nthis is true, then the pharmaceutical lobbyists should support this \nmeasure because it will not affect them and would only set a reasonable \nparameter for advertising in the future.\n  We have to do something about spiraling prescription drug prices. \nThis bill is a step in that direction. It will seek to stop taxpayer \nsubsidies for excessive advertising and lower the price we pay for \nprescription drugs at our local pharmacy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Advertising and \n     Increased Research (FAIR) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 263\n\n       Whereas the United States recognized the Republic of \n     Croatia on April 7, 1992, acknowledging the decision of the \n     Croatian people to live in an independent, democratic, and \n     sovereign country;\n       Whereas, during the 10 years since the recognition, the \n     people of Croatia have overcome the legacy of the autocratic \n     Tudjman government and persevered in building a democratic \n     society, based on the rule of law, respect for human rights, \n     and a free market economy, as shown by the democratic \n     parliamentary and presidential elections held in January and \n     February 2000;\n       Whereas the people and Government of the Republic of \n     Croatia share the democratic values of the international \n     community and the responsibility to uphold them, actively \n     promoting democratic values in international organizations;\n       Whereas Croatia, cooperating on the basis of partnership \n     and solidarity, participates in the Vilnius Group, which is \n     committed to the common values of security and democratic \n     stability through future North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     membership;\n       Whereas Croatia is a reliable friend and ally of the United \n     States, actively contributing to the stabilization of South \n     Central Europe; and\n       Whereas Croatia immediately positioned itself within the \n     antiterrorism coalition of nations, sharing the common \n     interests and values of the free and democratic world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Republic of Croatia for the significant \n     progress it has made during the past decade, and encourages \n     its democratic orientation and further strengthening of \n     respect for human rights, the rule of law, and the free \n     market;\n       (2) supports the Republic of Croatia's aspirations to \n     become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO), welcomes its commitment to the reforms required for \n     NATO membership, acknowledges the importance of its continued \n     commitment to those reforms, and recommends its acceptance \n     into the Membership Action Plan at the NATO Ministerial in \n     Reykjavik, Iceland in May 2002;\n       (3) encourages Croatia's continued contributions in \n     bringing peace, stability, and prosperity to the region of \n     South Central Europe, including continuing its cooperation \n     with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \n     Yugoslavia; and\n       (4) recognizes the important role of the Croatian-American \n     community in supporting the strengthening of bilateral \n     relations between the United States and the Republic of \n     Croatia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4078-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4078-S4079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 264--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT SMALL \nBUSINESS PARTICIPATION IS VITAL TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR NATION, AND THAT \nFEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD AGGRESSIVELY SEEK OUT AND \n   PURCHASE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES FROM AMERICAN SMALL \n BUSINESSES TO HELP IN HOMELAND DEFENSE AND THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Bond) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship:\n\n                              S. Res. 264\n\n       Whereas on September 11, 2001, the people of the United \n     States were subject to the worst terrorist attack in American \n     history;\n       Whereas in October 2001, the Pentagon's Technical Support \n     Working Group, which is responsible for seeking new \n     technologies to assist the military, sent an urgent plea, \n     seeking ideas on how to fight terrorism;\n       Whereas in just 2 months, over 12,500 ideas were submitted \n     to the Technical Support Working Group, most of them from \n     small businesses;\n       Whereas small businesses remain the most innovative sector \n     of the United States economy, accounting for the vast \n     majority of new product ideas and technological innovations; \n     and\n       Whereas despite their achievements, small businesses often \n     have difficulty marketing and supplying goods and services to \n     Federal, State, and local governments: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) small business participation is vital to the defense of \n     the United States and should play an active role in assisting \n     the United States military, Federal intelligence and law \n     enforcement agencies, and State and local police forces to \n     combat terrorism through the design and development of \n     innovative products; and\n       (2) Federal, State, and local governments should \n     aggressively seek out and purchase innovative technologies \n     and services from, and promote research opportunities for, \n     American small businesses to help in homeland defense and the \n     fight against terrorism.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to submit a Resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that small business participation is \nvital to the defense of our Nation, and that Federal, State, and local \ngovernments should aggressively seek out and purchase innovative \ntechnologies and services from American small businesses to help in \nhomeland defense and the fight against terrorism.\n  Since the events of September 11, the people of our Nation have come \ntogether in many ways to help protect our land and its citizens. \nWhether it is the high number of individuals signing up to become Sky \nMarshals, fighter pilots pulling letters of resignation and staying in \nthe military, expressions of pride through the display of the American \nflag or other patriot memorabilia, or the desire of innovative small \nbusinesses to sell products to the Federal Government for the fight \nagainst terrorism or for homeland defense, the ground swell of \npatriotism has been truly uplifting.\n  But today, I want to focus the attention of my colleagues on the \ncontributions being made specifically by our small businesses. \nThroughout the years, small businesses have also heard the call to arms \nand to defend the nation, and have responded through the development of \ninnovative products to protect our Nation.\n  Whether it's a need for a new type of night vision scope for a lonely \nsniper in the field, lighter materials for a Marine's backpack, more \nreliable field communications gear, or nonlethal weaponry, America's \nsmall businesses have heard the call and met the challenge.\n  Fortunately, our government has recognized the need to promote a \ndiverse defense industrial base, and since World War II, the Federal \nGovernment has actively sought to grow and maintain a thriving small \nbusiness sector. And like many policies designed to promote defense, \ngovernment policy to foster small business creation and growth has \nturned out to be a great boon for the U.S. economy. Today, small \nbusinesses represent more than 99 percent of all employers, employ 51 \npercent of private sector workers, account for 96 percent of all \nexporters of goods, and provide 75 percent of net new jobs. \nAdditionally, small businesses are more adaptable, more innovative and \nmore likely to retain and hire employees during an economic downturn \nthan their larger brethren.\n  Our government's commitment to purchasing goods and services from \nsmall businesses is a key element in creating a positive environment \nfor small business creation and growth. It results in more competition \nand increased productivity, which leads to lower prices and new \ninnovations.\n  Yet with all of these positive elements, today, we are faced with a\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nunique challenge. Budgetary pressures in the Federal Government have \nresulted in demands for faster and cheaper purchases of goods and \nservices. Federal procurement personnel have retired and not been \nreplaced, government streamlining has hurt competition by eliminating \nor severely reducing the array of small business suppliers in the \nFederal procurement arena, and contract bundling has made it \nincreasingly more difficult for small businesses to compete for \ngovernment contracts.\n  That is why, as our Nation looks for new technologies to promote \nhomeland defense and fight terrorism, small businesses should play an \nactive role.\n  I would like to commend the Pentagon's Technical Support Working \nGroup, which is responsible for seeking new technologies to assist the \nmilitary, for sending an urgent plea seeking ideas on how to fight \nterrorism. America's small businesses responded, and in just two \nmonths, over 12,500 ideas were submitted to the Technical Support \nWorking Group, most of them from small businesses.\n  This not only demonstrates the commitment of America's small \nbusinesses and demonstrates their ability to be innovative, it clearly \nshows that when the Federal Government calls for action, small \nbusinesses respond.\n  The Resolution I am introducing today, along with the support of \nSenator Bond, the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, which I chair, seeks to encourage Federal procurement \nofficials to seek out and purchase innovative technologies and services \nfrom, and promote research opportunities for, American small businesses \nto help in homeland defense and the fight against terrorism.\n  This Resolution is a precursor to the Small Business Homeland Defense \nExposition that Senator Bond and I are jointly sponsoring, which will \ntake place this July here on Capitol Hill. At the Expo, a selection of \nsmall businesses will help send the message to Federal officials that \nthey should look to small businesses for true innovations that will \nhelp us win the war against terrorism. The Expo will showcase high-\ntech, innovative products that have been developed by our nation's \nsmall businesses.\n  For the last month, Senator Bond and I have been soliciting small \nbusiness homeland defense nominees from our colleagues, so that we can \nselect truly unique products for the Expo. As expected, the response \nhas been enthusiastic and I would encourage all of my colleagues to \nattend this event so that they may see and try these products. My only \nregret is that we do not have the space available to allow every small \nbusiness to participate. However, every nominee will be included in our \nevent book highlighting these innovative small businesses.\n  I would like to conclude by once again stressing the importance of \nour Nation's small businesses, both to our economic security and our \nnational security. Supporting small businesses is supporting America.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this Resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4079-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 265--RECOGNIZING THE ELLIS ISLAND MEDAL OF HONOR AND \n       COMMENDING THE NATIONAL ETHNIC COALITION OF ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                                 S. 265\n\n       Whereas the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, established by the \n     National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations in 1986, pays \n     tribute to individuals of various ethnic origins who have \n     distinguished themselves through their contributions to the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the Ellis Island Medal of Honor has been awarded on \n     a bipartisan basis to 6 Presidents and numerous \n     Representatives and Senators;\n       Whereas the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations is \n     the largest organization of its kind in the United States, \n     representing more than 5,000,000 family members and serving \n     as an umbrella group for more than 250 organizations that \n     span the spectrum of ethnic heritage, culture, and religion;\n       Whereas the mandate of the National Ethnic Coalition of \n     Organizations is to preserve ethnic diversity, promote \n     equality and tolerance, combat injustice, and bring about \n     harmony and unity among all peoples;\n       Whereas the Ellis Island Medal of Honor is named for the \n     gateway through which more than 12,000,000 immigrants passed \n     in their quest for freedom of speech, freedom of religion, \n     and economic opportunity;\n       Whereas the Ellis Island Medal of Honor celebrates the \n     richness and diversity of American life by honoring not only \n     individuals, but the pluralism and democracy that have \n     enabled the Nation's ethnic groups to maintain their \n     identities while becoming integral parts of the American way \n     of life;\n       Whereas during the 15-year history of the Ellis Island \n     Medal of Honor, more than 1,500 individuals from scores of \n     different ethnic groups have received the Medal, and more \n     than 5,000 individuals are nominated each year for the Medal; \n     and\n       Whereas at the 2002 Ellis Island Medal of Honor ceremony in \n     New York City, individuals from different ethnic groups will \n     be honored for their contributions to the rescue and recovery \n     efforts of September 11, 2001, the war against terrorism, and \n     the enhancement of the Nation's homeland security: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for \n     acknowledging individuals who live exemplary lives as \n     Americans while preserving the values of their particular \n     ethnic groups; and\n       (2) commends the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations \n     for its--\n       (A) sponsorship of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor; and\n       (B) ongoing work to promote harmony and understanding \n     between groups.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/08/senate-section/article/S4079-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3394.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Linking \n     Educators and Developing Entrepreneurs for Reaching Success \n     Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Business incubators housed in academic settings provide \n     unique educational opportunities for students, provide \n     entrepreneurs with enhanced access to a skilled workforce, \n     and bring a wealth of resources to business, academia, and \n     communities.\n       (2) Academic affiliated incubators bridge the missions of \n     academic institutions by\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\n     bringing together education, economic development, and \n     technology commercialization efforts.\n       (3) Studies have shown that incubator tenant companies have \n     an average success rate of 87 percent, and 90 percent for \n     technology-based incubator tenant companies. These success \n     rates are dramatically higher than the success rates for \n     companies in the general economy.\n       (4) Incubator companies are also more likely to remain in \n     the same communities as they grow and to provide high paying \n     jobs and benefits to their employees.\n       (5) Business incubators help academic institutions \n     contribute to local goals of sustaining economic development \n     in their surrounding communities.\n       (6) Education in entrepreneurship and other business \n     formation skills is essential to business success and \n     sustainable economic development.\n       (7) Studies have shown that every 50 jobs created by a \n     business in an incubator generate another 25 jobs in that \n     incubator's community.\n       (8) Business incubators are of particular value in \n     communities that have seen significant job displacement due \n     to overwhelming competition from exports.\n\n     SEC. __02.
