Mr. President, I again rise to focus the Senate on an \nissue that is without question a high priority one for the Congress and \nfor the American people and one I hope we can deal with before we \nrecess or adjourn this first session of the 107th Congress. I am \ntalking about the critical need for a national energy policy.\n  For over a decade, we have wandered in the energy world without a \npolicy that truly directed our resources and our public policy toward \nassuring that our Nation was self-reliant on its primary energy \nsources. Over that time, we have grown increasingly dependent upon \nforeign sources for those primary resources.\n  As a result, if what is now going on in the Middle East were to erupt \nin a broader shooting war, it is possible we could see a curtailment of \nsupplies out of those oil-rich countries that could not only create a \ncritical crisis here but would drive up fuel prices at the pump \ndramatically. It is not happening right now. It is not happening \nlargely because of a flat economy, less use, and because the OPEC \nnations recognize that the world economy is soft at this moment and \nhave chosen not to turn the spigots on their oil wells down; therefore, \ndriving up the price.\n  It is temporary, and we all know that it is temporary. Over a year \nand a half ago, they made it very public that it was their intent to \ndrive the world price of crude oil up to $28 to $30 a barrel and to try \nto sustain that price. It is now below that.\n  It is obvious to me and to all of us who watch this issue that they \nare intentionally holding the price down because of the world economy \nand their fear of its softening.\n  That is one side of the issue. The other side of the issue for us is \na quick examination of our infrastructure and the systems of our \ninfrastructure and the failure of that to deliver the kind of energy \nour growing economy and our growing Nation needs. We saw that for \nalmost a year in California with rolling blackouts that truly crippled \nthe economy of that great State, largely because they had chosen the \nwrong policy as it related to continuing to develop energy sources and \nto upgrade the infrastructure that served the public.\n  As a result of all of that, we had a new President come to town not \nquite a year ago and say that without question one of the most critical \nneeds of this Nation is a national energy policy. He established that \nas a very high priority.\n  Well, while he was doing that, we in the Senate, and our colleagues \non the other side of the rotunda in the House, were busily working at \nthe crafting of such a policy. We have spent countless hours and over 3 \nyears in the Senate, with literally 100 or more very detailed \ninvestigative kinds of committee gatherings for the purpose of trying \nto determine how that policy ought to look, how we ought to shape it, \nand how we ought to present it to the American people.\n  All of that work has been done. In fact, the House worked rather \nquickly. They sensed the urgency, as we did, and before the August \nrecess they had produced their version of a national energy policy. It \nappeared to me--and I think to all of us--that by late fall we would \nhave a similar bill and we would be voting on it on the floor of the \nSenate because the Energy Committee, under the guidance of Chairman \nBingaman, was working its will, starting a markup. Our attempt was \ngoing to be considerably more extensive than that of the House. But \nthat work was well underway.\n  Then comes September 11. We are refocused for a moment, as you know, \nand for all the right reasons. But this Senate is not a single-action \nSenate. There are 100 Senators, and there are multiples of committees \nand lots of chairmen, and there are hundreds of staff people. Clearly, \nthe Energy Committee of the Senate should have been, and could have \nbeen, continuing its work toward the production of a bill to come to \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Then, in a rather unprecedented move, over a week and a half ago, the \nmajority leader of the Senate basically told the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee to cease and desist. No longer was he to mark up a bill and \nget it to the floor. Why? The argument was that it was politically too \ndivisive. Too divisive to talk about a national energy policy, to tell \nthe citizens that this Senate was going to work with the President to \ndevelop a policy to move us toward energy self-sufficiency, that is \ndivisive? I don't think so. I think that is leadership. I think that is \nwhat our country calls out for at this moment, and people certainly are \ngetting it in most instances.\n  But in the area of national energy policy, the leader of the Senate \nis not leading at this moment. Now he says he has instructed the \nchairman of the Energy Committee to craft a bill that they will build \nup through the office of the majority leader and it will come to the \nfloor, or it could come to the floor, or it is possible to have a vote \non it prior to a recess or adjournment of the first session.\n  Well, that is not good enough. I don't believe so. I believe a strong \nmajority of the Senate agrees with me that it is time we dealt with a \nnational energy policy and let the chips fall where they may, let the \nvotes fall where they may. As a result of that, Frank Murkowski, our \nranking member of the committee, I, having served on the committee for \na good number of years, and a lot of other folks are engaged in trying \nto craft an energy bill. It won't be as broad or expansive as it might \nhave been had we had the will to work the committee and had the \ncommittee not been instructed to stand down and desist, but we will \nintroduce that bill. We believe that can be done on Monday.\n  We are working with the administration. Now we are asking in a very \nstraightforward way, and I think an honest and responsible way, for the \nmajority leader of the Senate to give us time to bring his bill to the \nfloor; let us bring our bill to the floor and let us work out our \ndifferences. Everyone knows the issues at hand and all of us have a \npretty good idea of what a national energy policy ought to look like. \nThen we can work with the House. Prior to adjournment, or following \nadjournment, we can rest assured that a national energy policy bill \nwill be on the desk of the President of the United States, so that if \nthere is a dramatic energy shock in the future, we will have done the \nright thing. We will have prepared the country, directed our resources, \ndirected the infrastructure of this country toward the development\n\n[[Page S10807]]\n\nof a greater sense of self-reliance because my guess is that if we fail \nand gas lines mount in a time of crisis, this Senate will be scrambling \nto make up politically what they are now trying to dodge.\n\n  It is not a time for politics. We have worked very cooperatively \ntogether on a lot of issues since September 11. Energy should not be \none issue that is politicized. But by the very action of the majority \nleader himself, he is on the verge of risking that possibly happening. \nSo I ask him to honor his commitment that he made publicly--and I have \nno reason to believe he would not--to get an energy bill to the floor, \nallow us to get ours to the floor, allow us to offer amendments, and \nlet the Senate work its will. Two or three days of debate, don't we \nhave time to do that when we are standing idle, waiting for decisions \nto be made, waiting for judicial nominees to come to the floor, and \nwaiting for appropriations bills to come to the floor?\n  Remember, there are 100 Senators. There are numerous chairmen. This \nSenate can work in multiples of ways beyond just a single issue and a \nsingle action. I think it is time that we as Senators insist that the \nleadership of the Senate allow us to bring what I believe is one of the \ntop issues in America today, a national energy policy, to the floor so \nthat the American people will know we did the right thing in trying to \nprotect them and their future and the economy of this country from any \nmajor shock, should we ever get into a situation in the Middle East, or \nin those primary production areas on which we are now so reliant, which \nare well beyond our border and well out of our control.\n  With those comments, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10807-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONTINUING THE WORK OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Daschle for having us in \nsession today. I think he has done the right thing. A great deal of \nwork will get done that needs to be done and can be done quickly. \nFrankly, I believe we should be here. I hope we will very soon have \nthese galleries open to all tourists. I hope very soon we can have the \nCapitol Building open to all tourists. I was in my office on Saturday. \nI came through this building and it was empty. I asked one of the \nguards why tourists are blocked out.\n  I remember as a teenager coming to Washington for the first time with \nmy parents, the thrill of going through this building, through the \nSmithsonian and the Library of Congress, because they were open to the \nAmerican people, as they should be now. I have to think there are a \nwhole lot of parents and their children who can't do that. I am on the \nBoard of Regents at the Smithsonian, and I see that the number of \nvisitors is going way down. That is free to everybody.\n  It should not be that way. This is one of the most beautiful cities \nin the world, one of the best cities in the world. The people are among \nthe best people anywhere. Washington should be a magnet not only for \nAmericans throughout the country but visitors throughout the world. I \nwant us back here. I have my staff squeezed into cubbyholes and my \nCapitol office and working out of their homes. We are all connected to \nthe Internet and everything else. We are going to work throughout this \nweekend. We are going to get the terrorism bill finished, with the \nbioterrorism piece that I added here in the Senate and the Senators \npassed.\n  All that is going to be done this weekend because very brave men and \nwomen, on my staff and others, are going to work straight through the \nweekend, but they are going to take 20 hours to do what they might do \nin 10 hours on other days because of all the disruptions.\n  We have to set the example that the Senate is open and ready for \nbusiness. We cannot ask some 18-year-old on duty in our armed services \nin Kosovo to stand sentry duty in the middle of the night next to a \nminefield and say: But U.S. Senators are not here.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer has been a Governor, and he is a \nSenator. He is here. I see my good friend from California who was mayor \nof San Francisco and stood there at a most difficult time. We are ready \nto go to work. We will go to work, and the Senate will continue to be \nthe conscience of the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10807-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report.\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 16, 2001.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 30 minutes for debate to be equally divided and controlled \nbetween the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, or their designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as my distinguished chairman, the \nSenator from California, is preparing to speak about the conference \nreport accompanying the military construction appropriations bill, I \nwant to make a few comments about what is going on today.\n  I am very pleased to say the Senate is open for business, and we are \npreparing to take up very important legislation as it relates to the \nU.S. war on terrorism. Before we talk about that, I want to say that \nwhat we are doing is important as an example to our country. We have \nhad severe threats to the people who work in the U.S. Capitol. The \nCapitol is the symbol of freedom and democracy for the whole world. It \nrepresents the United States.\n  Our people made the decision that we would close the office buildings \nso our staff would be protected. We are checking the office buildings \nto see what kind of anthrax might be present. We are doing the prudent \nthing. We are trying to take care of our people.\n  On the other hand, we are also keeping the Capitol open as the symbol \nthat the business of Government is going on, and many of us are working \nout of our Capitol offices. We have our staffs with us. They are very \nhappy to be here. There is a spirit of comradeship up and down the \nhalls of the Capitol where people are spilling out from the various \nsmall offices to make room in the tiny little offices from where we are \nnow operating. But everybody is happy to do it because we know this is \nimportant for our country. It is our way of saying to those who are in \nthe field representing us in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan that \nwe are here, too, and we are taking care of your needs.\n  I am very proud we are in session. Our staffs are happy to be here, \nand we are doing our duty for our country. The people of America should \nknow we are going to do everything that is on our agenda for this \nweek--business as\n\n[[Page S10808]]\n\nusual--and the House did the same thing. They passed the bills \nyesterday. We passed them yesterday, and we will pass them today.\n  With that, I welcome the chairman of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee and thank her in advance for the leadership she has \nprovided to this very important committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \ncomments.\n  Today I am very pleased to bring before the Senate the conference \nagreement on the fiscal year 2002 military construction appropriations \nbill.\n  Given the circumstances, this is a particularly timely and time-\nsensitive conference report. I am very pleased that the Senate has \ndemonstrated a willingness to move quickly on it.\n  The military construction conference agreement provides $10.5 billion \nof new budget authority. That is a 17.5-percent increase over last \nyear's military construction funding, and it is a 5.3-percent increase \nover the President's budget request. This statistic alone sends a \nstrong message of support to America's men and women in uniform.\n  This is a good package. It meets the most pressing needs of the \nmilitary, both in terms of readiness and quality-of-life issues. It is \nnot, of course, a perfect package. The conference report does not \ninclude everything the Senate wanted, nor does it include everything \nthe House wanted. It does, however, address the priorities of the \nDepartment of Defense, which I think is most important, as well as both \nHouses of Congress. It is a carefully crafted compromise. It is both \nbalanced and bipartisan.\n  I am particularly pleased to see such quick action on this measure at \na time when we as a nation are asking for so much from our men and \nwomen in uniform and from their families. The conference agreement \nprovides $4.8 billion for the Active components of the military. That \nis a 35-percent increase over fiscal year 2001. So the military \ncomponents are up 35.8 percent. It provides $953 million for the \nReserve components. That is a 357-percent increase over last year. For \nfamily housing, the conference agreement provides $4.1 billion. That is \na 12-percent increase over last year.\n  These are important increases. They signal a commitment to upgrading \nand rebuilding the infrastructure that is truly the backbone of our \nNation's military.\n  The conference report also includes a $100 million increase over the \nPresident's budget request for environmental cleanup at military \ninstallations that have been closed as part of the base realignment and \nclosure effort. This is most significant. We need to clean up these \nbases so they can be transitioned into civilian use. This additional \nfunding is necessary. It enables the military to honor its commitments \nto the people and the communities that have been affected by the \neconomic upheaval caused by base closures.\n  I point out that this is a great deal of money, yet much more is \ngoing to be needed before the environmental cleanup of BRAC sites \nacross the Nation is complete. This is certainly something we should \nconsider before we embark on any future rounds of base closings. I \nbelieve this most strongly.\n  One other item I want to mention today is the issue of defense access \nroads. The events of September 11 have made us all the more aware of \nthe potential vulnerability of sensitive civilian and military \ninstallations to the threat of terrorist attack, and a number of our \ncolleagues have expressed concern about the need for upgrading access \nroads serving military installations, particularly around chemical \ndemilitarization facilities.\n  These roads are generally Federal or State highways that provide \naccess to defense installations but are not owned by the Defense \nDepartment. Therefore, funding to construct access roads has to go \nthrough the Department of Transportation. The military construction \nbill includes a standing provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense \nto provide funds to the Transportation Department for access roads but \nonly--only--when the Secretary of Defense has certified that these \nroads are important for national defense.\n  In other words, these are not projects that can easily be added to \nthe MILCON bill if the President does not request them. However, \nbecause of the current sensitivity of chemical demilitarization \nfacilities, we included a provision in our conference agreement that \nwill enable the Defense Department to conduct a feasibility study on \nthe requirements for Defense roads at chemical demilitarization sites \nin the United States to support emergency preparedness requirements.\n  I might also mention the Senate MILCON bill and the House MILCON bill \nhad about a $600 million difference between the two bills. There were \nabout 173 adds from Members. Only 3 of them were the same in both the \nHouse and the Senate bills. So truly the Senate staffers on both sides \nhave done a wonderful job in putting together the conference report.\n  I am very pleased to say it was a unanimous vote in the conference \ncommittee. So it was a reconciling of interests.\n  I very much thank Chairman Byrd. I thank Senator Stevens and \nparticularly my ranking member on the subcommittee, Senator Hutchison, \nfor their unflagging support and assistance in bringing this conference \nreport to the Senate. Again, I particularly thank the subcommittee \nstaff for their hard work on this measure.\n  I am very pleased the military construction bill will be one of the \nfirst appropriations conference agreements sent to the President, and I \nhope he will sign it without delay.\n  I turn this over to the ranking member for her comments, and I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I fully endorse the comments made by \nour subcommittee chairman, Senator Feinstein. I am pleased to recommend \nthe military construction conference report for fiscal year 2002 to the \nSenate. We have worked very hard, Senator Feinstein and myself, with \nour House colleagues, to bring this conference report to a successful \nconclusion.\n  I thank our colleagues from the House side, the chairman, David \nHobson from Ohio, and John Olver from Massachusetts, the ranking \nmember, for working with us in such a collegial way.\n  As Senator Feinstein said, there were many disagreements and, \nfrankly, some different priorities when our two bills passed \nrespectively in the House and the Senate, but we worked hard and in a \nvery productive way to resolve those differences and keep the \npriorities of each House but within a responsible budget. Everybody \ngave a little, but I think everyone did the right thing, and I am very \npleased with the product.\n  We sought a balanced bill, one that provides funding for planning, \ndesign, construction, alteration, and improvement of military \nfacilities worldwide, both for Active-Duty and Reserve Forces. I think \nthis is a very important point because we know our Reserve Forces are \nstepping up to the plate as we speak.\n  Our President has called 40,000 of them to service, and there could \nbe more. So we are very cognizant of the need for our Reserves to be \nsupported and, in fact, there is a total of almost $1 billion for Guard \nand Reserve facilities in this military construction bill.\n  Additionally, we have focused on military housing. This has been a \npriority for all of us. Quality of life for our men and women in the \nservices is very important to us, and we are making a transition in our \nmilitary, frankly, from a force that used to be mostly single men, some \nsingle women, to now families of men and women. For that reason, we \nhave had to adjust military construction priorities in recent years. We \nhave $1.2 billion for barracks improvements; $44 million for child care \ncenters; $199 million for hospitals and medical facilities and $4 \nbillion for family housing.\n\n  This intensifies the effort to improve the quality of military \nhousing and accelerate the elimination of substandard housing. I am \nvery pleased with those priorities.\n  I also concur with the comments of Senator Feinstein on the issue of \naccess roads. A number of colleagues expressed to me their concern \nabout the need for upgrading access roads near chemical \ndemilitarization sites. A defense access road must be appropriately \ncertified by the Department of\n\n[[Page S10809]]\n\nDefense, legislatively authorized, and then it is eligible for funding \nin the military construction appropriations bill.\n  As Senator Feinstein said, we have provided the Department of Defense \nthe ability to conduct a feasibility study on requirements for Defense \nroads at chemical demilitarization sites. We think this is the right \nand responsible approach to determine what the needs are of the \nDepartment of Defense and also determine what the responsibilities of \nthe State or local governments should be in that regard.\n  I also want to make the point this bill will soon be going to the \nPresident of the United States for signature. This bill includes some \nvery important upgrades of facilities in support of the Operation \nEnduring Freedom effort in which we are now engaged. Operation Enduring \nFreedom, of course, is our war on terrorism. In support of these \noperations this bill includes an upgrade for a runway in Oman and a \nbase supply warehouse in Turkey, one of our strongest allies. I am very \nproud that Turkey stepped up to the plate early and said: Whatever you \nneed to protect freedom and democracy is going to be our cause as well.\n  Further, we included a special operations training range in Okinawa. \nJapan also stepped up to the plate--the Japanese Prime Minister was one \nof the first to say: We are with you to protect democracy in this part \nof the world. And lastly, we included a war reserve storage facility in \nGuam. We are very pleased to provide these projects that will directly \nsupport our ability to stage this war on terrorism.\n  I thank my chairman, Senator Feinstein, for working with me to assure \neven though we had the bill on the drawing boards before September 11, \nnevertheless we could react to the immediate needs of the Department of \nDefense in these areas.\n  This bill is on its way to the President, and it will provide the \nsupport to our men and women in the military who have pledged their \nlives to protect our freedom. They have pledged their lives to protect \nfreedom throughout the world. This is the test of our generation, and \nour young men and women are stepping up to the challenge. They deserve \nthe support we are giving them in this bill. We are doing our duty and \nfulfilling our responsibilities here today. I am proud to say, once \nagain, the prowess of our military is going to shine through and we are \ngoing to show the military of a freedom-loving country is the strongest \nin the world, with the full support of the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address \nthe Senate once again on the subject of military construction projects \nadded to an appropriations bill that were not requested by the \nDepartment of Defense. This bill contains $900 million in unrequested \nmilitary construction projects.\n  Every year, I come to the Senate floor for the express purpose of \nhighlighting programs and projects added to spending bills for \nprimarily parochial reasons. While I recognize that many of the \nprojects added to this bill may be worthwhile, the process by which \nthey were selected violates at least one, if not several, of the \ncriteria set out several years ago to limit just this sort of wasteful \nspending.\n  I find particularly offensive the usual Buy America restrictions \nincluded in this bill. Rather than providing the best value to our \nservice members by buying the best products at the best prices, these \nrestrictions require DOD procurement decisions to be driven by \nprotectionist impulses that frequently provide inferior value to our \ntroops. ``Buy America'' restrictions cost the Department of Defense and \nthe U.S. taxpayer $5 billion annually, money that is spent not on our \ngood people in uniform but to line the pockets of American producers of \ngoods that could otherwise be purchased at the same value for lower \nprices overseas.\n  I am also at a loss as to the rationale for including in this bill \ncertain site-specific earmarks and directive language, including a \nprovision urging the Department of Defense to make the consolidation of \nfour Guard and Reserve facility renovation projects in northeastern \nPennsylvania a priority, and to program this requirement in the Future \nYears Defense Plan; a provision directing the Navy to accelerate design \nof the Kingsville Naval Air Station Airfield Lighting project, and to \ninclude construction funding for it in the budget request for fiscal \nyear 2003; a provision directing the Air Force to accelerate design of \nOffutt Air Force Base's Fire/Crash Rescue Station, and to include \nfunding for it in next year's budget request; and similar language \ninappropriately directing scarce resources on a non-competitive basis \nto Warren Air Force Base, Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base, and Selfridge \nAir National Guard Base.\n  In addition, sections of this bill designed to preserve depots, and \nto funnel work in their direction irrespective of cost, are examples of \nthe old philosophy of protecting home-town jobs at the expense of \ngreater efficiencies. And calling plants and depots ``Centers of \nExcellence'' does not constitute an appropriate approach to depot \nmaintenance and manufacturing activities. Consequently, neither the \nCenter of Industrial and Technical Excellence nor the Center of \nExcellence in Service Contracting provide adequate cloaks for the kind \nof protectionist and parochial budgeting endemic in the legislative \nprocess.\n  Last year, the Defense appropriations bill included a provision \nstatutorily renaming National Guard armories as ``Readiness Centers,'' \na particularly Orwellian use of language. By legally relabeling \n``depot-level activities'' as ``operations at Centers of Industrial and \nTechnical Excellence,'' we further institutionalize this dubious \npractice, the implications of which are to deny the American public the \nmost cost-effective use of their tax dollars. When will it end?\n  There are 28 members of the Appropriations Committee. Only six do not \nhave projects added to the appropriations bill. Those numbers, needless \nto say, go well beyond the realm of mere coincidence. Of 96 projects \nadded to this bill, 53 are in the States represented by the Senators on \nthe Appropriations committees, totaling over $503 million.\n  We are waging war against a new enemy with global operations and the \nmessianic aspirations to match; we are undertaking a long-term process \nto transform our military from its cold war structure to a force ready \nfor the challenges of a new day. A lack of political will had \npreviously hamstrung the transformation process, but the President and \nhis team have pledged to revolutionize our military structure and \noperations to meet future threats.\n  The reorganization of our armed services was, of course, an extremely \nimportant subject before September 11, and it is all the more so now. \nThe threats to the security of the United States, to the very lives and \nproperty of Americans, have changed in the last decade. The attacks of \nSeptember 11 have made more urgent the already urgent task of \nreorganizing our military to make sure that we have the people, weapons \nand planning necessary to ensure not only the success of our world \nleadership, international peace and stability and the global progress \nof our values, but to safeguard the survival of the American way of \nlife.\n  In the months ahead, no task before the administration and the \nCongress will be more important or require greater care and \ndeliberation than making the changes necessary to strengthen our \nnational defense in this new, uncertain era of world history. Needless \nto say, this transformation process will require enlightened, \nthoughtful leadership, not pork-barrelling of military funds, if we are \nto best serve America in this time of rapid change in the global \nsecurity environment.\n  I believe I have made my point. As usual, I labor under no illusions \nregarding the impact my comments will have on the way we do business \nhere. I have in the past attempted legislative recourse to pork-barrel \nspending, and I will do so again.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as I mentioned, this bill took a good \ndeal of good staff work. I am very proud that good staff work has \noccurred on both sides of the aisle. It is not easy to remedy 170 \ndifferences between a House and Senate bill, and yet this happened.\n  I particularly commend the appropriations staff, Christina Evans, \nB.G. Wright, on the Republican side; Sid Ashworth, John Kem, and also \nMatt\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\nMiller of my staff. They worked long and hard on this bill, and I think \nthat it will get, if not a unanimous vote of this body, certainly a \nnear unanimous vote. It is a job well done, and I am very pleased on \nbehalf of Senator Hutchison and myself to recognize that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  All time has expired. The question is on the adoption of the \nconference report.\n  The yeas and nays were previously ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns), \nthe Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign), and the Senator from Utah (Mr. \nBennett) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nMontana (Mr. Burns) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous consent \nthat I understand may be objected to, but for the moment I will \ndescribe what I am about to do and why I want to do it today.\n  As most of us know who have worked on an issue called the Internet \ntax moratorium issue, the moratorium that now exists with respect to \nInternet taxation expires on Sunday of this week. The expiration of the \nInternet Tax Moratorium Act on Sunday means that next week there will \nno longer be the prohibition that exists in that act.\n  Many of us believe we ought to do a couple things.\n  One, the Internet Tax Moratorium Act is one that I supported because \nit would have prohibited additional States from imposing taxes on \naccess to the Internet. I support that. It actually grandfathered some \nStates. I would have been content to eliminate the grandfathering even. \nI don't think we ought to be taxing access.\n  It also said that we will not allow discriminatory or punitive taxes \nwith respect to Internet transactions. I supported that as well and was \nhappy to vote for that legislation. It had an end date on it. That end \ndate is this Sunday.\n  What we have been trying to do for a long time is to construct an \nextension of the Internet tax moratorium, which I support, and attach \nto that a provision that would allow State and local governments to \nsolve a very significant problem they are confronted with; that is, \nremote sellers are selling all across this country now in a significant \nway and in many instances--in fact, most instances--they are not \nrequired to collect local taxes when they make those sales.\n  The remote sellers say it would be very difficult for them to collect \nthe local sales and use taxes because you have thousands of \njurisdictions around the country with different tax rates, different \nbases, and so on. It would be horribly complicated to subject a remote \nseller to all of those different standards and different jurisdictions. \nI am sympathetic to that.\n  For that reason, I believe State and local governments ought to be \nrequired to simplify the tax system by which consumption taxes would be \nimposed on remote sales.\n  At the moment, the courts have said the State and local governments \nmay not impose their consumption taxes on remote sales unless the \nremote seller has a location in that State. The only change that could \noccur that would allow them to enforce a collection would be the \nCongress, under the commerce clause, describing a different nexus so \nthat State and local governments could in fact enforce a requirement of \ncollection. I don't believe we ought to do that unless we also require \nState and local governments to dramatically simplify their sales and \nuse tax system. And when we do that, State and local governments should \nthen be able to enforce a collection.\n  You have two things: Requiring a simplification of a system, and then \nrequiring remote sellers to collect the tax and remit it to the States.\n  Why is this important? It is important for two reasons. One is \nfairness. Main street sellers are required to collect the tax, and \ntheir competitors from a remote circumstance are not required to \ncollect the tax. That is not a fair situation.\n  Second, there is a substantial amount of lost revenue, much of which \nwould be used to finance schools in this country, and that lost revenue \nis injuring the tax base of State and local governments and injuring \nthe opportunity to fund education which is funded, as most of us know, \npredominantly by State and local taxes.\n\n  What I propose is the following: We extend the moratorium for about 8 \nmonths to next June 30. That moratorium extension would be accompanied \nby a sense of the Congress in my bill. It is only a two-page bill: It \nis a sense of Congress that State governments and interested business \norganizations should expedite efforts to develop a streamlined sales \nand use tax system that, once approved by Congress, would allow sellers \nto collect and remit sales and use taxes without imposing an undue \nburden on interstate commerce.\n  The House of Representatives, I believe this week, passed a 2-year \nextension on the moratorium, with really nothing involved in it, that \nactually begins to address the other side of the\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\nequation; that is, how do you deal with all of this lost revenue and \nthe need to fund our schools and education?\n  We really need to deal with both issues. I agree with the extension \nof the moratorium. What I propose is that we extend the moratorium to \nnext June 30, do that immediately--I will propose a unanimous consent \nrequest when I send this to the desk--and between now and then, ask all \nof the sides involved to get serious and get this done, develop a \ncompact we can work on together, and therefore require simplification \nof local tax systems and allow the State and local governments to \nenforce collection.\n  My colleague, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, with whom I have worked, as \nwell as Senator Voinovich, Senator Wyden, Senator McCain, Senator \nGraham of Florida, and many others have worked on this issue for a long \nwhile. We have not met success at this point. But Senator Enzi has been \nworking very hard on it and another approach that would have a longer \nextension but would establish a more concrete system by which the State \nand local governments could develop a compact.\n  I am going to be a cosponsor of that proposal. I know he is working \nwith other colleagues on it. I think that is good work as well. In the \ninterim, I didn't want people to think that those of us who were \nworking to solve both problems here--and there are two problems--were \ninsensitive to the need to extend the moratorium. For that reason, I \npropose today that we extend the moratorium to next June 30. I will ask \nunanimous consent to do so, and I will send S. 1504 to the desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10811-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10811-S10815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1504\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1504, the \nInternet tax moratorium bill; that the Senate then proceed to its \nimmediate consideration, that the bill be read three times, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nstate the objection that I understand will be raised, but let me assure \nmy colleague and friend that there is an interest on both sides of the \naisle to extend the moratorium, maybe with not this precise language, \nmaybe it would be the Enzi proposal, maybe it would be something \nSenators Allard and McCain and others are working on. We will try to \nwork with you to make sure the moratorium is extended. At this \nparticular time, an objection will be raised.\n  Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say that I understood there would \nbe an objection. We will now experience a circumstance where the \nmoratorium expires on Sunday. My expectation is that will not have much \nmaterial impact on what or what might not happen in the country in the \nintervening days.\n  It is my hope that all of us who have worked on this can reach an \nagreement on how to do a number of these things. I don't want to retard \nthe ability of remote sellers, catalogs, Internet, or other devices; I \ndon't want to retard their ability to use that marketing strategy to \nenhance commerce in this country. I don't want to burden them in a way \nthat would be unfair.\n  By the same token, we have this growth of remote sales by enterprises \nthat, in many cases, have grown very large but have very few locations \nand use the mail and Internet transactions with which to conduct \nbusiness; much of the commerce is then outside of the ability of State \nand local governments to receive the sales and use tax from that \ncommerce just as other transactions would require.\n  That doesn't mean that when you buy something over the Internet, or \nfrom a catalog, it is tax free; it is not. A use tax is required to be \npaid, but almost no one pays it.\n  Some would make the case that, for example, those who want to solve \nthis problem are talking about a new tax. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. There is already a tax on these transactions. It is not paid \nbecause it is horribly complicated for individual citizens to find a \nuse tax form and submit a use tax to Oklahoma, or North Dakota, or \nVirginia, and say, by the way, I bought a shirt, or shoes, or a tool \nset, and here is the use tax I owe because the sales tax wasn't \ncollected when I purchased it.\n  Because of that set of circumstances, we believed it would be better \nfor the seller and the buyer to find a way to collect that, remit that \nto the coffers of State and local governments. It is used largely for \neducation and improving and strengthening our schools, and we believe \nit would be important to do that.\n  We are trying to solve several problems. I believe at the end of the \nday we will extend this moratorium. I wish we had done it today. We \nwill extend this moratorium. My colleague from Wyoming would make \npermanent the moratorium on taxing access. I will support that. We will \nextend the moratorium. If we are doing the right thing, I think we will \nat the same time begin to address the second part of the issue on \nbehalf of the Governors, mayors, State legislators, States, school \nadministrators, and all the folks who care about that.\n  On the other side, we are going to address the question of complexity \non behalf of the remote sellers. They are not just whistling in the \ndark here. This is a real problem and a serious problem that we have to \naddress. We are dealing with both sides of the equation. I support \naddressing both sides in a thoughtful and sensible way.\n  Again, I understand why an objection was raised, although I regret \nthat it was made. I wish we had been able to extend the moratorium \ntoday. I want everybody to understand that there is no division in the \nSenate, in my judgment, about whether the moratorium should be \nextended; it is how long, and should we do it without trying to find a \nway to buckle up the other part of the solution. We ought to, in my \njudgment, deal with both sets of problems at the same time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the Senate sponsor of the Internet tax \nfreedom bill, I appreciate a chance to set the record straight about \nexactly what this law is.\n  For example, it is continually cited that the Internet tax freedom \nlaw creates a kind of Cayman Islands for the Internet, where you can't \ncollect taxes. That is not right. The only thing the Internet tax \nfreedom law does is it bans discriminatory taxes. You can tax the \nInternet; you just must do to the offline world what you do to the \nonline world. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, not a single jurisdiction in this country--not even one--has \nbeen able to show any evidence that they have been hurt by their \ninability to impose discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. We are \nconstantly told by the mayors and Governors in some jurisdictions that \nthey have been hurt. We have repeatedly asked for the evidence, and \nthere has been none forthcoming.\n  I have made it clear that I am very anxious to work with the mayors \nand Governors on this issue. I was not aware there was going to be an \neffort to extend the moratorium today for just a few months, because we \nhave had these negotiations now for 18 months in an effort to try to \nbring the parties together. I want to make it clear that I am anxious \nto continue those negotiations.\n  No. 3, there is absolutely nothing in current law that prohibits \nStates and localities from collecting revenue that is owed to them. \nThere is nothing in the Internet Tax Freedom Act that bars them from \ndoing that. I just hope that as we make this effort to bring together \ntechnology companies, States, localities, and the mayors, we can \nrecognize that it is possible today under current law to collect all \ntaxes owed. The reason it is not done is, A, the technology doesn't \nexist to do it in a fashion that would not burden business and, B, a \nlot of the mayors and Governors don't want the political heat \nassociated with collecting those taxes. Probably most illustrative of \nthis point is what former Governor Celucci of Massachusetts, now \nAmbassador to Canada, said: Look, I am not going to put people on the \nborder of Massachusetts to chase people down coming\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\nfrom New Hampshire. I am not going to have that kind of chaos on my \nhands.\n  I hope we will continue this effort to try to bring the parties \ntogether in a constructive fashion. I wasn't aware there was going to \nbe an effort today by unanimous consent to deal with this issue. I want \nto make it clear that I am anxious to work with all of the parties who \nhave been involved in this issue. But there is absolutely nothing in \nthe Internet tax freedom law that creates a Cayman Islands with respect \nto the Internet, No. 1; and, No. 2, there isn't anything that keeps \nStates and localities from collecting taxes that are now owed; the \nreason it is not done is technology and politics. I hope, working \ncooperatively together, as we have sought to do for 18 months, it will \nbe possible to do that.\n  Senator McCain and I have introduced a bill that would bar \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce for 2 years. We introduced \nthat legislation several weeks ago. It is virtually identical to what \nthe House passed this week. I hope we can work from that. I want \ncolleagues to know that before we come to the floor, we will be \nconsulting with all the parties, and we will make an effort to bring \npeople together on that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I just want to clarify a point the Senator \nmade. I assume he was not making the point that I was suggesting that \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act created a ``Cayman Islands.'' I have not \nsuggested that, and I didn't say that today. If the Senator is \nresponding to somebody who might have done that, it wasn't I. I want to \nmake sure the Senator understands that.\n  If I might make a final point, the Senator is accurate that the State \nand local governments can now impose a use tax on sales that are made \nby remote seller to a customer in that State. He is also accurate that \nthey almost never do because it would require the hiring of tens of \nthousands of Federal workers to try, in each individual case, to \nachieve that tax collection. That is precisely why there needs to be a \nbalance in these proposals, to achieve both goals: Extend the \nmoratorium and, in some cases, make them permanent; second, to both \nsimplify the sales use tax systems and allow the collection.\n  I might finally say that I appreciate the generous time, and I say \nthat I would object to a 2-year moratorium with nothing else in it that \ngives us an assurance of solving the second problem, as some today \nobjected to the 8-month extension of the moratorium I suggested. We \nwill come to a balance on that. The reason I felt the need to offer \nthis today is that Sunday the moratorium expires, and this is simply \nsaying we can solve that and extend it for 8 months, until next June \n30, and there will be no expiration.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, to wrap up briefly, we have tried for 18 \nmonths to bring the parties together. For example, I proposed--in spite \nof the fact that I see absolutely no evidence that any jurisdiction in \nthis country has been hurt by their inability to impose discriminatory \ntaxes, I proposed, over the opposition of many in business, that when \nthe mayors and Governors have a proposal that is ready to go, they be \ngiven an opportunity to have a vote in the Congress, an opportunity to \nvote on a proposal of their choosing.\n  So I have clearly gone to considerable lengths to try to be sensitive \nto the concerns of mayors and Governors. I hope we will continue the \neffort to try to bring the parties together.\n  I was not aware there was going to be an effort to proceed to this \nbill by UC today, otherwise there would have been many colleagues, who \nshare my view and support the legislation I offered with Congressman \nCox that passed 98 to 2 in this Chamber, to support those positions to \ncarry on this debate. The only way we are going to get this done is to \nbring the parties together.\n  I point out finally with respect to the time period, the National \nConference of State Legislatures, known as NCSL, said recently they \nwanted a 4-year moratorium because they were not ready, from a \ntechnological standpoint, to advance the solutions that would address \nthis issue without putting burdens on out-of-state sellers.\n  We are dealing with an extraordinarily important issue. The \ntechnology sector has been very hard hit, as all of our colleagues \nknow. The last thing they need is to be shellacked with discriminatory \ntaxes. There are more than 7,600 taxing jurisdictions in this country. \nIf you are talking about overturning the Quill case, which is what this \ndebate is all about, which says that you cannot impose taxes unless \nthere is physical presence in a particular jurisdiction--a case I \nstrongly support--you are dealing with very serious matters with \nrespect to the economy of this country.\n  I would like to see us go back to the way we tried to deal with this \nfor the last 18 months, which was in a conciliatory way, trying to \nbring the parties together. Starting Monday, there is an opportunity \nfor considerable economic mischief. Fortunately, only four State \nlegislatures are in session right now, but there is an opportunity for \nconsiderable economic mischief.\n  The legislation that Senator McCain and I have advanced on a \nbipartisan basis provides the framework to proceed, but Senator Enzi, \nwho has been very constructive on this issue for quite some time now, \nhas made for me and others a copy of another proposal he has. I assure \nhim and those with whom he is working that we will look at it very \ncarefully and work with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak this morning, \nbut I arrived in the midst of the discussion of an issue which I think \nis very central to our federalist system of government. The Nation \ndepends upon our States and local governments to deliver some of the \nmost basic services that protect the security and advance the well-\nbeing of our people and our Nation as a whole.\n  We just had a dramatic demonstration of that with what happened after \nSeptember 11. While there were a number of Federal personnel involved, \nthe front line, the first responders, the people who lost their lives \nin the collapse of those buildings serving the public interest were \nlargely employees of State and local governments.\n  We know, and we all applaud the importance of education for the \nfuture of our Nation. That is predominantly a State and local \nresponsibility. What we are talking about today is the capacity of \nState and local governments to have sufficient control of their sources \nof revenue to continue to provide those very services.\n  While the current law, as the Senator from Oregon has correctly \nstated, focuses on prohibiting the States from adopting discriminatory \ntax systems that will single out and adversely affect distance sellers, \nparticularly those who sell over the Internet, the fact is there is \nanother form of discrimination, and that is the discrimination between \nthe Main Street retail seller and that distant seller.\n  The discrimination is that in times past, we have adopted a \nphilosophy that said in order for a State to require a seller to \ncollect its sales tax, there had to be a physical presence of that \nseller within the State. That was a concept that made sense in a \nprevious era, but that era has passed.\n\n  We just passed a major antiterrorism bill, and one of the basic \nchanges we made had to do with wiretaps. Our wiretap law was basically \nwritten for the old rotary phone. It proved to be inadequate to deal \nwith the issues of the cellular phone, computer communication, and all \nthe things with which we are now familiar and in daily personal use.\n  The same economic and technical changes that have caused the Congress \nto reevaluate its concept of what it takes to fight terrorism have \naffected the way in which commerce is delivered in America.\n  We now have a situation where if you sell the same book at a retail \nstore on Main Street, that seller is obligated to collect the sales tax \nof the State and local jurisdictions that might be imposed on that \nbook. If you buy the identical book over the Internet, there is no \nobligation to collect sales tax.\n  I do not think that is a defensible differentiation, and the \npractical effect of that is going to be over time to erode the \ncompetitive position of the Main Street seller, and through that \nerosion also affect the ability to properly finance our police, fire, \nand education systems that are so critical to the functioning of our \nNation.\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\n  Yes, there is an issue of discrimination here, a mild discrimination, \nand a quite unlikely discrimination that might be directed by State \nlegislatures against Internet sellers and a massive discrimination that \nis being directed today against the Main Street retailer.\n  I believe these two issues are interconnected, and we should do as \nSenator Enzi is suggesting: At the same time we grant an extension of \nthe moratorium, we build into that extension a mechanism that will \nresult in the resolution of this much bigger issue of discrimination--\nthe discrimination against the Main Street seller.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the distinguished Senator from Florida yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In just a moment when I complete my remarks, I will be \npleased to yield.\n  The reality is that what we are about here, for those who are new to \nthis issue, is the fact that time is on the side of the distant \nsellers. Right now, a relatively small percentage of American retail \nsales are conducted over the Internet, but that percentage has been \ngrowing every year. Already the distant sellers have acquired enough \ninfluence to cause the House of Representatives to take the action it \nhas taken and to build considerable support within the Senate for an \nextension of the moratorium without any mechanism to deal with the \ndiscrimination against Main Street and the discrimination against the \nchildren and the other citizens who depend upon State and local \ngovernment for fundamental services such as education and police.\n  The secret of those who would like to effectively make this \ndiscrimination against Main Street permanent is they want to continue \nmoratorium after moratorium until the percentage of people who are \nusing the Internet is so great that there will be no political \nconstituency to deal with this discrimination.\n  I state for myself and I believe for others that we consider this to \nbe a core issue of the future of federalism in America; that we have to \nhave strong State and local governments, and we have to depend upon \nthem to make decisions appropriate to their people. State and local \ngovernments, as one who served there for 20 years, do not like taxing \ntheir people. They are as sensitive to that as we are in Washington, \nmaybe more so.\n  We should not deny them the capacity to make the decisions that are \nin the best interest of their people. That is a fundamental part of our \nfederalist system, that different levels of government have \nresponsibilities and must accept the obligation of those \nresponsibilities, including the appropriate way to finance them.\n  So this is, as I say, a very basic issue. I, for one, will insist \nbefore we extend this moratorium beyond the very short period as \nsuggested by the Senator from North Dakota that any longer extension \nmust be linked to a process, not a solution but a process, to move us \ntowards the resolution of this fundamental discrimination that exists \nwithin our Nation and within our economy today.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oregon for his question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague, and I think he knows I am very much \ncommitted to working with him and with Senator Enzi. I do not know how \nmany hours we have put in over the last 18 months trying to do this. My \nquestion was designed really to get a sense of the thinking of the \nSenator on a particular point that may help us move this issue along.\n  What I and many others are concerned about is sticking it to sellers \nwho are located thousands of miles away from a local jurisdiction and \nthat seller has no presence in the local jurisdiction other than a Web \nsite. That is the only presence they have today. Of course, the Supreme \nCourt has said there has to be physical presence, under a current Court \ndecision, in order to do that.\n  In the view of the Senator from Florida, what is the case for \nimposing these various taxes--of course, anything that is already owed \ncan be collected under the current Internet tax freedom bill, so we are \ntalking about something new. What is the case in the mind of the \nSenator for having changed treatment of that particular seller who is \nlocated thousands of miles from a local jurisdiction and who has no \npresence in that jurisdiction other than a Web site?\n  Again, I do not ask this question for any other reason than I think \nit would be helpful for me and others who spent a significant amount of \ntime to get the thinking of colleagues as we try to figure out a way to \nmove forward on it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the very sincere and committed effort the \nSenator has made to try to arrive at a resolution, and I hope in this \ndebate which has arisen today, and will arise with greater frequency \nnow that the moratorium is about to lapse, that we can reach such a \nresolution.\n  What I think is basic is, first, the Constitution. The Constitution \nvests--and it was one of the most controversial debates at the \nConstitutional Convention of 1787--in the Federal Government the \ncontrol of interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, as I read the most \nrecent opinions on this issue, did not say requiring distant sellers to \ncollect sales tax was unconstitutional. Rather, they said it was \nunauthorized; that it would take an affirmative act of Congress to \nsanction the States to require distant sellers--that is, sellers who \ndid not have a physical presence in their State--to collect their sales \ntax.\n  So the issue is, we have to take an affirmative act in order to \nempower the States to require that distant sellers should collect their \nsales tax. So then the question is why----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The time of the Senator from \nFlorida has expired in morning business.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask for an additional 2 minutes to \ncomplete the answer to the question from the Senator from Oregon.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So the question then is whether we should take that \naffirmative action. I think we should for two basic reasons. One is \nfairness. It is, in my judgment, intolerable to have an economic system \nin which government says if you are selling from a distant location, \nyou are at a competitive advantage over persons who are selling on Main \nStreet. That is precisely the current circumstance of requiring one to \ncollect sales tax but not requiring the other to do it, and it is not \nan insubstantial competitive disadvantage. In my State, depending on \nwhich locality one is in, it could be a 6-, 7-, or more percent \ndifferential.\n  Second, the practical effect of this is going to be to erode the \ncapacity of State and local governments, acting through the democratic \nprocess of representative election and decision, as to what services \nshould be provided and how they should be financed to substantially \nerode that capability.\n  My State happens to be particularly dependent upon sales tax. About \n70 percent or more of our general revenue is collected by sales tax. So \nif there were a significant percentage of that which moved from Main \nStreet to distant seller, it would have an immediate and substantial \nimpact on the capacity of our State to educate its children, to defend \nour people through police, to protect our people in time of emergency \nthrough fire and other emergency response institutions.\n  So this is a basic question of whether we at the national level are \ngoing to say to our brethren in the 50 States that for all time you are \ngoing to be saddled by this discrimination, which will have the effect \nof eroding your capacity to decide how to finance the services your \npeople are asking you to provide.\n  I do not believe all wisdom resides in Washington. I believe in a \ndistributed democracy and that we ought to let 50 States and thousands \nof local jurisdictions make those kinds of judgments, and eliminating \nthis massive discrimination that currently is part of our tax system \nwill return that degree of respect and capacity to State and local \ngovernments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, at what time is the Senate expected to \nreconvene following the recess?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. 2 p.m.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m., when the Senate \nreconvenes following the recess, I be recognized for not to exceed 35 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\nVoinovich be allowed to follow the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  I have refrained from getting into this discussion about the \nmoratorium on Internet taxes up to this point, but I need to voice some \ncomments because I am one of the people who has been working on this \nissue for the last 18 months and was a part of the debate we had 18 \nmonths ago that put the current moratorium into effect.\n  I thank Senator Graham from Florida, who has been intensely involved. \nHe has been one of the main people who has provided a connection with \nCongress and State legislators. I thank Senator Ron Wyden, the Senator \nfrom Oregon, for his intense interest. I think probably the number of \nhours the Senator from Oregon and I, and Senator McCain, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Dorgan, and Senator Graham have spent in meetings on this \nissue, which has not been a specific bill, probably exceeds the time \nspent on any other issue that was not actually a bill, which indicates \nthe intensity of the need there is to resolve the issue nationwide.\n  Particularly since the events of September 11, there has been a drain \non resources for cities, towns, counties, and States as they have put \nmore security in place, as they have provided for the difficulties that \nhave happened in their States. Most of them rely on a sales tax to be \nable to do that.\n  Education is another area heavily funded by sales taxes. Those States \nthat collect sales taxes and rely on sales taxes have been intensely \ninterested that their right to collect sales taxes is not taken away. \nGetting all of the groups together has been extremely difficult: the \nrecognition that there is an added burden on direct marketers when they \ndo this, that the States need it, that the retailers are at an unfair \ndisadvantage if there is not a sales tax collected. And it is small \nretail merchants that provide for donations for the year books and the \nother local activities that would be sorely missed if they were not \nthere.\n  Getting some protection for all of these groups and bringing them \ntogether has been a real task. We have been making tremendous progress. \nThere has been some concern that the moratorium runs out Sunday and the \nNation will go into a major crisis. That is not the case. The \ngrandfathering dates back to 1998. I suspect nobody is going to undo \nthat particular date.\n  We need a solution. This is not my solution. This is the solution of \nall of the people I mentioned who have been working on it and will be \ncontinuing to work on it to come to some kind of an agreement where, \nfirst of all, we extend the moratorium; second, we make sure we protect \nthe States so they can, with some pressure--and this is where the \nStates have to come to the middle, too--simplify their tax system so \nthat direct marketer or that person doing remote sales has some \ncapability of complying. In order to make that easier, one of the \nthings we have built into the bill is a requirement that there be one \nform, one reporting place, one place to send the check, and a maximum \nof one audit. There is also a requirement there be reasonable \ncompensation to the person who collects it.\n  Everybody who does direct sales collects sales taxes. They collect it \nin the State in which they are located, which is where they have a \nnexus and in other States where they have a nexus. There is an intense \ninterest on their part to see that there is some simplification to the \ntax system in the States where they have to work.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am happy to yield for a question when I complete my \nremarks.\n  As I mentioned, we have been working with retailers and a coalition, \nincluding a lot of retailers and others who rely on the sales tax or \nrely on businesses that have a sales tax. That includes people who \nbuild shopping malls and do other types of retail businesses. I \nacknowledge their help in coming to this particular bill. I thank the \nNational League of Cities and the National Governors' Association, and \nmost particularly, my Governor from Wyoming, Governor Geringer, and the \nGovernor from Utah, Governor Leavitt, for the tremendous hours they \nhave put in together trying to get everybody on the same page.\n  I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague from Wyoming. I appreciate the work \nthat has gone into this. He obviously has strong views on it. It has \nbeen very constructive in trying to work with me and others.\n  I ask my colleague about a procedural matter that could allow us to \ngo forward and bring the parties together. Senator McCain and I \nintroduced legislation several weeks ago that is virtually identical to \nwhat the House passed this week. The House has already begun to move.\n  My question to my colleague is, would the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming be willing to work with me and others, the entire group \ninvolved, to craft a unanimous consent request that could come up early \nnext week where we could take up in the Senate the House-passed bill \nand then have an open and fair debate on amendments and all of the up-\nor-down votes that Members of this body would choose to have?\n  Would my colleague be willing to work with me and others to see if we \ncould craft that kind of approach that is agreeable all around?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am happy to work with the Senator from Oregon. I have \nbeen working also with the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, to see if \nwe cannot propound some kind of unanimous consent. It needs to be done \nquickly before States run off the edge and pass some things we might \nthen feel bad about repealing but have to repeal. I am interested in \ndoing that.\n  However, I hope the propounded unanimous consent could deal with this \nbill, rather than the straight 12-month extension. I have been talking \nto people on the House side and I think they see some reasonableness in \ngoing with the approach I am providing, as well.\n  We need to come up with a propounded unanimous consent that will get \nus to this form of debate and voting on amendments so this bill will \nhave a majority of cosponsors and can be passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Today Senator Dorgan, the chairman of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee, is going to have at our luncheon the Ambassador of Egypt, \nthe Ambassador of Jordan, the Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates \nand the Charge d'Affaires of Pakistan. I compliment Senator Dorgan for \narranging these eminent people to speak with Members.\n  I mention that only as a preface to a letter I received from a \nconstituent of mine in Las Vegas, a young constituent. Her name is \nSanaa Khan, and she is a ninth grade student. The letter reads:\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: It is unfortunate that Americans do not \n     have the basic knowledge about Islam. This is the faith \n     practiced by almost seven million Muslims living in the \n     United States, and over one billion people around the world. \n     It is the fastest growing religion in the world. As a \n     research topic for my 9th grade English project, I chose to \n     highlight the basic tenets of Islam, in order to develop a \n     better understanding among my friends and teachers in school. \n     I would like to send this to you so that you may share with \n     your friends and colleagues.\n       The Islamic belief is structured around five main pillars: \n     (1) The profession of faith. (2) Daily worship. (3) Fasting \n     during the month of Ramadan (based on the Islamic lunar \n     calendar). (4) Charity and (5) Making the pilgrimage to \n     Makkah.\n       The profession of faith is simple. It's declaring that one \n     believes in one God and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is \n     the messenger of God. By reciting this, one may convert to \n     Islam. Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last prophet of \n     God who lived from 570 to 633 BCE.\n       Daily worship is praying five times a day: at dawn, midday, \n     afternoon, evening, and at night. These prayers are short and \n     include recitation of verses from the Qur'an, the holy book \n     for Muslims. During these prayers, Muslims bow their heads in \n     the direction of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, the holiest place for \n     Muslims.\n       Charity in Islam is called ``zakat''. This is the \n     obligation to share what one possesses with the poor. Muslims \n     are required to give 2.5% of all the money and jewelry they \n     own once a year to less fortunate people.\n       Fasting during the month of Ramadan is also mandatory. \n     Fasting is refraining from food and drink from dawn until \n     dusk. Muslims go by the Islamic lunar calendar making Ramadan \n     the ninth month. Fasting is\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\n     significant because it makes you a stronger person by \n     realizing the significance of self control, discipline, and \n     restricting ones desires.\n       The last pillar is making the pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi \n     Arabia. This pilgrimage is called Hajj. The holiest mosque is \n     in Makkah, Masjid-al-Haram. Hajj occurs only once a year \n     during the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar. It is \n     required that you perform Hajj at least once in your lifetime \n     if one can financially afford it.\n       The prophet of Islam is Muhammad (peace be upon him). He \n     was born in Makkah, Saudi Arabia in 570 BCE. In 610 BCE, the \n     angel Gabriel carried the revelation from God and brought it \n     down to Muhammad (peace be upon him). After a period of time, \n     these revelations were placed into one book called the \n     Qur'an.\n       I hope this information, though very basic, would at least \n     provoke some thought process towards efforts to better \n     understand Islam.\n\n  I appreciate very much Sanaa sending me this letter. I hope everyone \nin the Senate will become familiar with her letter and become familiar \nwith the tenets of her religion.\n  I have been on the floor before, speaking about Islam and what a \ngreat religion it is. I have said before and I repeat that my wife's \nprimary physicians are two members of the Islamic faith, her internist \nand the person who has performed surgery on her. I know them well. I \nhave been in their homes. I have socialized with them. I have talked \nabout very serious things with them. We have helped each other with \nfamily problems.\n  I have been to the new mosque with them in Las Vegas. They are \nwonderful people with great families. I have come to realize Islam is a \ngood religion; it is a good way of life.

Madam President, I rise this afternoon on a very sad note. \nWe lost a State senator from Virginia, Emily Couric.\n  For those who knew Emily Couric, and for those who worked with Emily \nCouric and followed her life and her battles, we all know we have lost \na fine person. We have lost an articulate, passionate, and \ninspirational leader.\n  Emily Couric passed away today, October 18. She had been a State \nsenator in the 25th District of Virginia since after her election in \n1995. That is an area around Charlottesville, Albemarle County, Greene \nCounty, Madison County, Orange County, and Nelson County--generally the \nPiedmont area of Virginia.\n  She passed away of pancreatic cancer today in her home in \nCharlottesville.\n  She served in the State senate while I served as the Governor of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  She was recognized by all on both sides of the aisle as a leader--\nespecially in her areas of greatest concern, which were health care and \neducation.\n  Before serving in the State senate, she served on the school board in \nthe city of Charlottesville, and indeed before getting elected to the \nState senate was chairman of the school board.\n  She had many accomplishments, such as establishing advanced \nmathematics and technology diploma seals for those high school \ngraduates. Picture that--encouraging students to do even more than what \nis just enough to get by. But if they wanted to do even more, they \ncould add an advanced mathematics and technology aspect to their \neducation.\n  She was also a leader in supporting research and rehabilitation for \nvictims of spinal cord injuries and traumatic brain injuries.\n  She was a leader in the Democrat Party in Virginia. Had she not \ncontracted pancreatic cancer, she would right now certainly be running \nfor Lieutenant Governor on the Democrat ticket. She explored that race. \nBut she was diagnosed with cancer back in July of last year--2000. She \nwas certainly regarded as a frontrunner and would not have had any \nopposition whatsoever in her party. I would certainly guess that she \nwould probably have won very easily. But she had to withdraw from the \nrace because she had to undergo treatment for the pancreatic cancer.\n  Nevertheless, she didn't want to get out of what she cared about, \nwhich was serving the people. Indeed, she served as the general chair \nof the Democrat Party of Virginia, and undertook that responsibility in \nDecember of 2000.\n  She served on many committees in the State senate, such as the \nEducation and Health Committee, the Agriculture, Conservation and \nNatural Resources Committee, and the Rehabilitation and Social Services \nCommittee.\n  She served in a variety of areas, but she did not just serve \nVirginia, she served the region. She served not only in the \nlegislature, but on the Southern Regional Education Board and the \nSouthern Legislative Conference Education Committee, as well as other \npolicy committees.\n  As I said, prior to her election, she did serve on the \nCharlottesville School Board from 1985 to 1991, including one term as \nchairman. She served on a lot of community boards and organizations. \nShe was a member of the Charlottesville Boys & Girls Club, the \nCharlottesville Area School Business Alliance, the Jefferson Area Board \nfor Aging, the Virginia National Bank, the Virginia Festival of the \nBook, the Heritage Repertory Theater, Camp Holiday Trails, and various \nother activities in the community. Until her last breath, you knew her \npassion was for all these ideas, but especially those that would \nbenefit youngsters with their health, their education, and their future \nopportunities.\n  She was born in Atlanta, GA. She moved to Virginia in 1951. She was a \ngraduate of Yorktown High School in Arlington, VA, right across the \nriver from us.\n  She received her bachelor of arts from Smith College and graduated \nwith honors, magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi from Smith \nCollege.\n  Expressing for my colleague and myself, and I think all Senators and \nanybody who knew Emily Couric, our prayers and thoughts are with her \nhusband, Dr. George Beller of Charlottesville, VA, her son Ray Wadlow--\nhe is a doctor--and her daughter-in-law Jessica of Philadelphia, PA; \nand her son Jeff Wadlow of Los Angeles, CA.\n  She is also survived by her parents Elinor and John Couric of \nArlington, VA; her siblings, Clara Couric Batchelor, John Couric, Jr., \nand, of course, one we know and see every morning, Katie Couric; her \nstep children, Michael Beller, Amy Beller, and Leslie Beller; and also \nseven nieces and nephews; and two step-grandchildren.\n  We will all miss Emily Couric. Regardless of our political parties, \nEmily Couric was an inspiration. Her life really embodied her true \ndedication to her fellow human beings.\n  Once she was diagnosed with this terrible cancer, she kept fighting. \nShe did not give up. She is an inspiration and her spirit lives on. All \nof us have been blessed to have known her; and, indeed, future \ngenerations will have healthier, better lives because Emily Couric \ncared enough to devote a great deal of her lifetime to public service \nand the betterment of others.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I am pleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I associate myself with my colleague's \nremarks. I say to Senator Allen, indeed, you knew her very well. I had \ncome to know her in later years.\n  The Presiding Officer might be interested in this little story. I had \na chance to be with her about 6 or 8 months ago, it seems to me, when \nshe won an award in Northern Virginia and I was sort of the toastmaster \nof that evening. We\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\nhad a very friendly conversation--as we often do.\n  I talked to her about my father, who had likewise died from cancer. \nHe was a medical doctor who devoted his life to others. We engaged \nbriefly in a conversation.\n  I said: It took great courage for you not to seek the Lieutenant \nGovernor's post.\n  She acknowledged that, and then, with a twinkle in her eye--she was a \nvery attractive woman, by the way--she said: Yes. I thought about the \nLieutenant Governor post because that was going to be a way stop to \ncome and have a campaign against you, Senator Warner.\n\n  And she could have waged a campaign against this old Senator that \nwould give him a wakeup call, for sure.\n  Our State has lost one of its shining stars, but that is God's will, \nand we must accept it. I share with the Senator our prayers for her \nfamily and her friends.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I add my voice to that of the two Senators \nfrom Virginia. I did not know Emily Couric, but having listened to the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Virginia speak about her, and the \nsenior Senator, not only did Virginia lose someone of great value but \nthe country did as well. I am sure her family and friends appreciate \nimmensely the words spoken in this Chamber this afternoon. I am sure \nall of us would like to associate ourselves with them. We express our \nsympathies to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10816-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10816-S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BEST PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues Senators \nDeWine and Dodd for their efforts to reauthorize an important piece of \nlegislation--the pediatric exclusivity rules. The DeWine-Dodd pediatric \nexclusivity law was passed as part of the Food and Drug Administration \nModernization Act of 2001. This bill has helped spur a great deal of \nresearch into pediatric indications for many pharmaceutical products. \nIt is a good law.\n  I also want to recognize the efforts of Chairman Kennedy and Ranking \nMember Gregg and Senator Frist for their work in moving this through \nthe HELP Committee.\n  I am offering a technical amendment that I believe will be acceptable \nto all, that clarifies how the pediatric exclusivity provisions work in \nconjunction with certain provisions of the Drug Price Competition and \nPatent Term Restoration Act. Representative Waxman and I were \ninstrumental in developing this important 1984 law.\n  I have worked with my colleagues, the administration, and interested \nparties to make certain that the 1997 pediatric exclusivity law does \nnot act to curtail the incentives of those generic drug manufacturers \nawarded 180 days of exclusivity under the 1984 law because they have \nsuccessfully challenged a patent or have shown that a pioneer drug \nproduct is not infringed.\n  The amendment I offer today helps make clear that a generic firm that \nqualifies for the 180-day patent noninfringement/patent invalidity \nincentives gains just that--180 days, no more, no less.\n  I also thank Senator Dodd for agreeing to continue to work to iron \nout some issues as this bill is conferenced with the House. For \nexample, we want to work together to make certain the overlap language \napplies to generic drug applications already in the pipeline at FDA. I \nalso understand that some may have concerns that certain aspects of \nthis language may raise questions with respect to the takings clause. \nIt is my hope that the conferees will work to perfect the language.\n  I commend Helen Rhee, who has worked on this bill for both her old \nboss, Senator DeWine and her new boss Senator Frist and Deborah Barrett \nof Senator Dodd's office for their work on this bill.\n  I also commend the expert staff of the Food and Drug Administration, \nincluding Melinda Plaisier, Jarilyn DuPont, Liz Dickinson, and Kim \nDettelbach for their hard work on this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together to reauthorize the DeWine-Dodd \npediatric bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 838, the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act. In the January 2001 report to \nCongress, the FDA stated that the law that we are reauthorizing today, \n``has done more to generate clinical studies and useful prescribing \ninformation for the pediatric population than other regulatory or \nlegislative process to date.''\n  In just the 3 years since the law was implemented, it has made a \npositive difference in the lives of thousands of children. I am pleased \nto be a cosponsor and strong supporter of this highly successful \nprogram. In the short time that this program has been in existence, FDA \nhas issued about 200 written requests for pediatric studies. Companies \nhave undertaken over 400 pediatric studies, of which 58 studies have \nbeen completed, in a wide range of critical therapeutic areas, \nincluding gastro\nesophageal reflux disease, diabetes mellitus, pain, asthma, and \nhypertension. Thirty-seven drugs have been granted pediatric \nexclusivity, and important label changes have either been made, or are \nunderway, as a result of pediatric studies.\n  For instance, new pediatric dosing information for a new oral \nformulation of midazolam, a medication used to sedate children in \nsurgery, now offers an alternative to the injectable form of the drug \nthat needs to be directly injected into a child's vein. The studies \nsubmitted under this pediatric exclusivity law not only resulted in \nthis new oral syrup formulation and correct dosing information, but \nalso identified a subpopulation of pediatric patients with heart \ndisease and pulmonary hypertension who are at higher risk for adverse \nevents unless they are given lower doses than other children. A \npediatric nephrologist from Memphis, TN, prescribed Randitidine, using \nnew dosing and labeling information that resulted from this law, to \nneonates who were experiencing health problems due to acid reflux.\n  Despite the successes of this law, we did not settle for a straight \nreauthorization. We instead sought to improve this already highly \nsuccessful law. This law provides a funding mechanism to ensure that \noff-patent drugs and certain declined written requests for the study of \non-patent drugs, for which the Secretary believes there is a continuing \nneed for pediatric testing, are studied. It establishes timeframes for \nresponding to written requests, timeframes and processes for \nnegotiating label changes, and authorizes the Federal Government to \ndeem a drug misbranded if the company ultimately disagrees with FDA's \nproposed new drug label. The government could then begin an enforcement \naction under existing authority to seek a court order regarding \nrelabeling of the drug.\n\n  We also lift the current restrictions on user fees established under \nthe Prescription Drug User Fee Act to include this pediatric testing \nprogram. By including pediatric testing in the user fee program, the \nFDA will be given additional resources needed to give priority review \nto pediatric testing applications.\n  We provide for the public dissemination of summaries of the pediatric \nstudies that are submitted so that certain unprotected information will \nbe disseminated to pediatricians even before labeling information has \nbeen finalized.\n  I would like to thank Senator Hatch and his staff, Bruce Artim and \nTrish Knight, for their work in drafting language to clarify that this \npediatric incentive program does not, and is not intended to, preclude \nother incentives, for example, one that provides for a 180-day \nexclusivity period for the first generic drug company that challenges a \npatent. Another important clarification we made in this bill is that \nthe pediatric exclusivity program is not intended to prevent generics \nfrom entering the market solely based on the fact that some or all of \nthe pediatric use information may be protected under the pediatric \nexclusivity law. Allowing generic drug companies to market a drug to \nadults, while requiring that any precautions, warnings, or \ncontraindication for pediatric use that the Secretary determines to be \nnecessary ensures that the safety of children is protected and that the \nintent of two different laws are both met.\n  To further ensure that the safety of children in clinical trials is \nprotected, this bill requires that the Institute of Medicine conduct a \nreview of federal regulations, reports, and research involving children \nand provide recommendations on best practices relating to research \ninvolving children. This\n\n[[Page S10819]]\n\nbuilds on an important review and report from the Department of Health \nand Human Services that Senator Kennedy and I worked with Senator \nDeWine and Dodd to include in the Children's Health Act last year.\n  While we ensure that the Secretary convenes and consults with the \nPediatric Advisory Committee, we also ensure that pediatric oncology \nremains a research priority. Twenty written requests have been issued \nso far for oncology drugs, and this bill authorizes the Pediatric \nOncology Subcommittee to evaluate therapeutic alternatives to treat \npediatric cancer and provide recommendations and guidance to ensure \nchildren with cancer having timely access to the most promising new \ncancer therapies.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Dodd, DeWine, and \nKennedy for their relentless effort to create such a strong bill. We \nhave worked hard to make major improvements to an already highly \nsuccessful law. I would like to thank Senators Collins and Bond for \ntheir early support and for helping to draft language to ensure that \ndrugs used in the neonate population are studied, when safely and \nethically appropriate. I also appreciate the support of Senators Gregg, \nMikulski, Jeffords, Murray, Clinton, Bingaman, and Wellstone for this \nbill and for their help in improving this already highly successful \npediatric testing law.\n  I would also like to thank Helen Rhee on my staff and Debra Barrett \nfrom Senator Dodd's staff for their tireless dedication and effort to \nhelp us bring so many Members from across the aisle and off the Hill \ntogether to pass this legislation. Finally, I would like to thank \nElaine Holland Vining with the American Academy of Pediatrics, Mark \nIsaac and Natasha Bilimoria with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS \nFoundation, and Jeanne Ireland, Christie Onoda, and Stephanie Sikora \nfrom Senator Dodd's office for their expertise and guidance in drafting \nthis bill. Vince Ventimiglia from Senator Gregg's staff, Christina Ho \nfrom Senator Clinton's staff, and David Dorsey, David Nexon, and Paul \nKim from Senator Kennedy's office also deserve much credit for \nnegotiating and bringing this bill to final passage today.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1905\n\n  The amendment (No. 1905) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended was \nagreed to.\n  The bill (S. 838), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10819-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, in the early days of the Great Depression, I \nlived in the coal mining camps of southern West Virginia. I remember \nthose days when we only had an old Philco radio up on the wall of the \nhouse. But the voice of President Franklin Roosevelt was a golden \nvoice. When his voice came over the airways, the coal miners and their \nfamilies gathered around and listened intently and always with hope.\n  Roosevelt, in his first inaugural address, stated quite clearly:\n\n       [T]he only thing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, \n     unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed \n     efforts to convert retreat into advance.\n\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Senate must not be paralyzed. At a time when \nthe Senate must lead by example, we must show the Nation that work can \ncontinue and that our Government will not close down.\n  Congress is supposed to approve 13 appropriations bills--these are \nthe regular appropriations bills--by the start of the fiscal year on \nOctober 1. But that fiscal year started several days ago. Yet we have \nonly sent the Interior and the military construction appropriations \nconference reports to the President for his signature. At the same \ntime, we have now approved a third continuing resolution--this one to \nlast until October 31. That is Halloween. The Appropriations Committees \nin the House and Senate have been doing their work. The legislation is \nbeing written and reported to the Senate for consideration. But instead \nof debating and voting on these bills, instead of expeditiously doing \nthe work of the people, the Senate is moving all too slowly--moving at \na snail's pace, as a matter of fact--on these essential funding bills.\n  The American people are looking for leadership in their elected \nrepresentatives, and they have a right to demand it. We need to act; we \nneed to show them, we need to show the world that the Senate is \nundaunted, that we can accomplish our goals notwithstanding those who \nwould seek to have the American people cower in fear.\n  One of the bills, for example, delayed on the floor is the fiscal \nyear 2002 foreign operations appropriations bill includes $450 million \nto combat HIV-AIDS, the worst global health crisis in half a \nmillennium. The bill includes money for medicines to treat malaria and \ntuberculosis. Hundreds of millions of dollars for efforts to reduce \npoverty, improve basic health care, and build basic housing and \nsanitation systems are also being delayed. Even funds to combat \nterrorism and to reduce threats from biological, chemical, and nuclear \nweapons are currently in that bill, the bill being held up by one side \nof the aisle on this Senate floor.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the majority leader to bring these \nappropriations bills to the floor. Unfortunately, his efforts to date \nhave been blocked to a considerable extent.\n  Now is the time for the Members of the Senate to exercise the \nleadership which the American people have entrusted to us. Now is the \ntime to abandon petty political partisanship and to link arms against \nterror. Now is not the time to ignore our responsibilities. Now is not \nthe time to abandon our posts and scurry out of town. Let us \ndemonstrate a steady hand. Our message must be that calmness is going \nto prevail. It does prevail; it will continue to prevail. We must avoid \nthe appearance of disorder, panic, and especially petty partisanship.\n  To those who say let us slam all of our legislation into one package \nand pack our bags and get out of town, I say lift your sights. We \ncannot fulfill our duties with one eye on the door. We have a \nConstitution to guide us. We have a Constitution to uphold and an oath \nto which we swore our solemn allegiance.\n  We cannot let Osama bin Laden take over the Senate. We cannot succumb \nto terror, nor can we succumb to partisan games. Many of our \nappropriations bills are waiting and ready for Senate floor debate. \nThese are bills that fund important programs, important programs for \nyou out there in the Great Plains, in the great hills and valleys \nthroughout this country--important for the well being of our people. \nThese bills fund endeavors which are critical to our homeland defense, \ncritical to our national defense, critical to our citizens' health, \ncritical to our Nation's economic health. We must go forward. We must \nembrace the cooling comfort of reasoned, rational order and debate.\n  We have to protect our staff and the public who come to this complex. \nThat is being done. I have every confidence that it is being done well \nand with great professionalism. But nobody ever said that representing \nthe people would be easy. Now is the time for us to earn our paychecks!\n  We cannot simply fund these appropriations bills at last year's level \nin a giant continuing resolution and go\n\n[[Page S10820]]\n\nhome. And that is what will happen if we don't pass these \nappropriations bills. They will end up in a giant omnibus bill--a giant \ncontinuing resolution. That means they would be funded at the same \nlevel as last year. We must do the people's business.\n\n  We have seen great courage and grand dedication in the eyes of our \ncitizens. One has only to recall the firemen, the rescue workers, the \npolicemen, the volunteers who served so valiantly in New York City and \nwho still dig and labor patiently through the rubble that inters \nthousands of the bodies of our fellow citizens. Are Senators any less \ndedicated to our jobs than these people have been to theirs? One has \nonly to observe Old Glory flying from the windows of passenger cars and \nclutched in the hands of children to appreciate anew the spirit of our \npeople and the power of American ideals.\n  We must not fail the millions of Americans by sending the message to \nmisguided men that we can be so easily spooked.\n  This Nation has always produced men and women who had the spirit and \nthe fortitude to carry on, to do the difficult job of protecting \nfreedom and securing the constitutional pillars of this, the greatest \nNation on Earth.\n  This Senate is the grandest of those constitutional pillars. Let us \nsecure the people's House and promote the people's welfare by the \nsimple and straightforward act of continuing to do our business and to \ndo it in an orderly and rational way.\n  Horace said:\n\n       Do your duty and leave the rest to heaven.\n\n  Now is the time for all of us to embrace the sublime wisdom of those \nwords.\n  We might repeat the words of Longfellow in doing so:\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'Tis of the wave and not the rock;\n     'Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee--are all with thee!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10820-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10820-S10822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE GREAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in his book, ``The Greatest Generation,'' \nNBC's news anchorman Tom Brokaw discusses the greatness of the \ngeneration of Americans who withstood the problems, the terrors, the \ndoubts, the fears of the 1930s and the 1940s. He points out that it was \nthis generation of Americans who ``came of age in the Great Depression \nwhen economic despair hovered over the land like a plague.'' When Pearl \nHarbor made it irrefutably clear that America was not a fortress, he \nwrites, ``This generation . . . answered the call to help save the \nworld from the two most powerful and ruthless military machines ever \nassembled.'' Afterward, those people ``helped convert a wartime economy \ninto the most powerful peacetime economy in history.'' This was ``the \ngreatest generation any society has ever produced.''\n  Like Mr. Brokaw, I, too, admire the generation of Americans who \nsurvived the hardships of the Great Depression and won World War II. \nThey were truly outstanding Americans, a great generation. I am proud \nto say they are of my generation.\n  But ever since reading Mr. Brokaw's book, I can't help but think \nabout the greatness of not only that generation of Americans, but also \nthe greatness of generation after generation of Americans. It seems \nthat in almost every age of our history, Americans have risen to meet \nthe challenges and difficulties of their times to move our country \nforward toward even further greatness.\n  I immediately think of the generation of Americans about which I love \nso much to read and to speak--the generation of Americans who won our \nindependence and established this Government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people. In the Declaration of Independence, these \nAmericans took the ideas of the English enlightenment and made them a \nnational vision. These Americans infused into the very nature of our \npolitical life the egalitarian, democratic impulses that guide us \ntoday.\n  In seeking our independence, those Americans demonstrated remarkable \ndetermination, remarkable courage.\n  Just by putting their names on this Declaration of Independence, \nwhich I hold in my hand, the 56 signers became guilty of high treason \nagainst the British Crown. It was a crime that was punishable by death. \nBut the unflagging determination of that generation was expressed in \nthe words of Patrick Henry, who declared: ``Give me liberty or give me \ndeath.'' It was also demonstrated by a 21-year-old schoolteacher turned \nsoldier-patriot named Nathan Hale.\n  If your American history book doesn't tell the story of Nathan Hale, \nit is not a history book. It is probably a book on social studies, not \na book of American history. I studied American history by reading \nMuzzey back in 1927, 1928, by the light of an old kerosene lamp. \nMuzzey. He told the story of Nathan Hale: When about to be executed by \nthe British for supplying GEN George Washington with important \ninformation--drawings of the British gun emplacements, and so on, and \nabout the location and the strength of the British troops, Nathan Hale \nuttered those immortal words: ``I only regret that I have but one life \nto lose for my country.''\n  The leaders of that generation of revolutionary Americans were not \nyour down and out, nothing-left-to-lose, rebel-rousing revolutionaries.\n  Benjamin Franklin was a transatlantic figure, a world figure of great \naccomplishments. He was a world-renowned and respected scholar, \nphilosopher, inventor, diplomat, and scientist.\n  George Washington was a highly respected, wealthy landowner. He did \nnot have to leave his beautiful, vast country estate and risk \neverything, including his family fortune and death, to lead a ragtag \nrevolutionary army against the mighty British military machine.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson was a great scientist, a great mathematician, \nauthor, educator, architect, inventor, political leader.\n  This list of greats in the revolutionary generation also includes \nsuch giants as James Madison, George Mason, Alexander Hamilton, James \nOtis, Samuel Adams, John Adams, and the list goes on and on. And it \ndoes not stop with the leaders. The list includes colonial merchants \nsuch as Robert Morris. It includes colonial craftsmen such as Paul \nRevere. It includes tens of thousands of colonial workers who made up \nthe famous correspondence committees, the Sons of Liberty who enforced \nthe boycotts of British goods, carried out the Stamp Act protests, and \ndumped the British tea into Boston Harbor.\n  It was these nameless colonial workers who made up that Revolutionary \nArmy, who shivered through the cold winter at Valley Forge, who made \nthat daring crossing over the Delaware River on that frigid Christmas \nEve, and who turned the world upside down at Yorktown.\n  After winning the Revolution, this generation put their vision of \nAmerica into a workable form, a government that embodied the \nprinciples, ideals, and values for which they had fought and died. So \nmany of our Founding Fathers assembled in Philadelphia that hot summer \nof 1787 and formulated the U.S. Constitution, a copy of which I hold in \nmy hand.\n  Mr. President, it simply does not get any greater than that when we \nspeak of the greatest generation, but I cannot and I will not say that \ngeneration was greater than the generation that prevailed during the \nGreat Depression and saved the world from the tyranny, the Nazi \ntyranny, nor can I say it was greater than the generation of Americans \nwho experienced the events that led up to the Civil War, who saved the \nUnion, and who ended the ugliest, most tragic chapter of American \nhistory: the chapter concerning the institution of human slavery. That \ngeneration of American greats included President Abraham Lincoln, \nSenators Charles Sumner, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun,\n\n[[Page S10821]]\n\nSolomon Foot, and Henry Wilson. It included writers such as Ralph Waldo \nEmerson and Henry Thoreau, the great contemporary of Emerson, Nathaniel \nHawthorne, Herman Melville.\n  After the Civil War came a collection of extraordinary Americans that \nincluded John D. Rockefeller, the great grandfather of my colleague \nfrom West Virginia, Commodore Vanderbilt, Leland Stanford, J.P. Morgan, \nAndrew Carnegie, James Drew, James Hill, and Collis P. Huntington, who \nfounded the city of Huntington, WV. These are just to name a few.\n  Referred to by such titles as ``captains of industry'' and ``empire \nbuilders,'' this was the generation that industrialized America as the \nUnited States soared from fifth in the world in economic productivity \nto become the world's foremost economic power. With little \nexaggeration, industrialist Jay Gould stated:\n\n       We have made the country rich. We have developed the \n     country.\n\n  Mr. President, they certainly made modern industrial America that \ngave the United States the industrial base that enabled us to win World \nWar I and then World War II. They, too, certainly qualify for having \nmade up a great generation.\n  Between 1900 and 1920, a period of American history sometimes \nreferred to as the ``progressive era,'' a generation of reformers \nsought to clean up the mess created by the industrialization and \nurbanization of the late 19th century, including child labor, sweat \nshops, corrupt political machines, industrial and banking monopolies, \nand urban slums. These tenacious progressive reformers broke the \ncontrol that railroad, lumber, and coal companies possessed over their \nState legislatures.\n\n  These men enacted many of the laws that still regulate and guide us \ntoday, including those that established the Federal Reserve System and \nFederal Trade Commission, as well as antitrust laws and the national \nincome tax. They adopted four constitutional amendments, including the \ndirect election of U.S. Senators, without which amendment I certainly \nwould not be here and perhaps the Senator from Rhode Island, who \npresently presides over the Senate with such a degree of dignity and \nskill, aplomb that is so rare as a day in June, Jack Reed.\n  That generation included some of our greatest political leaders, such \nas President Woodrow Wilson, during whose second administration I was \nborn, and President Theodore Roosevelt and Senators Robert LaFollette, \nHenry Cabot Lodge, and William E. Borah.\n  It included some of the greatest journalists in American history, \nsuch as Ida Tarbell, David Graham Phillips, and Lincoln Steffens. It \nincluded some of the greatest labor leaders in American history, such \nas Samuel Gompers, and Mother Jones.\n  Mr. President, rather than pitting one generation of Americans \nagainst another in some sort of intergenerational competition, I like \nto recognize the greatness of a society, the greatness of a government, \nthe greatness of a culture that is so instrumental in producing one \ngreat generation after another great generation and then another great \ngeneration.\n  It is not the singular greatness of any particular generation of \nAmericans that we should recognize and celebrate but the greatness of a \nway of life that is ours, a way of life that not merely allows but \nencourages the American people to do our best, and allows and \nencourages the best to rise to the top, allows the cream of the crop to \nrise and become its own and fulfill its own talents, to excel, to \nsucceed, and to make us a better Nation.\n  It is also important and fascinating to recall from where this \ngreatness has come. Some, such as George Washington, the Roosevelts, \nand the Kennedys, did come from families of wealth, power, and \neducation.\n  But the leader of the country during its darkest hours was a humble \nrail splitter who was born in a log cabin in western Kentucky. The \nleader of American military forces during the invasion of Normandy was \na Kansas farm boy.\n  Look at the great industrialists of the late nineteenth century. John \nD. Rockefeller was the son of an itinerant patent medicine salesman. \nAndrew Carnegie was the son of a poor Scottish weaver. Jay Gould, \nPhilip Armor, and Daniel Drew were children of poor farmers. James J. \nHill began his career as an office clerk.\n  I daresay that the vast majority of Americans who have contributed to \nthe greatness of this country, such as those who made up George \nWashington's motley revolutionary army, were plain, ordinary Americans, \nfrom ordinary places, doing ordinary things, until their country needed \nthem. This included the men who fought at San Juan hill. This included \nthe men who fought at Gettysburg. It included the men who stormed the \nbeaches of Normandy, and, who, more recently, won Desert Storm.\n  Now we are seeing another generation of extraordinary Americans \nmeeting the challenges and demands of our extraordinary times.\n  I am speaking foremost about the men who exemplified that New York \nspirit. Most of these were firefighters, policemen, and rescue workers \nat the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon who rushed in to save \nother lives, including many who gave their own lives in the process. \nThen we think of those who have labored so long and so hard, day after \nday, week after week, digging through the rubble of the worst disasters \nin American history, seeking to save one more life.\n  I am also speaking of those countless Americans who have given blood, \nmoney, and other forms of assistance to the victims of those disasters.\n  I am speaking of the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform, and \nmay soon be put in harm's way to protect our country and defend the \nliberties and principles that we hold so dear.\n  I am speaking of the courageous men and women aboard United flight \n93, who brought that plane down in the desolate fields of Somerset \nCounty, Pennsylvania, and saved the lives of hundreds, perhaps \nthousands, of their fellow Americans.\n  It does not get any greater than that. There can be no greater \ngeneration than these. All of these Americans qualify for greatness. \nThey have made their generation yet another great generation of \nAmericans.\n  It was people such as these who won our independence. It was because \nof people such as these that this country has survived a Civil War, a \nGreat Depression, two world wars, and will now prevail in our current \ncrisis. It is because of people such as these that our country has \nbeen, is, and will remain a great country.\n  I think of some verses from J.G. Holland.\n\n     God give us men!\n     A time like this demands strong minds, great hearts, true \n           faith, and ready hands.\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie.\n\n     Men who can stand before a demagogue\n     And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n\n     Tall men, sun-crowned;\n     Who live above the fog,\n     In public duty and in private thinking.\n     For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds,\n     It's large professions and its little deeds, mingles in \n           selfish strife,\n     Lo! Freedom weeps!\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God give us men!\n\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty;\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character;\n     Men of sterling worth;\n     Then wrongs will be redressed, and right will rule the earth.\n     God Give us Men!\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I cannot help but comment about the \neloquent words we have just heard from the Senator from West Virginia. \nWhen I go home, people are quite concerned about our country, the state \nof our homeland security, the state of our security abroad, the \nsituation with our economy. The eloquent words of the Senator from West \nVirginia speak to that and underscore the fact that when we have ever \nbeen challenged, we have had the people who will rise to the occasion \nand solve those problems that have been confronting our country.\n  One of the things I have been really impressed with is how thankful \nthe people are that those of us who are Republicans and Democrats have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\nworking together and putting aside partisan politics for the benefit of \nour country. We need to really not forget how important that is to our \npeople at this very critical time. So I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for his remarks.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend, the Senator from Ohio, for his kind \ncomments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10822-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10822-S10824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE IMPORTANCE OF AN ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, earlier today I joined colleagues to \nunderscore the importance of an energy policy to our national security. \nOne of the reasons I came to the Senate was to adopt an energy policy. \nI lived with the lack of one as the mayor of the city of Cleveland and \nas Governor of the State of Ohio.\n  An energy policy is needed to secure our national economy and \nguarantee our competitiveness in the global marketplace and now, more \nthan ever before, to secure our national security. We do indeed have to \nharmonize our environmental needs and our energy needs to continue to \nimprove the quality of our air and water, public health, and at the \nsame time guarantee we have the resources at reasonable cost to meet \nour energy needs.\n  In my opinion, we are in the midst of an energy crisis, one that is \nhaving a tremendous influence over the state of our economy and is \naffecting the quality of life of the American people and their \nconfidence about the economic future of our Nation.\n  I believe this crisis is caused by several factors. One, as I \nmentioned, the national energy policy, is faulty. Two, we saw in \nCalifornia a deregulation law which could be looked at in other parts \nof the country. Three, environmental policies have contributed to a \nlack of diversity and difficulties in siting new facilities, pipelines, \nand transmission lines. The definition of something called NSR, new \nsource review, has put utilities and manufacturers in limbo to the \nextent they are doing nothing to improve the environment, and at the \nsame time doing nothing to improve the availability of energy in our \ncountry. Fourth, we are too reliant on foreign sources of oil. Fifth, I \nthink we have had an inappropriate demonizing of nuclear power in this \ncountry.\n  As the Presiding Officer of the Senate knows, in his part of the \ncountry, many States rely heavily on nuclear power. Today we are a \nfossil fuel-based economy. Although there is broad recognition there \nwill eventually be a shift away from primary reliance on fossil fuels \nand a greater use and emphasis on other resources, there are many \npeople who would argue that alternative fuels are the answer to our \nenergy crisis.\n  Yes, several alternative energy sources exist today. They are either \ninexhaustible: solar, wind, nuclear; or renewed through a natural \nprocess: hydropower, plant-based fuels such as ethanol and vegetable \noils.\n  Currently, the contribution of alternative energy sources to U.S. \nneeds range from less than one-tenth of 1 percent for wind and solar \npower, 3 percent from hydroelectric and biofuels each, and 8 percent \nfrom nuclear energy. Today, however, fossil fuel reserves appear to be \nadequate to serve this Nation's current energy needs, with a 70-year \nreserve for oil and approximately a 250-year reserve for coal at \ncurrent consumption rates.\n  One of my colleagues noted that wind power is the fastest growing \nsource of electricity in the world and we should look to it more \nseriously as an alternative energy source. Another colleague pointed \nout that solar panels covering 100 by 100 square miles would produce \nenough solar energy to power this entire Nation.\n  The truth is, although alternative energy sources are being used in \nsome places across the country, we have been subsidizing solar and wind \npower for over 25 years. Combined, they make up only one-tenth of 1 \npercent of the total energy demand today.\n  Renewables are now generally costlier than fossil fuels. For example, \nsolar power is currently 8 to 10 times more costly. Even assuming an \noptimistic technology scenario, it will take at least 30 to 40 years \nbefore renewables energy infrastructure could be built from its current \nlevel to start contributing significantly to our energy supplies.\n  In this chart we are talking about the impact of the lack of an \nenergy policy. Costs have a disproportionate impact on low-income \nfamilies. Since the beginning of the 107th Congress, I have been \nholding hearings across my State. I have asked individuals and business \nowners to relay their experiences on how the energy crisis has impacted \nthem. In Cleveland, for example, I held a meeting with Catholic \nCharities, Lutheran Housing, the Salvation Army, senior citizens, low-\nincome parents, and handicapped individuals.\n  I heard many heartrending stories about their struggles to be able to \nafford their monthly energy bills. The Catholic diocese said in the \nyear 2000 their help line received 3,400 calls for basic needs, items \nsuch as food, utilities, mortgage, and rent. The number of calls the \ndiocese received went up 96 percent from 1999 to 2000, a 194-percent \nincrease from 1998 to 2000. In the first 7 weeks of 2001, the Salvation \nArmy in Cleveland had 559 families seeking assistance with energy \ncosts. In comparison, for all of 2000 they had 330 families.\n\n  On this chart, the Department of Energy demonstrates an individual or \nfamily making less than $10,000 a year is going to spend 29 percent of \ntheir income on energy. Those making between $10,000 and $24,000 spend \nabout 13 percent of their income on energy. Those making over $50,000 \nspend 4 percent. It is obvious, for some of our brothers and sisters, \nthe choice sometimes comes down to paying for heat or paying for food. \nBecause of this, many of them had to rely on hunger centers for their \nmeals and other necessities.\n  The next chart shows the principal sources of energy today are oil, \nnatural gas, and coal. It goes without saying that these fuels have \nbecome essential elements in creating our way of life. Despite the fact \nthat each year we use energy more efficiently, energy demand rises \nabout two-thirds of the rate of economic growth. With the funk we have \nin the economy, that is a little bit down right now. The chart shows \nthat nuclear, hydropower, and nonhydropower renewables and others make \nup a very small percentage of production. Any shortfall created between \nproduction and consumption of the other three main sources of energy--\nnatural gas, oil, and coal--will be made up from imports. For example, \noil imports have risen from 36 percent in 1973 to 56 percent in the \nyear 2001. Refined gasoline net imports have risen from 1 percent in \n1980 to approximately 5 percent in 2000. This increase in imports has \nbeen necessary to make up the difference from our closed refineries. \nOil and natural gas demand is expected to continue to grow for the \nforeseeable future--oil at about 2 percent a year and gas in excess of \n3 percent. Alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power are \nbeing pursued but will not alter this outlook for decades to come.\n  Next, U.S. energy production. Now that we know how much Americans can \nexpect to consume over the next two to three decades--we are talking \nfrom 1995 to the year 2020--it is important to see how that expectation \nwill be met, given our current state of resources. This chart shows how \nmuch energy we produce domestically by fuel type. We can see the \nhydropower. We can see the nuclear, nonrenewables. We have petroleum. \nWe have natural gas. We have coal.\n  According to the Department of Energy, natural gas is expected to be \nthe fastest growing component of world energy consumption. We saw that \nthis winter when gas prices skyrocketed. Gas use is projected almost to \ndouble to 162 trillion cubic feet in 2020 from 84 trillion in 1999. If \nwe do not increase infrastructure, installing more pipelines, the \nincreased production will not reach our consumers.\n  According to a study by the nonprofit operator of New England's power \ngrid, New England will be increasing its natural gas demand from 16 \npercent in 1999 to a projected 45 percent in 2005, but they lack the \nlocal pipelines to distribute the gas to its markets.\n  With that in mind, we also know there is an estimated 40 percent of \nundiscovered natural gas located on land leased by the Federal and \nState government. These resources will be needed to be tapped to \naccommodate the inevitable increase in natural gas consumption. If not, \nthen we face the hardship of increasing dependence on\n\n[[Page S10823]]\n\nforeign resources that will have the capacity to cripple our energy \neconomy. The challenge to produce more oil and natural gas is greater \nbecause the production of our existing resource base is subject to a \nnatural decline through depletion.\n\n  Fuel cells, electric vehicles, hybrids, biomass, solar technology, \nand wind energy, all represented on this chart as nonhydropower \nrenewables, are all very promising alternative energy sources for the \nfuture. But right now there is no suitable infrastructure in place that \nwill allow for these energies--even when combined, as you will see in \nlater charts--to sufficiently supply current needs, much less future \ndemands.\n  Let's look at U.S. energy consumption. The green line is the \nconsumption of energy in this country. The red line represents the \ncurrent production. And of the projections, the purple line represents \nrenewables, including hydro- and nonhydropower. In other words, the \ndifference between the green and the red line is what we are having to \nbring in from out of the U.S. sources in order to meet the needs of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Americans do consume more energy than we produce and will continue to \nconsume more energy, especially fossil fuels, for decades to come. \nAlthough several sources exist today, the chart reflects, as I said \nbefore, that the contribution of renewables and others is very little, \nif you look down the road.\n  This means that our President is right. We need more refineries. We \nneed more electric powerplants, more coal, more natural gas pipelines \nand production. It is plain to see that we will not be able to conserve \nour way out of this crisis. While conservation helps--and it has \nrightly made a difference--it is not going to meet our estimated \nconsumption without drastically changing America's standard of living.\n  The United States of America is the world's largest energy producer, \nconsumer, and net importer. However, it is no secret that the United \nStates is becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil imports.\n  This chart reflects what we have to look forward to by way of \ndependence, out through the year 2020. If we look at our petroleum \nconsumption and look at it here on this chart, and this green line is \nour petroleum production, what we are faced with is, between 2000 and \n2020 we will be relying on oil from foreign countries. It is an \nenormous amount of oil. We will be depending on them for an enormous \namount of oil.\n  Total imports in the month of April, for example, this year, as a \npercentage of total domestic petroleum deliveries was 62.4 percent. At \nthis time last year, it was about 59 percent. The total petroleum \nproducts delivered to the domestic market in April equaled over 19 \nmillion barrels per day, while in the same month last year it delivered \nabout 18.5 million barrels per day.\n  The scarce petroleum resource is not a problem experienced only by \nthe United States; this energy crisis is experienced across the globe, \nso much so that as foreign countries realize the increase in their own \nenergy needs, they will be far less willing to accommodate the growing \nexport demands our country is going to place upon them. For example, \nChina used to export oil. Today they are a big importer of oil. The \ndemand for oil is growing worldwide.\n  But even with increased reliance on foreign oil as a country, we are \nnot going to go far if we do not work earnestly to expand the natural \ngas and oil pipeline system we have in our country. Our Nation's \n200,000-mile oil pipeline system is the world's largest. These almost \ninvisible ribbons of steel deliver more than 13.3 billion barrels of \ncrude oil and petroleum products in a typical year. Without them, it \nwould take thousands of trucks and barges clogging the Nation's roads \nand waterways to do the same. The capacity of the system, however, is \nbeing seriously eroded and the future of oil and natural gas \ntransmission does not appear to be promising.\n\n  If we refuse to act, the alternative will be a continued capacity \nsqueeze and higher transmission costs passed on to the consumer. And in \nsome areas they are very expensive.\n  This chart shows what we can expect under three different energy \nproduction scenarios through the year 2020. The top line assumes energy \nuse with respect to economic growth. This means that if we as a nation \ncontinued along the same lines as we are currently traveling, to the \nyear 2020, with energy demands rising in proportion to economic growth, \nand there were no further technological advances made, then consumption \nwould increase dramatically.\n  The bottom line represents energy production growth without \nsignificant changes.\n  The second line is what the Department of Energy predicts will happen \nif consumers are offered a menu of available technologies to choose \nfrom, an example of which would be a family replacing a vehicle after \nseveral years of use, with a more fuel-efficient one.\n  What happens is, if you use this chart, if we use energy production \nwith available technology and conservation, we will bring down the \nneed. Then if we fold in energy production using available technology, \nwe will bring it down some more. So this shows that by using technology \nand conservation, we can bring down this demand for energy in this \ncountry.\n  But the fact is, we still have a long way to go, if you look at the \ndifference between this green line and this gray line. This is the \namount of energy we are going to have to make up for during the years \nto come.\n  The third path, as I already mentioned, reflects the impact of \nconservation at its height.\n  The point I am trying to make is that we have an enormous gap between \nwhat we are going to need, in terms of energy in the United States of \nAmerica, and our production. That gap will have to be made up by \nforeign imports if we do not act quickly to accommodate this increased \ndemand with our own resources. There is no guarantee that these foreign \nimports will be available.\n  I believe we are more vulnerable today then ever before. Early this \nyear, I visited with President Mubarak, for an hour, with Senator \nSpecter. Then we traveled to Israel and met with at that time Prime \nMinister Barak, Shimon Peres, and now-Prime Minister Sharon, and \nseveral Arab leaders. I came back from that trip very concerned in \nregard to the growing Muslim extreme fundamentalism in that part of the \nworld. The thought I had was that if this continued to grow and they \nimpacted on our allies in that part of the world, we could be brought \nto our knees in terms of our ability to get oil from that part of the \nworld.\n  I think most people would agree the situation today is far more scary \nthan it was then. As you know, our major source of oil there is the \nSaudis--good friends. I am pleased the President and Secretary of State \nhave worked with some of our friends there and they are stepping up to \nthe plate and being responsive to our needs. But there is no guarantee. \nOsama bin Laden, who has targeted the leadership in Saudi Arabia, could \nchange that situation.\n  Then the issue is, Where do we find ourselves? If we think about what \nhappened in California this last year, and the urgency, the crisis, and \nthe impact that it had on the rest of the country, it affected \nbusinesses in the State of Ohio. But when that happened, we started \nburning dirty diesel. Environmental restrictions came off, and we just \nwent to town to take care of the problem we had in California.\n  Can you just imagine what would happen in this country if our oil \nsupply was cut off? It would be Katy bar the door. We would get oil \nfrom wherever we could, and environmental concerns would go straight \nout the window because we would need to keep our country going.\n  What I am saying is that it is time we adopt an energy policy in this \ncountry. It is something that cannot be delayed. This is not a \nRepublican or a Democratic issue. We have a real problem that needs to \nbe solved. Our national security is in jeopardy, and we need to go \nforward and deal with this problem before we leave the Senate this \nyear.\n  As far as I am concerned, it is just as important as the proposed \nlegislation we have to stimulate the economy. If we don't have an \nenergy policy as part of that economic stimulus and if we cannot \nguarantee that the future looks bright in terms of our energy costs, we \nare in deep trouble.\n  Part of the recession in the State of Ohio occurred this last winter \nwhen\n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\nthe price of heating oil went up because of the demand for natural gas. \nIt struck a blow to many of the businesses in our State, let alone \nthose people who I talked about before who live in our inner cities and \nwho do not have the kind of furnaces we have, the windows, and all of \nthe other items that are available to those who are a little bit more \nfortunate.\n  I am urging my colleagues in the Senate to arrange to work out some \nagreement where we can bring this energy issue to the floor and debate \nit. I am sure there are going to be controversial issues, but we have \ndealt with controversial issues before. Let's get it on the floor. \nLet's amend it. Let's debate it and get it over with so we can secure \nour economic future, secure our competitive position in the global \nmarketplace, and, last but not least, secure our national security.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first I rise to compliment my colleague, \nthe Senator from Ohio, on his presentation. I think it was a very \nuseful one. I personally enjoyed it and learned from it. I thank my \ncolleague for the effort that went into that presentation on our energy \nneeds in this country.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about farm policy. We \nhave just now heard that the administration has endorsed Senator \nLugar's farm plan, which fundamentally, in my judgment, abandons family \nfarms and the rural economy.\n  The farm plan that the administration is now supportive of is radical \nand it is ruinous. I don't know how to sugarcoat it. This is an \nabsolute unmitigated disaster for the rural parts of the country.\n  The President is, in essence, backing a plan that eliminates farm \nprograms--this at a time that our major competitors, the Europeans, are \noutspending us 10 to 1 in support for farm producers, and in terms of \nexport support they are outdoing us 30 to 1.\n  It is no wonder that these are hard times in farm country. It is no \nwonder that when I go home to North Dakota--one of the most \nagricultural States in the Nation--farm producers tell me they wonder \nwhy they should stay in agriculture when there is virtually no \nfinancial return. There is enormous risk.\n  The plan the President has endorsed is an absolute abdication. It \nsays we are going to eliminate AMTA payments immediately. It says we \nare going to eliminate in just a few years the marketing loan program. \nIt says we are going to eliminate the sugar program, the dairy program, \nand the peanut program. For all of that, it substitutes a voucher \nsystem that is woefully inadequate, and which will leave tens of \nthousands of farmers in a position of financial failure.\n  That is the plan this President has endorsed. That is the plan the \nPresident would impose on farm producers across this country.\n  I cannot say strongly enough what an absolute economic disaster that \nplan would be for virtually every farm State in the Nation.\n  What the President is calling for is abandoning of farmers in every \npart of America. What the President is saying is he doesn't like the \nprevious farm policy. Very few of us do. His answer is a farm policy \nthat signals retreat. His policy would say to our European adversaries \nand competitors: You take the agricultural markets. You become the \ndominant producer in the world.\n  That is a profoundly wrong policy for this country. I am certain the \nEuropeans are taking great comfort today in the announcement by the \nWhite House that they back a policy which is a policy of unilateral \nsurrender. I do not know how else to term it.\n  If this policy were ever to become the law, you would see mass \nbankruptcy all across the rural parts of this country.\n  One of the farm group leaders in my State was in my office. I \ndescribed for him the plan that the administration had endorsed. He \nthought I was joking. He thought I was putting him on. He could not \nbelieve that this would be a farm policy endorsed by this or any \nadministration. In fact, when I asked a group of farm leaders what \nwould happen if we saw the kind of cuts that the President's plan would \nimpose, he said it would mean the race to the auctioneer.\n  This is a serious matter. The irony is that at the very time this \nadministration is arguing for a stimulus package for the economy, they \nare proposing a package for agriculture that is the opposite of a \nstimulus package. It is a package that would destroy many of the farm \nproducers all across this country.\n\n  My State is perhaps the most agricultural State in the Nation. This \nfarm policy now endorsed by the Bush administration would be a \ndevastating blow to North Dakota.\n  A few months ago, the President came to North Dakota and said his \nadministration would be farmer friendly. Now we see a complete \nabdication on that commitment. Now we see a total reversal with the \nPresident proposing a plan that would be an absolute calamity--an \neconomic calamity--not only for North Dakota but for South Dakota, for \nNebraska, for Minnesota, for Montana, for Iowa, and for every other \nfarm State in this Nation.\n  This cannot be.\n  I hope over the weekend people will reflect on what has happened. I \nhope all across this country farm group leaders and farm producers will \ncall the White House, call their representatives, and call their \nGovernors and urge them to tell the White House they have to reverse \ncourse. We cannot abandon rural America at a time when the rest of the \nnational economy is already in trouble. We cannot say to America that \nwe are going to provide stimulus to help the economy recover in the \nurban parts of the country but we are going to abandon the rural parts \nof our Nation. That cannot be, and it will not be.\n  I am saying to my colleagues that no stimulus package is going to \npass here unless all of America is included--unless the rural parts of \nthis country and the urban parts of the country are treated with \nrespect.\n  This proposal and this plan is an absolute unmitigated disaster for \nfarm families.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I asked a number of Senators from farm States today--I read \nan article in the newspaper. We are not a farm State. We grow alfalfa. \nAgriculture is a very minor part of Nevada's economic base.\n  I asked a number of people about this article in the newspaper. Some \nhad not read it yet. I hope the Senator from North Dakota will continue \nspeaking out on this issue because there are not many farm States \nremaining. We need some leadership because of what we read in the \nnewspaper, which spins pretty well, that they are going to stop all \nthese things that appear bad for farmers.\n\n  I have followed the lead of the Senators from the Dakotas and Iowa in \nwhat I think is good farm policy because I know it is the lifeblood of \nthe State of North Dakota.\n  I hope you continue to speak out, just as you have. We need to hear \nthat in the non-farm States. So I ask the Senator a question. I hope \nyou will speak out on this more than just today. Will you?\n  Mr. CONRAD. You can count on that.\n  I say to my friend from the State of Nevada how much we appreciate \nthe assistance he has provided on key farm issues over the years. This \nis a real jolt to the people I represent because agriculture is the \ndominant part of our economy. I think people in our State recognize \nvery well the devastation a bill such as this would mean. And I tell \nyou, these are hard times already in our State. Just as we have \nsuffered an economic downturn in this country, we have been facing hard \ntimes in agriculture the last 4 years.\n  In fact, the Senator well remembers we have had to write four \neconomic disaster bills for agriculture in the last 4 years. Every year \nwe have had to write an economic disaster rescue package for our \nfarmers. Without it, tens of thousands of farm families would have been \nforced off the land. That is the hard reality.\n  Now this administration endorses a plan that would prevent us from \nhaving\n\n[[Page S10825]]\n\nthe kind of rescue packages we have passed in the last 4 years. They \nare saying to tens of thousands of farm families: What you do has no \nvalue, and you might as well give up and give in and get out.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I have one more question.\n  Wouldn't it also drive the family farmers further and further away \nfrom their farms, where we wind up in America having big corporations \ndoing all the farming?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Unfortunately, that is the direction. If you will study \nthis farm plan, what it would mean is basically the elimination of farm \nprograms. I know there are people listening who say, gee, maybe that is \na good idea. I would say to those people, you need to look at what is \nhappening in other parts of the world that produce agricultural goods \nbecause that is not what they are doing.\n  I indicated our European friends provide over $300 an acre of support \nper year. We provide $38. So already they have an enormous advantage \nover our producers. And then, when you look at export support, they \naccount for 84 percent of all the world's agricultural export support. \nWe are less than 3 percent. They are outgunning us there 30 to 1.\n  This administration plan is to wave the white flag of surrender. To \nall those who seek our markets the old-fashioned way, by buying them, \nwe just say, take them; you can become the dominant player in world \nagriculture.\n  That would be a profound mistake for this country. It has been one of \nthe key sources of American strength, that we have been the dominant \nplayer in world agriculture.\n  This plan is a guarantee that the United States would be second \nclass, second rate, and we would have dominance by the Europeans.\n  I pray that this plan never becomes the law and America never has to \nexperience what this would mean to not just farmers but to the main \nstreets in every city and town all across rural America.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I would like to ask a \ncouple of questions, maybe with a comment.\n  We, of course, have a disagreement with a distinguished colleague of \nours who offers a farm bill that really is not much of a farm bill at \nall and certainly offers no hope to family farmers. But isn't the \norigin of this idea coming from people who really think the current \nfarm program, which has nearly bankrupted the rest of the family \nfarmers who are still around--they have believed this current farm \nprogram has been just dandy, that it works just swell? Isn't the origin \nof this idea from people who really think the current farm program has \nworked for family farmers?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to my colleague, it is one of the ironies of this \nplan. This plan is presented by the architects of the plan under which \nwe are operating now, which has proved itself to be a disaster. That is \nwhy we have had to write four economic disaster bills for farmers in \nthe last 4 years. Now they come along with the same chapter, second \nverse, and this is disaster No. 5. Four years of economic disasters for \nagriculture, and now they come with a new plan, a plan that is even \nworse than the plan they imposed on this country in the last farm bill. \nI do not know what could be more clear.\n  As I reported to the rest of our colleagues, the President came to \nour State and said he was going to be farmer friendly. This is a total \nreversal. I had a group of farmers from our State in my office this \nweek. I gave them the outline of this plan. They were stunned. They \nwere shocked. They could not believe this was a serious plan. When I \ntold them not only was this being proposed by one of our colleagues but \nthat the White House was poised to endorse it, they were nonplussed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for another question, there is \nthe old saying: There is no education in the second kick of a mule. My \nexpectation is, most of our colleagues will understand that this, as a \nfollow-on to the Freedom to Farm bill, is not progress but in fact it \nretards the opportunity for family farmers in this country to make a \nliving.\n  I say to Senator Conrad, one of the things I want to ask is: Our \ncountry now is trying to find out how we provide a lift to the American \neconomy because we had a very soft economy prior to these terrible \nterrorist acts that occurred on September 11. The economy was very soft \nand troubled going into that point. But, in fact, the farm economy, the \neconomy in which family farmers live, has been soft and troubled and \ncollapsing for 4, 5 years. So when you talk about giving a lift to the \nAmerican economy, family farmers out there on the land have been \nworking through a virtual depression for 4, 5 years now.\n  It is interesting; we are talking about two things in Congress: One \nis a stimulus plan to try to lift the economy, and the second is \nsecurity. In both cases, it seems to me, these proposals fail.\n  Stimulus. This isn't going to be a stimulus. This is going to be a \nlodestone. It is going to weigh down further family farmers.\n  The family farmers have been foot soldiers for this country's economy \nfor a long while. They produce the best food, at the lowest price, for \nconsumers around the world. We are lucky to have them and ought to be \nproud of them, but they are being bled by an economy that says our food \nhas no value, even as half a billion people around the world are \ndesperately hungry.\n  But the point I want to make is, the Senator talked about Europe. \nEurope understands food. Europe understands it from another point, \nwhich is the other thing we are working on: Security. Part of the issue \nof food is security.\n  Introduce bioterrorism agents into the food supply and you have \nreally big trouble. How do you do that? Perhaps as a national newscast \ntalked about recently, in a feedlot containing 200,000 cattle. That is \nwhy a broad network of family farms, disbursed across our country, \nrepresents security of America's food supply.\n  So there is a significant security interest here that the Europeans \nhave understood for a long while that we ought to start understanding.\n  Finally, I make the point that the Senator talks about the bill \nintroduction that the President says he now supports. That bill is a \nbill that offers 5 feet of rope to somebody drowning in 10 feet of \nwater. Thanks for the gesture, but it is really insignificant and does \nnot matter very much.\n  What we have to do with the leadership of Senator Conrad, myself, and \nothers who care about the future of family farmers, is to take what the \nHouse of Representatives passed--which is better than this, I might \nsay, and better than current law--and then add to it higher loan rates \nfor wheat, higher loan rates for barley, and a series of other things \nthat really make it a bill that is friendly to family farms.\n  I am talking now about families who produce America's food supply. I \nwas not going to speak to this, but I heard Senator Conrad make some \ncomments. He is right on the mark; assertive, strong, but right on the \nmark on these issues. I am proud to work with him on these matters.\n  This is life or death for the economic and financial future of many \nfamilies who have invested their hopes and dreams on a farmstead \nsomewhere in the Dakotas or up and down the heartland of the country.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n  In response to the remarks of the Senator, we are working on a \nstimulus package in the Senate to lift the economy because we know this \neconomy is in a weak condition. It has been further weakened by the \nevents of September 11. It needs a stimulus. It is extraordinary that \nin the middle of that, when, as the Senator from North Dakota \ndescribed, agriculture has been in a recession for 4 years, you would \nsay to the rural parts of the country, yes, we are going to have a \nstimulus package to lift the economy but not in the rural areas; you \nare going to be left out; you are going to be left behind; you don't \ncount. That is profoundly wrong.\n  On top of that, as the Senator described, the second key issue with \nwhich we are dealing is the question of security. The Europeans have \nmade a commitment to grow the food within their own borders because \nthey have been hungry twice. They know what it\n\n[[Page S10826]]\n\nis to be without adequate foodstuffs. Can you imagine what it would be \nlike in this current crisis if we were dependent on imported food for \nour own population's needs? How much more serious would the current \ncrisis be if we did not have a strong agricultural base in America? How \nmuch more vulnerable would we be if every day's food supply or some \nsubstantial part of it had to be brought in from other countries?\n  This is serious business. This administration's endorsement of a \nradical and ruinous farm plan must be resisted, must be defeated. We \nmust do better.\n  I hope very much that before this year is out, we will have passed a \nfarm program that will make a difference in the lives of the tens of \nthousands of farm families who are the backbone of the strength of \nAmerica. Those are the people who are the builders. Those are the \npeople who are right at the heart of making this country strong and \ngreat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from North Dakota leaves \nthe floor, there is something worth pointing out. I don't claim to have \ngreat knowledge about the farm bill. I am from a consuming State. We \nhave our farmers in Connecticut, not to the extent they do in the \nMidwest--obviously the Farm Belt of the country--but they play a very \nimportant role. As consumers, of course, it is very much in our \ninterest that we encourage domestic production of agricultural \nproducts.\n  Many of us were told the other day something that maybe I had known \nbefore, but in the context of September 11 and the events that occurred \nsince then, it surprised me I hadn't thought about it. I must mention \nit here and ask my friend for a response.\n  I was stunned to learn, once again, that less than 1 percent of all \nthe food that we import is inspected. Again, we were talking about all \nthe other problems we face, but I was sort of taken aback by the fact \nthat such a tiny percentage of the produce or products we as Americans \nconsume that comes from offshore--and many do, particularly in cold-\nweather months, particularly we import an awful lot of food from \noverseas--we are not talking about stopping that, but it seems to me in \nthe context of what the Senator is talking about, a farm bill, it is in \nall of our interests, whether you are from a farm State or not--putting \nthat issue aside but with that issue in mind--we would not be doing \neverything we could to encourage domestic production of our food \nsupplies.\n  I don't know if he had any comments he wanted to make in that regard. \nIt struck me that this would be an important point to raise at this \ntime.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for raising the \nissue. We were in a briefing the other day. Representatives from the \nadministration were alerting us to a vulnerability of this country. \nThey were making the point the Senator has made, that we are only \ninspecting about 1 percent of the foodstuffs that come into this \ncountry. That represents a vulnerability for America.\n  I say to my colleagues, if this farm plan were to pass, the \nvulnerability of America would increase geometrically. This is the most \nradical farm plan ever endorsed by any administration in my memory. I \nam 53 years old. I have followed farm policy very closely all of my \nlife, being from a farm State. It is breathtaking what this \nadministration has said we should put in place.\n  It is absolutely the wrong plan at the wrong time, and we must reject \nit.\n  I thank my colleague very much for his input.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I have found in my years of service \nwith the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, every time he \nproposes something in the area of agriculture, I follow. I have found \nmyself to have a good record on farm policy because of his leadership. \nI thank him for his comments today. He not only speaks for his own \nState and region of the country; he speaks for all Americans who care \nabout this most critical issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10826-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10826-S10829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BEST PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier today this body passed, by unanimous \nvote, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. This is a bill I \nauthored a number of years ago with my good friend from Ohio, Senator \nMike DeWine. He is presently occupied at a Judiciary Committee hearing, \nand he will come to the floor and offer his own statement. I ask \nunanimous consent that whatever time he seeks, the Chair would provide \nhim with an opportunity to be heard on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio. He has been a \ngreat partner in numerous efforts we have made together on behalf of \nchildren. S. 838 is something for which both of us are tremendously \nproud, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.\n  Let me briefly describe the bill, why it is a bit different than the \nbill we passed 3 years ago, and why it is important.\n  This bill would reauthorize the pediatric testing incentive \nlegislation we passed in 1997 as part of the Food and Drug \nAdministration Modernization Act. This important program has gone a \nlong way toward ensuring that doctors and parents have the most up-to-\ndate and critical information on medications for our children. It has \nbeen an important achievement.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 20 percent--I \nthink a little less--of the drugs on the market have been tested and \nlabeled specifically for their safety and effectiveness for children. \nChildren are simply not smaller versions of adults, as I hope most \npeople are aware.\n  The bodies of infants, toddlers, and adolescents are very different \nand react very differently to drugs than adults do. The absence of \npediatric labeling poses some very significant risks for children. \nWithout adequate information about how a drug works in children of \ndifferent ages and sizes, they are more likely to be either underdosed \nor overdosed or to experience dangerous side effects.\n  Mr. President, again, years ago--in fact, in fairly recent history--\nthere were a lot of products out there for adults and children, but for \nmany years there were just the basics, and parents, over the years, \nwould take the old family aspirin and the children's dosage was to cut \nit into quarters or halves and take it. It was pretty safe. Nobody \nsuffered terribly. Trying to calculate a child's dosage of traditional \nmedicines in times past was not that difficult. There were some \nhazards. But we have seen a wonderful explosion of new products.\n  I note the Senator from New Jersey is presiding. Both in his State \nand mine, we have literally thousands of constituents who have \ndedicated their lives to the research and development of products to \nmake us all healthier, live better lives, and live longer.\n  In the process, however, only about 20 percent, as I mentioned--a \nlittle less--have actually been tested and designed to serve children's \nneeds. Despite the fact that children represent in excess of one-\nquarter of the population of this country--25 percent--only a tiny \nfraction of the products on the shelves to be prescribed by doctors are \nactually labeled and designed to meet their needs. It seems sort of \nstaggering to me that we have waited so long to do this. We have labels \non the food that children can eat. We now have labels on the music to \nwhich they listen. We have labels that will tell you what movies you \nought not to let your child go to. But when it comes to pharmaceutical \nproducts, we have very little of that.\n  With that as a background, Senator DeWine and I, in 1997, as part of \nthe Food and Drug Administration modernization bill, crafted this \nlegislation as a way to see if we could not induce --there was a debate \non whether we should mandate it and say you have to do it whether you \nlike it or not, which is one approach, or should we say we will give \nyou a chance to prove to us you can do it by providing 6 months of \nexclusivity in the marketplace. There was a debate about that.\n  I had my own doubts about whether or not this was going to work very \nwell. I must say the success of this legislation has been beyond \nanyone's wildest imagination. If I can, I will share some of the \ncomments made about the success of the 1997 act, which would go out of \nexistence, by the way.\n  Why did we need to pass this legislation, and why am I so \nappreciative of\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\nthe Members who helped make this happen? It didn't happen just with \nSenator DeWine and I. A lot of people were involved, and I am grateful \nto them all.\n  The bill would have gone out of existence; it expires at the end of \nDecember. The period of exclusivity would be over and the question of \nwhether or not we would be able to see the continued development of \nchildren's products in the area of pharmaceuticals would become less \nattractive.\n  Look at some of the comments. This is from the Food and Drug \nAdministration status report to Congress in January of this year:\n\n       The pediatric exclusivity provision has done more to \n     generate clinical studies and is more useful in \n     prescribing information for the pediatric population than \n     any other regulatory or legislative process to date.\n\n  That is a pretty remarkable statement. I am grateful for that. \nFurther down here, this is from the National Association of Children's \nHospitals:\n\n       This is a remarkable achievement for children's health. We \n     know from talking with pediatric researchers at children's \n     hospitals across the country that the effect of the pediatric \n     exclusivity provision has been very positive for children and \n     their families and their providers of care.\n\n  Further down is a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics. \nThese are the pediatricians across the country:\n\n       We cannot overstate how important this legislation has been \n     in advancing children's therapeutics. It is allowing children \n     to have the same kind of drug safety and efficacy information \n     that was only available previously to adults.\n\n  There is also a letter from the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS \nFoundation:\n\n       Regarding costs, the FDA estimates that consumer prices of \n     drugs have increased by one-half of one percent annually as a \n     result of the initiatives of pediatric testing. As \n     individuals who have fought for decades for better health \n     care for children, we firmly believe this is a legitimate \n     price to pay to ensure our children's well-being.\n\n  I don't know of anybody who will argue with that when you consider \nthe difference we can make in children's lives. If I can, let me share \nwith my colleagues more specifically what has happened. In light of the \nextraordinary times we find ourselves in today, the national debate on \nhow to prepare and protect all Americans from bioterrorism further \nhighlights the importance of drug safety and the efficacy of \ninformation when it comes to treating children. Children are especially \nvulnerable to the release of chemical or biological toxins. As we \nidentify antibiotics or vaccines to prevent or treat illnesses related \nto bioterrorism, we are going to need to know the proper dosing \ninformation, possible side effects or risks of this kind of medicine, \nand the effectiveness of the various agents children would be \ningesting. Any antidotes used for children will be affecting them at \ncritical periods of childhood growth and development. We need to have \nproper medications to prevent or reduce those risks.\n  This bill could help ensure that essential treatments for exposure to \nhazardous materials are studied. I will work with the FDA and my \ncolleagues, Senators Clinton of New York, Kennedy, and Frist. In fact, \nI thank Senator Frist and Senator Clinton for their contribution to \nthis effort today. Our hope is that we will get it done in conference \nand strengthen some language to require that the industry start \ndeveloping children's vaccines and antibiotics in the area of \nbioterrorism.\n  So this bill is a timely piece of legislation. I am confident the \nHouse will act. I urge them to do so quickly, to incorporate some of \nthe changes that we think can make a difference in terms of children's \nhealth.\n  I will say what was going on before we passed this bill. In the 3 \nyears, 36 months, since we passed this legislation--prior to the \npassage of this bill, there had been a total in the previous 7 years of \n11 clinical trials for products designed for children. I think there \nmay have been 2 or 3 products that had come on the market designed \nspecifically for children in 6 or 7 years. In the 36 months, since the \nbill that Senator DeWine and I wrote, there have been 400 clinical \ntrials. In 36 months, there have been 400 clinical trials as opposed to \n11 in the previous 7 years in children's pharmaceutical products. \nToday, there are 40 new products in 36 months being prescribed for \nchildren. They did not exist 36 months ago.\n  It occurs specifically because of the legislation we adopted--this \nbody and the other body--in 1997. That bill was about to go out of \nexistence. The bill we passed today--and every Member ought to take \npride in it because every Member allowed this bill to go forward. Many, \nsuch as my friend from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, are cosponsors. I \nwill leave the record open for others who would like to be associated \nwith it.\n  In the midst of all of these terrible events going on--this body is \nworking today, by the way, and we did excellent work today, this body \npassed a bill that will make a difference in people's lives. So we are \nnot just meeting for the sake of meeting to have a good show, but \nactually we adopted this legislation by unanimous consent. It would not \nhave occurred without the cooperation of Democrats and Republicans--the \n100 Members in this body who allowed this legislation to go forward.\n  In 36 months, there have been 400 clinical trials and almost 40 new \nproducts on the shelves. That is the record of this little bill \nattached to the FDA Modernization Act.\n  Let me talk about one product and make this case more clearly. I am \ntalking about a product that, as a result of pediatric studies, would \nmake any parent's heart skip a beat; it is called Versed. Versed is one \nof the most commonly used sedatives for children undergoing surgery or \nother hospital procedures.\n  As a result of these pediatric studies, the label has been changed to \nindicate a higher risk of serious life-threatening situations in \nchildren with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension who \nneed lower doses than predicted to prevent respiratory compromise.\n  Can you imagine doctors using Versed without knowing that \ninformation? Until we got these studies underway, it was unknown. But \nas a result of 36 months of effort, this product today is being used in \na way that is saving lives and making a difference. Maybe it does not \nget banner headlines and it will not lead the news tonight, but it is \nsomething that will make a difference in the lives of children and \ntheir parents who care about their health.\n  I heard from a doctor from Children's Mercy Hospital about a 6-year-\nold boy, Darryl, who required metal pins to be inserted in his leg \nafter his femur was broken in a bicycling accident. Darryl was \nprescribed Versed to relieve his anxiety and discomfort when the \ndoctors and nurses each day cleaned the wounds resulting from his \ninjury. This new information on Versed allowed health care providers to \ntreat this young man safely and effectively with this drug.\n  The second chart is before and after effects of our legislation. It \nis in small print. I will try to describe it.\n  We get the products, indications, what labeling was prior to the \nadoption of this bill 36 months ago, and what has occurred afterwards. \nI will run down from everything dealing with diabetes, hepatitis, \nhypertension, juvenile arthritis, seizures, and the like. This is just \na partial list to give my colleagues some idea of the drugs to treat \nhepatitis B, hypertension, diabetes, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and \nepilepsy, just to name a few. They previously had labels that simply \nread:\n\n       Safety and effectiveness in children not established.\n\n  That was the guideline a doctor or parent had in these areas.\n  Now we have dosing information, safety information, and the \ninformation on adverse side effects. In fact, in one drug study for \nepilepsy, Neurontin was found to be most effective in higher doses for \nchildren under 5 years of age. I heard from Dr. Philip Walson at \nChildren's Hospital Medical Center in Ohio who told me:\n\n       Some children with previously uncontrolled seizures now are \n     controlled with higher doses of this drug than [what] would \n     have been used [prior to pediatric testing] if adult doses \n     were just ``scaled down.''\n\n  In this case, instead of breaking off the aspirin and getting a \nsmaller dose, as a result of the studies, we learned Neurontin, which \nis a seizure controlling medication--people who have had strokes know \nabout Neurontin--for children makes a difference. Increasing the dosage \nactually made a difference.\n  Far more significant than the number of studies and drugs tested are \nthe stories of kids who can be helped by\n\n[[Page S10828]]\n\nthis increased information. This past June I met with a group of five \nyoung children from my State of Connecticut; they were suffering from \njuvenile diabetes. In fact, almost every office had a visit from kids \nfrom their State suffering with juvenile diabetes.\n\n  One young man who came to my office was from Bethel, CT, 12-year-old \nJason Baron. I put his picture up. I am giving him TV time. He was so \neloquent and remarkable. He could run for the Senate. He is a \nwonderful, eloquent person with juvenile diabetes. He just blew me \naway. We got to talking. He aspires--and I see my friend from \nTennessee, and he will appreciate this--as he told me, without missing \na syllable--and I may--that he intends to be a pediatric \nendocrinologist at 12 years of age. That is his life goal as a young \nman with juvenile diabetes.\n  I was amazed and impressed at the maturity and sense of \nresponsibility of this young man who is managing his disease and \neducating others, as he was doing on Capitol Hill and as he does at \nschool. Part of his civic activity is to teach about juvenile diabetes.\n  One of the drugs studied and labeled as a result of the bill we \npassed 3 years ago is Lantus. It is a new and recombinant form of \ninsulin for type I diabetes which requires only once-a-day \nadministration and results in less allergic reactions. This drug, and \nothers similar to it, could help children such as Jason improve the \nquality of their lives by introducing more flexibility into their \ntreatment regimes.\n  While tremendous progress has been made, still more needs to be done, \nobviously, to make sure children are not an afterthought when it comes \nto pharmaceutical research. Hundreds of drugs are on the market today \nthat are used in children but still have not been tested for pediatric \nneeds.\n  We reauthorized earlier this morning the pediatric testing incentive, \nand the explosion of research it has promised, which was set to expire \non January 1, 2002. I am very grateful to my colleagues for the \nbipartisan support we received.\n  I mentioned the presence of Senator Frist. I mentioned his name once \nbefore, and I will mention it again. He was tremendously helpful 3 \nyears ago when we originally wrote the bill and then when we watched \nthe success of this legislation, which I already described. We inserted \nsome language to encourage the industry to develop the vaccines and \nantibodies in the bioterrorism field. Senator Frist is working with the \nadministration and others of us to develop more comprehensive \nlegislation dealing with bioterrorism. We thought this bill was an \nattractive vehicle to put on something dealing with this issue.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy, the chairman of the committee, for his \nterrific work, Senator Frist who I mentioned already, Senator Wellstone \nof Minnesota, Senator Hatch who has been tremendously helpful, Senator \nClinton, Senator Reid, Senator Jeffords, Senator Bond was involved; \nSenator Corzine, the Presiding Officer, I know cares about this as \nwell, and Senator Bingaman for their important contributions. I thank \nSenator Conrad and Senator Domenici who were helpful today in moving \nthis bill along. I thank Senator Durbin who offered some good \nsuggestions on the legislation as well, and I thank him for those \nthoughts.\n  If I am leaving someone out, I apologize. I will add the names \naccordingly at the appropriate time. I also thank Deborah Barrett of my \noffice, who has been a tireless staff person working with the staff of \nMike DeWine, with Senator Clinton, Senator Frist, and so many others, \nto iron out some of the disagreements we were wrestling with on this \nlegislation.\n\n  Lastly, let me tell you some of the improvements we made in the bill.\n  We ensure that the new safety information for pediatric studies is \npromptly added to drug labels.\n  We require that the Food and Drug Administration quickly disseminate \ninformation gathered from pediatric studies to pediatricians and \nparents.\n  We authorize Federal dollars to study older off-patent drugs which \nare not eligible for the existing pediatric testing incentive through a \nnew off-patent fund and creating a mechanism for private contributions \nfrom manufacturers to support the study of off-patent drugs through an \nexisting NIH foundation.\n  We request frequent and thorough evaluations of the program so we can \nmonitor our effectiveness in getting the needed drugs studied and, \nimportantly, to have a sense of which needed drugs are not being \nstudied despite FDA requests.\n  In fact, to ensure that vital drugs are not being left unstudied, the \nbill includes a mechanism to ensure that if a company declines to study \nan on-patent drug that is a continuing benefit to children, the \nSecretary will make public the names of those must-study drugs that \nhave not been picked up and refer them to the NIH foundation for \nfunding. As a backstop, these drugs can also be referred to the off-\npatent fund.\n  The bill creates a new Office of Pediatric Therapeutics at the Food \nand Drug Administration to coordinate activities related to children. \nIt authorizes the existing Pediatric Oncology Subcommittee to provide \nrecommendations and guidance so children with cancer can have timely \naccess to promising new therapies.\n  Finally, because the bill will lead to increased participation of \nchildren in clinical trials--I mentioned 400 already in the last 36 \nmonths--we have requested a study of the appropriateness and adequacy \nof current Federal research protections for children in clinical \ntrials. I will continue to work with Senator DeWine and my colleagues \nto ensure the strongest protections are in place for this vulnerable \npart of our population.\n  We have relied generously on the expertise and counsel of Elaine \nHolland Vining of the American Academy of Pediatrics; Mike Isaac and \nNatasha Bilimoria of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, \nwho worked tirelessly on behalf of children; Helen Rhee with Senator \nFrist; David Dorsey, David Nexon, and Paul Kim with Senator Kennedy \ndeserve tremendous thanks for their work in negotiating and working out \nthe fine details of this bill.\n  I again thank our colleagues for their contribution today. I see the \ndistinguished majority whip in the Chamber. I know the media may report \nnothing much happened today. Well, maybe it did not get a lot of \ndebate, but we passed this children's bill. And I see my friend from \nMaine, Senator Collins, and I want to thank her as well for her help on \nthis bill.\n  The distinguished majority leader has arrived. I say to the majority \nleader, this bill did not generate huge debate. We did it unanimously. \nThis bill has already made a huge difference in the lives of millions \nof children: 400 clinical trials in 36 months as opposed to 11 in the \nprevious 7 years.\n  So we think we have done something worthwhile today, in the midst of \nother news, which will not likely generate a headline. The Senate put \nit on the agenda and did a good job.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. This is another notch in the long line of things the \nSenator from Connecticut has done for children. Whether it was child \ncare, dealing with the emotional health of children, it is one of many \nthings the Senator from Connecticut has done. I guess this is kind of a \ncelebration of his being a new father. So we congratulate him.\n  Mr. DODD. I will show pictures, if you like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Nevada in \nexpressing my heartfelt congratulations to the Senator from Connecticut \nand to others on the committee for their swift action on this bill. \nThis is one of the highlights of the week. I do not know that there \ncould be anything more important than providing good quality health \ncare in all of its iterations to children. That is what this \nlegislation does, and only because of the leadership of Senator Dodd. I \ncommend him. There may be a connection between fatherhood and \nlegislative production on children, but whatever the motivation, as the \nSenator from Nevada has said, no one has put more time and effort and \nleadership into the issues affecting children than has Senator Dodd. So \nit is a good way to end the week. It is another reason that staying in \ntoday was important, and we are grateful to him, grateful to the \nMembers of the committee, Republican and Democrat, for the work done. I \nthank him.\n\n[[Page S10829]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I noted yesterday I would be coming to \nthis Chamber. I will take a moment, if I may, to provide our colleagues \nwith a short update on the circumstances involving the Senate today.\n  This has been a trying time for all of us, in particular for my \noffice and staff. I am thankful for the outpouring of concern and \nsupport we have received, especially from the family of Senators. I am \nvery grateful for their friendship, for their words of encouragement, \nfor the strength they have given me and my staff over these very \ndifficult days. It has meant a lot.\n  I wish to thank as well the many experts who have come to investigate \nand to help. I wish to recognize Secretary Thompson; Dr. Ken Moritsugu, \ndeputy surgeon general; all of the Health and Human Services staff; Dr. \nJohn Eisold, our attending physician of the U.S. Capitol, and all the \nphysicians who are working in his office; MG John Parker of the U.S. \nArmy; Dr. Greg Martin, who has been unbelievable, an incredible help to \nmy staff, to me, and to the entire Senate during this time.\n  There are a number of professionals who work with Dr. Martin at \nBethesda Naval Hospital whom I want to recognize as well. Were it not \nfor their effort, we would not be in the position we are today. They \nhave been working around the clock analyzing the thousands of tests \nthat were taken. Though they are not in the Capitol compound, they have \nhad every bit as much to do with our success in dealing with these \ncircumstances as anyone else. So we are extremely grateful to them for \ntheir work.\n  I want to thank as well the Centers for Disease Control, including \nRima Khabbaz and Ali Khan; the District of Columbia Department of \nPublic Health. Finally, I thank the members of the Senate family who \nhave been working around the clock to address this situation, to \ncoordinate our response, and see to it that the Senate was able to \ncontinue its important work.\n  Maybe first, among all of those, I thank our Secretary of the Senate \nand our Sergeant at Arms for their outstanding work. There were several \nnights where they literally did not go to bed. They stayed up the \nentire night working to be able to address the many challenges we were \nfacing as we looked at the logistical and health concerns people had.\n  I also wish to thank Dr. Bill Frist. He was in this Chamber earlier. \nHe has been an amazing resource. While he is not present now, I know I \nspeak for all of our colleagues in thanking him. He again spoke for all \nof us in a news conference wherein he was able to answer in very \nunderstandable ways many of these complicated questions. So I \npersonally thank him, and I know I speak for everybody in thanking him \nas well.\n  The challenge facing all of these people, and all of us, is \nunprecedented. To a person, every official I have mentioned has \nresponded in the most admirable way. Their poise, their \nprofessionalism, their compassion have been a comfort to all of us, \nespecially to my staff and me.\n  I want to provide an update on where we stand based on Dr. \nMoritsugu's briefing a few moments ago. It is now 72 hours after this \nincident occurred, and we now can say we are confident about the health \nof the public. Beyond the 31 positive nasal swabs I reported yesterday, \nthe results on nasal swabs analyzed to date have all--and let me \nemphasize all--come back negative. The CDC has determined no further \nnasal swabs are needed. Tests on all of the nasal swabs collected on \nMonday will be completed by the end of today, although we may not be in \nsession, so I chose this moment to come and give at least this partial \nreport.\n\n  A total of 278 swabs were taken Monday. At this time, there are no \nfurther positive results. So the number of positive results to date \nremains at 31. Everyone who has tested positive has been notified by \nmedical authorities.\n  Let me put some rumor to rest because it has been circulating all \nafternoon that some member of the leadership has been provided with a \npositive test result. The unequivocal clarification in that regard is, \nthat story is not true. There is no positive result among any members \nof Senate leadership.\n  Testing also continues on approximately 1,400 swabs collected \nTuesday. Of those, preliminary results on approximately 600 have \nproduced no new positives. To this point, the CDC investigation has \nestablished the exposure area as the fifth and sixth floors in the \nsoutheast wing of the Hart Building. Based on this determination, the \nCDC has said no further nasal swabs are needed there.\n  People who were on the fifth and sixth floors in the southeast wing \nof the Hart Building on Monday are being reminded to complete their \nfull 60-day course of antibiotics, regardless of the results of their \nnasal swabs. Anyone who entered that area but has not received \nantibiotics should report to the treatment center at the Architect of \nthe Capitol facility on the southeast corner of 6th and East Capitol \nStreets.\n  A thorough environmental sweep of the Capitol complex began last \nnight. It went on throughout the night and continues today. Those \nsweeps were conducted by the EPA and the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health. Areas were swept in the Capitol, the \nDirksen Senate Office Building, the Ford House Office Building, the \nCapitol Police offsite delivery center where all Capitol mail and \ndeliveries go through security screening, and at this time there are no \nadditional results to report.\n  The sweeps will continue, as we reported yesterday, over the next \nseveral days of the other areas of the Capitol complex. The entire \nCapitol complex will be swept, and so there will not be any area left \nunattended or unchecked before we are cleared.\n  Numerous additional samples have been taken of the ventilation \nsystems, and these samples are under evaluation. I think it is \nimportant to emphasize, too, at this time there is no evidence of \ncontamination in the ventilation system.\n  Because of the extensive work being done, it is not clear when the \nHart Building will reopen, but it will reopen as soon as we are \nabsolutely confident it is completely safe.\n  I want to make one final point. The people who work in these \nbuildings, regardless of their political affiliation, have come to the \ncity and to the Congress because they believe in what this Nation \nrepresents to its citizens and to the world. Many have made sacrifices \nto do so. Some are accepting lower pay than they would receive \nelsewhere. Many are far from their families. All believe that by being \nhere we can improve the lives of Americans and, in the process, make \nAmerica stronger.\n  That letter may have been addressed to me, but these attacks didn't \nstrike just my office. They struck at the heart of that belief. In the \npast couple of days, members of my staff, who have every right to be \nafraid, who have every right to take some time and be with their loved \nones, have come to talk to me. More than one has told me they were more \nproud than ever to show up for work. This attack was meant to undercut \nthat spirit. What I have seen in the past 3 days is all I need to know \nthat the attack has missed its mark.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Everyone knows the close personal relationship I have with \nthe majority leader. This statement I am making could come from any of \nthe 99 Senators. It doesn't have to come from me.\n  The leader has gone out of his way to congratulate his staff, to \ncompliment his staff, to talk about the great work the Sergeant at Arms \nand the Secretary of the Senate have done. They deserve every bit of \ncredit that the leader has given them. Senator Frist deserves the \ncredit he has been given by the majority leader. But speaking for the \nwhole Senate, there is no one who deserves more credit during this time \nof strife and trouble and turmoil caused by evil people trying to do \nbad things than our majority leader. He has stood very tall.\n  I am speaking for the entire Senate, the people of the State of \nNevada, the people of New Jersey, the people of Minnesota, the people \nof Maine: Everybody in this country is so proud of the\n\n[[Page S10830]]\n\nmajority leader of the Senate. When the history books are written about \npeople standing tall during a time of crisis, Tom Daschle will be at \nthe top of that stack.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada for his \nkind and generous words. This has been a difficult challenge for all of \nus. I am grateful.\n  I note that any time somebody gives me credit for ``standing tall,'' \nI will take that as the highest compliment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I echo the words of the Senator from \nNevada. We have all been impressed with the tremendous grace and \nstrength that our Senate majority leader has shown under unbelievable \npressure. Our thoughts are with him and with his staff as they continue \nto go through this ordeal. He has, indeed, made every Member proud by \nhis actions during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10830-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BETTER PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

I want to \ntake a moment to congratulate all the people who are working, all the \npeople who are working in the Senate Chamber, all the Members' staffs \nwho are working. Hearings have been held today. The Senate has been in \nsession and work is continuing. I thank them for their dedication. I \nthank them for what they mean for our country and what they have done \nto help our country.\n  The vast majority of people who work on Capitol Hill, at least from \nmy perspective in life, are fairly young. They have gone through \nsomething that no members of staffs have ever gone through before. They \nhave done very well. I congratulate them and thank them.\n  I want to pay particular tribute to my staff and thank them. Eight \nmembers of my staff have been tested, as have hundreds of other members \nof other staffs.

So our thoughts and prayers go to her and to her family \nand the Cherry family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10830-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10830-S10832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BEST PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. One of the things that passed today was a bill that \nSenator Dodd and I have been working on for some time. Senator Dodd \ntalked a little bit about it on the Senate floor earlier today. This \nbill is S. 838, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.\n  This is reauthorization legislation which Senator Dodd and I wrote to \nensure that more medicines are tested for children and that useful \nprescribing and dosing information appears on labels.\n  Let me take a moment on a personal note to congratulate my friend, \nSenator Dodd, and his wife Jackie on the recent birth of their daughter \nGrace. I had the opportunity a couple of days ago when Senator Dodd and \nhis wife Jackie brought baby Grace into the Capitol to see baby Grace, \na beautiful child--a great joy. So our congratulations go to both of \nthem.\n  It is appropriate that the first piece of legislation that Senator \nDodd passed after the birth of his little girl was a bill that will \nhelp children, a bill that will make sure that good pharmaceuticals are \navailable for children and that doctors, specifically pediatricians, \nand parents will know what the dosage for each medicine should be for \ntheir particular child, for the age of that child.\n  Four years ago, Senator Dodd and I first learned that the vast \nmajority of drugs in this country that came on the market every week--\nin fact over 80 percent--had never been formally tested or approved for \npediatric use and therefore lacked even the most basic labeling \ninformation regarding dosing recommendations for children. When we \nfound that out, we began writing what is now referred to as the \npediatric exclusivity law. That bill passed. In the 3 years since that \nlaw went into effect, the FDA has issued about 200 written requests for \npediatric studies.\n\n  Companies have undertaken over 400 pediatric studies, of which over \n58 studies have been completed, for a wide range of critical diseases, \nincluding juvenile diabetes, the problem of pain, asthma, and \nhypertension.\n  Mr. President, 37 drugs have been granted pediatric exclusivity. Some \nstudies generated by this incentive have led to essential dosing \ninformation; for example, Luvox. Luvox is a drug prescribed to treat \nobsessive-compulsive disorder. Pediatric studies performed pursuant to \nour law have shown inadequate dosing for adolescents, which resulted in \nineffective treatment. The studies also have shown that some girls \nbetween the ages of 8 and 11 were potentially overdosed, with levels up \nto 2 to 3 times that which was really needed.\n  Since our law has been in effect, the private sector has increased \nits investment in pediatric training and developing a infrastructure to \nsupport and expand pediatric research. The FDA stated in a January 2001 \nreport:\n\n       The pediatric exclusivity provision has done more to \n     generate clinical studies and useful prescribing information \n     for the pediatric population than any other regulatory or \n     legislative process to date.\n\n  The bill this Senate and House passed 3 years ago has done a great \ndeal of good. We are seeing more drugs for children on the market that \nhave a label that tells how they can be used, and more basic \ninformation for pediatricians. So when they look at that little child \nand they know the age of that child and they know the weight of that \nchild, they can look it up and see exactly what the prescription should \nbe, what the dosage should be, what the indicators are. They can do \nthat because we have given the pharmaceutical companies an incentive to \ndo that research, research they were doing prior to passage of this \nbill in only 20 percent of the cases.\n  A great deal of progress has been made, but we have further to go. \nThat is what we were about today with the passage of the bill that I am \nnow describing. Senator Dodd and I and the other cosponsors knew that \nthe law we passed 3 years ago could be improved. We knew that it had \nsome holes in it. We set out to improve that, to fill the gaps, and \naddress the outstanding issues, such as the testing of off-patent \ndrugs, which the original law was never designed to include. It is \nunderstandable why the original law wasn't designed to include off-\npatent drugs. The original law extended the patent by 6 months. They \nextend it for 6 months if and only if they tested these drugs for \nchildren.\n  If a drug is not on-patent, if it is off-patent, the patent has \nbasically expired, obviously that incentive doesn't do any good. What \nwe tried to do with this bill that we passed today was to change that \nand therefore expand it and expand the purpose of this bill to include \noff-patent drugs as well.\n  For some products and some age groups, the existing market incentives \nare simply inadequate to encourage new pediatric research. In the bill \nwe passed several hours ago, we have built upon the existing law's \nbasic incentive structure to further ensure that these\n\n[[Page S10831]]\n\nessential products, and young age groups, are included within the scope \nof the program.\n\n  To make perfectly clear the need for additional legislation, I would \nlike to quote a significant passage from the FDA's January 2001 report, \nwhich stated the following:\n\n       A majority of marketed drugs are not labeled for use in \n     pediatric patients, or are labeled for use only in specific \n     pediatric age groups . . . And many of the drugs most widely \n     used in pediatric patients carry disclaimers in their \n     labeling stating that safety and effectiveness in pediatric \n     patients have not been established. The absence of pediatric \n     labeling information poses significant risks for children. \n     Inadequate dosing information exposes pediatric patients to \n     the risk of adverse reactions, usually age-specific adverse \n     reactions that could be avoided if such information were \n     provided in product labeling. The absence of pediatric \n     testing and labeling may also expose pediatric patients to \n     ineffective treatment through underdosing, or may deny \n     pediatric patients therapeutic advances because physicians \n     choose to prescribe existing, less effective medications in \n     the face of insufficient pediatric information about a new \n     medication.\n\n  These facts are very disturbing. Through our bill, we have sought to \nfind a way to improve the labeling process. Since our law has not been \nimplemented for very long, many labels are still in the process of \nbeing requested and negotiated by the FDA. In this new bill, the new \ntimeframes established in the bill for labeling negotiations, together \nwith the enforcement authority under the existing misbranding statute, \nwill help to ensure that essential pediatric information generated from \nstudies implemented under this law, will result in necessary and timely \nlabeling changes.\n  Our bill establishes timeframes for responding to written requests, \ntimeframes and processes for negotiating label changes, and authorizes \nthe federal government to deem a drug misbranded if the company refuses \nto relabel its drug. The government would then begin an enforcement \naction under its existing authority to seek a court order regarding the \nrelabeling of the drug.\n  Through the bill that we are about to pass today, we will ensure that \npriority drugs which lack patent or other market exclusivity will be \ntested for children. For example, the Ritalin label states the \nfollowing:\n\n       Precautions: Long-term effects of Ritalin in children have \n     not been well established. Warning: Ritalin should not be \n     used in children under six years since safety and \n     [effectiveness] in this age group has not been established.\n\n  The point is that Ritalin is being prescribed off-label for children \nunder six years of age, and yet we do not know the safety and \neffectiveness, since it has only been tested in children older than \nsix, and we do not know long-term effects on children of any age.\n  Our bill creates a mechanism to ``capture'' the off-patent drugs for \nwhich the Secretary determines additional studies are needed to assess \nthe safety and effectiveness of the drug's use in the pediatric \npopulation.\n  In other words, our bill provides for the testing of some cases of \nthese off-patent drugs.\n  By expanding the mission of the existing NIH Foundation to include \ncollecting and awarding grants for conducting certain pediatric \nstudies, we have provided a funding mechanism for ensuring studies that \nare completed for both off-patent drugs and those marketed on-patent \ndrugs that a company declines to study--and for which the Secretary \ndetermines there is a continuing need for information relating to the \nuse of the drug in the pediatric population.\n  That is the language in the bill. That is the correct area.\n  By first seeking funding through the Foundation, we provide a \nmechanism for drug companies to contribute to the funding of mainly \noff-patent drugs and also to a narrow group of on-patent drugs, \nincluding those for neonates, for which companies have declined to \naccept the written request to pursue the six month market exclusivity \nextension.\n  The Neonates, of course, are young children up to one-month of age.\n  If the Foundation lacks the funds to study that prioritized drug, the \nSecretary may then issue a request for proposal--``RFP''--for a third \nparty to study the commercially available drug using money from a \nResearch Fund that we create in this bill. The Secretary may then \npublish the name of the company that declined to study the drug, the \nname of the drug, and the indication or use that is being requested to \nbe studied. This would ensure that more data is collected and reported, \nso that we can better understand which drugs are not being studied.\n  A condition of the RFP or contract with a third party is that all \ndata and information generated from the pediatric study in the form of \na report must be submitted to the NIH and the FDA. The FDA must then \nreview the report and data and negotiate whatever labeling changes the \nFDA determines is appropriate.\n  I thank Senator Bond for his determined focus on helping to further \nensure that neonates also benefit from this pediatric testing law. I \ncongratulate and thank him. We have included neonates in the definition \nof ``pediatric studies'' to which this pediatric exclusivity applies. \nThroughout the bill we have also encouraged the inclusion of neonates \nin written requests, when appropriate.\n  To further ensure that the safety of children in clinical trials is \nprotected, this bill requires that the Institute of Medicine--IOM--\nconduct a review of federal regulations, reports, and research \ninvolving children and provide recommendations on best practices \nrelating to research involving children. The IOM is to consider the \nresults of the study by HHS that Senator Dodd and I included as part of \nthe Children's Health act last year. I look forward to working with \nSenators Dodd, Frist, and Kennedy on the issue of human subject \nprotections, especially in focusing on protections of children \nparticipating in clinical trials.\n  I want to thank my friend, Senator Dodd for his relentless efforts in \nmaking this reauthorization a reality, and for his relentlessness in \nimproving the bill. I look forward to working on many more pediatric \ninitiatives with him in the future.\n  Let me also thank Senators Kennedy and Clinton for their strong \nsupport of this bill and of children's health overall. Let me also \nthank Senator Collins for her support and for her work in regard to \nthis bill.\n  I want to acknowledge and thank Debra Barrett, Jeanne Ireland, \nChristie Onoda, David Dorsey, David Nexon, Paul Kim, Christina Ho, John \nGilman, and Tim Trushel for their hard work in helping us reach \nagreement on such a well-crafted bill. I cannot think of a bill that \ntook more hard work, more Members and staff than this bill.\n  I also extend my appreciation to Elaine Holland Vining with the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics for the tenacious effort, technical \nassistance, and expertise she brought to this bill. She is expecting \nher first child shortly, and I wish her and her husband, Paul, my very \nbest wishes as they begin their family.\n  I also appreciate the diligent work of Mark Isaac and Natasha \nBilimoria with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in \nhelping us negotiate and pass this important reauthorization.\n  Finally, I must say a very special thanks to a former member of my \nstaff, Helen Rhee, who is now working for Senator Frist on the HELP \nCommittee. She has been absolutely instrumental in seeing this \nlegislation through from its inception to its passage. Without her \ntireless efforts, her dogged determination, and a work ethic that is \njust unsurpassed, we would not be at this point today, we would not \nhave seen this bill pass. Literally, right up until the last moment, \nliterally, before the bill passed, Helen was continuing her work. So I \npay tribute to her. This bill is a real tribute to her dedication and \nto her efforts.\n\n  So I thank Helen and all the members of the different staffs who have \nworked so hard on this bill.\n  Let me also take a moment to thank Senator Hatch and his staff, Bruce \nArtim, for their work in drafting language to correct and clarify this \nbill, specifically to clarify that pediatric exclusivity law is not and \nwas never intended to eliminate incentives granted to generic drug \nmanufacturers that are awarded 180 days of exclusivity under the 1984 \nHatch-Waxman law for successfully challenging a patent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S10832]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10830-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10830-S10832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BEST PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. One of the things that passed today was a bill that \nSenator Dodd and I have been working on for some time. Senator Dodd \ntalked a little bit about it on the Senate floor earlier today. This \nbill is S. 838, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.\n  This is reauthorization legislation which Senator Dodd and I wrote to \nensure that more medicines are tested for children and that useful \nprescribing and dosing information appears on labels.\n  Let me take a moment on a personal note to congratulate my friend, \nSenator Dodd, and his wife Jackie on the recent birth of their daughter \nGrace. I had the opportunity a couple of days ago when Senator Dodd and \nhis wife Jackie brought baby Grace into the Capitol to see baby Grace, \na beautiful child--a great joy. So our congratulations go to both of \nthem.\n  It is appropriate that the first piece of legislation that Senator \nDodd passed after the birth of his little girl was a bill that will \nhelp children, a bill that will make sure that good pharmaceuticals are \navailable for children and that doctors, specifically pediatricians, \nand parents will know what the dosage for each medicine should be for \ntheir particular child, for the age of that child.\n  Four years ago, Senator Dodd and I first learned that the vast \nmajority of drugs in this country that came on the market every week--\nin fact over 80 percent--had never been formally tested or approved for \npediatric use and therefore lacked even the most basic labeling \ninformation regarding dosing recommendations for children. When we \nfound that out, we began writing what is now referred to as the \npediatric exclusivity law. That bill passed. In the 3 years since that \nlaw went into effect, the FDA has issued about 200 written requests for \npediatric studies.\n\n  Companies have undertaken over 400 pediatric studies, of which over \n58 studies have been completed, for a wide range of critical diseases, \nincluding juvenile diabetes, the problem of pain, asthma, and \nhypertension.\n  Mr. President, 37 drugs have been granted pediatric exclusivity. Some \nstudies generated by this incentive have led to essential dosing \ninformation; for example, Luvox. Luvox is a drug prescribed to treat \nobsessive-compulsive disorder. Pediatric studies performed pursuant to \nour law have shown inadequate dosing for adolescents, which resulted in \nineffective treatment. The studies also have shown that some girls \nbetween the ages of 8 and 11 were potentially overdosed, with levels up \nto 2 to 3 times that which was really needed.\n  Since our law has been in effect, the private sector has increased \nits investment in pediatric training and developing a infrastructure to \nsupport and expand pediatric research. The FDA stated in a January 2001 \nreport:\n\n       The pediatric exclusivity provision has done more to \n     generate clinical studies and useful prescribing information \n     for the pediatric population than any other regulatory or \n     legislative process to date.\n\n  The bill this Senate and House passed 3 years ago has done a great \ndeal of good. We are seeing more drugs for children on the market that \nhave a label that tells how they can be used, and more basic \ninformation for pediatricians. So when they look at that little child \nand they know the age of that child and they know the weight of that \nchild, they can look it up and see exactly what the prescription should \nbe, what the dosage should be, what the indicators are. They can do \nthat because we have given the pharmaceutical companies an incentive to \ndo that research, research they were doing prior to passage of this \nbill in only 20 percent of the cases.\n  A great deal of progress has been made, but we have further to go. \nThat is what we were about today with the passage of the bill that I am \nnow describing. Senator Dodd and I and the other cosponsors knew that \nthe law we passed 3 years ago could be improved. We knew that it had \nsome holes in it. We set out to improve that, to fill the gaps, and \naddress the outstanding issues, such as the testing of off-patent \ndrugs, which the original law was never designed to include. It is \nunderstandable why the original law wasn't designed to include off-\npatent drugs. The original law extended the patent by 6 months. They \nextend it for 6 months if and only if they tested these drugs for \nchildren.\n  If a drug is not on-patent, if it is off-patent, the patent has \nbasically expired, obviously that incentive doesn't do any good. What \nwe tried to do with this bill that we passed today was to change that \nand therefore expand it and expand the purpose of this bill to include \noff-patent drugs as well.\n  For some products and some age groups, the existing market incentives \nare simply inadequate to encourage new pediatric research. In the bill \nwe passed several hours ago, we have built upon the existing law's \nbasic incentive structure to further ensure that these\n\n[[Page S10831]]\n\nessential products, and young age groups, are included within the scope \nof the program.\n\n  To make perfectly clear the need for additional legislation, I would \nlike to quote a significant passage from the FDA's January 2001 report, \nwhich stated the following:\n\n       A majority of marketed drugs are not labeled for use in \n     pediatric patients, or are labeled for use only in specific \n     pediatric age groups . . . And many of the drugs most widely \n     used in pediatric patients carry disclaimers in their \n     labeling stating that safety and effectiveness in pediatric \n     patients have not been established. The absence of pediatric \n     labeling information poses significant risks for children. \n     Inadequate dosing information exposes pediatric patients to \n     the risk of adverse reactions, usually age-specific adverse \n     reactions that could be avoided if such information were \n     provided in product labeling. The absence of pediatric \n     testing and labeling may also expose pediatric patients to \n     ineffective treatment through underdosing, or may deny \n     pediatric patients therapeutic advances because physicians \n     choose to prescribe existing, less effective medications in \n     the face of insufficient pediatric information about a new \n     medication.\n\n  These facts are very disturbing. Through our bill, we have sought to \nfind a way to improve the labeling process. Since our law has not been \nimplemented for very long, many labels are still in the process of \nbeing requested and negotiated by the FDA. In this new bill, the new \ntimeframes established in the bill for labeling negotiations, together \nwith the enforcement authority under the existing misbranding statute, \nwill help to ensure that essential pediatric information generated from \nstudies implemented under this law, will result in necessary and timely \nlabeling changes.\n  Our bill establishes timeframes for responding to written requests, \ntimeframes and processes for negotiating label changes, and authorizes \nthe federal government to deem a drug misbranded if the company refuses \nto relabel its drug. The government would then begin an enforcement \naction under its existing authority to seek a court order regarding the \nrelabeling of the drug.\n  Through the bill that we are about to pass today, we will ensure that \npriority drugs which lack patent or other market exclusivity will be \ntested for children. For example, the Ritalin label states the \nfollowing:\n\n       Precautions: Long-term effects of Ritalin in children have \n     not been well established. Warning: Ritalin should not be \n     used in children under six years since safety and \n     [effectiveness] in this age group has not been established.\n\n  The point is that Ritalin is being prescribed off-label for children \nunder six years of age, and yet we do not know the safety and \neffectiveness, since it has only been tested in children older than \nsix, and we do not know long-term effects on children of any age.\n  Our bill creates a mechanism to ``capture'' the off-patent drugs for \nwhich the Secretary determines additional studies are needed to assess \nthe safety and effectiveness of the drug's use in the pediatric \npopulation.\n  In other words, our bill provides for the testing of some cases of \nthese off-patent drugs.\n  By expanding the mission of the existing NIH Foundation to include \ncollecting and awarding grants for conducting certain pediatric \nstudies, we have provided a funding mechanism for ensuring studies that \nare completed for both off-patent drugs and those marketed on-patent \ndrugs that a company declines to study--and for which the Secretary \ndetermines there is a continuing need for information relating to the \nuse of the drug in the pediatric population.\n  That is the language in the bill.

Mr. President, I see my good friend, the deputy majority \nleader, the senior Senator from Nevada, in the Chamber. I first note my \nappreciation for the kind words he has said on several occasions about \nour efforts in the Judiciary Committee. The Senator and I have been \nfriends from the day he came to the Senate. I value that friendship \nvery much.\n  I also thank our leadership for having us in session today. Let me \ntake a couple moments to say why.\n  This is a trying time for everybody--for our staffs, for the brave \nmen and women of the Capitol Police, who protect us, for Dr. Eisold, \nand all those who work with him in the Capitol physician's office--for \neverybody, whether they are doorkeepers, or anybody else, including the \nyoung pages, both the Democratic and Republican pages who are here. The \nwork is being done. It has been a difficult time.\n  What would have been more difficult for the Nation would have been if \nwe had not been here today. I think it was essential we be here. We \nhave actually accomplished a great deal by being here.\n  We have held hearings on judges, and voted a number out of committee, \nas well as a number of U.S. attorneys. We have completed action on an \nagreement on the counterterrorism bill. It is something that just a few \ndays ago everybody said could not be done. We have done it. We are now \nat the point simply of drafting, which is not the easiest thing in the \nworld with all the offices closed down. But the staffs of the various \ncommittees, including the Judiciary Committee, of course, have been \nworking literally around the clock to get the paperwork done, to get \nthe actual words on paper.\n\n  So I feel safe in predicting the House and the Senate will vote on a \npackage on the counterterrorism bill that, interestingly enough, will \nbe improved over what we passed in the Senate and improved over what \nthey passed in the other body.\n  The sum is greater than the parts. And that shows what happens when \nwe work together--both bodies; both parties--to get something done.\n  We have actually done the administration a favor by taking time to \nlook at it. The piece of legislation originally proposed by the White \nHouse and Attorney General was deeply flawed. Had we accepted their \nproposal to immediately move forward and pass it, we would have given \nthem a flawed bill which, in the long run, would have hurt their \nchances to fight terrorism.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from Minnesota, was \none of those who cautioned and counseled both me and others to go \nslowly, look at what is here, and make sure we do it right.\n  The distinguished Senator from Minnesota, as he always does, offered \nwise counsel. The distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, stood in \nthis Chamber a number of times and said: We want to get it done right. \nI believe we have.\n  But lastly, it is important, as a symbol, that we be in session. I \nfeel deeply privileged to be a Member of the Senate. I remember the \nfirst day I walked in this Senate Chamber as a Senator-elect. I was a \n34-year-old prosecutor from Vermont. I had never been on the floor of \nthe Senate. It was a lameduck session after the elections at the time. \nWe were going to go into the new session, which is when I would be \nsworn in.\n  I came in as a Senator-elect. I thought to myself: What a thrill, \ncoming in this Chamber and seeing people, giants of the Senate--in \nfact, two predecessors from the Presiding Officer's home State: Hubert \nHumphrey and Fritz Mondale. And I have thought it a privilege every day \nI have walked in this Chamber, every day I have come to this building.\n  I have no idea how long I will be a Senator--none of us do--but I \nknow every single day that I am, I will consider it a day that is a \ngreat privilege.\n  And this building, this symbol of democracy, which will be here long \nafter all 100 of us are gone--and I hope for hundreds and hundreds more \nit will be here--should be open. It should be open. It should tell not \njust a quarter of a billion Americans that this is the seat of \ndemocracy but tell billions of people around the world, especially \nthose who come from countries that are anything but democracies, this \nsymbol stands, this symbol shines, this symbol is open for business.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10832-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10832-S10834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to go over a few facts regarding \njudicial nominations because that has been the subject of some \ndiscussion in this Chamber.\n  I, first, say that today there was a hearing held down in S-128, the \nappropriations room. It was held in spite of all that is going on \naround here. I want to tell Senator Leahy how much I appreciate that, \nand also Senator Schumer, who chaired the subcommittee.\n  I say that because Senator Ensign nominated Larry Hicks. He did it. \nAnd I appreciate very much John Ensign allowing me to approve of his \nnomination.\n  John has been very good about that. Every fourth nomination I get. He \ntold me if there is somebody I really don't like, he said, yes, he \nwouldn't put them forward. But the first person he put forward is a man \nby the name of Larry Hicks, eminently qualified, a good lawyer and a \ngood person. It would have been a terrible shame for him and his family \nto have traveled back here yesterday to be told the hearing has been \ncanceled, the Senate is not in session. So they were able to go into \nthat crowded room and proudly be there when their husband, their \nfather, their brother was given this most important hearing that will \nmake him a Federal judge. He is extremely well qualified.\n  I wish to tell the Senator from Vermont how much I personally \nappreciate that. He is chairman of the committee. He is the one who \narranged that. He is a member of the Appropriations Committee, one of \nthe senior members. That is why we were able to use S-128.\n  Not only did he hold the hearing in S-128, but there was an emergency \nmeeting held today to mark up people who had had hearings previously. \nThirteen U.S. attorneys were reported out of the Judiciary Committee \ntoday, including a person who is going to be an assistant Attorney \nGeneral, Jay Bybee from Nevada, a person also very well qualified, a \nprofessor at the University of Nevada Law School.\n  In addition to the U.S. attorneys and the Assistant Attorney General, \nwe have four district court judges who were reported out of committee. \nRight back here it was done. It was difficult to get a quorum. People \nwere pulled off the floor to do that. The Senator from Vermont, \nchairman of the committee, did that. There was a judge from Oklahoma, a \njudge from Kentucky, a judge from Nebraska, and a judge from Oklahoma--\nfour district court judges.\n  In S-128 today, there was not a single member of the minority at that \ncommittee hearing--not a single one. The makeup of the committee was \nSenator Schumer, Senator Leahy, and Senator Kennedy. I may be missing \nsomeone but they were all Democrats. So I say to my friends, if these \njudicial nominations are that important, couldn't they attend a \nhearing? Remember, these were all Republican nominations--not a single \nDemocratic nomination, all Republicans.\n  Let me also say this to boast--it is a pure, unadulterated boast; I \nam bragging about Chairman Pat Leahy--confirmations under Chairman \nLeahy have been faster than in the other first years. Fair comparisons \nshow that by October 15 of the first year of President Clinton's \nadministration, the Senate had only confirmed four judges, four fewer \nthan by the same time this year. By October 15 of the first year of the \nfirst Bush administration, the number was the same; only four judges \nhad been confirmed. This year, 2001, in the fewer than 4 months since \nthe reorganization of the Senate, when we had Chairman Leahy of the \nJudiciary Committee, and we had to spend some time organizing, too--you \ndon't just hit the ground running--twice as many judges\n\n[[Page S10833]]\n\nhave been confirmed as during the first 9 months of the first Bush \nadministration and the Clinton administration. Remember, 4 months.\n  Chairman Leahy and the Senate are ahead of the confirmation pace for \njudicial nominations for the first year of the Bush administration and \nthe first year of the Clinton administration.\n  Since July of this year, the Senate has already confirmed four court \nof appeals judges and a fifth has already had a hearing and is being \nscheduled for committee consideration as soon as the followup questions \nare answered. That judge would have been reported out today had the \nquestions been answered of one of the Senators, I believe from \nWisconsin. Senator Feingold had some questions that had not been \nanswered. Because of that and Senate tradition, you can't report out \nnominations if questions of members of the committee have not been \nanswered.\n\n  In 1989, five court of appeals judges were confirmed for the entire \nyear. We are on a pace to confirm between six and eight this year.\n  Chairman Leahy has already held six hearings involving judicial \nnominees since July 10, including two in July and two unprecedented \nhearings during the August recess. Most of us were out doing other \nthings. I am not afraid to acknowledge, I took a vacation for several \nweeks in August. When Pat Leahy was here holding hearings, I was \nvacationing. Unprecedented hearings, two hearings during August, a \nhearing in September in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist \nattack, a hearing on October 4, and, of course, the hearing today about \nwhich I have talked.\n  By contrast, in the 6\\1/2\\ years the Republicans chaired the \nJudiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001, in 34 months, they held no \nconfirmation hearings for judicial nominations, 34 months. In 30 \nmonths, they held a single confirmation hearing. And in only 12 months \ndid they hold at least two hearings involving judicial nominees.\n  You can bring charts on the floor, as was done earlier saying, \nSenator Leahy, when he holds a hearing, doesn't do as many as we did. \nAs I have said, I am happy to play this statistics game. I am happy to \ndo that. Anyone who wants to do that, I can do it. As everyone knows, \nyou can do whatever you want with statistics. But I am giving the \nSenate the statistics. Let someone come and disagree if they want. I am \ntelling you this will be on the record of the Senate forever.\n  If the Senate adjourns, let's say, by the Thanksgiving recess, which \nprobably will be the case, as it did in 1989 and 1993, Chairman Leahy \nintends to hold additional hearings for judicial nominees. That would \nbring the total of the year to maybe as many as 10 hearings. The Senate \ncould be in a position to confirm between 25 and 30 judges in this very \nshort session during which the chairman of the Judiciary Committee took \nover this summer.\n  During the entire first year of the Clinton administration, the \nJudiciary Committee held only six hearings. During the entire first \nyear of the first Bush administration, the committee held seven \nhearings.\n  Chairman Leahy will hold as many as 10, even though he has not had \nthe whole year. I remind everybody, during the first 6 months of this \nyear, not a single confirmation hearing was held and not a single \nconfirmation took place. Those are the facts.\n  The comparisons of the minority are simply unfair. Chairman Leahy and \nthe Democratic Senate have been criticized for only having confirmed \neight judicial nominations so far this year. That number has been \ncompared to totals from the end of previous years: In 1989, 15 judges \nwere confirmed; in 1993, 27. This year's number was achieved between \nJuly 10 and October 15, and it is still growing. The totals against \nwhich it is being compared counts confirmations through late November \nin both years.\n  Now, as a result of the ``unprecedented''--I use the word again--\nhearing in the President's room, we are going to, on Tuesday or \nWednesday, vote out four more judges or several more judges. I think it \nis four. We are going to do these U.S. attorneys. We are going to do \nMr. Bybee.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I didn't know Senator Leahy was here. I am \nglad to see the chairman.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't always enjoy the statements I hear on the floor, \nbut I must admit, I was relishing this one.\n  Mr. REID. If I had known you were here, I would have been more \neffusive.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think it was bad enough. But if my wife is watching \nthis, she is going to wonder who this person is and who is coming home \ntonight with all these nice things you have said about me. I thank the \nSenator from Nevada who has helped make it possible.\n  He and Senator Daschle helped us get the rooms under difficult \ncircumstances so we could have this hearing. I had the markup this \nmorning, where we sent out, between judges and U.S. attorneys, about 18 \npeople, virtually all of whom were there on the recommendation of \nRepublican Senators. Because of his help, we were able to get a hearing \nroom for this afternoon.\n  The point the Senator made was a good point. He mentioned the \njudicial nominee for Nevada. He traveled 3,000 miles to be here for a \nhearing, assuming, of course, we were going to have the hearing today. \nThose plans came before the anthrax scare and, all of a sudden, \neverything shut down. The Senator from Nevada, in his usual way, where \nhe worries about everybody, it seems, came to me and said: People came \nthis distance; can we do something to help them out? Of course, we can. \nWe have been trying to do that to accommodate everybody.\n  There is one thing I find with great amusement, and that is when \npeople say ``look at the vacancies.'' Well, that is right, Mr. \nPresident, there are vacancies. President Clinton nominated people for \nvirtually all of those vacancies, and they were not even allowed to \nhave a hearing, to say nothing about a vote.\n  It reminds me of when the same people blocked President Clinton's \nnominees from having a hearing or a vote, and now they say we have all \nthese vacancies. That is like the kid who killed his parents. When he \nwas brought into court, he said, ``Your Honor, have mercy on me, I am \nan orphan.''\n  What can we say about these vacancies? Lordy, lordy, I wish they said \nthat last year when we had the nominees ready to go.\n  Having said that, I don't intend to play that kind of game. We are \nmoving as fast as we can. I point out to Senators that we have had a \nfew problems. The Senator from Nevada pointed out that when the \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, they didn't hold a single hearing or \nconfirm a single judge. They have all been done since we took over, and \nthey are all President Bush's nominees. We have had a few things going. \nI wasn't given a committee until July, about 2 or 3 weeks before the \nAugust recess. That is why I had staff stay here--to hold hearings \nduring August. We have had a couple of things going on before that \ncommittee.\n  I am sure nobody has forgotten what happened 5 weeks ago in this \ncountry, on September 11, with the Pentagon and the World Trade Towers. \nWe have been drafting a massive antiterrorism bill. We were given a \ndeeply flawed piece of legislation by the Attorney General and the \nWhite House. I have worked with them and have tried to improve it, and \nwe have done that. So now we have something both Republicans and \nDemocrats can support, and we are going to pass it next week. That has \ntaken a great deal of time.\n  As the Senator from Nevada has pointed out several times on the \nfloor, speaking of the various Members and staff who have worked on it, \nI can go home at night, but most of them stay and spend the rest of the \nnight working on it. So a lot has been done.\n  My earlier reason for coming to the Chamber was to thank the Senator \nfrom Nevada, and the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, for \nkeeping us in today. We accomplished an enormous amount. We \naccomplished more than any piece of legislation written today, more \nthan any nominee, more than anything we voted on: we demonstrated to \nthe United States of America that the Senate is open for business. \nSenators are here doing their duty.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his long-term friendship \nand for his kind words.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this says it all: The average time between \nnomination and confirmation for court of appeals judges this year has \nbeen approximately 100 days, which includes the\n\n[[Page S10834]]\n\ndelay and reorganization of the Senate and the wait for the ABA peer \nreviews, which cannot begin now until after the nomination. The average \nlength of time between nomination and confirmation of those circuit \ncourt nominees approved during President Clinton's most recent term was \n343 days. That is a year--average.\n\n  Accordingly, even with all the delays caused by Republicans, this \nSenate is acting on court of appeals nominees, on average, 8 months \nfaster than the Republican Senate acted on Clinton nominations during \nthe last 4 years--when they acted at all.\n  More than half--56 percent--of President Clinton's court of appeals \nnominations in 1999-2000 were not confirmed. More than one-fifth of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees--68--never got a committee \nhearing, and certainly not a committee vote from the Republican \nmajority. No one on the Republican side has conceded that the \nRepublican Senate did anything wrong over the last 6 years in its \nhandling of the judicial nominations. I guess they accept 343 days as \nbeing fairly good.\n  Chairman Leahy and the majority now are ahead of the pace of the \nRepublican Senate--it is not even a close race--and we should not be \ncriticized for doing far better than our predecessors. Of the 31 \ndistrict court nominees pending, 14 do not have completed paperwork \nwith ABA ratings, 5 had hearings, 4 are scheduled for hearings this \nweek--and I talked about those --and 10 or more will be included the \nrest of this month and next month.\n  Mr. President, having made this case, hopefully showing that the \neffort to have Senator Daschle change what we are doing on the floor as \na result of Chairman Leahy not doing what he is supposed to do is not \ngoing to work. Having laid this out, this is not payback time. We are \nnot going to use their model. They should use it when they are trying \nto make apples out of oranges, but we are not going to go for that. We \nare going to treat the Republicans like they did not treat us. We are \ngoing to do everything we can to get every judicial nomination \ncompleted as quickly as we can. That is our responsibility, and we are \ngoing to live up to it. It would be easy to do what was done to us--\nthat is, hold them, hold them, until the very last, and then let some \ngo--not very many but a few. We have not done that.\n  We have approved scores of ambassadors. Chairman Biden has been \nexemplary. All the other committees have voted out people as quickly as \nthey could. I had a hold on someone in the Environmental Protection \nAgency. I got a call from Governor Whitman. I had questions. She \nanswered them on the phone and we did it within a day or two. It would \nhave been easy to say, well, that is what they did to us. But we are \nnot doing that, Mr. President. We are getting these judges out as \nquickly as we can.\n  All the screaming and yelling and saying we are not going to let the \nappropriations bills move--they can do that. We are doing the best we \ncan.\n  Someone on the other side said we are going to have some meetings. We \nare going to have meetings, but not on that, Mr. President. I have \nspoken to the majority leader, and he recognizes these appropriations \nbills are very important. But they are the President's bills, not our \nbills. If he wants these lumped into some big thing--and he is over in \nChina now. We have the foreign operations bill being held up, and he is \nmeeting with 21 other world leaders there, many of whom get benefits \nfrom the bill we are trying to pass. But we can't because there is a \nfilibuster.\n  I practiced law. I argued cases in the Ninth Circuit. I tried lots \nand lots of cases. I know how important it is to have judges--good \njudges--as many as you can get. Justice delayed is justice denied, and \nwe know that. We are going to do the best we can to make sure there is \nno justice delayed. But let's use common sense.\n  Why hold up these appropriations bills? It is not going to speed \nthings up. Now we are going into the third week with a filibuster. It \nis wrong, and I am very sorry it is happening. But no one is going to \ndenigrate Pat Leahy while I still have an ounce of breath left in my \nbody.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10834-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10834-S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BASE CLOSURES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, I received a letter on a very \nimportant subject that I wish to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues.\n  The House of Representatives and the Senate are currently meeting in \njoint conference committee on the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2002. This bill has many provisions that are very \nimportant to our military and to our Nation, but one of the most \nimportant of these is a provision authorizing the President to conduct \na new round of base closures in 2003.\n  The Senate voted to support the request of the administration and of \nour military leaders to allow the Department of Defense, DOD, to \nrationalize, and where necessary reduce, their infrastructure. Allowing \nDOD to conduct a new round of base realignment and closures is \nnecessary to stop wasting taxpayer money, to redirect funds to higher \nnational security priorities, and to allow the transformation of our \nmilitary. Transformation has never meant just buying new weapons.\n  The letter I received is signed by eight former Secretaries of \nDefense. They write to tell the Congress that we must act to allow DOD \nto ensure our base structure supports for our forces and our war \nfighting plans. They warn us that forces tied up defending unneeded \nbases ``are forces unavailable for the campaign on terrorism'' and that \nresources devoted to unneeded facilities cannot be spent on the tools \nwe will need to win this war.\n  This letter is signed by Robert McNamara, Mel Laird, Jim Schlesinger, \nHarold Brown, Caspar Weinberger, Frank Carlucci, Bill Perry, and our \nformer colleague Bill Cohen. I might add that two other former \nSecretaries of Defense, Vice President Cheney and our current Secretary \nDonald Rumsfeld, have asked the Congress for this authority on behalf \nof this administration.\n  Every living current or former Secretary of Defense is telling us it \nis essential that we act to reduce our excess infrastructure. The \nCongress should listen to the voice of experience on this matter. These \nare the men who have had the awesome responsibility of protecting our \nNation's security and running one of the world's largest, most complex \norganizations. These are the men who have been in the chain of command, \nwho have had to make life and death decisions. When they tell us we \nneed to act, we should listen, and we should act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 15, 2001.\n     Hon.

While we understand the sensitivity of this \n     effort, our support for another round is unequivocal in light \n     of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The Defense \n     Department must be allowed to review its existing \n     infrastructure to ensure it is positioned to support our \n     current and evolving force structure and our war fighting \n     plans.\n       We are concerned that the reluctance to close unneeded \n     facilities is a drag on our military forces, particularly in \n     an era when homeland security is being discussed as never \n     before.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 19, \n2000 in Columbus, OH. Scott Roberts, a gay man, told the Columbus \nDispatch that he believes he and his partner of six years, Bill \nCamelin, were attacked because they are gay. After being lured to a \nremote location, Camelin was shot to death and Roberts was wounded in \nthe knee.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10835-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10835-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10835-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The following enrolled bill, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, was signed by the President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) on October \n18, 2001:\n\n       S. 1465.

A bill relating to United States adherence to the ABM \nTreaty; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nregarding the testing, development, and possible deployment of a \nNational Missile Defense system. This legislation is cosponsored by \nSenators Wyden, Feingold, Corzine, Harkin, and Leahy.\n  I share the concern of many of my colleagues that, in the aftermath \nof the horrific events of September 11, this is not the appropriate \ntime or place for a divisive debate on the Senate floor on missile \ndefense.\n  That is why I did not offer this legislation as an amendment on the \nDefense authorization bill, do not intend to offer it as an amendment \non other legislation before the Senate at this time, and do not intend \nto push this legislation for a vote at this point in time. This is not \nthe time for Senate consideration of this legislation or for a divisive \ndebate on this issue.\n  But I also believe that it is critical that at the appropriate time, \nand in the appropriate way, a full public and congressional debate on \nmissile defense must occur. It is simply too an important a decision, \nand too important an issue, to be treated in any other way.\n  Indeed, National Missile Defense is one of the most serious foreign \npolicy and national security issue that we will face in the coming \ndecades. The administration's decisions on this issue should be made \ndeliberately, in consultation with our allies, and, most importantly, \nin consultation with the United States Congress.\n  As one Senator, I myself have spent considerable time over the past \nseveral years in meetings, briefings, and discussions on this issue. \nEarlier this year I had the opportunity to discuss missile defense \nissues at length with former Secretary Perry.\n  He suggested to me that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons of mass destruction, and the increasing availability \nto other nations as well as transnational groups such as terrorist \norganizations, of the technology and material necessary to develop and \ndeliver WMD is perhaps the most serious threat to U.S. national \nsecurity today.\n  Secretary Perry went on to argue, however, that National Missile \nDefense is not and should not be seen as a one-size-fits-all substitute \nfor an effective non-proliferation strategy, and that the United States \nmust have a balanced program to effectively safeguard our interests. \nThis includes effective strategies for the prevention of proliferation, \ndeterrence, homeland defense, and counter-proliferation, and clearly \ncalibrating and allocating resources to meet the real challenges that \nface U.S. national security interests.\n  I believe that the approach suggested by Secretary Perry makes a good \ndeal of sense.\n  Based on this approach, I believe that it is therefore important for \nCongress to ask a number of questions with regard to NMD. Questions \nsuch as:\n  Would missile defense have helped to prevent the events of September \n11?\n  Are there more immediate security needs, such as homeland defense, \nwhich demand priority on our scarce national defense and national \nsecurity resources?\n  Is NMD an appropriate to serve as the central axle around which U.S. \nnational security rotates, given the nature of the threats we now face?\n  Would unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty hurt U.S. \nefforts to get international cooperation in the battle against \nterrorism?\n  Will acquiring NMD make the United States, and the world, safer and \nmore secure? Or will unilateral U.S. development and deployment of NMD, \nand unilateral violation, abrogation, or withdrawal from the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty, make us less safe and secure?\n  I am also concerned that with what appears to be a rush toward \nconstruction at Fort Greely, AK, the administration has already made a \ndecision on deployment, without having yet answered these bottom line \nquestions.\n  The legislation that I and my colleagues introduce today seeks to \naddress these questions, and to suggest that the balanced approach \nsuggested by Secretary Perry to safeguarding the United States from the \nthreat of WMD attack might be a wiser policy for Congress to consider, \nrather than merely rubber-stamping the administration's missile defense \npolicy.\n  This legislation would: express the Sense of the Senate that U.S. \nresearch and development of missile defense remain consistent with the \nABM treaty, that the U.S. should pursue good faith negotiations with \nRussia to make such modifications to the ABM as may be necessary, but \nthat the U.S. should not unilaterally opt-out of the treaty and not \ndeploy a missile defense system that has not met the basic research, \ntesting, and evaluation standards to prove its operational \neffectiveness.\n  Place a limitation on funding available for missile defense testing, \nevaluation, or deployment that would unilaterally abrogate or violate \nthe ABM treaty.\n  Call on the Secretary of State to report to Congress, if a decision \non deployment is made, regarding the nature of the threat that \ntriggered the deployment decision and the likely impact that the \ndeployment decision will have on U.S. national security interests.\n  Call on the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress, if a decision \non deployment is made, on the operational effectiveness of the missile \ndefense system.\n  Call on the President to make an annual report to Congress on the \nnature of the WMD threat faced by the U.S. and its allies, evaluate the \nthreat posed by different means of delivery, ranging from ballistic \nmissiles to suitcase bombs, provide an estimation for the total cost of \ndevelopment and deployment of missile defense, and make a determination \nwhether missile defense spending adversely impacts other priority \nnational security programs of the Department of Defense.\n\n[[Page S10837]]\n\n  I have previously stated that my concerns about NMD revolve largely \naround four issues: The nature of the threat; the implications for arms \ncontrol and the international security environment; the feasibility of \nthe technology; and the cost. I would like to address each of these in \nturn.\n  The bottom line of these concerns is simply this: Will a \nunilateralist missile defense deployment decision become the basis for \na new arms race, leading to a world with more ballistic missiles and \nWMD pointed at the United States, not less? Would the United States be \nmore secure, or less?\n  We also must ask where does the long range missile threat to the U.S. \nstand?\n  Russia for all its problems, remains the only nation possessing \nenough Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, ICBMs, and submarine \nlaunched ballistic missiles, SLBMs, to overwhelm the proposed U.S. \ndefensive umbrella. China has only a small number of ICBMs. No other \nnation has operational ICBMs and only two, France and the United \nKingdom, have SLBMs.\n  Other countries, such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, do not today have \nballistic missile capabilities that are a threat to the United States. \nWe should not act in ways to encourage them to develop these \ncapabilities or, just as troubling, to develop alternate means to \nattack the United States which NMD is powerless to counter.\n  Looking ahead, however, George Tenet, Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, testified before Congress last year that ``over \nthe next 15 years, our cities will face ballistic missile threats from \na variety of actors.'' He pointed to North Korea which, he said, could \nfurther develop its Taepo Dong 2 missile, noting that it ``might be \ncapable of delivering a nuclear payload to the United States.''\n  Other nations which have or are pursuing ballistic missile programs \ninclude Iran and Iraq. Neither of these countries have succeeded in \ndeveloping ballistic missile capabilities, however, and unless they \nmake a concerted effort to do so, neither appears likely to develop \ncapabilities within the next 10 years.\n  As we consider U.S. missile defense policy, I believe it is a fair \nquestion to ask what sort of developments in the international security \nenvironment might lead them, or others, to make that sort of concerted \neffort?\n  As the past two weeks have too well illustrated, the world is not a \nstatic place. International security relationships are fluid and \ndynamic. The United States today is the world's sole superpower, and \nalthough that gives us great strategic flexibility and maneuverability, \nit would be naive for us to believe that other nations and \ntransnational groups do not and will not react to the strategic choices \nthe United States makes, and how they perceive those choices affecting \ntheir own interests.\n  In other words, how might the rest of the world react to a unilateral \nU.S. decision to deploy NMD? What would other countries do to protect \nwhat they perceive as their national security interests in the face of \na U.S. NMD?\n  The National Intelligence Estimate prepared last year, ``Foreign \nResponses to U.S. National Missile Deployment,'' suggests that in \nreaction to U.S. NMD deployment:\n  Russia could opt to deploy shorter-range missiles along its borders \nand resume adding multiple warheads to its ballistic missiles.\n  China would most likely seek to deploy additional missiles with \nMIRVed warheads if the U.S. went ahead with NMD. This would mean that \nChina may attempt a strategy of ``breaking out,'' giving them the \ncapability to ``overwhelm'' a U.S. NMD system.\n  North Korea could resume its missile flight test program and \ncooperate with other countries, such as Iran or Iraq, in helping them \ndevelop missile capabilities.\n  Iran and Iraq might well redouble their efforts to develop their own \nmissile programs, including decoys and countermeasures that would allow \nthem to bypass a U.S. missile shield.\n  The NIE report also concluded that if China sought to deploy \nadditional missiles and warheads in response to NMD, this might prompt \nIndia to respond by building up its own nuclear arsenals and missile \narsenal, which would in turn prompt Pakistan to seek to develop \nadditional nuclear weapons and advanced missiles, unleashing a South \nAsian nuclear arms race.\n  I do not believe I need to comment further, given recent events, just \nhow dangerous that would be.\n  Such a destabilized environment, with Russia, China, North Korea, \nIndia, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and possibly others adding to their \nnuclear arsenals or missile capabilities does not strike me as a more \nstable world, or one in which the U.S. is more secure from the threat \nof WMD or missile attack.\n  In addition, many analysts believe that if the United States were to \ngo ahead with NMD, rogue states and terrorists groups would simply \nshift their focus from developing missile technology to delivering \nweapons of mass destruction by ship, plane, or cruise missile, methods \nthat are both more reliable, provide no ``return address,'' and can't \nbe countered by NMD.\n  I do not even want to contemplate what September 11 would have been \nlike had one or more of those hijacked planes contained even a small, \nprimitive, ``dirty'' nuclear device.\n  The second issue I would like to address today is the implication of \na rush to deploy NMD for the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n  Today the ABM Treaty is the keystone of a number of interlinked \nnuclear arms control agreements, including the START I and START II \ntreaties with Russia. Although the ABM Treaty may require some \nmodifications to take into account the realities of the new security \nenvironment, and this legislation urges the Administration to pursue \nsuch negotiations, to just cast it aside risks undermining the very \nfoundations of strategic stability and U.S. national security.\n  The United States has long been at the forefront of the international \ncommunity in trying to inculcate respect for international law and \ntreaty obligations.\n  In fact, one of the ways in which the United States identifies so-\ncalled rogue states is that these are states that do not respect their \nobligations to other members of the international community; states who \nwalk away from, ignore, or cheat on their treaty obligations.\n  And so it is deeply troubling to me that the United States may now be \ntelling the rest of the world, through its own actions, that it is \naccepted behavior to break your treaty obligations.\n  Indeed, with this approach I am particularly concerned that the \nUnited States may, in fact, be sending precisely the wrong message on \ninternational arms control to China: That only the weak must respect \nother nations and international law. If you are strong enough, you can \ndo as you please.\n  If the United States seeks to unilaterally abrogate the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty, and in general treat international treaty \ncommitments as mere pieces of paper to be disregarded if they prove \ninconvenient, how can we expect to hold China accountable to live up to \nits international agreements, or to the commitment it has made to the \nMissile Technology Control Regime?\n  As reported in the press accounts earlier this summer, the Department \nof Defense ABM Compliance Review Group, the Pentagon lawyers tasked to \nidentify potential ABM Treaty issues raised by the testing schedule, \nhave determined that some elements of the administration's plan for \ndeveloping missile defenses may conflict with the ABM Treaty by 2002.\n  Indeed, a July 30, 2001 letter from Undersecretary Paul Wolfowitz to \nme stated that the ``Department has neither designed the missile \ndefense program to intentionally impact the ABM treaty sooner rather \nthan later, nor have we designed it to avoid the treaty.'' That is good \nas far as it goes. But is also avoids the real question:\n  Has the Department of Defense made an effort to develop a missile \ndefense testing program which is, by intent, consistent with the ABM? \nSo long as the treaty is in force and is the supreme law of the land \nthat seems to me to be a reasonable requirement.\n  Moreover, as Philip Coyle, the former director of Operational Test \nand Evaluation at the Pentagon, wrote in a recent issue of The Defense \nMonitor, the ABM treaty ``is not holding back the design and \ndevelopment of the technology needed for National Missile Defense, NMD, \nnor is the treaty slowing the tests of an NMD system. Development of \nNMD will take a decade or\n\n[[Page S10838]]\n\nmore for technical and budgetary reasons, but not due to the \nimpediments caused by the ABM treaty.''\n  In other words, the United States can continue with an aggressive NMD \ndevelopment and testing program for the foreseeable future, should the \nAdministration and Congress choose to, without the need to abandon the \nABM.\n  I do not believe that arms control treaties and agreements are a \npanacea that, by themselves, secure U.S. national security interests or \nthose of our friends and allies.\n  But surely the constraints that these treaties and agreements impose \ncan play a valuable role in constricting the development of weapons of \nmass destruction and their proliferation around the globe.\n  They are a useful tool in a fully articulated foreign policy and \nnational security toolbox, and it is short-sighted, to say the least, \nto throw the tool out. Especially if one does not replace it with \nsomething of equal or greater value.\n  Although the technical challenges of developing missile defense \ntechnology are great, I believe that the United States, if we choose to \npursue it, is equal to the task.\n  But that we can develop a missile defense system should not be \nconfused by anyone to mean that we have the capabilities now, or will \npossess them, even with an aggressive testing and development program, \nanytime soon.\n  Effective missile defense is an enormous technical challenge. \nCommonly compared to ``hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' missile \ndefense requires interceptors to find and hit the warheads of long-\nrange missiles traveling at speeds of 15,000 mph or more. Although two \nof the four tests thus far have failed, and serious questions have been \nraised about the degree of success of the other two, these tests have \nindicated that it may indeed be possible to ``hit a bullet with a \nbullet.''\n  But it is still far from clear if it can be done reliably in a real-\nworld setting, where decoys and countermeasures will complicate the \nsystem's ability to determine what targets need to be hit. A global \nsystem of satellites, radars, communications relays, booster rockets \nand interceptors all must work with each other almost perfectly for the \ndefense to have a chance of success.\n  There are also concerns, first raised by the November 1999 Welch \nReport, that political pressure to deploy a system regardless of \nwhether the science works or not may lead to a ``rush to failure.'' \nHowever, it must be a scientific determination, not a political \ndetermination, that decides how far and how fast we go forward with \nmissile defense.\n  If the United States goes forward with development and deployment of \na missile defense system, it must be one that is fully tested and \ndeemed operationally effective in a real world setting. Anything less \nwould be an invitation to disaster.\n  My final concern about missile defense relates to the potential costs \nof development and deployment.\n  As Congress considers this issue it is critical that it is able to \nclearly prioritize missile defense programs and spending, within the \ncontext of our larger national security needs. Funds that are spent on \nnational missile defense are, in effect, funds that can not be spent on \nother priority programs, such as homeland defense. I do not propose \nthat the United States spends all on one or the other. Rather, Congress \nmust play a responsible role in making sure that sufficient funds are \navailable to meet the threats to national security that exist today, \nwhile planning prudently for threats that will emerge tomorrow.\n  To allocate a disproportionate share of defense spending on a threat \nthat does not exist at all, or which will not be real until much \nfurther off in the future creates a very real risk to those programs \nthat need to be funded today. This means that immediate and concrete \nthreats we face today may not be addressed with potentially disastrous \nresults.\n  There has never been a consensus cost figure for deploying an NMD \nsystem. For several years, the Clinton administration estimated that a \nlimited NMD system would cost $9 to $11 billion to develop, test, and \ndeploy. In January 1999, the administration estimated that an initial \nsystem of 20 interceptors would cost about $10.6 billion. In February \n2000, the administration provided a ``life-cycle'' cost estimate of \n$26.6 billion for an initial system of 100 ground-based interceptors in \nAlaska.\n  An April 2000 study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), \nhowever, estimated that it would cost about $29.5 billion to develop, \nbuild, and operate an initial NMD system through 2015. CBO estimates it \nwill cost another $19 billion through 2015 to expand the initial system \nof 100 interceptors and build what was called a Capability 2 and \nCapability 3 system designed for greater numbers of more sophisticated \npotential missile threats. According to CBO, additional space-based \nsensors would bring the total costs for NMD to around $60 billion \nthrough 2015.\n  Several reports issued by outside groups, however, suggest that the \nreal costs of missile defense deployment could be much higher, perhaps \nas $300 billion if such elements as space-based and naval-based NMD \ninterceptors are included.\n  Trying to put a price tag on missile defense costs is all the more \ndifficult at present because the current administration has not yet \ndetermined what sort of missile defense architecture they want to \ndevelop. Put simply, they have asked for the credit card to go to the \nstore, but have not told us if they will be buying jeans or a tuxedo, \nor anything in between.\n  The question of cost should not be a determining factor in and of \nitself. If the international security environment demands development \nand deployment of missile defenses, the U.S. must go forward regardless \nof the cost.\n  But as Congress considers the elements of U.S. national security \nstrategy in the years ahead, it must do so mindful that devoting \nresources to one area likely means depriving them from another. We must \nbe careful, therefore, to make sure that our national security needs \nare properly prioritized. To move forward with missile defense, if it \nis not at the top of the list or immediately needed, and in so doing \nplace in jeopardy other higher and more immediate needs and priorities, \nsuch as homeland defense, risks creating an unbalanced and ineffective \nnational security strategy.\n  The administration's current plans, of what we know about them, seem \nto suggest that the United States will abandon the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile treaty before we even know if the deployment of NMD is even \nfeasible. And that it would abandon the ABM in pursuit of what can only \nbe considered ``unbalanced'' national security strategy, one that \nplaces too much weight on the development of missile defense, and too \nlittle on the other areas, such as prevention, intelligence, rollback, \nand management, that are equally, or more, important.\n\n  The United States must respond to new threats, and defenses can play \nan important role. But the question is not whether we deploy defenses, \nas missile defense advocates like to paint it, but what, when, and, \nmost importantly, how.\n  As I stated earlier, the threat of the proliferation of WMD is real \nand growing, and how the United States manages this threat should be an \noverriding security priority. Management requires a comprehensive \napproach that strikes the right balance between prevention, deterrence, \nand defense, and the emphasis placed on missile defense must be \nbalanced against other national security priorities. An effective WMD \nnational security strategy must emphasize:\n  Prevention, through preventive defense and preventive diplomacy, \nincluding export controls, regional security commitments, on-going \nthreat reduction programs, and arms control regimes;\n  Intelligence, including those efforts that show promise for \npenetrating transnational and terrorist groups that may be planning \nattacks against the United States or our allies and that illuminate the \nnature of the proliferation threat;\n  Rollback of WMD and missile programs that have been developed by \nother countries, such as the intense diplomacy such as has met with \nsome success on the Korean Peninsula, and a mixture of economic and \npolitical incentives; and,\n  Management of the consequences of proliferation by better protecting \nour forces, holding open the possibility of pre-emption, and active \ndefenses.\n\n[[Page S10839]]\n\n  And our defensive programs must also recognize that as the horrific \nevents of September 11 too well illustrated, missile defense is a \nresponse to but one of the WMD threats that the United States faces in \ntoday's world--and perhaps the least of these threats at that.\n  Indeed, a breakdown of the ``threat spectrum'' produced by the Joint \nChiefs of Staff earlier this year lists a missile attack as having the \nlowest ``probability of occurrence'' in the threat spectrum.\n  In fact, as a member of the Senate Committee on Intelligence, I have \nhad an opportunity to discuss WMD threat assessments with members of \nour intelligence community. Although the threat of a ballistic missile \nattack from a rogue nation is certainly a concern, they are far more \nconcerned about the threat that a ``suitcase'' bomb or a bomb hidden on \na ship may pose. Needless to say, NMD does nothing to address these \nthreats.\n  A balanced approach to national security therefore suggests that it \nis only prudent for the United States to conduct a limited testing \nprogram to develop missile defense technology so that if, at some point \nin the future, it is necessary we will have appropriate options. And \nyes, the ABM Treaty may need to be modified or amended to enable us to \nrespond to new threats.\n  But it would be folly to place too much of an emphasis on missile \ndefense, to simply and unilaterally develop and deploy NMD, and to \nabandon the treaty, before we even know what defensive systems are \nfeasible, which systems best meet our needs, and well before any \nsensible development or testing program needs to bump up to treaty \nlimits.\n  The unilateral U.S. pursuit of NMD is likely to create a less stable \nworld, with more nations pursuing weapons of mass destruction, and \nwithout the constraints of international arms control agreement.\n  It strikes me as a big gamble to develop a national security strategy \non one hand which seems intent on cultivating a missile defense system \nof unknown effectiveness, and a less stable and less secure world on \nthe other.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to debate these issues on the floor \nwith my colleagues at an appropriate time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Thomas, Mr. Graham, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 1567. A bill to foster innovation and technological advancement in \nthe development of the Internet and electronic commerce, and to assist \nthe States in simplifying their sales and use taxes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1567\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Tax Moratorium and \n     Equity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The moratorium of the Internet Tax Freedom Act on new \n     taxes on Internet access and on multiple and discriminatory \n     taxes on electronic commerce should be extended.\n       (2) States should be encouraged to simplify their sales and \n     use tax systems.\n       (3) As a matter of economic policy and basic fairness, \n     similar sales transactions should be treated equally, without \n     regard to the manner in which sales are transacted, whether \n     in person, through the mails, over the telephone, on the \n     Internet, or by other means.\n       (4) Congress may facilitate such equal taxation consistent \n     with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Quill \n     Corp. v. North Dakota.\n       (5) States that adequately simplify their tax systems \n     should be authorized to correct the present inequities in \n     taxation through requiring sellers to collect taxes on sales \n     of goods or services delivered in-state, without regard to \n     the location of the seller.\n       (6) The States have experience, expertise, and a vital \n     interest in the collection of sales and use taxes, and thus \n     should take the lead in developing and implementing sales and \n     use tax collection systems that are fair, efficient, and non-\n     discriminatory in their application and that will simplify \n     the process for both sellers and buyers.\n       (7) Online consumer privacy is of paramount importance to \n     the growth of electronic commerce and must be protected.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT MORATORIUM.\n\n       Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. \n     151 note) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Moratorium.--No State or political subdivision \n     thereof shall impose--\n       ``(1) any taxes on Internet access during the period \n     beginning after September 30, 1998, unless such a tax was \n     generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, \n     1998; and\n       ``(2) multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic \n     commerce during the period beginning on October 1, 1998, and \n     ending on December 31, 2005.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nand expand the credit for electricity produced from renewable resources \nand waste products, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, perhaps at no other time in our history is \nthe energy security of the United States more vital to this nation's \nwell being.\n  We all agree that the United States needs to reduce its dependence on \nfossil fuels that pollute the environment and undermine our national \nsecurity interests and balance of trade. Nevadans understand that any \nresponsible energy strategy must encompass conservation, efficiency, \nand an expanded generating capacity. Developing renewable energy \nresources represents a responsible way to expand our power capacity \nwithout compromising air or water quality. These renewable energy \nsources can enhance America's energy supply on a time scale of 1-3 \nyears, considerably shorter than times required for fossil-fuel power \nplants.\n  I rise today to introduce a bill that expands the existing production \ntax credit for renewable energy technologies to cover all renewable \nenergy technologies. I want to thank Senator Gordon Smith for joining \nme in the introduction of this bill, which sets America on a steady \npath toward energy independence.\n  Our legislation will renew the wind power production tax credit and \nexpand the credit to additional renewable resources, including solar \npower, open-loop biomass, poultry and animal waste, landfill gas, \ngeothermal, incremental geothermal, and incremental hydropower \nfacilities.\n  The proposed production tax credit for all these renewable energy \nsources would be made permanent to signal America's long-term \ncommitment to renewable energy resources.\n  One example that illustrates the need for a permanent tax credit is \nwhat I recently learned about a major wind farm project at the Nevada \nTest Site. It is experiencing delays. The production of electricity in \nrapidly growing Nevada and the whole western part of the country is \nimportant. We need to do something to develop new sources of \nelectricity.\n  But I found that this project, which is set to go on line, is having \ndifficulty\n\n[[Page S10841]]\n\nbecause in the law we have an expiring tax credit for wind. Not only \nthat, but to do it for 1 year really doesn't help that much. People are \nunwilling to lend money on a 1-year tax credit. It is possible this \nproject may be canceled due to the uncertain nature of the production \ntax credit for wind energy. This would be a terrible disappointment. \nWithin 3 to 5 years they can produce enough electricity by wind to \nsupply energy to 260,000 people. That is a lot of people. That would be \nthat much less coal we would have to burn, or natural gas, or fuel oil.\n  The Department of Energy estimates that we could increase our \ngeothermal energy production almost ten fold, supplying ten percent of \nthe energy needs of the West, and expand wind energy production to \nserve the electricity needs of ten million homes.\n  The Nevada Public Utilities Commission estimates 500 megawatts of \nwind energy and 500 megawatts of geothermal should be online in the \nstate by 2013, supplying the energy needs of one million Nevadans. That \nis 1,000 megawatts.\n  But we need a permanent production tax credit to make these estimates \na reality.\n  The bill Senator Smith and I have introduced this afternoon allows \nfor co-production credits to encourage blending of renewable energy \nwith traditional fuels and provides a credit for renewable facilities \non native American and native Alaskan lands.\n  It also provides production incentives to not-for-profit public power \nutilities and rural electric cooperatives, which serve 25 percent of \nthe nation's power customers, by allowing them to transfer of their \ncredits to taxable entities.\n  Fossil fuel plants pump over 11 million tons of pollutants into our \nair each year. Eleven million tons--it is hard to comprehend that--\nevery year. What we are doing is building more powerplants to pump more \npollution into the air. By including landfill gas in this legislation, \nwe systematically reduce the largest single human source of methane \nemissions in the United States, effectively eliminating the greenhouse \ngas equivalent of 233 million tons of carbon dioxide. These figures are \nstaggering, but they are realistic.\n  There is a compelling need for our legislation because the existing \nproduction tax credit for electricity produced from wind energy and \nclosed-loop biomass renewable resources expires at the end of this \nyear.\n  In the past year alone, $1.3 billion in capital investment in wind \nenergy projects has been made in the U.S.\n  As I indicated, at the Nevada Test Site, a new wind farm will provide \n260 megawatts to meet the needs of 260,000 people.\n  Growing renewable energy industries in the U.S. will also help \nprovide growing employment opportunities in the U.S., and help U.S. \nrenewable technologies compete in world markets.\n  In States like Nevada, expanded renewable energy production will \nprovide jobs in rural areas--areas that have been largely left out of \nAmerica's recent economic boom during the past several years. Rural \nNevada hasn't done well at all. Renewable energy is poised to make \nmajor contributions to our Nation's energy needs over the next decade.\n  As fantastic as it sounds, enough sunlight falls on a 100-mile-by-\n100-mile area of southern Nevada that, if covered with solar panels, \ncould power the entire Nation.\n  I am proud to say that Nevada has adopted the most aggressive \nRenewable Portfolio Standard in the nation, requiring that 5 percent of \nthe state's electricity needs be met by renewable energy resources in \n2003, which then grows to 15 percent by 2013.\n  We are mandating in the State of Nevada that 15 percent of the energy \nresources must be produced by alternative energy. That is really a step \nforward, and I applaud the Nevada State Legislature.\n  The citizens of Nevada deserve a national energy strategy that \nensures their economic well being and security, and provides for a \nsecure quality of life. That should also apply to the whole United \nStates.\n  Our legislation encourages the use of renewable energy and signals \nAmerica's long-term commitment to clean energy, a healthy environment, \nand energy independence.\n  Renewable energy--as an alternative and successor to traditional \nenergy sources--is a common sense way to ensure the American people \nhave a reliable source of power at an affordable price.\n  The United States needs to move away from its dependence on fossil \nfuels that pollute the environment and undermine our national security \ninterests and balance of trade.\n  We must accept this commitment for the energy security of the U.S., \nfor the protection of our environment, and for the health and security \nof the American people.\n  I hope this legislation is allowed to move forward as quickly as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1568. A bill to prevent cyberterrorism; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCyberterrorism Prevention Act of 2001, an important piece of \nlegislation to prevent terrorists from hijacking our computer system to \nwreak havoc with our essential infrastructure.\n  This bill provides law enforcement with critical tools to combat \ncyberterrorism. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Reed, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1570. A bill to provide the Secretary of Education with specific \nwaiver authority to respond to conditions in the national emergency \ndeclared by the President on September 14, 2001; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, every American is struggling to cope with \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11 and subsequent events. Among \nthose on the front lines in addressing these disasters are our military \nReservists and members of our National Guard. Not only are these men \nand women grappling with the consequences of the catastrophe and the \nrigors of being mobilized for active duty, but many of them are also \nforced to worry about leaving college in the middle of their courses \nand making continued payments on their student loans. Will their \ntuition be reimbursed for courses that are interrupted? How will they \nkeep up with their student loan payments while they are on active duty?\n  In my State of Maine, more than 10 percent of our National Guard \nmembers are making payments on their student loans and are faced with \nthese very questions. As these Guard members and Reservists prepare to \nserve their country, the least we can do is alleviate their concerns \nabout making payments on their student loans while they are on active \nduty.\n  Some of the families directly affected by the tragedies of September \n11 are facing similar dilemmas. The dislocation in New York City and \nelsewhere caused by the terrorist attacks has jeopardized the ability \nof some individuals to meet their payment schedules on their student \nloans.\n  Lending institutions located in New York City are encountering yet \nanother set of difficulties. A number of lenders are headquartered \nwithin a few blocks of ground zero. They, understandably, have been \nunable to meet the due diligence requirements set forth by the \nDepartment of Education. Several firms, in fact, were not even able to \naccess their office buildings for many days after the attacks, let \nalone meet filing deadlines.\n  With those Guard members, Reservists, affected families, and lending \ninstitutions in mind, I am pleased today to introduce the Higher \nEducation Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2001. My colleagues, \nSenators Gregg, Reed, Warner, and Sessions, as well as the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Johnson, whose support and leadership I value greatly, \nhave signed on as original cosponsors. The HEROS Act grants the \nSecretary of Education specific waiver authority under the Higher \nEducation Act to provide relief to those affected by the recent attacks \non America. The Secretary would be empowered to assist Reservists and \nGuard members who are being called up for active duty as well as others \ndirectly affected by the attacks.\n  The Secretary's new authority would be limited to ensuring that \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S10842]]\n\npersonnel and civilians are in the same financial position as they were \nprior to the terrorist attacks with respect to their student loans. And \nit has been drafted so as to not impair the integrity of the student \nloan programs.\n  The Secretary of Education is given some discretion under the Higher \nEducation Act to defer payments on student loans. But this authority \ndoes not go far enough. The HEROS Act would empower the Secretary to \ntake several additional steps to provide needed relief to help those \ndirectly affected by the terrorist attacks.\n  Specifically, the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students \nAct authorizes the Secretary of Education to relax repayment \nobligations for Guard members and Reservists called up to active duty, \nto provide a period of time during which the victims and their families \nmay reduce or delay monthly student loan payments, and to assist \neducational institutions and lenders with reporting requirements.\n  All of these steps can be taken while still ensuring the integrity of \nour student loan programs.\n  This legislation is modeled on a previous law that was enacted during \nthe Gulf War to provide relief for our men and women in the military. \nIn short, there is precedent for authorizing the Secretary of Education \nto provide these kinds of relief.\n  I am pleased to be joined by five of my colleagues in introducing \nthis bill, and I thank them all for their support. I also commend \nRepresentative McKeon for his leadership on the House version of the \nHEROS Act. His initiative will help ensure that we provide adequate \nstudent loan relief to Reservists, Guard members, and victims' \nfamilies.\n  I look forward to the swift passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask it be \nappropriately referred at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10842-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10842-S10844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 172--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n     URGENT NEED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND \n DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO CIVILIANS IN AFGHANISTAN, INCLUDING AFGHAN \n                   REFUGEES IN SURROUNDING COUNTRIES\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 172\n\n       Whereas, well before the terrorist attacks on September 11, \n     2001, Afghanistan was the site of the greatest crisis of \n     hunger and displacement in the world;\n       Whereas, after more than 20 years of conflict, 3 years of \n     severe drought, and the repressive policies of the Taliban \n     regime, 4,000,000 Afghans had sought refuge in neighboring \n     countries, and Afghan women have one of the highest maternal \n     mortality rates in the world, and one in four children dies \n     before the child's fifth birthday;\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n     estimates that 1,500,000 additional Afghans could seek to \n     flee the country in coming months due to the ongoing military \n     conflict;\n       Whereas all 6 countries neighboring Afghanistan have closed \n     their borders to refugees both on security grounds and citing \n     an inability to economically provide for more refugees, and \n     thousands have been trapped at borders with no food, shelter, \n     water, or medical care;\n       Whereas 7,500,000 people inside Afghanistan face critical \n     food shortages or risk starvation by winter's end, and are \n     partially or fully dependent on outside assistance for \n     survival, and of these people, 70 percent are women and \n     children;\n       Whereas the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), which \n     distributes most of the food within Afghanistan, estimates \n     that food stocks in the country are critically short, and WFP \n     overland food shipments inside and outside the border of \n     Afghanistan have been disrupted due to security concerns over \n     United States military strikes;\n       Whereas airdrops of food by the United States military \n     cannot by itself meet the enormous humanitarian needs of the \n     Afghan people, and cannot replace the most effective delivery \n     method of overland truck convoys of food, nor can it replace \n     access to affected populations by humanitarian agencies;\n       Whereas the President has announced a $320,000,000 \n     initiative to respond to the humanitarian needs in \n     Afghanistan and for Afghan refugees in neighboring countries, \n     and much more international assistance is clearly needed; and\n       Whereas the United States is the single largest donor of \n     humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, totaling more \n     than $185,000,000 in fiscal year 2001: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HUMANITARIAN AND \n                   DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FOR THE PEOPLE OF \n                   AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Afghanistan's neighbors should reopen their borders to \n     allow for the safe passage of refugees, and the international \n     community must be prepared to contribute to the economic \n     costs incurred by the flight of desperate Afghan civilians;\n       (2) as the United States engages in military action in \n     Afghanistan, it must work to deliver assistance, particularly \n     through overland truck convoys, and safe humanitarian access \n     to affected populations, in partnership with humanitarian \n     agencies in quantities sufficient to alleviate a large scale \n     humanitarian catastrophe; and\n       (3) the United States should contribute to efforts by the \n     international community to provide long-term, sustainable \n     reconstruction and development assistance for the people of \n     Afghanistan, including efforts to protect the basic human \n     rights of women and children.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, even before the world focused on it as \na sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and other terrorists, Afghanistan was \non the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe, the site of the greatest \ncrisis in hunger and refugee displacement in the world. Now the \nworsening situation on the ground is almost unimaginable. After 4 years \nof relentless drought, the worst in three decades, and the total \nfailure of the Taliban government in administering the country, 4 \nmillion people have abandoned their homes in search of food in \nPakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, and elsewhere, while those left behind eat \nmeals of locusts and animal fodder.\n  Mr. President, 7.5 million people inside the country are threatened \nby famine or severe hunger as cold weather approaches, according to the \nUnited Nations.\n  As President Bush made clear, we are waging a campaign against \nterrorists, not ordinary Afghans, who are some of the poorest and most \nbeleaguered people on the planet and were our allies during the cold \nwar.\n  Yet, the current military air strikes and the disintegration of \nsecurity is worsening the humanitarian situation on the ground.\n  Aid organizations are increasingly concerned about their ability to \ndeliver aid to Afghanistan while the United States continues its \nbombing campaign. Several aid organizations have been accidentally \nbombed by the United States in the last week. In addition to these \naccidental bombings, law and order are breaking down inside \nAfghanistan. Reports indicate that thieves have broken into several aid \norganization offices, beat up the Afghan staff and stolen vehicles, \nspare parts, and other equipment.\n  Warehouses of the International Red Cross in Kabul were bombed \nyesterday. The ICRC says that the warehouses were clearly marked white \nwith a large red cross visible from the air. One worker was wounded and \nis now in stable condition. One warehouse suffered a direct hit, which \ndestroyed tarpaulins, plastic sheeting, and blankets, while another \ncontaining food caught on fire and was partially destroyed. The \nPentagon claimed responsibility for the bombing later in the day, \nadding that they ``regret any innocent casualties,'' and that the ICRC \nwarehouses were part of a series of warehouses that the United States \nbelieved were used to store military equipment. ``There are huge needs \nfor the civilian population, and definitely it will hamper our \noperations,'' Robert Monin, head of the International Red Cross' \nAfghanistan delegation, said on Islamabad, Pakistan.\n  Another missile struck near a World Food Program warehouse in \nAfsotar, wounding one laborer. The missile struck as trucks were being \nloaded for an Oxfam convoy to the Hazarajat region, where winter will \nbegin closing off the passes in the next two weeks. Loading was \nsuspended and the warehouse remains closed today.\n  Last week, four U.N. workers for a demining operation were \naccidentally killed when a bomb struck their office in Kabul.\n  In response to the dangers threatening humanitarian operations, the\n\n[[Page S10843]]\n\nOxfam America President said, ``It is now evident that we cannot, in \nreasonable safety, get food to hungry Afghan people. We've reached the \npoint where it is simply unrealistic for us to do our job in \nAfghanistan. We've run out of food, the borders are closed, we can't \nreach our staff, and time's running out.''\n  The World Food Program was feeding 3.8 million people a day in \nAfghanistan even before the bombing campaign began. These included \n900,000 internally displaced people at camps. Although the United \nStates military has dropped thousands of ready to eat meals, everyone \nagrees that only truck convoys can move sufficient food into \nAfghanistan before winter. As of last Friday, there were only two \nconvoys confirmed to have gotten though. WFP announced that two more \nconvoys since the bombing campaign started were nearing Kabul.\n  Complications and delays in delivering emergency food supplies to \nAfghanistan could cause rising death rates from starvation and illness \nas winter sets in. Many of the high mountain passes will be closed by \nmid-November due to 20-30 foot snows.\n\n  Aid agencies are falling behind in their efforts to deliver enough \nemergency relief to Afghans to avoid a large loss of life this winter. \nUNICEF estimates that, in addition to the total of 300,000 Afghan \nchildren who die of ``preventable causes'' each year, 100,000 more \nchildren might die this winter from hunger and disease.\n  The main reasons for this shortfall in aid are related to security \nconcerns. Aid agencies have withdrawn their international staff, and \nlocal staff have attempted to continue the aid programs but have been \nsubjected to intimidation, theft, and harassment. As the United States \ncontinues to pound Taliban targets, law and order in some cities is \nreportedly also breaking down. Truck drivers are unwilling to deliver \nsupplies to some areas for fear of being bombed by the United States, \nor being attacked by one faction or another. Taliban supporters have \nobstructed aid deliveries on some occasions.\n  Despite these nightmares, shipment of food and nonfood emergency \nitems arrive in Afghanistan daily--but the total shipped is only about \none-half of what is needed. The situation is particularly urgent as \nsome of the poorest and most needy areas will be cut off from overland \nroutes by mid-November. An estimated 600,000 people in the Central \nHighlands are dependent upon international food aid, and little is on \nhand for them now.\n  The food shortfall in Afghanistan may result in an increased flow of \nrefugees to the borders. A flood of refugees to the border would \npresent a different but also challenging set of problems. Clearly, as \neveryone has said, it is better for them to remain at home than flee to \nneighboring countries out of hunger.\n  There is no easy solution to this humanitarian crisis. It is complex \nand requires the international community to take urgent and imaginative \naction to boost the flow of food inside. The United States should take \nthe lead in helping to devise aggressive and imaginative ways to expand \nthe delivery of food. These could include the creation of humanitarian \ncorridors, the use of existing commercial trading companies and air \ndeliveries to airports that have not yet been bombed.\n  The establishment of humanitarian ground and air corridors should be \nconsidered for the secure transportation and distribution of emergency \naid. The administration should push to have some roads or air routes in \nareas of limited conflict be designated as protected humanitarian \nroutes. Such possible ground and air corridors include Northern \nAlliance held territory along the border of Tajikstan, and Northern \nAlliance airfields which have not been bombed. These airfields could be \nused for a Berlin style airlift to get massive amounts of aid into the \ncountry quickly.\n  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that 1.5 \nmillion additional Afghans could seek to flee the country in coming \nmonths due to the ongoing military conflict.\n  All six countries neighboring Afghanistan have closed their borders \nto refugees both on security grounds and citing an inability to \neconomically provide for more refugees. Thousands have been trapped at \nborders with no food, shelter, water, or medical care.\n  I am introducing a resolution today which addresses this crisis. The \ntext of the resolution states the following:\n  Afghanistan's neighbors should reopen their borders to allow for the \nsafe passage of refugees, and the international community must be \nprepared to contribute to the economic costs incurred by the flight of \ndesperate Afghan civilians;\n  As the United States engages in military action in Afghanistan, it \nmust work to deliver assistance, particularly through overland truck \nconvoys, and safe humanitarian access to affected populations, in \npartnership with humanitarian agencies in quantities sufficient to \nalleviate a large scale humanitarian catastrophe;\n  The United States should contribute to efforts by the international \ncommunity to provide long-term, sustainable reconstruction and \ndevelopment assistance for the people of Afghanistan, including efforts \nto protect the basic human rights of women and children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I spoke yesterday in this Chamber in relation to this \nresolution I am submitting today. I will offer this as an amendment on \nlegislation to have a vote.\n  I think we in America are probably as united as we can be as a \npeople, especially when it comes to our horror and sadness, indignation \nand anger at the innocent slaughter of so many people, so many \nAmericans.\n  In response to that, a resolution was passed authorizing the use of \nforce, targeted on those who committed this act, hopefully drawing a \ndistinction between justice and vengeance.\n  I think most of us also believe--and certainly Secretary Powell has \nsaid this more than once, as it is terribly important--that the use of \nforce, the military action, must be as targeted as possible; that every \nstep be taken that is humanly possible to avoid innocent people being \nkilled, innocent Afghans who had nothing to do with the murders in our \ncountry.\n  I worry to the extent that there are reports that innocent people \nhave been killed in the bombing. I certainly worry about that. Our \ncountry wants to avoid that. Moreover, there is also the whole question \nof the Islamic world and how people respond to this. So, again, I will \nmake the point that this has to be as carefully targeted as possible.\n  But the other issue, which I do not think we have paid enough \nattention to--and I had a chance to write a piece for the Boston Globe \na couple weeks ago, and I am going to start speaking about this in the \nChamber more, and I think there is a lot of strong bipartisan interest \nand support for this--is the whole question of this humanitarian crisis \nin Afghanistan.\n  The reports are there are about 7.5 million people who go hungry. We \ndo not know how many hundreds of thousands could starve to death this \nwinter if we do not get food to people.\n  The problem is, though there has been a lot of discussion about the \nairdrops, maybe a half of 1 percent, maybe 1 percent at best, doesn't \ndo the job. The only way we can get the food to people is through the \ntruck convoys, and now not nearly enough of this is happening.\n  Different organizations, the NGOs, the nongovernment organizations, \nfood relief organizations, are all saying on present course they may be \nable to get enough food for half the people who need it at best. In 3 \nor 4 weeks there will be cold winter weather, and we will see pictures \nof innocent, starving Afghan children. That is a fact.\n  The resolution calls upon our Government to take stronger measures, \nwith a more focused effort to get the food to people. That will be \ncomplicated. Part of it involves people who will still be trying to \nleave Afghanistan. Some of the neighboring countries have to open up \ntheir borders. Those people have been stopped at the borders. Then \nthere are the people who don't leave. And the conditions in the refugee \ncamps have to be dramatically improved.\n  The fact is, the people who don't leave are the poorest of the poor. \nThey are the elderly, the infirmed; they are the children. They are the \nones about whom we all worry. There have been intermittent reports--\nquite often when you try to confirm it, it is not clear what happened--\nthat the Taliban itself\n\n[[Page S10844]]\n\nhas taken some of the food. Many organizations are saying with the \nbombing the truck convoys can't go through.\n  I am not making an argument for cessation of bombing. I argue it be \nas targeted as possible and to avoid in every way possible bombing \ninnocent people. There has to be a way, whether it is the creation of \nsafe corridors, coordinated with military activity or whatever to get \nthese truck convoys in to get the food to people. Time is not neutral. \nWe are going to deeply regret if we don't take these steps.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate regarding the urgent \nneed to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilians of \nAfghanistan. Well before the terrorist attack of September 11, this was \nthe site of great hunger and displacement in the world.\n  Whereas, after more than 20 years of conflict, 3 years of severe \ndrought and the repressive policies of the Taliban regime, 4 million \nAfghans have sought refuge in neighboring countries, and Afghan women \nhave one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, and one \nin four children dies before the child's fifth birthday; whereas the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that 1,500,000 \nadditional Afghans could seek to flee the country in the coming months \ndue to the military conflict; whereas all six countries neighboring \nAfghanistan have closed their borders to refugees both on security \ngrounds and are also saying they can't provide for the refugees \neconomically; whereas 7,500,000 people inside Afghanistan face critical \nfood shortages or risk starvation by winter's end and are partially or \nfully dependent on outside assistance for survival, and of these people \n70 percent are women and children; whereas the United Nations World \nFood Program, which we commonly call the WFP, which distributes most of \nthe food within Afghanistan, estimates that food stocks in the country \nare critically short and WFP overland food shipments inside and outside \nthe border of Afghanistan have been disrupted due to security concerns \nover United States military strikes; whereas the airdrops of food \ncannot meet the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people--and there is \nmore to it, but I do not have the time--and that the most effective \ndelivery is the overland convoys of food; whereas the President has \nannounced a $320 million initiative to respond to the humanitarian \nneeds in Afghanistan and for Afghan refugees in neighboring countries; \nwhereas the United States is the largest donor of humanitarian \nassistance, be it resolved--and this is what I am hoping to get a \nstrong vote on--it is the sense of the Senate that, A, Afghanistan's \nneighbors should reopen their borders to allow for safe passage of \nrefugees, and the international community must be prepared to \ncontribute to the economic costs incurred by the flight of desperate \nAfghan civilians; B, as the United States engages in military action in \nAfghanistan, it must work to deliver assistance particularly through \noverland truck convoys and safe humanitarian access to affected \npopulations in partnership with humanitarian agencies--that is \ncritical--and C, the United States should contribute to efforts by the \ninternational community to provide long-term sustainable reconstruction \nand development assistance for the people of Afghanistan, including \nefforts to protect the basic human rights of women and children.\n\n  I announce this resolution today, which will be in the form of an \namendment on the first vehicle for a vote, because it is critically \nimportant for the Senate to go on record with an intense and focused \neffort because it is who we are. It is our values to make sure these \ntruck convoys can go forward and we can get the food to people.\n  A, it is who we are as a nation. It is about the values we live by \nand, frankly, B, it is national interest. If you have juxtaposed with \nmilitary actions pictures of starving Afghan children in the winter to \ncome, that will be used against us. We know it will be used against us. \nWe do not want to see that happen.\n  I am hoping there will be a strong message from the Senate to work \nwith the administration, to work with the NGOs, to work with the food \nrelief organizations. We have to put a focus on this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/18/senate-section/article/S10844-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 173--CONDEMNING VIOLENCE AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST \n   IRANIAN-AMERICANS IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST \n                                ATTACKS\n\n  Mr. HATCH submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I thank the majority whip for his kindness \nin allowing me to express my appreciation and admiration for Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lott keeping us in session today. Today's statement \nis very important: That the work of the Senate is going on and will \ncontinue.\n  Certainly, it was a very troubling thing to learn anthrax had been \ndelivered to a Senate office building and 300 more people may have been \nexposed. We know the good news is exposure does not mean infection, and \nwe also know from the public health professionals that this form of \nanthrax is easily treatable with all forms of antibiotics, from \npenicillin to the new Cipro. Really, this is not a threat to those \npeople because our public health people moved very quickly. The medical \nteams were there, and we have taken the necessary steps.\n  What the terrorists want to do is not necessarily kill anybody with \nanthrax because they are not going to do it, but they want to spread \nfear. The terrorists win if they cripple us psychologically, if they \ndestroy our economy, if they turn us against ourselves, or if they \ninterfere with the workings of our Government and our economy.\n  We will not let them win if we do not give in to our fears. The \nmedical experts tell us that anthrax is not contagious; but panic is. \nThe message to our people, our bosses, the good people of America, is \nthat they have been strong and their Government is going to continue to \nfunction.\n  There will be more letters. Since we made the decision to stay in, \nthere were letters that were delivered to Governor Pataki's security \noffice, to the media. These will continue, and, unfortunately, there \nmay be other evidence of bioterrorism or physical violence visited on \nus by terrorists, but we have strong leadership.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we support the President. Most of all, we \nsupport the brave fighting men and women of America whose lives are on \nthe line to limit the terrorists, to run them back into their holes, to \ndestroy their safe havens, to take away their financial resources, and \nto terminate them.\n  We will continue this fight, and the American people have responded \nmarvelously. There has been a tremendous outpouring of charity, with \nbillions of dollars that Americans have contributed to aid those who \nare victims. I urge we continue to support those organizations, from \nthe Salvation Army to the Red Cross, and all of the other groups that \nare providing vitally needed services and who must continue to serve in \nour community.\n  Continuing to support our local United Way is as important as helping \nto combat the direct impact of the terrorist activities. We are going \nto win this fight. The terrorists are not going to destroy us. We have \nseen the example of the brave people of London who survived and \nflourished when London was under fierce bombing attacks in World War \nII. We have seen the people in Israel who live with terrorism every \nday, and they are not deterred. They will continue their lives, and we \nas Americans must continue our lives.\n  We are the bright and shining beacon for the world. We are the ones \nwho inspire jealousy and inspire envy and inspire fear in others, but \nwe have reached out the hand of friendship. The President has urged \nAmerican children to contribute a dollar to help the children in \nAfghanistan, and that is the American way.\n  We will fight against those who seek to rain violence down upon us, \nwho seek to spread fear and concern among our citizens. We will be \nstrong, but we will be humanitarian and we will take care of those in \nneed. We will show people there is a better way. We will show people \nfreedom and democracy can flourish in the face of terrorist activities. \nThat is the strength of America.\n\n  We are being tested today, and by having the Senate in session today \nwe have shown that Government will go on.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue their steadfast resolve. To our \nstaffs and others who are frightened, be not afraid. You are not on the \nfront lines where our young men and women are in danger of bullets and \nanti-aircraft missiles every day. They are showing the bravery. With \ntheir resolute\n\n[[Page S10851]]\n\nstrength and with our commitment to continue our jobs, terrorism will \nnot win. We all in America can once again say, God bless America.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
