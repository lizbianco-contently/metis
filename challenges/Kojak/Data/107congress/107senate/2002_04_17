Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their unanimous \nand positive vote on the last nominee. I will bring everybody up to \ndate.\n  Today, the Senate is voting on the 44th judicial nominee to be \nconfirmed since last July when the Senate Judiciary Committee was \nreassigned new members in connection with the reorganization of the \nSenate after the shift in majority. The confirmation of Judge Africk \nwill be the third district court judgeship we have filled in Louisiana \nand the seventh judgeship filled overall in the Fifth Circuit since \nJuly, including the first new judge for the Fifth Circuit in seven \nyears. In fact, it was this Senate's confirmation of Judge Edith Brown \nClement last fall that created this vacancy, which we are now \nproceeding to fill without delay.\n  In the past few months, the Senate has also confirmed Judge Kurt \nEngelhardt and Judge Jay Zainey to fill vacancies on the District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Louisiana. The Senate has confirmed Judge \nMichael Mills to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Mississippi. The Senate has also confirmed Judge Philip \nMartinez to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Texas and Judge Randy Crane to fill a vacancy on the \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n  Of course many of the vacancies in the Fifth Circuit are \nlongstanding. Judge Clement was confirmed to fill a judicial emergency \non the Fifth Circuit. Judge Martinez and Judge Crane likewise filled \nwhat had been judicial emergencies. These many vacancies and \nemergencies are the legacy of the years of inaction. For example, \ndespite the fact that President Clinton nominated Jorge Rangel, a \ndistinguished Hispanic attorney, to fill a Fifth Circuit vacancy in \nJuly 1997, Mr. Rangel never received a hearing and his nomination was \nreturned to the President without Senate action at the end of 1998. On \nSeptember 16, 1999, President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno, another \noutstanding Hispanic attorney, to fill a vacancy on the Fifth Circuit \nbut that nominee never received a hearing either. When President Bush \ntook office last January, he withdrew the nomination of Enrique Moreno \nto the Fifth Circuit. The Senate has moved quickly to confirm Judge \nArmijo in New Mexico and Judges Martinez and Crane in Texas, who were \namong the very few Hispanic judicial nominees sent so far by this \nAdministration to us.\n  The Senate received Judge Africk's nomination the last week in \nJanuary and his paperwork was complete on March 6. Judge Africk was \nscheduled for the very next confirmation hearing on March 19. He has \nbeen serving as a federal magistrate in the Eastern District of \nLouisiana for more than a decade. Judge Africk is a member of the \nFederalist society and a registered Republican. His confirmation, along \nwith that of Judge Clement, Judge Wooten in South Carolina, Judge Mills \nin Mississippi, Judge Caldwell in Kentucky, Judge Granade in Alabama, \nJudge Hartz to the Tenth Circuit, and so many others, shows that the \nSenate has been very accommodating to this Administration's \nconservative nominations.\n  The Senate is making progress on judicial confirmations. Under \nDemocratic leadership, the Senate has confirmed more judges in the last \nnine months than were confirmed in four out of 6 full years under \nRepublican leadership. The number of judicial confirmations over this \ntime--44--exceeds the number confirmed during all 12 months of 2000, \n1999, 1997 and 1996.\n  During the preceding 6\\1/2\\ years in which a Republican majority most \nrecently controlled the pace of judicial confirmations in the Senate, \n248 judges were confirmed. Some like to talk about the 377 judges \nconfirmed during the Clinton administration, but forget to mention that \nmore than one-third were confirmed during the first 2 years of the \nClinton administration while the Senate majority was Democratic and \nSenator Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee. The pace of \nconfirmations under a Republican majority was markedly slower--\nespecially in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000.\n  Thus, during the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate, \njudicial confirmations averaged 38 per year a pace of consideration and \nconfirmation that we have already exceeded under Democratic leadership \nover these past nine months in spite of all of the challenges facing \nCongress and the Nation during this period and all of the obstacles \nRepublicans have placed in our path.\n  I ask myself how Republicans can justify seeking to hold the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate to a different standard than the one \nthey met themselves during the last 6\\1/2\\ years. There simply is no \nanswer other than partisanship. This double standard is most apparent \nwhen Republicans refuse fairly to compare the progress we are making \nwith the period in which they were\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\nin the Senate majority with a President of the other party. They do not \nwant to talk about that because we have exceeded, in just 9 months, the \naverage number of judges they confirmed per year.\n  They would rather unfairly compare the work of the Senate on \nconfirmations in the past 9 months to a period more than twice as long, \nthe work of previous Senates and Presidents over entire 2-year \nCongresses. They say it is unacceptable that the Democratic-led Senate \nhas not yet confirmed as many judges in nine months as were confirmed \nin 24-month-periods at other times. I would say it is quite unfair to \ncomplain that we have not done 24 months of work on judicial vacancies \nin the little more nine months we have had since the Senate \nreorganized. After all, we have already topped their efforts for 12-\nmonth periods and are still hard at work.\n  These double standards are wrong and unfair, but that does not seem \nto matter to Republicans intent on criticizing and belittling every \nachievement of the Senate under a Democratic majority.\n  Republicans have been imposing a double standard on circuit court \nvacancies as well. The Republican attack is based on the unfounded \nnotion that the Senate has not kept up with attrition on the Courts of \nAppeals. This is a case of the arsonist coming forward and saying: We \nneed a better fire department around here. Look at all these buildings \nthat are burning down. All these vacancies were there because \nRepublicans refused to hold hearings on the Court of Appeals nominees. \nWe are now holding such hearings.\n  The Democratic majority in the Senate has more than kept up with \nattrition and we are seeking to close the vacancies gap on the Courts \nof Appeals that more than doubled under the Republican majority.\n  Just this week, the Senate confirmed Judge Terrence O'Brien to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by a vote of 98 to \nzero. His confirmation was the eighth circuit court nominee to be \nconfirmed in the little more than nine months since I became Chairman \nthis past summer.\n  We have already confirmed eight Court of Appeals nominees and held \nhearings on 11 Court of Appeals nominees. In comparable periods at the \nbeginning of the Clinton administration, with a Senate majority of the \nsame party as the President, the confirmations numbered only two and \nhearings were held on only three. In the comparable period during the \nadministration of George H. W. Bush, within the first 10 months the \nSenate had confirmed only three Court of Appeals judges and had \nhearings on only four.\n\n  The facts on what Republicans are now calling the judicial vacancies \ncrisis in our Courts of Appeals are important and startling. The \nRepublican majority assumed control of judicial confirmations in \nJanuary 1995 and did not allow the Judiciary Committee to be \nreorganized after the shift in majority last summer until July 10, \n2001. During that period, from 1995 through July 2001, vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals more than doubled, increasing from 16 to 33!\n  When I became chairman of a committee to which members were finally \nassigned on July 10, we began with 33 Court of Appeals vacancies. That \nis what I inherited. Since the shift in majority last summer, five \nadditional vacancies have arisen on the Courts of Appeals around the \ncountry. With this week's confirmation of Judge O'Brien, we have \nreduced the number of circuit court vacancies to 30.\n  Rather than the 38 vacancies that would exist if we were making no \nprogress, as some have asserted, there are now 30 vacancies--that is \nmore than keeping up with the attrition on the Circuit Courts. Since \nour Republican critics are so fond of using percentages, I will say \nthat we will have now reduced the vacancies on the Courts of Appeals by \nalmost 10 percent in the last nine months. In other words, by \nconfirming three more nominees than the five required to keep up with \nthe pace of attrition, we have not just the matched the rate of \nattrition but surpassed it by 60 percent.\n  While the Republican Senate majority increased vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals by over 100 percent, it has taken the Democratic \nmajority nine months to reverse that trend, keep up with extraordinary \nturnover and, in addition, reduce circuit court vacancies by almost 10 \npercent overall. Alternatively, Republicans should note that since the \nshift in majority away from them, the Senate has filled more than 20 \npercent of the vacancies on the Courts of Appeals in a little over 9 \nmonths. This is progress. Rather than having the circuit vacancy \nnumbers skyrocketing, as they did overall during the prior 6\\1/2\\ \nyears--more than doubling from 16 to 33--the Democratic-led Senate has \nreversed that trend and the vacancy rate is moving in the right \ndirection, down.\n  That is not to say that our job is completed, but a fair review of \nour efforts should acknowledge the progress we have made. It is not \npossible to repair the damage caused by longstanding vacancies in \nseveral circuits overnight, but we are improving the conditions in the \n5th, 10th and 8th Circuits, in particular. The confirmation of Judge \nO'Brien this week made the second judge confirmed to the 10th Circuit \nin the last 4 months.\n  With this week's vote on Judge O'Brien, in a little more than nine \nmonths since the change in majority, the Senate has confirmed eight \njudges to the Courts of Appeals and held hearings on three others. In \ncontrast, the Republican-controlled majority averaged only seven \nconfirmations to the Courts of Appeals per year. Seven. We have \nconfirmed eight circuit judges and there are almost 3 months left until \nthe 1-year anniversary of the reorganization of the Senate and the \nJudiciary Committee and we have already exceeded the annual number of \nCourt of Appeals judges confirmed by our predecessors. The Senate in \nthe last nine months has confirmed as many Court of Appeals judges as \nwere confirmed in all of 2000 and more than were confirmed in 1997 or \n1999, and eight more than the zero from 1996.\n\n  Overall, in little more than 9 months, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhas held 16 hearings involving 55 judicial nominations. That is more \nhearings on judges than the Republican majority held in any year of its \ncontrol of the Senate. In contrast, one-sixth of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees--more than 50--never got a Committee hearing and \nCommittee vote from the Republican majority, which perpetuated \nlongstanding vacancies into this year. Vacancies continue to exist on \nthe Courts of Appeals in part because a Republican majority was not \nwilling to hold hearings or vote on more than half 56 percent--of \nPresident Clinton's Court of Appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000 and was \nnot willing to confirm a single judge to the Court of Appeals during \nthe entire 1996 session.\n  Despite the new-found concern from across the aisle about the number \nof vacancies on the circuit courts, no nominations hearings were held \nwhile the Republicans controlled the Senate in the 107th Congress last \nyear. No judges were confirmed during that time from among the many \nqualified circuit court nominees received by the Senate on January 3, \n2001, or from among the nominations received by the Senate on May 9, \n2001.\n  The Democratic leadership acted promptly to address the number of \ncircuit and district vacancies that had been allowed to grow when the \nSenate was in Republican control. The Judiciary Committee noticed the \nfirst hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes of the \nreorganization of the Senate and held that hearing on the day after the \nCommittee was assigned new members.\n  That initial hearing included a Court of Appeals nominee on whom the \nRepublican majority had refused to hold a hearing the year before. We \nheld unprecedented hearings for judicial nominees during the August \nrecess. Those hearing included a Court of Appeals nominee who had been \na Republican staff member of the Senate. We proceeded with a hearing \nthe day after the first anthrax letter arrived at the Senate. That \nhearing included a Court of Appeals nominee. In a little more than nine \ntumultuous months, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held 16 hearings \ninvolving 55 judicial nominations--including 11 circuit court \nnominees--and we are hoping to hold another hearing soon for half a \ndozen more nominees, including another Court of Appeals nominee. That \nis more hearings on judges than the Republican majority held in any \nyear of\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\nits control of the Senate. The Republican majority never held 16 \njudicial confirmation hearings in 12 months.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding regular hearings on \njudicial nominees and giving nominees a vote in Committee, in contrast \nto the practice of anonymous holds and other obstructionist tactics \nemployed by some during the period of Republican control. The \nDemocratic majority has reformed the process and practices used in the \npast to deny Committee consideration of judicial nominees. We have \nmoved away from the anonymous holds that so dominated the process from \n1996 through 2000. We have made home State Senators' blue slips public \nfor the first time.\n  I do not mean by my comments to appear critical of Senator Hatch. \nMany times during the 6\\1/2\\ years he chaired the Judiciary Committee, \nI observed that, were the matter left up to us, we would have made more \nprogress on more judicial nominees. I thanked him during those years \nfor his efforts. I know that he would have liked to have been able to \ndo more and not have to leave so many vacancies and so many nominees \nwithout action.\n\n  I hope and intend to continue to hold hearings and make progress on \njudicial nominees in order to further the administration of justice. In \nour efforts to address the number of vacancies on the circuit and \ndistrict courts we inherited from the Republicans, the Committee has \nfocused on consensus nominees for all Senators. In order to respond to \nwhat Vice President Cheney and Senator Hatch now call a vacancy crisis, \nthe Committee has focused on consensus nominees. This will help end the \ncrisis caused by Republican delay and obstruction by confirming as many \nof the President's judicial nominees as quickly as possible.\n  Most Senators understand that the more controversial nominees require \ngreater review. This process of careful review is part of our \ndemocratic process. It is a critical part of the checks and balances of \nour system of government that does not give the power to make lifetime \nappointments to one person alone to remake the courts along narrow \nideological lines, to pack the courts with judges whose views are \noutside of the mainstream of legal thought, and whose decisions would \nfurther divide our Nation.\n  The committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. The Court of Appeals nominees included at hearings \nso far this year have been at the request of Senator Grassley, Senator \nLott, Senator Specter, Senator Enzi and Senator Smith from New \nHampshire--five Republican Senators who each sought a prompt hearing on \na Court of Appeals nominee who was not among those initially sent to \nthe Senate in May 2001. Each of the previous 43 nominees confirmed by \nthe Senate has received the unanimous, bipartisan backing of the \nCommittee.\n  The confirmation of Judge Africk makes the 44th judicial nominee to \nbe confirmed since I became chairman last July, and I hope to confirm \nour 50th nominee by the end of this month. I am extremely proud of the \nwork this committee has done since the change in the majority. I am \nproud of the way we have considered nominees fairly and expeditiously \nand the way we have been able to report to the Senate so many \nqualified, non-ideological, consensus nominees to the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I supported the nomination of Lance Africk \nto be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Judge Africk's distinguished \nlegal career, and I have concluded that he is a fine jurist who will \nadd a great deal to the Federal bench in Louisiana.\n  Judge Lance Africk has an impressive record in the private and public \nsectors. Upon graduation from the University of North Carolina School \nof Law in 1975, Judge Africk clerked for the Louisiana Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeal before joining the New Orleans firm of Normann & \nNormann as a civil attorney. In 1977, he moved to the Orleans Parish \nDistrict Attorney's Office in New Orleans and became director of the \nCareer Criminal Bureau, where he prosecuted criminal cases. From late \n1980 to mid-1982, Judge Africk worked in private practice, representing \nplaintiffs and defendants in personal injury cases and serving as \ncorporate counsel. In August 1982, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office \nin New Orleans as an assistant U.S. attorney and served with \ndistinction as chief of the Criminal Division until 1990. As a State \nand Federal prosecutor, Judge Africk became an expert in drug and \npublic corruption matters. During his legal career, he tried to \njudgment or verdict approximately 40 cases. Since 1990, Judge Africk \nhas served as U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of \nLouisiana, bearing responsibility for often complex civil and criminal \nmatters assigned from the U.S. District Court.\n  I have every confidence that Lance Africk will serve with distinction \non the Federal district court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud that the Senate today \nconfirmed Lance Africk for Federal District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana. Again, I must commend President Bush for this \nnomination. He has chosen an exceptional man with a fantastic \nreputation for the Federal Bench.\n  I cannot say enough about Lance. Lance brings over 25 years of legal \nexperience to this job, and for the past 12 years, he has served as the \nU.S. Magistrate for Civil and Criminal Matters. His commitment to \ncommunity and country has permeated his career as an Orleans Parish \nDistrict Attorney, a United States Attorney and most recently as a \nFederal Magistrate. I know that he looks forward to continuing his \nservice. He presents a true model of honor and professionalism to the \nbar.\n  Numerous letters of support have poured into my office praising \nLance's qualities. Everyone who has ever talked to me about Lance has \nused the same words: fair, courteous, and intelligent. Not only does \nLance possess these values, but he has instilled them in his family. \nHis wife Diane and his four children mean the world to him and inspire \nhis service. Today's action in the Senate only confirmed what I and \neveryone in Louisiana already knew; that Lance Africk will be an asset \nto the Federal Judiciary.\n  We need more people like Lance Africk on the Federal Bench. He is a \ntrue patriot who desires to serve his country to the best of his \nability. He recognizes the importance of our judicial system and has \ndedicated his life to the system of laws that makes our country so \nunique. It is for these reasons that I wholeheartedly supported his \nnomination and am elated by the action of the Senate today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I am at heart a teacher. Perhaps it is \ngenetic, for I am the son of teachers. Whatever its source, a \ncommitment to education runs deep in my soul. That is why, when I was \nGovernor of Georgia, I chose to focus on education, for all our other \nchallenges have at their root the same solution: Children who are loved \nand children who are educated.\n  I believe education is everything. It is the educated individual who \nmakes this Nation stronger. It is the educated individual who adds to \nits wealth, protects against enemies, carries forward its ideals and \nfaith.\n  The Latin phrase ``alma mater'' means ``nourishing mother.'' That is \na pretty good description of what our schools should be for our \nchildren.\n  Within those schools, all education starts with the teacher standing \nat the head of the child's classroom. Teachers are the world's most \nnoble creatures, engaged in the world's most noble profession. Teachers \nare the architects who guide and shape the building of young lives. \nTeachers are the ones who call forth the best from our children and \ninspire them to reach new heights. Teachers, I think we would all \nagree, are the key ingredient to improving education.\n  So if we are to build a first class education system in this country, \nwe must be able to attract and hold on to good teachers. Right now, we \nare losing that battle. We are losing that fight badly.\n  Last year we set a new standard in Federal aid for education with the \npassage of President Bush's far-reaching education reform bill. But \nwhile we have made big strides in Federal funding for education, we \nstill have not touched teacher salaries at the Federal level.\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\n  I would argue that teacher pay is the most important area of all \neducation. Yet our teachers work in sometimes deplorable conditions and \nfor little pay. Public school teachers in America today make an average \nof $43,335 a year. One would assume that about half of the States have \nteacher salaries above the national average and the other half have \nteacher salaries below that level. But actually, only 12 States, plus \nthe District of Columbia, have salaries that are higher than the \nnational average. The other 38 States are below the national average. \nIn fact, the dollar gap between the lowest and the highest average \nsalaries varies greatly from a low of $30,265 in South Dakota to a high \nof $53,281 in New Jersey.\n  Sadly, our teachers have even lost financial ground over the past few \nyears. In the past decade, teacher salaries rose only one-half of 1 \npercent when inflation is taken into account. In many States, teachers \nactually lost ground to inflation.\n  Today in this Nation, teacher salaries account for a smaller \nproportion of total education spending than they did 40 years ago. In \n1960, the average education expenditure devoted to teacher salaries was \n51 percent. Today it is 36.7 percent, the lowest percentage since \nrecords have been kept.\n  As a result, many of the best and brightest of our young people today \nsteer away from the classrooms to join the ranks of better paying \nprofessions. It has become clear that unless we in Congress take some \ndrastic action, and take it soon, this disparity will only get worse \nbecause on the horizon ominous storm clouds loom darkly. We must hire 2 \nmillion more teachers in the next decade to keep up with new students \nwho are entering our schools. Where are we going to get all those new \nteachers? Where?\n  Enrollment at our colleges of education is down 30 percent. Among \nthose who are willing to try teaching, 40 percent leave the profession \nbefore the end of their fifth year. In some States, almost 20 percent \nleave after just 1 year. Most, of course, leave to pursue better paying \ncareers. And who can blame them? It is a hollow message when we \nconstantly tell our teachers how invaluable they are and then pay them \nso little.\n  What can we do, and what can we do quickly, to stop this brain drain \nfrom our schools? How can we make teaching more competitive with better \npaying professionals? I will tell you how we could have an immediate \neffect. Let our teachers keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  I will be introducing a bill to give our teachers an immediate pay \nraise in the form of a tax cut. Simply put, teachers would keep more \nmoney in their pocket each payday and send less of it to the IRS. They \nneed this money back home more than we need it up here. And I guarantee \nyou they will spend it more wisely than we will. Hard-earned money \nalways goes further in a household than it does in a rathole. I call it \nthe Thank You Teachers Tax Cut. Here is how it would work.\n  It would include every full-time teacher, public and private, in \nevery prekindergarten and K through 12 classroom. This tax cut would \nstart immediately and would increase the longer the teacher stayed in \nthe classroom.\n  Teachers with fewer than 5 years in the classroom, about 900,000 \nteachers, would get a tax cut equal to one-third of their Federal \nincome tax. Teachers with 5 to 10 years of experience, also about \n900,000 teachers, would get to keep two-thirds of what they would \nnormally pay in Federal income tax. Teachers with more than 10 years' \nexperience--about 1.8 million teachers--would have no Federal income \ntax at all for as long as they stayed in the classroom.\n  The Thank You Teachers Tax Cut would mean immediate pay raises of \nbetween 5 and 15 percent. It would put more money into teachers' \npockets each and every payday. It would immediately give some equity to \nthis noble profession. But it would be more than just more money. It \nwould be a tangible show of our respect and our gratitude to this \nprofession that is all too often taken for granted.\n  So it would be a huge tax cut, more than $16 billion a year at a \nminimum--probably more, according to my very rough math. But when we \nare talking about a projected budget for 2003 of $2.085 trillion, $16 \nbillion is not even 1 percent of that budget. Don't tell me we cannot \ntighten our belt that little to help our teachers.\n  We all know our teachers are not paid adequately. They are not in my \nState and they are not in your State. Some need more help than others. \nMississippi has the lowest average salary for teachers in the South and \nSouth Dakota has the lowest paid teachers in the Nation. I would plead \nfor the leaders of both parties in this Senate to support this tax cut.\n  I also think our Nation's Governors would like this proposal for two \nreasons: First, it does not interfere with the States' rights to set \nteacher salaries. But it does boost the bottom line for every State's \nteachers, and that is what is important.\n  Our Governors will also like it because today, and especially in the \nnext few years, that Pacman called Medicaid is going to gobble up State \nrevenues as never before. I warn you, that will leave a much smaller \npot of money available at the State level for teacher pay raises.\n  I realize there are shortages in other important professions that \nhave low salaries and bad working conditions, and I have great sympathy \nfor those workers, too. But the long-term security of this Nation is \nwrapped up in our schools, and that is why this tax cut for teachers is \nsuch an important one now.\n  This tax cut is a chance to really help our children by making sure \nwe put good teachers in their classrooms and keep them there. It is \nalso a chance to help our deserving teachers. It is the fastest, surest \nway to put more money into their pockets immediately.\n  Finally, this is a chance for the Senate, for the entire Congress, to \nsay thank you to our teachers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, thank you very much. This is one of \nthose speeches I had not intended to make. I have to make it, but I \nwould just as soon not make it.\n  I rise today to provide a few comments on the situation we are facing \nregarding the farm bill and the possibility of an assistance package \nthis year. My colleagues are working very hard in the conference. I \ndon't mean to perjure anybody's intent. These are friends of mine, and \nI know we have strong differences of opinion. But we are in pretty \nrough shape for the shape we are in, in farm country, and we need \nassurance that there will be an assistance package as of this year.\n  For several weeks now, I have been warning that we need to either get \na farm bill finished and apply it to this year's crop or pass an \nagriculture assistance package, and then pass a new bill that goes into \neffect for the 2003 crop. The thinking behind that is it is better to \npass a good bill than simply disagree on a bad bill and try to expedite \nthat.\n  Prior to the Easter and Passover recess, I introduced an assistance \npackage that I said was a placeholder if a bill could not be passed \nalmost immediately after the recess period. Well, it is now April 17. \nWe still have not passed a bill. In fact, the negotiations did break \ndown yesterday, unfortunately.\n  It seems clear that a bill will not be passed as of this week. Madam \nPresident, the clock, if not expired, is certainly ticking. It is the \n11th hour and 59th minute. It is time for us to admit what farmers and \nranchers already know: It is too late to pass a bill that applies to \nthis year's crop.\n  Consider these facts:\n  The 2002 wheat crop was planted last fall and harvesting in the far \nsouthern region will begin next month.\n  Several crop reports in recent days have said that 9 percent of the \nNation's cotton crop is planted, including 37 percent in Arizona, 35 \npercent in California, and 13 percent in Texas, with the rest of the \nStates starting to plant.\n  Corn planting is 59 percent complete in Texas; 25 percent in \nTennessee; 3 percent in North Carolina; 26 percent in Missouri; 17 \npercent in Kentucky; and in Kansas--yes, we grow cotton--11 percent.\n  Another article said corn planters were already in the field in \neastern\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\nIowa. And 43 percent of the sorghum crop is planted in Texas and 18 \npercent in Arkansas. Rice: Texas, 85 percent planted; Louisiana, 69 \npercent; 10 percent in Arkansas.\n  Our producers and our bankers, lenders, must make planting and \nlending decisions. We cannot continue this game of Charlie Brown, Lucy, \nand the football. This will not work in farm country.\n  Our producers have been told that the bill could be completed prior \nto Christmas, the bill could be completed right after the first of the \nyear, the bill would be completed by Easter, and the bill would be \ncompleted by April 15.\n  Quite frankly, we have people who crawl out of train wrecks faster \nthan the farm bill conference is proceeding in regard to the tough \namendments they must reconcile. My producers do not believe any \npredictions they hear at this point. They now need to make decisions \nforced by their lenders.\n  I want to make it clear to colleagues that if we pass a new bill for \nthis year's crops, we are setting ourselves up for another disaster or \nsupplemental bill this fall--even after spending $73.5 billion in new \nfunding for agriculture. Unfortunately--and this is the one I want all \nfarmers, ranchers, and agribusiness to pay attention to--you are going \nto discover that in both House and Senate farm bill proposals, there \nwill be no supplemental AMTA statement, no market loss payment in \nSeptember, as producers have grown accustomed to.\n  Instead, under the countercyclical proposals in the two bills, \nproducers and farmers could receive a portion of their countercyclical \npayment for wheat in December, while other crops would receive no \nassistance until next spring.\n  To put it another way, none of this countercyclical assistance, after \nall the talk we have heard in the last years as to the current farm \nbill--about the lack of a safety net and the need for countercyclical \nassistance--none of this assistance for the 2002 crop will even go out \nuntil the spring of 2003. When farmers discover this, there is going to \nbe an outcry. That is why, in a recent poll, 70 percent of the farmers \nsaid about the supplemental in this crop bill: Put the new farm bill \nunder 2003.\n  We are receiving indications that any agreement on the farm bill will \ninclude much higher loan rates--most likely at the expense of direct \npayments or the countercyclical payment.\n  It was 97 degrees in Dodge City 2 days ago. That is pretty hot for \nDodge. Nearly 50 percent of our Kansas wheat crop has been rated at \nbelow favorable conditions and getting worse. My producers who may have \nno crop to harvest--and that is the condition in Texas, Oklahoma, \nKansas, and Nebraska, moving north--will gain nothing from higher loan \nrates. Loan rates don't help if you don't have a crop.\n  This is a blueprint for disaster. We cannot continue down this path. \nIt appears the farm bill will not be completed this week. We still have \n8 or 10 contentious amendments. They probably should not be part of the \ncommodity title.\n  I am putting colleagues on notice that as soon as the procedural \nsituation allows, I will either ask unanimous consent that S. 2040--the \nsupplemental bill I just referred to, which I previously introduced--be \npulled up and, hopefully, passed by the Senate or I will offer it as an \namendment to any bill under consideration by the Senate.\n  Madam President, it didn't have to go down this road. I hope my \nSenate colleagues serving on the conference--good men and women all--\ncan reach some accommodation by the end of this week and break this \nlogjam or we are going to have to go this route because we will be in a \nworld of trouble in farm country. We already are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the trip to the Mideast by Secretary of State Colin Powell.\n  At the outset, I compliment President Bush for his initiative in \nsending Secretary Powell to the region, and I compliment Secretary \nPowell for his strenuous efforts, even though they have not achieved a \ncease-fire. As I listened to Secretary Powell on his live newscast this \nmorning at about 7 a.m. eastern standard time, it seemed to me that his \ntrip was worthwhile and progress had been made, although it is \ndifficult to quantify progress in the Mideast because of the difficult \nand complex problems that are faced there.\n  I believe Israel has acted in self-defense in moving into Palestinian \nterritories. It is the fundamental duty of a nation to protect its \ncitizens. When Israel has been faced by almost daily suicide bombings, \nthat action is necessary, as viewed by the Israeli authorities.\n  The President did call upon Israel to withdraw several days ago--\nalmost 2 weeks ago--and Israel has to make its judgments and decisions \nas a sovereign nation. I do not think it should be viewed as a rebuke \nto President Bush that Prime Minister Sharon and the Israeli Cabinet \nsaw it differently. President Bush made the judgment call he did as he \nsaw the interests of the United States and the interests of the world \ncommunity. I am sure he was considering Israel's interests in that mix. \nHowever, the judgment is up to Israel as a sovereign nation. It is \nunderstandable that when they have virtually daily suicide bombings, \nthey see it differently so as to protect their citizens.\n  This morning, Secretary Powell referred to an international \nconference, and it is my hope that such a conference would be convened \nat an early time. It is my view that the so-called moderate Arab States \nhave to become involved, representing Palestinian interests, because of \nthe difficulties of relying upon anything Chairman Yasser Arafat has to \nsay.\n  On March 26, 2002, I visited Israel and talked to General Zinni, \nPrime Minister Sharon, and Chairman Arafat. On that day, the three were \nin agreement that they were very close to coming to terms on the so-\ncalled Tenet plan on security arrangements. The very next day there was \na suicide bombing in Netanya at the Passover seder killing 27 Jews at \nprayer and wounding approximately 200 others. The whole situation has \ndeteriorated.\n  In the intervening three weeks, evidence has come to light, \npurportedly bearing the handwriting of Chairman Arafat, that he \npersonally was involved in paying terrorists. I have asked the State \nDepartment for an analysis and the verification that, in fact, it was \nArafat's handwriting, but on this state of the record, it appears that \nwas the case.\n  It is no surprise that Yasser Arafat is a terrorist. He was involved \nin the murder of the United States charge d'affaires in the Sudan in \n1974. He was involved with the murders of Israeli athletes. He was \ninvolved with the murder of Leon Klinghoffer who was pushed off the \nAchille Lauro. It was hoped that a new page had been turned with the \nOslo agreements.\n  I was present on the White House lawn on September 13, 1993, when \nArafat was honored at the White House. I had grave reservations about \nseeing this known terrorist honored at that time, but I watched as \nPresident Clinton put his left arm around Arafat and his right arm \naround Prime Minister Rabin, and the two shook hands. Then, Foreign \nMinister Peres shook hands with Arafat. It seemed to me that if the \nIsraeli leaders were prepared to shake Arafat's hand, where Israel had \nbeen the principal victim of the terrorism, that was something we might \nmove ahead with and try to deal with Arafat.\n\n  I have had occasion to talk to Chairman Arafat on a number of \noccasions over the years. Again, when I met with him on Tuesday, March \n26, I urged him to make a clear-cut, definitive statement denouncing \nterrorism and denouncing suicide bombings. Chairman Arafat said he \nwould, but of course he has never done so.\n  It is a very difficult call to have U.S. negotiators or the Secretary \nof State or anyone meet with Arafat because of the outstanding evidence \nthat he is still involved in terrorism, but that is a call the \nSecretary of State had to make, and I respect that. It seems to me that \nif the peace process is to go forward, it is very difficult for Arafat \nto be a major player or a major participant because he is, simply \nstated, untrustworthy.\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\n  When Prime Minister Rabin made the famous statement that we have to \nnegotiate with our enemies, we have to make peace with our enemies \nbecause we do not need to make peace with our friends, that set a \nparameter in a statesmanlike way for the necessity for Prime Minister \nRabin to deal with Chairman Arafat and for us and others to have had \ntalks with him. However, on this state of the record, where it appears \nthat Arafat has been paying terrorists recently, it seems to me very \nhard to conduct negotiations with Arafat on the expectation that his \ncommitments will be observed.\n  We do have moderate Arab leaders. We have King Abdullah of Jordan, a \nman in his late thirties, heir to King Hussein's good work. We have \nKing Mohamed of Morocco, another able young man in his late thirties \nwho has the potential for leadership. We have President Mubarak of \nEgypt. It seems to me that those are the leaders who ought to be \nconvened.\n  It would be my hope that Saudi Arabia would play a constructive role \nin a peace conference. The Saudis came forward with a proposal which \nhad merit because it was the first time the Saudis have said they would \nnormalize relations with Israel if Israel would recede to the pre-1967 \nborders. I do not think it is possible to recede to those borders, but \nthere had been negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on \nborders, and I think an accommodation would be worked out. However, \nwhen the Saudis agreed to normalize and the Syrians agreed with that, \nthat was a significant step forward.\n  Candidly, it was a major disappointment to see Saudi Arabia have a \ntelethon for the Palestinians and raise, according to press reports, \nsome $92 million. Where was their telethon for the American victims \nfrom September 11th? We know that of the 19 terrorists involved, 15 \nwere from Saudi Arabia, and then Osama bin Laden is a Saudi. It would \nbe my hope that we could expect something more from Saudi Arabia.\n  As we look forward, I was pleased to see Secretary of State Powell \nsay today that Assistant Secretary Burns will remain in the region, \nthat General Zinni will be there to carry on his role, and that CIA \nDirector George Tenet may be going in the near future to work out \nsecurity arrangements so that there is an active role by the United \nStates.\n  I urge the administration to move forward on a conference which would \nbe at the ministerial level, in a sense making the move for Foreign \nMinister Peres to be the negotiator for Israel; a conference which \nhopefully would omit Arafat; a conference which hopefully would have \nJordan, Egypt, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia as principal participants to \nbe guarantors representing the Palestinian efforts and making \narrangements which could be relied upon and could be carried out.\n  It is very important, in conclusion, that the process be continued. \nWhen Secretary Powell went to the Mideast, he undertook very \nsubstantial risks.

Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3132 and 3133\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I welcome a chance to speak about the pending \namendments. There are two amendments that have been proposed related to \nANWR:\n  A first-degree amendment by my friend Senator Murkowski relates to \nthe proposal to open ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge area, to \ndrilling, and the second-degree amendment by Senator Stevens proposes \nto do that but also proposes a major relief program related to the U.S. \nsteel industry primarily. I will try to talk about the ANWR-related \nprovisions of the bill, and particularly the energy aspects of those \ntoday.\n  I oppose opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas \ndevelopment, and there are many reasons why. Some of those reasons \nrelate to the energy security issues with which we are trying to deal. \nSome relate to environmental concerns. I am strongly committed, as I \nbelieve most Members of this body are, to our Nation's energy security, \nand the energy bill we have put forward tries to emphasize domestic \nenergy supply and the importance of energy in national security.\n  However, developing the oil and gas resources in this Coastal Plain \nof the Arctic Refuge, this area known as the 1002 area, is simply not a \nnecessary component of a progressive energy policy for this country. \nThe development of the Coastal Plain has been debated in this country \nand in this Congress for nearly 40 years. Experts still disagree about \nthe actual reserve potential.\n  In May of 1998, the Geological Survey released new estimates of oil \nin the refuge. In that analysis, the USGS's mean estimate of \neconomically recoverable oil on Federal lands within the 1002 area was \nfrom 3.2 to 5.2 billion barrels, and that was assuming a price of $20 \nto $24 per barrel using 1996 dollars. Today the United States consumes \nabout 19 million barrels of oil each day, almost 7 billion barrels of \noil each year.\n  We have a chart I will put up which I think begins to make that \npoint. As this chart indicates, production from the Arctic Refuge would \nnot contribute significantly to solving this problem. I will make the \npoint by reference to this chart.\n  Domestic oil production, as shown on this chart, has been declining \nsince 1970 and continues to decline today. That is this green line \ntoward the bottom of the chart. Total oil demand, on the other hand, in \nthe United States has been going up and is expected to continue going \nup. This chart goes from the year 1950 to the year 2020. We can see \ndemand continuing to go up.\n  This middle line is transportation demand, and one of the points this \nchart makes is that total oil demand is driven directly by \ntransportation demand. I think people can see that pretty readily. This \nlittle red line down in the right-hand side is domestic oil production \nwith ANWR. So we can see that domestic oil production, although it\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\ncontinues to decline, would uptick. For a period starting at about \n2012, we would see an increase in domestic production under ANWR, if \nANWR was open to development. It does not reverse the long-term trend, \nwhich is less U.S. production, more imported oil, but for a relatively \nshort period, considering our Nation's history, we would see an \nincrease in domestic production.\n  The estimate we have from the Energy Information Agency is we would \nsee about a 2 to 3 percent of oil demand in a given year coming out of \nthe ANWR production at the peak of that production. The Energy \nInformation Agency assumes it will take 7 to 12 years before we have \nany production from ANWR.\n  We had a hearing in our Energy Committee. We invited representatives \nof some of the major oil companies that have interests on the North \nSlope, and the representative from ExxonMobile was asked that very \nquestion: How long will it take to bring production to market if we go \nahead and enact legislation? His estimate was 10 to 12 years. He said: \nAssuming there are no legal problems that need to be overcome, it would \ntake as few as 8 years; more likely, it would take something in the \nrange of 10 years.\n\n  According to the Energy Information Agency, peak production would not \noccur for nearly 20 years after initial production. So development \nwould not address the near-term prices or shortages with which people \nare faced.\n  The figures the Energy Information Agency has given me indicate their \nestimate is 54 percent of the oil we consume, as of January, was \nimported oil. That is why I believe clearly we need to address the \nproblem. We need to try to pass comprehensive energy legislation. As I \nsaid before, though, opening the Arctic Refuge is not the answer to \nthis dependence on foreign oil.\n  The recent report that the Energy Information Agency came out with \nhas a quotation in it that I think is very important. This is on page 6 \nof a report that the Energy Information Agency issued in February of \n2002. That was 2 months ago. They say:\n\n       The increase in ANWR production would lead to a decline in \n     the U.S. dependence on foreign oil for the 2002 referenced \n     case. Net imports are projected to supply 62 percent of all \n     oil used in the United States by 2020. Opening ANWR is \n     estimated to reduce the percentage share of our imports to 60 \n     percent.\n\n  I will put this second chart up to make the point very graphically. \nWhat the Energy Information Agency is telling us is there will be less \nneed for us to import oil if we open ANWR, and that reduced need for \nimports would come in about 2012. It would be about 2 percent. Instead \nof importing 62 percent of our oil in the year 2020, we would be \nimporting 60 percent of our oil in the year 2020.\n  The other thing the Energy Information Agency says, which I think is \nvery instructive, if we carry their projections out--and these are all \ntheir projections; this is technically recoverable oil from ANWR as \nthey see it--if these are carried out, by the year 2026 those two lines \ncome together again and we are back in a situation where we are as \ndependent on foreign oil in the year 2027, for example, as we would \nhave been absent any drilling in ANWR.\n  By the year 2030, their projection is we are going to be 75-percent \ndependent upon imports for our oil if ANWR is open for drilling and we \nare going to be 75-percent dependent upon imports of foreign oil if \nANWR is not open for drilling. So from their perspective, if we look at \na 28- or 30-year timeframe, they see absolutely no difference in the \nextent of our dependence whether we open ANWR or we do not open ANWR.\n  Another point I think is important to make is this focus on \ndeveloping the Arctic Refuge has drawn attention away from real \nopportunities we do have to enhance our domestic energy production and \nreduce our reliance on imported oil and help us attain energy security. \nLet me mention some of these opportunities from which I think we have \nhad our attention deflected.\n  First is the development of the abundant gas resources on other parts \nof the North Slope that are already open for development, coupled with \nthe construction of a natural gas transportation system, a pipeline to \nbring that gas from the North Slope down to the lower 48. I will speak \nsome more about each of these in a moment.\n  A second opportunity I think we have not given enough attention to is \nthat production from the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. This is a \nhighly prospective area for recent oil and gas leasing activity, and it \nis one where I think we have great potential to produce additional oil.\n  A third opportunity is new production from lands already under lease \nthat are not being developed. There are many such lands offshore \nLouisiana, Texas, and Alabama, and we need to give more focus to how we \nincentivize production out of those areas. Fourth is the reliance on \nother forms of energy. We have been trying to make that point \nthroughout the debate on this energy bill.\n\n  Long term, if we are going to avoid the projection on this chart, \nwhich is that we will be 75-percent dependent upon foreign sources of \noil by 2030, we have to find alternative sources of energy as a \nsubstitute for this imported oil. That needs to be a very high priority \nfor our research and development effort and for the provisions we have \nin this bill.\n  I believe the most important energy issue in Alaska is not the Arctic \nRefuge--although hearing the debate one would think that was the \ncentral issue as to whether we did what should be done to meet our \nenergy needs in the future. The most important issue is Arctic gas. The \nNorth Slope of Alaska contains rich supplies of natural gas. There is \nmore than 32 million cubic feet of natural gas immediately available in \nexisting oil fields in the Alaskan North Slope. The total natural gas \nestimates are in the area of 100 trillion cubic feet. We do not need \nnew legislative authority in order to produce this gas.\n  However, currently, the natural gas that is produced with oil on the \nNorth Slope is being reinjected because there is no transportation \nsystem, there is no pipeline with which to bring that gas from the \nNorth Slope to the lower 48. Congress dealt with the issue in 1976 when \nit enacted the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System Act. Responding \nto the energy crisis of that decade, Congress called for the immediate \nconstruction of a gas transportation system and an expedited process \nfor accomplishing that goal. Due to changed economics, due to other \nintervening factors, there have been more than two decades that have \npassed and we still do not have any pipeline. We do not have any kind \nof transportation to bring that gas to the lower 48.\n  The energy bill pending in the Senate tries to address the issue. The \nHouse-passed bill does not try to address the issue. This bill does. We \nwould increase the supply of domestically produced natural gas to U.S. \nconsumers by expediting the construction of the Alaska natural gas \npipeline. It provides for streamlined procedures for permits, for \nrights-of-way and certificates needed for the U.S. segments of the \npipeline, as well as financial incentives to reduce the risks of the \nproject.\n  We have had a lot of discussion about jobs as part of this debate \nabout ANWR. This natural gas pipeline I am talking about, which is \ndistinct from ANWR, the natural gas pipeline creates more than 400,000 \nnew jobs. This is in contrast to the Congressional Research Service \nestimate of 60 to 130,000 jobs that would be created by opening the \nArctic Refuge.\n  Senator Reed, who chairs the Joint Economic Committee, released a new \nreport last month estimating that opening the Arctic Refuge results in \nthe creation of 65,000 jobs nationwide by 2020, an employment gain of \nless than one-tenth of 1 percent of the U.S. workforce as a whole. \nBuilding the pipeline would not only create thousands of new jobs but \nalso provide a huge opportunity for the steel industry. The project \nrequires up to 3,500 miles of pipe, 5 million tons of steel. The Senate \nbill encourages the use of North American steel and union labor in the \nconstruction of the pipeline. The total cost of the pipeline would be \nin the range of $15 to $20 billion. I strongly support going forward \nwith that and putting whatever we can in this legislation to encourage \nits construction.\n  In addition to these enormous supplies of natural gas from existing \noilfields, there is another substantial opportunity to obtain \nadditional oil and gas from the Alaska North Slope. This is the \nNational Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. We have a chart that shows\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\nsomething of which most Americans are not aware. The map shows a large \narea, the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska (NPRA), which is the \norange area on this chart. It is a very large area. This is the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge and includes the 1002 area. There are 23 \nmillion acres of public land in the NPRA. It is approximately the size \nof Indiana. It was created to secure the Nation's petroleum reserves. \nIt is administered by the Bureau of Land Management which, in 1999, \noffered 4 million acres in the northeast portion of the NPRA. They \noffered 4 million acres in that area for leasing. The result was very \nsuccessful. It was a very successful lease sale. There was a high level \nof industry interest, with over $104 million in bonus bids for 133 \nleases on 867,000 acres in this NPRA area.\n  Exploration drilling has occurred. The industry has made major finds. \nA second lease sale is scheduled to take place in June of this year in \nanother part of the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. The planning is \nalso being undertaken to open additional portions of the NPRA after the \nsale that takes place in June. This is an opportunity that does not \nrequire any change in the law in order for drilling to go forward. As \nthe map indicates, there are vast areas of Federal and State land on \nthe North Slope that are already open to oil and gas leasing and \ndevelopment. The yellow portions on the chart are already under lease.\n  In addition, under the current 5-year leasing plan, the State of \nAlaska plans an aggressive leasing program in the areas between the \nNPRA and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Not only do I believe these parts of the North Slope other than the \nArctic Refuge can contribute significantly to meeting our oil and gas \nneeds, there are Federal lands currently under lease elsewhere that are \nalso not being produced. Let me show a chart with our Outer Continental \nShelf off the coast of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. This chart \nshows 32 million acres in the Outer Continental Shelf that have already \nbeen leased by the government to oil companies for exploration and \ndevelopment that have not yet been developed. We do not need to pass a \nlaw in order to have drilling in those areas, either.\n  In addition to my belief there are many other good opportunities to \nincrease domestic oil and gas production, and I mentioned some here, I \nam particularly concerned this controversy about the Arctic Refuge \ndiverts attention from an important underlying goal which we need to \nhave in this bill, and that is to diversify our energy mix.\n  What we are trying to do in the bill to support more research and \ndevelopment, to support development of alternative sources of energy, \nin the long run will do more to solve our national energy problems than \nwhat we have done so far.\n  I will comment for a minute on the issue of CAFE standards because \nthat has come into the debate in various ways. I will show another \nchart that shows why, in my view, we should have gone ahead and \nrequired higher CAFE standards for vehicles. This chart shows a blue \nline, which is net imports of oil, given current law. The green line \nindicates net imports if we open ANWR to drilling. It shows the amount \nrequired to be imported for a period of 20 years is reduced under that \nscenario. Then if we had net imports with CAFE, had we raised the CAFE \nstandards, we would see that net imports would not only be more than \nthe imports would be in the case of drilling in ANWR but they would \nstay lower. That is the advantage of it. In the case of drilling in \nANWR, you have a relatively short-term benefit which goes away once the \noil is used up. In the case of CAFE standards, you have a continuing \nbenefit for the indefinite future.\n\n  I do think we need to revisit that issue. I hope we can. I hope we \ncan get some support from the administration to do something more \nsignificant.\n  I received a letter--I know my colleague, Senator Murkowski, had it \nprinted in the Record yesterday afternoon--from Secretary of Energy, \nSpencer Abraham, our former colleague, for whom I have great respect. \nHe was citing the various things he is doing as Secretary of Energy to \nhelp us reduce our dependence on foreign oil. I gather he sent this \nletter to all Members of Congress. He said:\n\n       I will be meeting this week with the American Automobile \n     Association--AAA--to identify ways to encourage Americans to \n     drive smarter, to prepare their cars to operate more \n     efficiently to save fuel and money.\n\n  I am not opposed to him meeting with the AAA to encourage Americans \nto drive smarter, but that is not an adequate response to the energy \nchallenges this country faces. We need to do better. This \nadministration should be supporting increased CAFE standards. It should \nbe supporting provisions of this bill to encourage efficiency in the \nuse of energy and not just depend upon Americans to drive smarter.\n  You can put a little more air in your tires. You can, perhaps, get \nyour car tuned up. But the truth is, if the car is manufactured to run \nat 12 or 14 miles per gallon--14 miles for each gallon that you buy--\nyou cannot do a whole lot to solve that problem.\n  I know there are others who want to speak. There will be \nopportunities later for me to add to my comments. Let me conclude by \nsaying that opening the Arctic Refuge is not, in my view, good \nenvironmental policy. More importantly, it is far from necessary as \npart of a national energy policy. Oil and gas development on the \nCoastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge does little for \nour Nation's energy security. If you take the long-term view, which is \n2030, it does nothing to deal with our energy security needs.\n  It is a diversion from the efforts we should be taking as a country \nto address the important subject of energy, a subject that is crucial \nto our economy, to our way of life and our future. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in the effort to oppose opening this area for drilling.\n  I believe Senator Breaux was expecting to speak at this time in favor \nof one or both of the amendments, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow the distinguished \nchairman of the Energy Committee. Although we differ on the conclusion, \nI certainly have the utmost respect for the good work he has done in \nbringing this bill to the floor, along with the Senator from Alaska, \nMr. Murkowski, in an effort to try to develop something we do not have \nin this country and that we desperately need, and that is an energy \npolicy that is good for America.\n  The energy policy we have--or probably do not have--is probably good \nfor OPEC but it is not good for America. Why do I say it is good for \nOPEC? Because the facts are that we import about 57 to 58 percent of \nthe oil we use in this country. It comes not from America, not from \nallies in Canada, or good friends in Mexico, but about 58 percent of \nthe oil and gas we use in this country for everything we need, from \nagriculture to cars and trucks to our residences being heated in the \nwinter and cooled in the summer--that 58 percent of the oil and gas we \nneed for all those services which are critically important to the \nUnited States and every citizen of this country does not come from \nAmerica. It comes from countries where, if people in this country did \nwhat they did in their country, they would go to the penitentiary.\n  What am I talking about? Every few weeks people in OPEC, the sheiks \nand the people who control the energy in those countries, meet in fancy \nresort hotels around the world, they meet in secret, and they determine \nhow much they are going to price the oil that America has to buy. They \nregularly and openly fix prices. If companies that are providers in \nthis country did that in America, they would go to the penitentiary. \nThat is clear. It is illegal. Yet we as a nation have accepted that \npolicy on the part of the principal supplier of oil for our country.\n  We do not control our destiny; we do not control our future, as long \nas we rely on people who fix prices to provide this country with the \ningredients we need to be a strong and secure and prosperous nation. \nThat has to come to an end.\n  It is not going to be easy. There is not one answer. There is a \nmultitude of answers which we have to incorporate in an energy bill \nwhich is balanced, which provides help and assistance for new forms of \nenergy, for alternate forms of energy.\n  I voted for $6 billion worth of tax incentives for new forms of \nenergy. Many people in Louisiana think it is ludicrous that I am doing \nthat. When I talk\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\nabout wind power and chicken manure being converted into energy, people \nin my State say: What are you doing? Why don't you try to encourage oil \nand gas production? I say: Yes, that is important, but alternative \nsources of energy are also important.\n  The point I make about where we get our energy supplies is just this \nsimple. If we were dependent for, say--think about it--58 percent of \nthe food we eat in this country, suppose it came from a foreign source \nwhich was not very dependable. People would be marching in the streets \nin Washington, saying you have to stop that policy. It is insane. We \ncan't depend on foreign countries for our food. It is essential to our \nnational security. You cannot allow a policy which gets agricultural \nproducts from countries on which we cannot depend. People would march \nin the streets--and rightfully so.\n  That is exactly what we do when it comes to energy. We are satisfied. \nWe are fat, we are happy, until they turn the faucet off just a little \nbit. It happened in 1973 and it brought this country to our knees. We \nhad long lines at filling stations. We had lack of supplies. We had \npeople getting in fights trying to buy gasoline so they could take \ntheir children to the doctor and to school and run commerce in this \ncountry. We saw what they could do. At that time we were probably 30-\npercent dependent on imported oil. Today it is about 58 percent. We \nlook around the world and the circumstances today are much worse than \nthey were in the 1970s.\n\n  There has been an attempted coup in Venezuela, which is one of our \nlargest suppliers. The President of that country is in bed with Castro \nand Libya and Iraq, and we are dependent on them for much of the energy \nsupply in America. Purchase of it comes from Louisiana where we refine \nit in Lake Charles. Is that a secure source? Of course not. They just \nhad a revolution. The guy they kicked out is back. He is not \nparticularly a friend of the United States when he is giving oil to \nCuba at discounted prices and threatens to cut it off to us at any \nmoment.\n  Getting oil from Iraq, is that a stable source? The Middle East \nsituation today is as volatile as it has been in generations.\n  So the point I would make to start this discussion is we, in these \nUnited States, have to be more reasonable, more balanced in how we \napproach the solution. There is no absolute, safe method of achieving \nenergy independence that doesn't have some risk. Let's admit that up \nfront. That is, of course, true.\n  But we have a policy in this country when it comes to oil and gas. \nThink about it. You could not drill offshore anywhere on the east \ncoast, from Maine to Key West. It is all locked in--or, rather, locked \nout from any development, although there are potential reserves in \nthose areas that are substantial.\n  If you look on the west coast of this country, you can go all the way \nfrom Washington State down the west coast, all the way down to Mexico \nand you cannot have any new leasing in any of those areas whatsoever. \nWe did that because Republican administrations and Democratic \nadministrations, Republican Congresses and Democratic Congresses, have \ntaken all those areas and said: Don't do it here. Not in my backyard. \nThe problem is the backyard is the entire west coast of the United \nStates. Don't do it in my backyard on the east coast. The problem is it \nis the entire east coast of America.\n  Some have said, and some of the environmental groups have said, ``Do \nit off Louisiana,'' as if we were not important from their perspective, \nand as if we didn't have some of the most valuable resources in terms \nof wetlands, fin fish, birds, oysters, shrimp, and all of the fur-\nbearing animals that we have in the very fragile wetlands where we lose \n25 square miles a year because of erosion. But they are saying: Do it \nthere. We are doing it there. We will continue to do it there because \nwe believe this is a national issue and we should make our contribution \ntowards energy security. We have done it for 60 years off our coast and \non our shores. There have been mistakes. There have been problems, but \nwe have learned from those mistakes. And today it is much more secure \nthan bringing oil in rusty-bucket ships that leak and spill oil on the \noceans of this country. Less than 2 percent of the oil that finds its \nway into the oceans of America and the world come from offshore \ndevelopment. Most of it comes in tanker discharge, industrial runoff, \nand other sources, and natural seepage, but not from offshore \nproduction activities--less than 2 percent, according to the National \nAcademy of Sciences. I think we have shown it can be done safely and in \na fashion that protects the environment.\n  There is no place I would rather fish in America than the Gulf of \nMexico. We have literally hundreds and hundreds of platforms that have \nwells, exploration wells, and production wells that produce natural gas \nand oil for the rest of this country. We have a pipeline system that \ntakes natural gas and sends it to Chicago, New York, New England, or to \nthe west coast, and all over this country, coming from one particular \nsource in the gulf where there is a 60-year record of it being done \nsafely. Despite that, when we tried to have additional leasing in the \ngulf, Congress tried to stop that even.\n\n  President Clinton, to his credit, proposed a compromise called lease \nsale 181 in the Gulf of Mexico. To my regret, the Bush administration \ncut that by two-thirds. It was a proposed lease sale that was two-\nthirds less than President Clinton had proposed in the Gulf of Mexico. \nAnd this Congress tried to eliminate it completely because they did not \nwant it in their backyard.\n  From where is it going to come? From where is it going to come, if \nnot from a domestic source right here in this country where we have \nshown we can do it safely, in a secure fashion, and in an \nenvironmentally sensitive fashion? I think there are many parts of the \ncountry that are doing their share.\n  The concept that because it is a wildlife refuge and somehow we are \nnot supposed to be able to do anything on it other than look at caribou \nis ridiculous. Here are the wildlife management and wetland management \ndistricts around the country where we have production already. There \nare 9 facilities in Texas and 12 in Louisiana. Every single wildlife \nrefuge in Louisiana--which has some of the best in the world, the best \nin the country, and which has more wildlife features and more fragile \necology than the North Slope--12 separate production facilities on \nwildlife refuges, one of them owned by the Audubon Society, which has \nproduction on their own refuge from which they get royalties, strongly \nsupport it, but nowhere else.\n  I think it has been shown that, in fact, you can have production, if \nit is done properly and in a sensitive fashion--and in wildlife \nrefuges, as well as in areas that are not. It can be done. It has been \ndone and it has been done safely.\n  This is an example of the type of facility in Louisiana. Look at how \nsmall of a print that is. In Alaska, there are 19 million acres in \nANWR. When we are talking about reserving a portion of that 19 million \nacres, which is less than the size of Dulles Airport, to do one type of \noperation, of course, it makes an imprint. Is it huge? Of course not. \nIs it dangerous? Of course not. Can it be done safely? The answer is \nyes. History has shown us that it can be done in an environmentally \nsafe fashion. We would not need that, if we were not importing 58 \npercent of our oil from countries that are not safe and not reliable.\n  If we had enough energy production from other sources, then we would \nnot need to do it in the wetlands because we would have more than we \nneeded right here in this country. But that is not the case when we are \nimporting 58 percent from places that fix prices and which have us \nliterally over a barrel when it comes to having enough energy to run \nthe cars, to run industry, and agricultural entities in this country. \nWe can't afford not to look at developing it here in this country. That \nis the point I would make.\n  There are some who say we will have a problem with the caribou up \nthere. Caribou aren't endangered. They are like a bunch of cows. There \nare more of them now than there were years before. In addition to that, \nwe are not damaging the lifestyle of caribou by having some energy \ndevelopment in the same area they happen to be walking through once or \ntwice a year.\n  Some say: You can't do anything up there because of the caribou. They \nhave nice pictures of caribou. They say: Don't do anything to damage \nthe\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\ncaribou. The caribou are more plentiful in that part of the country \nthan they were in Prudhoe Bay. They are doing quite well, thank you \nvery much.\n  For those who said, ``Well, you are going to interfere with their \nlifestyle,'' look at this photograph. These are not dummies that \nsomebody put out on the North Slope. The Senator from Alaska knows that \narea quite well. It is his State. These are living, breathing, \nmultiplying caribou within a stone's throw of a production facility in \nAlaska. Does this look like the caribou lifestyle is being interfered \nwith? Does it look as if they are not happy and content, grazing near \nthe pipeline and production facility?\n  Some will make the argument you can't do it because the caribou walk \nacross this area twice a year, they might calve, and it might disrupt \ntheir lifestyle.\n  Importing 58 percent of our energy is disrupting the lifestyle of \nAmericans, and it is threatening the security of the United States.\n  We don't want to get into another Afghanistan or have the Middle East \nshut off the oil supply to this country or ask how we are going to \ndefend ourselves and be protectors of the world when we are buying oil \nfrom people who have turned against us because of conflicts with \nIslamic portions of this world.\n  We have to be secure. We have to be confident that we can depend on \nenergy. We ought to do whatever is necessary to produce it in this \ncountry instead of bending over on our knees saying, please, OPEC, \ndon't disrupt our energy supplies; please, OPEC, don't charge us too \nmuch; please, please, please.\n  You can't say that when you don't have someone to back it up. What \nare we going to do? Threaten not to buy their oil? We do not have that \nluxury because we are not doing enough to produce energy right here in \nAmerica.\n  For those people who say, ``Don't drill in ANWR,'' get off the \ncaribou argument. They made that argument about the Prudhoe Bay \npipeline; it was going to kill all of the caribou; they will move \nsomewhere else; they weren't going to have calves. That has not proven \nto be correct by one iota. The caribou are there and they are thriving. \nThat simply, in my opinion, is not a legitimate argument as to what we \nshould be looking at. We should be looking at it from the standpoint of \nsafety and making sure it has the utmost of environmental equipment \nthat is needed to make sure it can be done safely. I would suggest that \nit doesn't matter how we protect it. It is a lot safer than importing \nenergy that we are bringing in by tankers from around the world.\n  Some have said that in order to get this measure passed we have to \nsweeten the pot for some of the steelworkers who lost their jobs. I am \nnot for that. That is not what the issue should be.\n  Some have said maybe our friends in the Middle East and the Israelis \nwill help and maybe we can get enough votes to pass this measure. It \nshould pass on its own.\n  I would vote for trying to get something good from the standpoint of \nenergy security. It should pass or fail on its own merits. We ought to \nbe able to look and decide whether it is a good idea.\n  When I was back in the House in the 1970s, we wrote the Alaska Lands \nAct. We looked at this area. We set aside the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge with 19 million acres with the clear thought that we ought to \ntake a small portion of it and look to see whether we could possibly do \nmore for energy. The USGS tells us that it equals a 30-year supply of \noil coming from Saudi Arabia.\n  Some say there isn't much up there. We will not know until we take a \nlook. The USGS tells us that it is potentially a 30-year supply--the \nequivalent of what we get from Saudi Arabia. That is not insignificant. \nThat is a huge amount. Some say it is a 1-day supply. It is 1 day if we \ncut off all other sources. If you look at it from the standpoint of \npotentially how much is there, a 30-year potential is very significant \nconsidering what we get from Saudi Arabia.\n  We may not get this thing done. We may continue to say: Don't do it \nin my backyard; don't do it on the east coast, don't do it on the west \ncoast, don't do it in the Gulf of Mexico, don't do it--don't, don't.\n  But my point is simply this: If not there, where? For somebody who \nthinks it is better to import it from the Middle East rather than \nproduce it in our country with our own people running the program and \nwith our environmental laws in effect, I suggest that is not a good \ntradeoff.\n  This amendment should pass. We should go about the business of \nbringing energy security to this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask the Senator from Louisiana: Some people have \nsuggested that the better answer is, rather than opening ANWR to \ndrilling, we should simply concentrate on the Gulf of Mexico and put up \nevery possible lease sale. I think that lease sales are already taking \nplace in 2,000 to 3,000 feet of water. And the industry has had a very \nsuccessful effort in producing there. It requires a great deal of \ntechnology.\n\n  But I wonder if the Senator from Louisiana believes this is a better \nsolution than exploration in other areas of the country, where States \nsuch as Louisiana or Alaska want the development to occur?\n  Mr. BREAUX. From a selfish standpoint, I could say: Don't do it \nanywhere else. Just do it in Louisiana. It creates jobs. It creates \nincome. And it creates infrastructure. We are happy to support that \nactivity. If I looked at it from only a parochial standpoint, I would \nsay: Only do it in the Gulf of Mexico. Don't do it anywhere else. But \nthat is not in the best interest of the country.\n  You have to do it in the gulf, but you have to do it in other places \nwhere oil may be present. One of the most promising and potentially the \nlargest supplies, other than the Gulf of Mexico, is, in fact, the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  So if you look at it as national policy, it is not enough that \nLouisiana and Texas do it. Other States have to be involved; and ANWR \nis one of those sites. We cannot keep saying ``don't do it here'' and \n``don't do it there'' and ``don't, don't, don't.'' The fact is, we \nought to do it where we can find available energy. I would say ANWR is \none of those.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator would show us that particular \nchart because I think it depicts the statement that has been made \ncontinually: ``Well, not in my backyard.''\n  Mr. BREAUX. That is it. It is easy to say: Don't do it in my own \nbackyard. I want to be with environmentalists. And that is fine, but at \nsome point you have to say: We have to have a balanced program.\n  I talked to some environmentalists about ANWR, and I said: I tell you \nwhat, what if we limit it to 1 acre? Would you be satisfied if we only \ndid it on 1 acre in Alaska? The answer was: No. The fact is, they don't \nwant to do it on 1 acre or 20 acres. They just don't want to do it \nbecause it becomes a symbol of what they stand for. And I understand \nthat.\n  But we are in a crisis in this country. I am saying you have to have \na balanced approach. This is what has occurred around natural gas, the \ncleanest burning fuel, the least threatening in this country. People \ndon't like nuclear because it is dangerous. Natural gas is dangerous. \nThey don't like coal because it is dirty. Natural gas is the cleanest \nfuel we have.\n  Look at what has happened. As I show you this on the map I have in \nthe Chamber, this area is subject to no restrictions. You cannot drill \nfor potentially 21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas on the west coast \nbecause it is all blocked off. There are 31 trillion cubic feet of \npotential natural gas reserves on the east coast. You cannot drill a \nwell anywhere there.\n  There is lease sale 181, which we just fought in this Congress, where \npeople want to say: Don't do anything here. There are 24 trillion cubic \nfeet of potential natural gas reserves, and Florida is importing over \n90 percent of the gas they use from other sources. They do not produce \nbut a trickle of their gas in Florida. They import over 90 percent, and \nthey say: Don't do it off my pretty beaches. Don't do it off my \nmillion-dollar houses. Go do it somewhere else. There isn't anyplace \nelse.\n  The only place we are doing it is shown here on the map. So look at \nthe\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\ninterior of the country. We have more places where you can't look for \noil and gas than you have where oil and gas potential exists.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Would my friend from Louisiana yield for a question?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Sure.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I don't want to argue with the Senator's basic point. I \nam in general agreement with him, that we ought to be drilling some \nplaces where we are not drilling today. But the chart the Senator has \nseems to indicate you are not drilling in northwestern Mexico. That is \none of the largest gasfields in this country, the San Juan Basin. We \nare drilling at an amazing rate up there. I support the drilling that \ngoes on there, by and large.\n  I do not know about all the rest of the Rocky Mountain region, if \nthat map is intending to indicate you cannot drill in it. But an awful \nlot of our State is being drilled in, and appropriately so.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I just say, referring to the map, the access restrictions \nI am talking about on the coast clearly are a total prohibition. And \nthis is a total prohibition. This has restrictions on access to those \nareas. For some of these areas, it should be.\n  But what we are talking about today is not access restrictions to \nANWR; we are talking about a total prohibition on ANWR. That is not \naccess restrictions. That is a lot further.\n  If we want to pass a bill that says we are going to carefully \ncoordinate how you can get into that area, how you can exit that area, \nwhat you can do in that area, that is one thing; but the legislation we \nhave in the current law of this country is: no access. That is not \naccess restrictions; that is totally no access to areas that have \npotentially huge amounts of energy.\n  Again, I would say, don't do ANWR if we don't need it. But anytime \nthis country is importing 58 percent of our energy, I would suggest we \nneed it. Are we importing 58 percent of our energy because we like to \ndo that? Of course not. We are over a barrel paying OPEC prices, which \nthey fix every 6 weeks.\n  I think, if we are going to have a national energy policy, everybody \nhas to come to the table, not just half of the equation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin, if I may, by first of all \nsaying it is my intention to answer each and every one of the \nassertions just made by the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from \nAlaska. There is ample proof that those of us who oppose drilling in \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge are strongly in favor of drilling in many \nother parts of this country and are strongly in favor of a policy which \nkeeps the United States on the cutting edge of energy production.\n  In a few moments I will show how we are producing extraordinary \namounts of natural gas, almost all the coal we consume, huge amounts of \noil and other sources of energy, and, in fact, we are building new \npowerplants all across this country.\n  None of us are standing here with our head in the sand arguing that \nwe should not continue to produce energy. Moreover, I think the \narguments made underscore the fundamental difference in the approach by \nthose of us who believe there is a different energy future for the \nUnited States that does not require us to do injury to something we \nhave set aside for a purpose.\n  Beginning with a Republican President, and going through a series of \nPresidents over the last 25, 30 years, there has been an honoring of an \nethic in the United States that suggests that the concept of a preserve \nshould be exactly that.\n  My colleague, a moment ago, said: What would happen if we said, drill \nin only 1 acre? Well, everyone understands that if you begin with 1 \nacre, it does not stay at 1 acre. It will progress. The first acre is \nthe violation of the notion of set-aside. The first acre is the \nviolation of the concept of pristineness. The first acre is the \ndestruction of the concept of an arctic wildlife refuge that is absent \nany kind of industrialization.\n  My arguments against drilling in ANWR are not based on the caribou. \nThat was a wonderful picture, a great discussion of caribou, but that \nis not the principal argument here. It is interesting, however--and I \nwill show, a little later, that our own Fish & Wildlife Service--I have \nheard my colleagues referring to radical environmental groups. The \npeople who are cautioned against this are the administration's own \nfunctionaries who worked on this for years. The Fish & Wildlife Service \nfinds there would be problems with respect to the ecosystem. The U.S. \nGeologic Survey has serious questions with almost all of the numbers \nthat have been put forward by the proponents.\n  So I begin at the beginning. I want to try to lay a record out here \nthat I think is clear and, I hope, understandable and, I hope, in the \nend, compelling about why it is inappropriate to drill in the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge. But I do want to say, the two visions are different \nvisions of the energy future of our country.\n  I honor what the Senator from Louisiana said. He is a strong advocate \nfor his State. He is a terrific Senator. And he is right, we do need to \ndo more drilling. I am in favor of more drilling. We should do more \ndrilling in the deep water Gulf of Mexico, which Lord John Brown, the \nCEO, chairman of British Petroleum, says is the most significant \noilfield unexploited in the world, which is where at least British \nPetroleum would like to put its energy, its efforts, not in ANWR.\n  But let's begin at the beginning.\n  Our colleagues have come to the floor and suggested to our fellow \nSenators that this is the first time in history that a ``national \nsecurity'' issue has been filibustered.\n  First of all, one could make a serious argument about the degree to \nwhich this is, in fact, a national security issue. But I will accept \nthe question of how much oil we import. The question of American \ndependency on oil is legitimately a concern of the United States. But \nit is not addressed by drilling in ANWR, No. 1, and, No. 2, the record \nshows clearly that this is not the first time such an issue has been \nfilibustered.\n  If ANWR is important to the energy national security of the United \nStates because it would affect how much oil might be available or how \nmuch oil we are importing, then CAFE standards are equally a national \nsecurity issue for our country. In fact, CAFE standards are a far \nbetter response to national security because even the oil companies \nwill tell us they can't produce oil from ANWR for anywhere from 7 to 10 \nyears.\n  When my colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and suggest to us \nthat the crisis in the Middle East is a reason to drill in ANWR, that \nis a misleading argument because no oil will flow from ANWR, given the \npermitting, lawsuit, developmental processes, as I will show later, \nuntil from 7 to 10 years from now. And you don't even get to the peak \nproduction until somewhere, perhaps, around 2020.\n  That said, if you put CAFE standards in place, you would have a much \nfaster response to the oil. You would get 1 million barrels saved in a \ndecade, and that would grow exponentially. In ANWR, as you drill, you \nlose the oil. You reach a point of peak production, and then it starts \nto go down. But if you put CAFE standards in place, it grows and grows \nthrough the years. So in fact, CAFE standards result in three times the \nsavings of ANWR.\n  I don't want to get into a CAFE standards argument. That is not why I \nam here. But CAFE standards is as much a national security issue for \nthe United States as the question of whether or not we drill in ANWR. I \nwill show later how ANWR doesn't even affect the total amount of oil on \nwhich we are dependent except for this tiny little sliver that is \nbarely discernable on a graph.\n  The point is, our colleagues have suggested this is the first time. I \nwant to say this because the accuracy that disappears in this process \nis very important. The fact is, in the 101st Congress, second session--\nI was a member of that Senate; I remember the vote--we had a motion to \ninvoke cloture on the Motor Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Act. It failed. In \nother words, it was filibustered. It was filibustered, and 42 Senators \nmanaged to prevent us from passing the effort by Senator Richard Bryant \nof Nevada to have CAFE standards, which is a national security issue.\n  Among those Senators who voted to continue the filibuster and not \nallow us\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\nto put CAFE standards in place were both Senators from Alaska and the \nSenator from Texas, who have asserted that we must allow a straight \nvote on ANWR. Let's dispense with the national security argument, and \nthere is further reason to dispense with it because of the amount of \noil we have in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.\n  I want to show this chart. This is the world supply of oil production \nversus the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. If the Presiding Officer is having \ntrouble seeing ANWR, that is because here it is. It is this yellow line \nat the very bottom of the chart versus all the oil production of the \nworld.\n  The United States of America only has 3 percent of the oil reserves \nof the world, including ANWR, including the Gulf of Mexico, our \nnational monuments, all of our oil. Every single year, the United \nStates of America uses 25 percent of the world's oil. I don't know any \nchild in school who can't quickly figure out that if we only own 3 \npercent but we use 25 percent of the world's production, we have a \nproblem.\n  We have a serious problem.\n  You can't drill your way out of this problem. If you drill all the \noil in ANWR, you still face a fundamental issue which is the United \nStates of America is overly dependent on foreign oil and is growing \nmore and more so.\n\n  In 1973, when we first met the cartel's oil crisis, we had a \ndependency on foreign oil of about 35 percent. Yet we responded, \nsupposedly, with CAFE standards, with more production. Today, we are \nabout 55 or 56 percent dependent on the rest of the world. And in the \nnext few years, we will grow to 60 percent. Does anybody in their right \nmind believe if we depend today on foreign oil for 60 percent of our \noil, that ANWR, which is only a fraction of the 3 percent that we \npossess, somehow has the ability to make a difference to the United \nStates? The answer is no. No, you can't. You just can't squeeze that \nenough.\n  So there are two competing visions here: A vision of the status quo, \na vision that is similar to the one that is reflected in a willingness \nto avoid doing anything about global warming, even though every \nscientist says global warming is a problem; a willingness to ignore the \nneed to be involved in the realities of science versus our desire just \nto go along the way it is and not upset the equilibrium in any way \nwhatsoever.\n  The fact is that about 70 percent of America's oil use goes to \ntransportation. When I hear my colleagues talk about our terrible \ndependency on the Middle East for oil, ANWR doesn't end the terrible \ndependency on the Middle East for oil. I just heard the Senator from \nLouisiana say: Gosh, it would be great if we could vote in a way that \nwe are not the hostages of Middle Eastern countries that can cut off \nour oil.\n  Well, yes, it would be great. But voting for the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge doesn't do that. It leaves you still 60-percent dependent on \nforeign oil. And any cartel, any terrorist, any country that wants to \nhold the United States hostage will hold us hostage until we liberate \nourselves from our oil gluttony, dependency, whatever you want to call \nit.\n  Those two visions are the vision of the status quo over here, and a \nvision over here of those who believe there is a different energy \nfuture for the United States.\n  I quickly say as an outline, my sense of that energy future for the \nUnited States begins with four important principles. Those principles \nspeak directly to what the Senator from Louisiana just said about \nwhether we are willing to drill.\n  No. 1, absent an exhaustion of remedies and a life-threatening threat \nto the United States, absent that, the United States should do nothing \nthat doesn't make economic sense. Principle No. 1: It makes economic \nsense to do what we choose to do absent some life-threatening challenge \nthat is coming down the road.\n  Principle No. 2: We should commit ourselves again, given the same \ncaveat, absent a threat that we have just got to respond to, we should \ncommit ourselves that the choices we make do not diminish the quality \nof life of any American at all. So it makes economic sense. We don't \ndiminish the quality of life. We can make those choices now.\n  Principle No. 3: All of us who are opposed to the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge must have the courage to stand up and say we are going to be \ndependent on oil still for 30 to 50 years or more in this country. It \nwill take that long to make the energy transition, to make the \ntransportation transition. And what we must do is put in place a set of \npolicies that begin to accelerate our capacity in an economically \nviable way to begin to make that transition to this new energy future.\n  That is alternatives and renewables and the hydrogen fuel cell and \nhybrid cars and a host of other things.\n  I don't know why my colleagues are so pessimistic about America's \ncapacity to meet a challenge through the skill and creativity of our \nentrepreneurs.\n  When we put our entrepreneurial skill and energy to work in the \nUnited States of America, there is nothing we can't do. We have proven \nit--when we went to space. We proved it in the Manhattan Project when \nwe needed to create a response to the terror of the Axis Powers and win \nWorld War II. We have proven it time and again.\n  I believe that just as President Kennedy put a challenge to the \ncountry saying we are going to go to the Moon in 10 years--not knowing, \nincidentally, if we could in fact get there, not knowing if it was in \nfact achievable, but telling America that the reason we are going to do \nthis is because it is difficult. And we did it.\n  In 1990, when everybody said, oh, it is going to cost $8 billion to \nreduce the amount of sulfur in our air as part of the Clean Air Act and \nwe cannot do it in that time period, what happened, Mr. President? We \ndid it faster than we ever thought we would or could, and we did it for \na cost not of $8 billion, or for $4 billion, which the environmental \npeople thought it would cost; we did it for $2 billion, and we did it \nfaster.\n  The reason we did that was that no one was able to factor in the \nexponential benefits of technology, the rate at which one technological \ndiscovery spurned the next technological discovery. The way, in fact, \nthat the serious commitment of the United States could do it invited \nprivate capital markets to make the decision that, hey, that is worth \nthe investment. It is the old field of dreams: Build it, and they will \ncome. We decided we were going to build it, and they came, and we did \nit faster.\n  My colleagues are very pessimistic about the ability of the United \nStates to bring online all of these other capacities to do these things \nmore efficiently, cleanly, and effectively, and we can create tens of \nthousands, millions of jobs in this country, putting people to work in \nproduction for other parts of the world that also have the same demands \nand needs.\n  Again, I repeat, we cannot drill our way out of America's energy \nchallenge. We have to invent our way out of this challenge. We should \nbegin now to encourage the greatest laboratories, our universities, our \nventure capitalists, the private sector, in the strongest way possible \nto begin to move us to this new energy future where America is not \ndependent upon these other countries.\n  I am particularly sensitive when I hear my colleague say we don't \nwant our young men and women sent off to these countries and put at \nrisk. Let me tell you, I think one of the things I have fought for as \nhard as anything in the Senate is common sense about how we wage our \nwars and where and when we put people at risk.\n  Mr. President, this is a false promise to America. The sons and \ndaughters of America are more at risk every day that we remain \nprisoners of this equation where more than 45 percent of the world's \noil supply is in Saudi Arabia. There is nothing we can do about that. \nWe don't have as much. No matter what we try to do, we won't be able to \nrepeat it. Moreover, the amount of oil in ANWR will not affect the \nprice of oil globally at all. It doesn't create the kind of \nindependence we want.\n  This is a statement of Lee Raymond, chairman and chief executive \nofficer of ExxonMobil Corporation. He is in the oil industry. He knows \nwhat he is talking about:\n\n       The idea that this country can ever again be energy \n     independent is outmoded and probably was even in the era of \n     Richard Nixon. The point is that no industry in the world is \n     more globalized than our industry.\n\n  That is a chief executive of an oil company.\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\n  Whether or not we do ANWR with respect to price is also critical. The \nfirst President Bush said:\n\n       Popular opinion aside, our vulnerability to price shocks is \n     not determined by how much oil we import. Our vulnerability \n     is more directly linked to how oil dependent our economy is.\n\n  President Bush is correct. Nothing about drilling in the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge fundamentally alters the dependency of the United \nStates. No one in the industry will suggest that, even at its best \namount of oil, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge makes anything but a few tiny \npercentage points, in the low single digits, of difference on a 60-\npercent dependency on foreign oil.\n  Even if you drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, you cannot affect \nthe energy price. Alaska Governor Tony Knowles said:\n\n       Evidence overwhelmingly rejects the notion of any \n     relationship between Alaska North Slope crude and West Coast \n     gasoline prices.\n\n  Great Britain is entirely energy independent, fuel independent. They \nhave their own North Sea oil. But Great Britain, despite the fact that \nit has a 100-percent capacity to supply its oil, is subject to the same \nprice increases and the same price shocks as other countries in the \nworld. ANWR, with its tiny little percentage, is not going to affect \nthat.\n  Let me deal with another issue if I may. I have enormous respect for \nSenator Murkowski and Senator Stevens. They are friends. They have been \nmy colleagues a long time, and they are fighting a fight in which they \nbelieve. They particularly believe in it for their State. I think every \none of us in the Senate accepts responsibility for helping States that \nhave difficulties making up revenue differences. That is why we have a \nFederal system in this country. We help farm country for different \nthings at different times. I am certainly always prepared to try to be \nof assistance to the State of Alaska in ways that it needs it.\n  One of the Senators, or both, has spoken about Senator Tsongas a \nnumber of years ago. None of us could comment on what was or was not \nsaid between Senators. I accept what Senator Stevens says. All I know \nis that Senator Tsongas was asked point blank in 1992:\n\n       Do you believe that the Alaska refuge should be opened to \n     drilling in 1992?\n\n  Here is what the Senator said:\n\n       Absolutely not. I believe we should prevent exploitation \n     and devastation of this national treasure. To address our \n     energy needs, we should promote maximizing energy efficiency, \n     renewable resources, and our plentiful natural gas reserves.\n\n  Once again, I cannot go back in history to a time when I wasn't here. \nBut I do know that Paul Tsongas, as late as 1992, was opposed to \ndrilling and certainly had no sense of any commitment he had made at \nthat point in time in that regard.\n  In this debate, as I mentioned a moment ago, I want to deal with the \nquestion of production. The Senator from Louisiana asked: What are we \ngoing to do? Where are we going to produce our energy? He asked \nlegitimate questions, such as: If we are not going to do it here, how \ndo we do it there, and so forth.\n  Let me clarify this for the record. The proponents of drilling in the \nArctic Refuge want to cast those of us who don't want to do it as \nsomehow anti-energy production. As I have just described, I have a \nvision--and I think others share it--of huge energy production for the \nUnited States of America. We cannot grow our economy if we don't grow \nour energy production. We want to grow our economy, and we want the \njobs that come with it. We need the strength for our Nation. Of course, \nwe have to expand our energy production. Here is where these debates \nalways somehow get dragged down, because people want to go to the \nplaces--I don't know, for sort of a debate advantage or political \nadvantage but not where the truth is.\n  This debate is not about whether or not we need to expand our energy. \nThis debate is over how we expand our energy. How do we do it? Do we do \nit in ways that we know violate the air, leave toxic waste sites, tear \napart the health of our fellow citizens, that pour particulates into \nthe air so we have more emphysema, more lung disease, more cancer or do \nwe try to use the ingenuity God gave us to go find the cleaner, more \nthoughtful technologies that make a difference in the long-term future \nof our country and indeed the planet?\n  That is the choice. Once again, I say there are those who want the \nstatus quo where they think all we do is drill oil, and there are those \nwho believe there is a different energy future for the country.\n  Let me point out, America produces almost all the coal that we \nconsume, and the tax package that is in this energy bill, if we pass \nit, promotes clean coal--clean coal.\n  America produces about 85 percent of the natural gas that we consume, \nand this energy bill includes a provision to federally subsidize the \nconstruction of the massive gas pipeline to carry the estimated 35 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas from the North Slope of Alaska to \nthe lower 48 States.\n  Those who argue that we are coming to this energy unconscious ignore \nthe fact that in this very bill, there is a provision to build a \npipeline from Alaska to the lower 48 States so we can burn clean energy \nin an intelligent way.\n  We hear that those of us opposing the development of ANWR are even \nagainst electricity production. Wrong again. In New England alone we \nhave built 12 new powerplants in the past 2 years. We have put more \nthan 3,500 megawatts online, another 12 new powerplants are under \nconstruction and will come online in the next 2 years, putting an \nadditional 6,300 megawatts online. There has been no opposition to \nthese projects.\n  We produce a significant amount of oil in America. We do not produce \nall we consume, as I have just described, and that will never happen \nwithout some extraordinary introduction of efficiencies and \nalternatives. I have explained why, and I do not have to go back over \nthat, but we remain one of the largest oil producers in the world \ntoday. I say this because given the debate in this Chamber, Americans \nmight believe the only oil in the Nation is somehow underneath the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge and we are preventing the only oil in the Nation \nfrom being drilled. That is just not true.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration of the United \nStates, we are one of the top oil producers in the world today. In \n2001, the United States produced roughly as much oil on a daily basis \nas Saudi Arabia and the former Soviet Union, which is about 8 to 9 \nmillion barrels a day.\n  America produced more than twice as much oil as Iran, more than three \ntimes as much as Iraq, more than three times as much as the United Arab \nEmirates, and more than three times as much as Canada. The idea that we \nhave blocked all the oil development is absolutely ridiculous, faced \nwith those statistics.\n  I want to talk about the Gulf of Mexico. Ask an oil company executive \nprivately right now--and some of them have gone on record publicly--\nwhether they really want to dig in Alaska. The answer is sometimes no, \nor it depends. Oil companies are holding 7,000 leases today for \ndeepwater exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and not using most of them. \nThe reason they have not drilled in the Gulf of Mexico where they \nalready have the permits is because they have waited for the price of \noil to go up because that helps the economics.\n  The fact is, if tomorrow the United States were cut off, it would not \nbe only Alaska we would look to; it would be the Gulf of Mexico; it \nwould be other oil supplies of the United States to which we would \nlook.\n  According to the Minerals Management Service, there are between 16 \nand 25 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil in the central \nand western Gulf of Mexico. That depends on the price, as I will \nexplain in a moment.\n  Economically recoverable oil is different from other categories of \noil that are in the ground and available. ``Economically recoverable'' \nreflects what you can get at the current cost of oil.\n\n  One of the interesting points is most of the studies of our \ncolleagues who come in here and say we ought to do this and create \n700,000 jobs and so forth are based on a completely false price for \noil, not the price we have today.\n  Development in the Gulf of Mexico has accelerated. According to the \nMinerals Management Service, 42 new deepwater fields have come online \nsince 1995. Production is expected to climb from under 1 million \nbarrels per day in 1995 to as much as 1.9 million barrels per day 3 \nyears from now.\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\n  The Gulf of Mexico reserves are so promising that Lord Brown, whom I \nmentioned earlier, the CEO of British Petroleum, calls them some of the \nmost promising reserves in the world. He was asked where the most \nimportant place to find oil is in the United States. He was asked this \nin an interview by ``60 Minutes'' a couple of months ago. Here is what \nhe said:\n\n       The deep water Gulf of Mexico, part of the United States, \n     is probably one of the greatest new oil provinces in the \n     entire world.\n\n  Let me highlight some of the production that is underway in Alaska \nbecause it has been suggested that somehow we are shutting down \nAlaska's capacity to pump oil.\n  Last May, the State of Alaska completed a lease sale of 950,000 acres \non the North Slope. It is the largest lease by any State in history, \nand they have announced another 7 million acres will be put up for \nlease in the coming years.\n  The State of Alaska has scheduled 15 oil and gas leases on 15 million \nacres.\n  In 1999, the Bureau of Land Management held a lease sale of 4 million \nacres in the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. It is in the process \nof releasing 3 million acres and other plans and it has announced a \nthird lease sale of a planning area of 10 million acres.\n  In April of 2001, BP, Phillips, and ExxonMobil predicted that there \nis at least 7.8 billion barrels of oil to be developed on the North \nSlope of Alaska.\n  In many ways, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge represents our God-given \nnatural strategic petroleum reserve. If, indeed, 20 years from now none \nof these things I have predicted happen, if we are so backed up in a \ncorner, if technology does not come through, if we do not do our work, \nthen at least we might have had the wisdom to have held on to this God-\ngiven strategic petroleum reserve, rather than going for it right now \nat a time when it is not necessary and in demand.\n  Let me speak to some of the important issues that I think have to be \nclarified as part of the record.\n  No. 1, how much oil is in Alaska? We hear of different amounts of oil \nthat we could find there. There are very different estimates. Some \npeople say more than 16 billion barrels; some say far less; some argue \nnot enough to make development economically viable. That is not where I \nam. I am not trying to go to either extreme, and I think those who only \ngo to the extremes do a disservice to the debate.\n  I would like to present what I think is the amount of oil that could \nbe technically recovered, and that is the amount of oil that could be \nextracted using today's technology without any consideration of cost. \nOf course, we know cost is a consideration, but I am going to deal with \nit technically.\n  I have heard this reference continually to radical environmental \ngroups. I do not think the United States Geological Survey is a radical \nenvironmental group. They say there is a 95-percent probability that at \nleast 6 billion barrels of oil are technically recoverable. There is a \n5-percent probability that at least 16 billion might be technically \nrecoverable. The mean, or the most likely outcome, is that 10 billion \nbarrels of oil are technically recoverable.\n  The second question is then, How much is economically recoverable? \nThis is an estimate of how much oil you could produce at a certain \nprice of oil. That number matters actually much more than the technical \nreserves because oil companies simply do not produce oil they cannot \nbring to the market profitably.\n  According to the U.S. Geological Survey, again, if oil is priced at \n$25 a barrel, then there is a 95-percent chance that 2 billion barrels \nare economically recoverable. There is a 5-percent chance that 9 \nbillion barrels are economically recoverable.\n  A mean chance, or the most likely outcome, is 5 billion barrels are \neconomically recoverable. I might add, these numbers are taken straight \nfrom the Congressional Research Service briefing on the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge, and the cost estimate is directly from the Energy Information \nAdministration reported by CRS.\n  It is difficult to estimate how much oil might be in the refuge. \nThere are complicating factors, but for the claim to keep coming at us \nthat the refuge is going to produce 16 billion barrels and to make all \nthe arguments dependent on that is not to do justice to the \nprobabilities I put forward and to the realities of oil exploration. \nThe claim is not only unrealistic, it runs counter to what proponents \nclaim to be the leading reason for drilling, because the leading reason \nfor drilling is that it is going to produce for us cheap oil.\n  If it is going to produce cheap oil, you diminish the amount of \nrecoverable oil because the economics do not work. So if you are \ndriving the price down--you cannot get caught in this argument and have \nit both ways.\n  I also want to highlight the important difference between what is \ncalled in-place oil, technically recoverable oil, and economically \nrecoverable oil. I know this is a little arcane, but I want to do it \nbecause I want the record to reflect this is not about caribou alone, \nit is not about some ``not in my back yard.'' This is about clear \nscience, economics, oil policy, national security policy, energy \npolicy, and the long-term interests of our country.\n  The fact is these definitions are vital to understand and to weigh \nthe choice we have. On Alaska's North Slope, near Prudhoe Bay, there is \na field called West Sak. In 1989, Arco estimated the West Sak field \nheld as much as 13 billion barrels of oil in place, with another 7 \nbillion listed as potential. Estimates published in the Society of \nPetroleum Engineers placed the estimate at more than 30 billion barrels \nof oil in total. But the Alaska Department of Natural Resources \nestimates that only 370 million barrels of oil, less than 2 percent of \nthe oil in that reserve, will be produced through the year 2020.\n  Why? Because that is all that is economically recoverable. This is \nAlaska itself telling us it is limited because of the price. It is not \nenough to say there is oil in the ground. We have to understand how \nmuch one can get out, at what kind of price, and what is realistic. We \nare going to hear that with emerging technologies and still-to-be-\ninvented technologies, the amount of economically recoverable oil might \nrise. I concede that. That is true. That is a positive thing, if it \nhappens in the future. But it is also true that the amount of \neconomically recoverable oil may be less and the price may go down.\n  Why may it go down? Because a whole bunch of people are already \nstarting to push that technology curve in the alternatives, and if \nsuddenly someone comes in with the capacity to do the hydrogen fuel \ncell or other things, the entire transportation mix and dependency of \nthe United States changes, the demand curve goes down, and the price \ngoes down, and far less oil will be recoverable.\n  On March 10, 2002, the New York Times published a story with the \nfollowing headline: ``Oil Industry Hesitates Over Moving into Arctic \nRefuge.'' The article highlights why the oft-repeated claim that the \nrefuge will produce 16 billion barrels of oil is simply inaccurate, and \nI share this quote: ``Big oil companies go where there are substantial \nfields and where they can produce oil economically,'' said Ronald \nChappell, a spokesman for BP Alaska, which officially supports the \narea and drilling. He continued: ``Does ANWR have that? Who knows?''\n\n  That is the conclusion of the company; not 16. Who knows?\n  The article continues: There is still a fair amount of exploration \nrisk here. You could go through 8 years of litigation, a good amount of \ninvestment, and still come up with dry holes or uneconomic discoveries, \nsaid Jerry Kepes, the managing director for exploration and production \nissues at the Petroleum Finance Company, which is a Washington \nconsulting firm for oil companies. Quote: It is not clear that this is \nquite the bonanza that some have said.\n  So we have to weigh, do we take this not quite so clear bonanza and \ndestroy an Arctic wildlife refuge, for which some people have \ndisrespect but, as I will show, I think is a concept that captures the \nimagination of many Americans and is worth preserving.\n  This article says a great deal about how little oil might be in the \nrefuge, and it stands in stark contrast to some of the claims we have \nheard in the press and in the Senate about the 16 billion. An article \nin the Washington Post examines some of the competing claims over the \nrefuge oil potential. It said as follows:\n\n       How much oil is out there? No one knows for sure. But the \n     environmental movement's favorite statistic is a USGS \n     estimate that the Coastal Plain contains 3.2 billion barrels\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\n     of economically recoverable oil at the current price of $20 \n     per barrel, about what the Nation uses in 6 months.\n\n  I will concede in the last few days the price of oil has gone up a \nlittle bit. That figure probably goes up with it, and of course that is \ntrue. But Senator Murkowski wrote a letter to the Post that the USGS \nactually estimates 10.3 billion barrels of economically recoverable \noil. The truth, according to the USGS, that conducted this study, is \nthey have said directly Senator Murkowski is wrong in stating that \nfigure and the environmentalists are right, and that is a quote from \nthe USGS.\n  To lay it out, proponents of drilling are regularly exaggerating the \nproduction by as much as 200 percent. Likewise, some of the opponents \nof drilling sometimes underestimate production by as much as 40 \npercent, assuming that oil costs less than $20 per barrel.\n  In my estimation, the most reliable prediction is that the refuge \nmight produce about 5 billion barrels of oil over its productive \nlifetime, and that is if oil is priced at about $25 per barrel. I \nshould add that the Energy Information Administration predicts oil will \nbe at about $22.50 per barrel, not $25 per barrel. So, again, 5 billion \nbarrels may be somewhat high.\n  What would it mean if one were to find 5 billion barrels in the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge? That is the next thing we ought to try to \nmeasure. A lot of promises have been made by the other side. They have \nsuggested it is a solution to oil shortages, heating oil shortages, \nhigh gas prices, electricity brownouts, unemployment, national \nsecurity. It is even being tied to specific conflicts and incidents \naround the globe. Someone might believe, listening to this, that the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge is the magic elixir that is going to cure most \nof the ills we face. But the fact is, if one is simply an oil company \nand they are looking to drill some oil, that can be a lot of oil. It is \nmoney, money in the pocket, profits; no question about it. I \nacknowledge that.\n  That is not what we are measuring. We are not an oil company. We \nrepresent the people of the United States of America, and our country \nhas to weigh that potential 5 billion barrels and what it means in the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge to the curves we displayed earlier that show our \ndependency on foreign oil, 70 percent of which goes into \ntransportation, which mandates that we begin to deal with a whole \ndifferent set of energy choices for our country.\n  There is another issue we need to think about with respect to this. \nWe need to think about how much oil is going to be produced not in the \ntotal lifetime but on a daily basis because that is what affects \nsupply. This number helps us understand what the real impact of the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge might be. Once again, the proponents of the \ndrilling, from the White House to the Senate, have exaggerated those \nestimates more than they have even exaggerated the overall recoverable \noil.\n  We have heard that the refuge oil is, as I said, a solution to a \nwhole bunch of problems, such as the California electricity crisis. I \nshowed the quote where Alaska Governor Tony Knowles responded it will \nnot have any impact at all on California. The refuge, as I said, will \nnot produce oil for 7 to 10 years. That means if you open the refuge \ntoday, you are not going to see oil until about 2012, maybe a couple of \nyears earlier.\n\n  The relevant agencies of our government and the industry itself have \nsaid this 10-year figure is about the average; maybe 7 to 10, but they \nbank on about 10. The Energy Information Administration says 7 to 10 \nyears. The Congressional Research Service says 10 years. The industry's \nown economic analysis produced by WEFA Economic Forecasters, which I \nshould add is wildly optimistic about every aspect of oil drilling, \npredicts it will take 10 years for the oil to begin flowing. That is \nfrom the group that produced most of the studies on which they rely. \nThey say 10 years.\n  Asked in a Senate hearing how long it will take, the president of the \nexploration of production for ExxonMobile said:\n\n       In the normal process we would probably allow 3 to 4 years \n     for the permitting which would put you in the 10-year range.\n\n  Let's end these arguments that this is the cure to the Middle East \ncrisis today, or that this is somehow going to prevent a young American \nman or woman in uniform from having to go over and defend an oilfield \nnext year, the year after, or the year after that. The United States, \neven if we drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, is still so \ndependent on foreign oil now, until we change our overall energy mix, \nAmerica's youth will be at risk to protect America's dependency.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about jobs, how many jobs will be \ncreated, what this will do. We have even heard that the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge drilling is the solution in place of the stimulus or part of the \nstimulus during the course of last year, and it will produce an \nimmediate impact. It is interesting to note Secretary of the Interior \nGale Norton has been sent around to a bunch of press events in \nMissouri, Arkansas, Indiana, and New York as a representative of the \nFederal Government--incidentally, the agency charged with managing our \npublic lands--and she has been promising the drilling of the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge creates 700,000 jobs across the Nation. Secretary \nNorton's tour, No. 1, is a political tour, not the management of our \nlands. And oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge does not create 700,000 \njobs. That claim comes directly from a study that has been universally \ndiscredited. It is a bogus study.\n  First of all, the 700,000 job claim is for 1 year in about 2015. Yet \nyou never hear the Bush administration mention that. Not only is the \n700,000 number a wild exaggeration, but it doesn't represent the \nstartup and decrease with respect to jobs in this particular effort. \nMoreover--and here is the most important thing, much more important \nthan anything else with respect to the study--the claim is based on a \n12-year-old study produced by WEFA Economic Forecasters, paid for by \nthe American Petroleum Institute. According to that API study--this is \ntheir study--drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge produces zero jobs \nfor the next 4 years; zero jobs according to their own analysis.\n  There is a choice. We can invest in the pipeline for natural gas \nwhich could immediately produce jobs, or we could drill immediately in \nother areas where we know we already have permitting and the ability to \ndrill. That would be a more immediate job production than this. It is \ninteresting, you would have to wait until 2007 for the jobs to be \nproduced.\n  I highlight a couple of the technical inaccuracies of this study \nwhich has been thrown around so much. The Center for Economic Policy \nand Research assessed that study and made the following points.\n\n  No. 1, according to Energy Information Agency estimates, the API \nstudy overstates oil production in the refuge by a factor of 3. \nAdjusting the projections to keep them in line with the EIA estimates \nreduces predicted job creation by more than 60 percent. The API study \nassumes other oil producers, especially OPEC, do little to increase \nproduction and bolster oil prices. Adjusting other production to keep \nthem in line with conventional estimates reduces the job creation by \nanother 40 percent. The API study assumes the economy will be far more \naffected by a drop in oil prices than is reasonable to expect and \nsubstituting a more reasonable estimate lowers the projection by about \n75 percent.\n  As I have said, that study was written 10 years ago. So we can test \nsome of the assumption and predictions easily. The study was based on \noil costing more than $45 per barrel in the year 2000. Let me repeat: \nHere is a study that they are still using, they still come to the floor \nto say creates a lot of jobs, that, in fact, predicted a price of oil \ndouble what the price of oil is today, which increases the recoverable \noil and changes the entire economics. Oil back then was $25 per barrel.\n  Here is another example. The study assumes that when Arctic oil \nflows, the world market for oil will be 55 million barrels per day. The \nworld market today is already more than 70 million barrels a day, and \nit will be much higher by the time the production occurs. When the \nwrong and, frankly, stretched assumptions are corrected in the API \nstudy, the job estimates fall to 50,000 nationally. To put this in \nperspective, that is fewer jobs than what our economy generated in an \naverage week over the years 1997 through the year 2000. That is what \nour economy is capable of doing in any week if our economy is moving in \nthe right direction.\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\n  I will read from an Associated Press article published in March a \nremarkable story that shows that while President Bush's Cabinet \nSecretary, Gale Norton, tours the Nation promising America 700,000 \njobs, the people who supported the API study are distancing themselves \nfrom it because it is faulty. Here is what the article reports:\n\n       The authors of the 1990 study no longer work at the company \n     [that prepared it], according to a spokesman who acknowledged \n     it was ``a bit out of date.'' ``We would not come up with the \n     same numbers today,'' said Mary Novak, an economist and \n     managing director.\n       Some of the assumptions made more than a decade ago ``are \n     suspect, and you might underline suspect,'' says Roger Ebel, \n     a global energy expert for the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies.\n\n  And he has been involved in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge drilling \ndebate.\n  The Congressional Research Service has looked at this question and \nassessed how many jobs might be created from drilling in the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge. Its report also casts doubt on the API study. CRS said \nthe following.\n  First, if the economy is operating at full employment, jobs created \nby drilling in the refuge would come at the expense of an equal number \nof jobs in the rest of the economy. In other words, if we pull this \neconomy out of recession and get ourselves to full employment, drilling \nis not going to create any additional jobs.\n  That is the Congressional Research Service; it is not me. I am \nquoting the Congressional Research Service.\n  Second, job creation from drilling in the Arctic Refuge may be as \nlittle as 8 percent of API's claims. The Congressional Research service \ngives a range of between 60,000 and 130,000 jobs. Again, when the \neconomy was expanding in recent years, it created that many jobs in 3 \nweeks.\n  Third, should oil prices drop, which CRS describes as uncertain, any \nemployment gain from that drop would be offset by harm to oil producers \nnot operating in the refuge, who would then conceivably reduce their \noperations and workforce, impacting suppliers and local economies in \nother ways.\n  Let me turn to a question of price. Jobs is not the only expanded, \nexaggerated component of the argument. Another is the question of how, \nif we develop in the refuge, we will lower the price of oil and \ngasoline, heating fuel, diesel, all the products we produce from oil. \nWhen we examine the facts which I went through a bit earlier, the fact \nis, the price of oil now is not going to be affected by what happens in \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge because, as we have seen, you have to be, \nfirst of all, certain about the amount of oil it will produce; and, \nsecondly, there are three different assumptions to make about the oil \nfrom the refuge. You could use the exaggerated peak production, you can \nuse the 1 million barrels a day you hear about from the President and \nfrom other supporters, or you could use the mean production, which is \nabout 660,000 barrels for 1 year, in the year 2020, or you could use an \naverage production over the life of the refuge, which is about 360,000 \nbarrels of oil.\n\n  I say the reason we might use any of these is that none of them, even \nthe overblown 1 million barrels a day, will have any impact on oil \nprices whatsoever. Use any one you want, it does not matter, because \nthe bottom line is that you cannot affect the price even on the day of \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge's largest production of oil. Here is why.\n  Central to the idea that the refuge will lower oil prices is the \nnotion that the United States of America, in our production, drives oil \nprices. It does not, and it will not. It cannot. The price of oil is \nset in the global market. According to the Energy Information \nAdministration, the world market for oil in 2020 will consume 119 \nmillion barrels per day. Refuge oil, for that single peak year of 2020, \nwould amount to between .25 and 1.17 percent of the entire global \nconsumption. That is simply not enough, under economic models of \nanybody anywhere. No economic model would suggest that .25 to 1.17 \npercent of the total production has the ability to affect that global \noil price. The fact is that the average production, probably at around \n360,000 barrels, is much less than peak production, and we all know \nthat is not going to have the ability to affect the price. So this \nargument is incorrect.\n  What about independence from imported oil? I talked about that. I do \nnot want to repeat all of that now. But the bottom line is there is not \none single day in which the Arctic Wildlife Refuge production will \nreplace Saudi imports. It just doesn't amount to that. These are not my \nnumbers, these are the numbers that come from the Congressional \nResearch Service.\n  I should point out the technical estimate is not a likely outcome. It \nis not the economic estimate. I use it to make the point that using \nonly the highly optimistic, greatest potential, you still do not have \nthe ability to affect the total of the Saudi imports.\n  The false promises go way beyond Saudi Arabia. As we have heard them \nsay over and over again, ANWR will ensure energy independence; it will \nreduce our dependence on imported oil. Nothing we have heard has \nrevealed anything except that promise is completely inflated and \nunrealistic because of the relationship of the amount of oil there to \nthe global supply.\n  The report from the Energy Information Administration was requested \nby Senator Murkowski. This report, requested by Senator Murkowski, says \nif you accept the EIA's reference case for oil imports and the mean \nestimate for refuge oil production that is the most likely outcome, oil \nimports will drop from 62 percent to 60 percent for 1 year, about 2020. \nEvery other year, imports will be higher. This is, again, the Energy \nInformation Administration in response to Senator Murkowski.\n  So the President of the United States and other proponents have told \nAmerica they have a plan for the Nation, a plan to ensure energy \nindependence, to protect our national security. They back up the plan \nwith a lot of talk about national security. They have insisted we \nattach ANWR to the Department of Defense authorization bill last year \nbecause it was an urgent matter of national security. They hold press \nevents with big pictures of Saddam Hussein. When two servicemen died in \nduty to our Nation, they suggested it was about the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge and that was related because we do not drill in the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge.\n  Their plan, this master plan that will ensure energy independence, is \nsimply without validity. Under no economic model whatsoever, under no \nsupply and demand curve, no way whatsoever can 3 percent supply the \nneeds of 25 percent and growing. It just does not happen. So we need to \nvote accordingly here in the Senate.\n\n  The fact is that 20 years from now, we will import 60 to 62 percent \nof our oil from foreign countries. Nothing we do, absent inventing \nalternatives, is going to diminish that. If we drill in the Arctic \nRefuge, we are not going to stop importing oil from Saudi Arabia. \nNobody suggests that. We are not going to stop importing it from any of \nthese other nations we are concerned about ultimately.\n  So I think it is clear that the flow of money to terrorists is not \ngoing to stop. If we drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, it is not \ngoing to suddenly make peace in the Middle East. If we drill in the \nArctic, our forces are not suddenly going to come home. There is going \nto be no change in deployment; There will be no change in what we may \nhave to do with respect to Saddam Hussein, which we ought to do anyway, \nregardless what happens in the ANWR.\n  Will a single soldier, marine, or sailor today in harm's way come \nhome if we make a decision to drill? The answer is no. We should not. \nWe should terminate this notion that somehow fools people that that is, \nindeed, what is at stake here.\n  I want to correct one thing I said a moment ago. The CAFE standards \nwould not begin immediately. Earlier I misspoke when I said that. The \nCAFE standards take some time to ramp up and take effect. But had we \nput that into effect in 1990, we would today, in the year 2002, be \nsaving 1 million barrels of oil per day, which is close to the amount \nwe import from Iraq. That represents the Iraq figure.\n  I have spoken almost entirely about energy policy. It is my own \nbelief that this is sort of the critical moment in the life of the \nUnited States, in our lives, to make a choice about our future. Are we \ngoing to just kind of keep going down the road where we pretend to \nourselves that just drilling for oil is the solution? Or do we begin to \nforce the transition?\n  In the 1930s, many parts of America did not get electricity. They \ncould not\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nget it. But Roosevelt and others decided it was critical for the \ndevelopment of our Nation, for our Nation's future economy, and for our \nwell-being, for kids to be able to have schools with lights, to have \npower and so forth in their homes--that we got that electricity out \ninto the rural and poor communities. So what did we do? The Federal \nGovernment spent several billion dollars to subsidize, to make sure we \nput that electricity out.\n  In the same way, the Government must today make a decision about the \nwell-being of our country. Are we better off continuing down a road \nwhere we already know we have oil we can drill in Alaska and the North \nSlope? I have described how much we are drilling, how much has been \nleased and put out for lease already. We already know we have 7,000 \nleases in the Gulf of Mexico. We can go down there and continue that \nprocess. But are we going to make the decision as a country to begin to \nembrace a future that is a different mix of fuels for transportation \nand begin to legitimately end our dependence on foreign oil?\n  The only way to change our dependence on foreign oil is to change the \nway we propel our motor vehicles. Transportation consumes 70 percent of \nthe oil we use. I said this at the outset, and I want to repeat these \nprinciples. Not one of these choices we make for our energy future \nshould be done if it doesn't make economic sense. We do not have to \nlower the quality of life for Americans. We have to recognize we are \ngoing to drill for 30 to 50 years and we have the places we can do \nthat. Finally, most of the gains in the near term, in terms of fuel use \nand our dependency, are going to come from efficiencies in the current \nregime. Those efficiencies come from hybrids, new technologies, \nalternatives, renewables, et cetera.\n\n  Those are the principles that must guide us. But I do not want to \nleave out what I think is a critical component of this argument that \nshould not be diminished. It does not deserve to be derided in the way \nit has been derided by some of our colleagues, with respect to what \nthis refuge means in terms of the environment.\n  Some who want to industrialize the Arctic Refuge call it a barren \nwasteland. It has been described as hell. It has been described in many \ndifferent ways, but I think those descriptions reveal more about a \npoint of view and the value than it does about the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  There are those on the opposite side of this debate who may look at \nthe refuge and only see beauty in an oil rig, and they may only see the \nforegone profit of conservation. But those views do not reflect the \nscience, and I don't believe they reflect the best instincts of \nAmericans.\n  Let me read some of the more objective descriptions of ANWR's \nenvironmental value to America today and to future generations. The \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the great untouched lands \nremaining in America and on the northern continent. Its ecological \nvalue is unlike any other in the Nation and in the world.\n\n       The Congressional Research Service describes the refuge as \n     follows: ``The portion of Alaska's North Slope between \n     Prudhoe Bay and the Canadian border represents this country's \n     largest, most diverse remaining example of a largely \n     untouched arctic ecosystem. . . . The apparently hostile \n     nature of the area belies its national and international \n     significance as an ecological reserve. It protects a \n     virtually undisturbed, nearly complete spectrum of arctic \n     ecosystems, and is one of the last places north of the Brooks \n     Range that remains legally closed to development.''\n       In 1959, the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote: ``The great \n     diversity of vegetation and topography . . . in this compact \n     area, together with its relatively undisturbed condition, \n     lead to its selection as the most suitable opportunity for \n     protecting a portion of the remaining wildlife and its \n     frontiers. That area included within the proposed range is a \n     major habitat, particularly in summer, for the great herds of \n     Arctic caribou, and countless lakes, ponds, and marshes found \n     in this area are nesting grounds for large numbers of \n     migratory waterfowl that spend about half of each year in the \n     rest of the United States; thus, the production here is of \n     importance to a great many sportsmen. . . . The proposed \n     range is restricted to the area which contains all of the \n     requisites for year round use. The coastal area is the only \n     place in the United States where polar bears dens are \n     found.''\n       The Department of Interior found in 1987 that ``the Arctic \n     Refuge is the only conservation system unit that protects, in \n     an undistributed condition, a complete spectrum of the arctic \n     ecosystem in North America.'' It described the 1002 area as \n     ``the most biologically productive part of the Arctic Refuge \n     for wildlife and is the center of the wildlife activity. . . \n     . The area presents many opportunities for scientific study \n     of a relatively undistributed ecosystem.''\n\n  Let me repeat that the Fish and Wildlife Service is not a radical \nenvironmental group. Frankly, I am tired of people who refer to this \nsort of radical environmental component when our own agencies--the Fish \nand Wildlife Service and Interior--are telling us, don't disturb this.\n  This is what the Fish and Wildlife Service says:\n\n       The closeness of the Brooks Range to the Arctic Ocean in \n     the Arctic Refuge creates a combination of landscapes and \n     habitats unique in North America. The area has exceptional \n     scenic, wildlife, wilderness, recreation, and scientific \n     values. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the only \n     protected area in the Nation where people can explore a full \n     range of arctic and subarctic ecosystems.\n       The Refuge includes alpine and arctic tundra, barren \n     mountains, boreal forests, shrub thickets, and wetlands. The \n     coast has numerous points, shoals, mud flats, and barrier \n     islands that shelter shallow, brackish lagoons. The tundra is \n     typically a layer of peat overlain by a carpet of mosses, \n     sedges, and flowering plants. Spruce, poplar, and willow \n     trees shade the south slope valleys.\n       Continuous summer daylight produces rapid but brief plant \n     growth. Underlying permaforst and low evaporation cause many \n     areas to remain wet throughout the summer. These factors, \n     along with shallow plant roots and a slow revegetation rate, \n     result in a fragile landscape easily disturbed by human \n     activities.\n\n  Why would we violate the concept of a pristine area? Why, when oil is \navailable in all these other areas we talked about, is there such a \ncompelling interest in destroying that area at this point in time?\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has inventoried some of the refuge's \nenvironmental qualities. They include:\n\n       18 major rivers; arctic tundra, the Brooks Range, boreal \n     forests, and a full range arctic and subarctic habitats; the \n     Brooks Range of mountains rise only 10-40 miles from the \n     Beaufort Sea on the coastal plain; the greatest variety of \n     plant and animal life of any conservation area in the arctic; \n     more than 180 birds from four continents have been identified \n     in the Refuge and its coastal plain is a major migration \n     route; Peregrine falcons, endangered in the lower-48 states, \n     thrive in the Refuge; it is home to 36 species of land \n     mammals; it protects the calving ground of the Porcupine \n     caribou herd, the second largest herd in North America; it is \n     home to black, brown and polar bears; 9 marine mammals live \n     off its coast; 36 fish species live in its rivers and lakes; \n     there are more than 300 archaeological sites; and, there are \n     no roads, trails or developments. Wilderness prevails.\n\n  That is the question before the Senate, whether this is a valuable \nwilderness. People say it is only going to be a small imprint; it is \nonly going to be a few pipes and a few roads. The fact is, experience \nhas shown us that is not an accurate description of what happens.\n  William O. Douglas, the former U.S. Supreme Court Justice said.\n\n       This is the place for man turned scientist and explorer; \n     poet and artist. Here he can experience a new reverence for \n     life that is outside his own and yet a vital and joyous part \n     of it.\n\n  Cecil Andrus, the former Secretary of the Interior, said:\n\n       In some places, such as the Arctic Refuge, the wildlife and \n     natural values are so magnificent and so enduring that they \n     transcend the value of any mineral that may lie beneath the \n     surface. Such minerals are finite. Production inevitably \n     means changes whose impacts will be measured in geologic time \n     in order to gain marginal benefits that may last a few years.\n\n  Congressman Morris Udall said,\n\n       It is a whole place, as true a wilderness as there is \n     anywhere on this continent and unlike any other that I know \n     of.\n\n  President Jimmy Carter has written,\n\n       Having traveled extensively in this unique wilderness, I \n     feel very strongly about its incredible natural values.'' . . \n     . ``I have crouched on a peninsula in the Beaufort Sea to \n     watch the ancient defensive circling of musk oxen who \n     perceived us a threat to their young. We sat in profound \n     wonder on the tundra as 80,000 caribou streamed around and \n     past us in their timeless migration from vital calving \n     grounds on the coastal plain. These plenomena of the \n     untrammeled earth are what lead wildlife experts to \n     characterize the coastal plain as America's Serengeti.\n\n  We have heard that drilling will not take place on the entire Refuge. \nRather it will take place only on the refuge's coastal plain, the so-\ncalled 1002 Area. So I want to talk some about the 1002\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\nArea and why it should be protected. It is not a complicated issue. The \ncoastal plain is a special place even within the environmental treasure \nof the refuge, and it is the place where oil exploration is likely to \ndo the most damage to the Refuge.\n\n  The Department of Interior found in 1987 that the\n\n     1002 area is the most biologically productive part of the \n     Arctic Refuge for wildlife and is the center of the wildlife \n     activity. . . . The area presents many opportunities for \n     scientific study of a relatively undistributed ecosystem.\n\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has said that\n\n     The Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge, the part of the \n     Refuge being considered for oil drilling, is the most \n     biologically productive part of the refuge and the heart of \n     the refuge's wildlife acivity. Opening the Arctic Refuge to \n     oil development would threaten the birthing ground of \n     thousands of caribou and important habitat for polar bears, \n     swans, snow geese, muskoxen and numerous other species.\n\n  I repeat that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is charged with the \nresponsibility for making those judgments.\n  A group of more than 500 ecologists, biologists, resource managers, \nand other experts from around the country have assessed the scientific \nliterature and the importance of the Coastal Plain. They made the \nfollowing conclusion:\n\n       Five decades of biological study and scientific research \n     have confirmed that the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge forms a vital component of the biological \n     diversity of the refuge and merits the same kind of permanent \n     safeguards and precautionary management as the rest of this \n     original conservation unit. In contrast to the broader \n     coastal plain to the west of the Arctic Refuge, the coastal \n     plain within the refuge is much narrower. This unique \n     compression of habitats concentrates the occurrence of a wide \n     variety of wildlife and fish species, including polar bears, \n     grizzly bears, wolves, wolverines, caribou, muskoxen, Dolly \n     Varden, Arctic grayling, snow geese, and more than 130 other \n     species of migratory birds. In fact, according to the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, the Arctic Refuge coastal plain \n     contains the greatest wildlife diversity of any protected \n     area above the Arctic Circle.\n\n  Scientists with the National Audubon Society studied how oil \ndevelopment might impact the millions of birds that migrate through the \nCoastal Plain to locations throughout the lower 48 States, South \nAmerica, and even Africa. They concluded that:\n\n       The Arctic Refuge, including its coastal plain, has \n     extraordinary value as an intact [intact] ecosystem, with all \n     its native birdlife. The millions of birds that nest, migrate \n     through, or spend the winter in the refuge are a conspicuous \n     and fundamental part of the refuge ecosystem.\n\n  Obviously, this is a special place. Those who deride it as simply a \nbarren wasteland, better for oil drilling than anything else, I think \ndo a disservice to the conservation ethic, the preservation ethic, and \nto the value of the ecosystem itself, which has been preserved for a \npurpose.\n  But let me just point out how drilling would, in fact, impact this \nspecial place I have described. This is the last thing I will do before \nyielding.\n  We hear people argue that oil drilling will do little or even no harm \nto the Coastal Plain ecosystem. But, unfortunately, the evidence from \ndecades of oil exploration in other areas of Alaska shows otherwise. It \nsimply tells a different story. The history speaks.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has examined that question and \nconcluded the following:\n\n       All reasonable scenarios for oil development on the coastal \n     plain of the Arctic Refuge envision roads, drilling pads, \n     long pipelines, secondary or feeder pipelines, housing, oil \n     processing facilities, gas injection plants, airports and \n     other infrastructure. In addition, the U.S.G.S. 1998 \n     assessment found that oil in the Arctic Refuge appears to be \n     spread out in several pools rather than in one large \n     formation like Prudhoe Bay, making it harder to minimize the \n     development ``foot print.''\n\n  A group of more than 500 ecologists, biologists, and resource experts \nwrote the following:\n\n       The Interior Department has predicted that oil and gas \n     exploration and development would have a major effect on \n     water resources. Fresh water already is limited on the \n     Refuge's coastal plain, and direct damage to wetlands will \n     adversely affect fish, waterfowl, and other migratory birds. \n     These potentially disruptive effects to fish and wildlife \n     should not be viewed in isolation, however. . . . We urge you \n     to protect the biological diversity and wilderness character \n     of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     from future oil and gas development.\n\n  I want to summarize a briefing provided to the Senate by the Wildlife \nSociety of America. The society was founded in 1937. It is an \ninternational, nonprofit, scientific and educational association \ndedicated to excellence in wildlife stewardship through science and \neducation. Its membership is comprised of research scientists, \neducators, communications specialists, conservation law enforcement \nofficers, resource managers, administrators, and students from more \nthan 60 countries.\n  What makes their briefing so important is that it addresses both the \nscientific evidence and the erroneous information that has been widely \ncirculated by the industry and by drilling proponents. Let me address \nthe scientific first. I will read from their position on the refuge.\n  In September of 2001, the Wildlife Society released its official \nposition of petroleum exploration and development in ANWR. It was \nprepared and approved by the Alaska chapter of the Wildlife Society. \nThey object to oil development on the Coastal Plain for the following \ngeneral reasons:\n\n       The adverse effects of petroleum development on some \n     wildlife species at existing North Slope oil fields have not \n     been avoided.\n       The unique aspects of wildlife resources in the environment \n     in the Arctic Refuge Coastal Plain are such that mitigation \n     of the impacts of oil development is questionable.\n       The long-term, cumulative effects of petroleum extraction \n     on fish and wildlife resources are unknown.\n       There is substantial scientific merit in maintaining part \n     of Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain in an undeveloped state for \n     long-term studies of the effects on fish and wildlife \n     resources of climate change in the Arctic.\n\n  The statement continues:\n\n       The Alaska Chapter's position statement committee was \n     composed of federal, state, industry, and university wildlife \n     biologists, including caribou experts--all from Alaska. In \n     developing the position statement, the committee accounted \n     for all available data relating to wildlife resources and oil \n     development, whether the data supported or opposed drilling. \n     Most committee members have had extensive experience working \n     in northern Alaska and used this experience to formulate \n     their recommendations.\n       The Wildlife Society advocates using sound biological \n     information in policy decisions. The Society desires that all \n     scientific aspects of the ANWR issue, including the \n     uncertainty permeating the issue, be considered openly, as \n     the final policy is developed. Careful analysis is extremely \n     important at this time, because not only are the wildlife \n     impacts of oil extraction uncertain, but numerous other \n     issues--such as the amount of recoverable oil, the potential \n     energy benefits from it, and the prudence of drilling in the \n     Refuge--are still under debate.\n\n  The society provided additional important details to support its \nconclusion. Let me say very quickly what they said:\n\n       Development of the Coastal Plain's petroleum resources \n     could have serious, long-term impacts to caribou and other \n     wildlife resources of the Arctic Refuge.\n       With present knowledge of the fish and wildlife resources \n     of the Arctic Refuge and of the functioning of arctic \n     ecosystems, and considering available information on the \n     impacts of current and ongoing petroleum development in \n     Alaska's North Slope oil fields, the primary biological \n     concerns of the Alaska Chapter of The Wildlife Society \n     regarding oil and gas development in the Arctic Refuge \n     include:\n       Potential impacts on the Porcupine Caribou Herd that \n     migrates to the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge;\n       Potential impacts on muskoxen that inhabit the Coastal \n     Plain of the Refuge year round;\n       Potential impacts on polar bears that\n     use the Coastal Plain in [that period of\n     time]. . . .\n       [As well as] the effects of disturbance on up to 500,000 \n     adult snow geese that migrate through the Coastal Plain;\n       The dewatering of streams and lakes during exploration and \n     production activities. . . .\n       Alterations of shoreline ecosystems for the construction of \n     causeways, drill pads, and other petroleum-related \n     facilities. . . .\n       The unknown, long-term, and cumulative effects of \n     development on ecosystem processes critical to long-term \n     viability and integrity of the arctic environment.\n\n  Based on studies in existing areas of oil development in the North \nSlope, they believe petroleum development on the Arctic Wildlife Refuge \nwould inevitably result in loss of wildlife habitat and probable \ndeclines in some wildlife populations.\n  Many times throughout this debate, people have pointed to the \ndevelopment of the central and western portions of Alaska's North \nSlope, particularly Prudhoe Bay. They say this proves that the oil \ncompanies can develop the refuge without harming the\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\nenvironment. Well, no one is going to dispute that wilderness goes on \nforever in every place. But you cannot put an oil drilling complex in a \nwilderness area and call it wilderness. You just can't do it. You are \neither going to decide you are going to have some area set aside as \npristine wilderness or you are not. That is part of what this debate is \nabout, in conjunction with the question of timing.\n  Maybe in the United States of America, somewhere down the road, our \nbacks will be up against the wall, and maybe we will not have made good \neconomic decisions, maybe we will not have developed the technologies \nwe need. Maybe somewhere down the line other nations all gang up, and \nthey will not supply us, and the United States may be stuck in a \nposition, and this tiny bit of oil will make a difference, and the \nUnited States at that point might decide it wants to make that choice.\n  But there is nothing in the economics, there is nothing in the \ncurrent global situation, there is nothing in the amount of oil that \ncan be found, there is nothing in the economically recoverable oil that \nsuggests that that kind of difference is worth this choice at this \ntime, particularly when there is so much in the way of oil alternatives \nin the Gulf of Mexico, natural gas alternatives, and continued drilling \nin Prudhoe Bay, the North Slope area.\n  But the record of Prudhoe Bay itself is not quite as pristine as they \nwant to suggest it is. Oil development on the North Slope has resulted \nin 500 miles of roads, more than 1,100 miles of pipelines, thousands of \nacres of facilities spread out over 1,000 square miles, 3,800 \nexploratory wells, 170 exploratory drill and drill pads, 22 gravel \nmines, 25 processing plants for oil, gas, and seawater, 56,000 tons of \nnitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog and acid rain, which is twice \nas much as is emitted by the city of Washington, DC. Our Nation's \nCapital emits less global warming gas than drilling in Prudhoe Bay.\n\n  Nearly 400 spills occur annually on the North Slope's oilfields; \nroughly 40 toxic substances, ranging from waste oil to acids, have been \nspilled. As much as 6 billion gallons of drilling waste have been \ndumped in 450 reserves pits. Three class I injection wells have been \nconstructed and injected with more than 325 million gallons of waste. \nThirty class II injection wells have been constructed and injected with \nmore than 40 billion gallons of waste.\n  Several experts have examined the impacts of oil development in \nPrudhoe Bay on the environment and what it might mean for the oil \ndevelopment of the Arctic Refuge. Again, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService says:\n\n       Air and water pollution and contaminated sites continue to \n     be a serious problem in Prudhoe Bay and are inevitable with \n     any oil development. Many gravel pads on the North Slope are \n     contaminated by chronic spills. In addition, hundreds of oil \n     exploratory and production drilling waste pits have yet to be \n     closed out and the sites restored. More than 76 contaminated \n     sites exist on the North Slope and contractor performance has \n     been spotty.\n       Prudhoe Bay is a major source of air pollution and green \n     house gas emission among the Arctic Coastal Plain. Prudhoe \n     Bay facilities annually emit approximately 55,000 tons of \n     nitrogen oxide which contributes to smog and acid rain. North \n     Slope oil facilities release roughly 24,000 tons of methane. \n     Industry has numerous violations of particulate matter \n     emissions and has opposed introduction of new technology to \n     reduce nitrogen oxides and requirements for low sulfur fuel \n     use.\n\n  That is our own Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  A group of more than 500 ecologists, biologists, and resource experts \nwrote Congress saying:\n\n       Based on our collective experience and understanding of the \n     cumulative effects of oil and gas exploration and development \n     on Alaska's North Slope, we do not believe these impacts have \n     been adequately considered for the Arctic Refuge, and \n     mitigation without adequate data on this complex ecosystem is \n     unlikely. Oil exploration and development have substantially \n     changed environments where they have occurred in Alaska's \n     central Arctic. Since the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in \n     1968, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service estimated about 800 \n     square miles of Arctic habitats have been transformed into \n     one of the world's largest industrial complexes. Oil spills, \n     contaminated waste, and other sources of pollution have had \n     measurable environmental impacts in spite of strict \n     environmental regulations. Roads, pipelines, well pads, \n     processing facilities, and other support infrastructure have \n     incrementally altered the character of this system.\n\n  The Wildlife Society, the Alaska chapter, believes that ``petroleum \nexploration and development are not warranted on the Coastal Plain of \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,'' which they have deemed, as I \nmentioned earlier, a critical area for the abundance and diversity of \nwildlife.\n  We also need to look at the issue of compliance. This is particularly \ntrue when oil production starts to decline, as it will. There is a \ncurve here. Let me share it with you. I have the chart in the \ncloakroom. Maybe we can get it in a minute.\n\n  The point of the chart is to show that obviously, like any finite \nresource, as you begin production, you begin slowly. You build up. You \nbuild up to a peak. And then, of course, since there is only so much \nthere, you begin to come down. What often happens in this debate is we \nwind up with peak production day being the amount of oil that is thrown \naround, whereas you have to work up to that and then come down.\n  If you were to compare that to what would happen, for instance, with \nCAFE standards, CAFE standards don't go up and down, CAFE standards \ncontinue to accrue as you go forward. Every day in the future, you will \nbe grabbing X amount of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and so forth, \nout of the atmosphere and recapturing it or preventing it from going \nin.\n  You can actually save three times as much fuel as the peak production \nday. You save three times as much foreign dependency by putting CAFE \nstandards in place as you would drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.\n  When oil exploration is over, when the companies don't want to invest \nany more money in the project, what is the commitment to clean up? All \nover this country--the Presiding Officer's State of New Jersey--there \nare unfunded liabilities in toxic sites where the companies don't clean \nthem up. We have just seen this administration seek to change the \n``polluter pays'' principle which, incidentally, is a tax on the \nAmerican citizen. I don't know if people are focused on that right now. \nMaybe it is worth a moment. When you undo ``polluter pays,'' as the \nprinciple that has guided our cleanup in America of our toxic sites, \nthen the question is, Who pays? The average taxpayer is going to pay. \nThe Federal Government is going to have to dump that money in if the \n``polluter pays'' principle is not there. That is a tax increase on \nAmericans. It is the Bush environmental tax on Americans.\n  By ending ``polluter pays,'' we are now going to turn, and either \nnobody cleans it up--which is what is happening right now because we \nare not putting the money into Superfund--or the taxpayer across the \ncountry pays.\n  That is the problem in Alaska, too. Who is going to clean up in the \nend? What is the State pristineness? Can you ever restore pristine? The \nanswer, I think most people know, is no.\n  In the year 2000, BP Alaska reached agreement with the Environmental \nProtection Agency to pay $7 million in civil and criminal penalties and \n$15 million to carry out a nationwide environmental management system. \nBP was sentenced in Federal court in February 2000 to pay $500,000 in \ncriminal fines and $6.5 million for failing to report illegal hazardous \nwaste disposals on the North Slope.\n  From 1993 to 1995, employees of a contractor up there illegally \ndischarged hazardous substances, including solvents, waste paint, paint \nthinner, waste oil containing lead and toxic chemicals such as benzene, \ntoluene, methylene chloride, by injecting them into wells. They failed \nto report the illegal dumping as required by law.\n  The Wall Street Journal, in a series of investigative stories, has \ndocumented widespread problems at other facilities on the North Slope. \nOn April 12, 2001, they reported:\n\n       Days before Interior Secretary Gale Norton's much-\n     publicized tour of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oilfields last month, \n     state inspectors made a startling discovery: almost a third \n     of the safety valves tested at one drilling platform failed \n     to close.\n\n  The story continues:\n\n       . . . technicians say they have complained for years about \n     the integrity of the industry's ``friendlier technology.'' \n     Some technicians who operate machinery--which proliferates on \n     Prudhoe Bay and could be replicated in the wildlife refuge--\n     are so understaffed and lacking in routine maintenance that \n     they are leak-prone and vulnerable to explosions.\n\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\n\n  On April 26, 2001, the Wall Street Journal reported:\n\n       About 10 percent of the safety shut-off valves in BP Amoco \n     entire drilling operation on Alaska's Western Prudhoe Bay \n     failed\n     to pass state tests during the first\n     quarter. . . .\n\n  On November 9, 2001, the Wall Street Journal reported that an \ninternal report revealed ``widespread operational problems at its giant \noil field in Prudhoe Bay''--that they were widespread operational \nproblems. Investigators found large and growing maintenance backlogs on \nfire and gas detection systems and pressure safety valves. The report \nconcluded:\n\n       The systems are old, portions of them pre-date current code \n     and replacement parts are difficult to obtain.\n\n  Let me close by saying I have made it clear in my comments that those \nof us who oppose the Arctic Wildlife Refuge do not oppose drilling.\n  We embrace drilling in many parts of our country as an ongoing need \nfor 30 to 50 years of this country's future. We will remain oil \ndependent, despite even our best efforts, if we were to make our best \nefforts. I have suggested that we need an organizing principle for our \nenergy future that does what makes economic sense. We should not make \nchoices that don't make economic sense, and we do not have to lower the \nquality of life of any American.\n  We heard debate on the floor of the Senate a few weeks ago about what \nkind of cars people were going to be ``forced'' to drive. No American \nis ever going to be forced to drive any kind of car if we do what we \nneed to do with respect to the future. If you want to drive a big SUV \nor a huge truck to take your kids to soccer games, go ahead, \nabsolutely. I think most soccer moms in America are outraged that cars \nget as little mileage for the gasoline as they do. They would love to \npay less when going to the gas station to fill up.\n  All of that technology is available to us to allow people to drive \nthe car of their choice that is more efficient. There are many choices \navailable to us. We can drill in those 7,000 leases in the deepwater \ndrilling of the Gulf of Mexico. I have gone through the long list of \nthe Arctic leases that were available that were put out last year. The \nlargest oil and gasoline lease in the history of our Nation, just over \na year ago, was 950,000 acres on the North Slope. They have scheduled \n15 oil and gas leases on 15 million acres now. The third lease sale of \na planning area of 10 million acres is coming right down the road.\n  We don't need to drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and destroy the \nconcept of a pristine refuge in order to accomplish our goals of, in \nfact, being independent or improving the national security of our \ncountry. That is really the choice here, for all of us in the Senate: \nWhether we will respect this concept until we find 15, 20, 30 years \nfrom now that we leaders of the country have not made wise choices with \nrespect to the alternatives and renewables, alternative means of \npropelling our automobiles.\n  I was just out at the National Energy Alternative Renewable Energy \nLab in Colorado meeting with Admiral Truly. They are doing \nextraordinary work. They say if the United States were to put in more \neffort and ratchet up our research on alternative propulsion, \nalternative heating, and other mechanisms, we could significantly \nadvance the curve in this country.\n  We have not been serious about that. The only thing we appear to be \nserious about thus far is continuing the dependency that has put us \ninto this problem in the first place.\n  So I hope my colleagues will take advantage of this vote, which \nrepresents an opportunity to suggest that our value system in this \ncountry, and our sense of economics, and our sense of security are \nwell-grounded and well-placed with respect to the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts. He is a friend. I have visited his home \nand I have great love for his wife. I find it very interesting that the \nSenator from Massachusetts has discussed about every other creature of \nthe world but has never talked about the people of the Arctic Slope. He \nnever talked about the Eskimo. In fact, despite repeated requests to go \nto the area, he has never been there. He has never been there. As a \nconcept, I find it hard to understand my friend's continued reference \nto the ``wilderness area'' and drilling in a ``wilderness area.''\n  The 1\\1/2\\ million acres of the Arctic Coastal Plain is not a \nwilderness area and was never designated as a wilderness area. Drilling \nthere would not be drilling in a wilderness area. It is unfortunate \nthat the Senator, and others, continue to say that because it \nrepresents a breach of faith.\n  Paul Tsongas, in fact, did offer four amendments to the 1980 act. One \nof them he withdrew. It was on the Coastal Plain. There was a \ncompromise on the Coastal Plain. I, too, am sad that Senator Paul \nTsongas and Senator Scoop Jackson are not here because, were they here, \nthey would say a deal is a deal.\n  We passed out the letter that Senator Jackson authored with Senator \nHatfield, which is on every Senator's desk, which says:\n\n       One-third of our known petroleum reserves are in Alaska, \n     along with an even greater proportion of our potential \n     reserves. Actions such as preventing even the exploration of \n     the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, a ban sought by one amendment, is \n     an ostrich-like approach that ill-serves our Nation in this \n     time of energy crisis.\n\n  That is the letter signed by Senators Jackson and Hatfield in 1980.\n  Fair is fair. I will talk about the senatorial courtesies and the \nprerogatives of the past. Right now I want to answer my friend. At one \ntime during his comments he said British Petroleum does not seek to \nexplore in ANWR. Am I hearing right? There has been no such \nannouncement by British Petroleum. It is one of the major producing \nentities in the North Slope now and, as far as I know, it has never \nbeen the concept of seeking the right to proceed with the commitment to \nexplore the 1\\1/2\\ million acres covered by the section 1002 in the \n1980 act.\n  The Senator talked about jobs. That is wonderful. We like that. The \nSenator talked about drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and he wants to \ndevelop the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska. He has had that \nopportunity since he has been in the Senate. Nobody has proceeded at \nall with that. We have tried to get that done. We have not been able to \ndo it. It is like the rest of Alaska. People say it is wilderness \nbecause it is undeveloped. It is not wilderness in the legal sense, \nunless it is classified as ``wilderness.''\n  So far as I know, it is not possible for that statement to be made on \nthe floor of the Senate--that we would drill in wilderness if we were \nto drill in the 1002 area of the Arctic Coastal Plain.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts belabored, I think, the CAFE standards \nconcept. It would be three times the savings, he says, of ANWR. Well, \nANWR doesn't persist in savings; ANWR is production. Beyond that, CAFE \nstandards deal with gasoline. We are dealing with oil. Mr. President, \n44 percent of a barrel of oil becomes gasoline; 56 percent is refined \nfor other products. You can have all the CAFE standards you want. If \nyou want the other products, you have to refine a barrel of oil. There \nis too much talk here about gasoline being oil. One time the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts said 70 percent of the oil goes into transportation. \nThat is not so at all. Maybe 70 percent of the gasoline goes into \ntransportation, but it is not oil. In fact, the bulk of the oil goes \nfor a lot of things, including home fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, and \nlubricants. I wonder how far our aircraft would fly if we stopped \nrefining a barrel of oil to get jet fuel. You would still have the part \nof the barrel that would make gasoline.\n\n  I remind those who are looking at this chart that these are items \nmade from oil--from toothpaste to deodorants, footballs, lifejackets, \npantyhose, lipstick, dentures, and they all come from a barrel of oil.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I did not interrupt the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. Does the Senator want to have a dialog?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will have a dialog when the time comes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. A real problem is the people who really take advantage \nof the Nation when we are evenly divided,\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nthe minority of the population--2 percent--which represents these \nradical environmentalists. The Democratic Party sees fit to seek to win \nelections by preventing us from proceeding with the prospect of \ndiscovering oil on the Arctic Plain, but it has not been a traditional \nposition of that party because, obviously, the two people who reserved \nthis area were, in fact, Democratic Senators--Senator Jackson and \nSenator Tsongas. They were Democratic Senators. They entered into a \ncommitment with us that this area would be explored, and if it proved \nto be not a situation where irreparable harm would occur on the Arctic \nPlain, this area would then be faced with a request from the President \nand the Secretary of the Interior to proceed with oil and gas leasing.\n  Oil and gas leasing is prohibited at the present time. We know that. \nIt is prohibited by law. The 1980 act prohibited oil and gas leasing in \nthis area until the procedure is followed. This is the procedure. It \nhas taken us 21 years to get to this point.\n  This is the ``Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain Resource \nAssessment Recommendation to Congress and Legislative Environmental \nImpact Statement'' required by the law of 1980. It demonstrates that \nthere would be no irreparable harm to this area if oil and gas leasing \nwould proceed.\n  I have some real problems with what is going on here. I want to talk \nabout them at length later. I understand the Senator from Texas wishes \nto speak, so I will be glad to yield to her when she is ready.\n  These people, the Eskimos, the Inupiats who live on the North Slope, \nseek this decision by Congress. They want this area to be explored. \nTheir schools, their roads, and their future depend upon jobs. This is \ntheir area. They believe it can be done safely. They even own some of \nthe land up there.\n  Mr. President, did you know they are prohibited from drilling on \ntheir own land, land they received from the Federal Government in \nsettlement of their claims? There is no question--no question--that \nthese people want to proceed.\n  The Senator was referring to this land as wilderness. Those people \nlive right there. This is the village that is within what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts calls wilderness. This is not wilderness. This is \nthe home of the Inupiat people, the Eskimo people of Alaska.\n  There are some Alaska Natives who live on the South Slope who really \nare part of the Canadian Indian nation known as Gwich'ins. They oppose \nthis. We know that. They are probably up in the galleries now. They \noppose it, but the Alaska Eskimos do not oppose it. They live there, \nand they want this development. They want to see it developed.\n  The first time I went up to the North Slope, it was a very sad visit. \nIt was back in the fifties. I tell you, they had a very small runway. \nWiley Post crashed just north of there. We landed at this little \nvillage in which the people lived in terrible circumstances and \nconditions. They had no modern conveniences at all. I invite you to go \nup and take a look at Barrow--five-, six-, eight-story buildings with \nelevators, beautiful schools, a wonderful airport, tremendous people \nenjoying their lifestyle. They like the Arctic. That is their home. \nThey like their opportunities now to have their feet in both the \npresent and the past. They are wonderful people. They make tremendous \ncitizens of the United States, and there is no question they want to \nproceed.\n  I have a letter that went to Senators Daschle and Lott in April of \nthis year from the Kaktovic Inupiat. This is a photograph of some of \ntheir children. They say they want the promises given to them. They \nwant this area open. They are the only residents of the 19.6 million \nacres that were recognized within the boundaries of that refuge. They \nown some of the land. They own 92,160 acres of the land, and they are \ncurrently prohibited by the Federal Government from drilling on their \nland because of the situation in the 1002 area.\n  They were told to wait until the approval was given by Congress to \nproceed in the whole area. They seek--and I hope before we are through, \nwe will recognize their request--to use their own lands to determine \nwhether or not beneath those lands there are oil and gas resources. \nThat is another matter we will go into.\n  They say:\n\n       We don't have much, gentlemen, except for the promises of \n     the U.S. Government that the settlement of our land claims \n     against the United States would eventually lead to control of \n     our destiny by our people.\n\n  That is denied now by the opposition of the majority party to this \namendment that is before us.\n  We believe this will be the largest oilfield on the North American \nContinent, somewhere in excess of 40 billion barrels of oil. We do not \nbuild paved roads; we build ice roads in these areas. It is true that \non State lands, where Prudhoe Bay was discovered--those are State \nlands--they are subject to the construction of roads by the permission \nof the State of Alaska. It is an entirely different situation than \nbeing within the 1002 area which is subject to total control by the \nFederal Government.\n  The House has already limited the use of this 1002 area, 1.5 million \nacres, to 2,000 acres of surface--2,000 acres out of 1.5 million acres. \nThat is what we are being denied the right to use.\n  I do believe it is unfortunate that we have the concepts now of so \nmany people who enjoy life and make so many studies from afar. They are \nmaking studies from all of these scientific organizations that are \nsupported by these environmental organizations. I am going to talk \nabout those later, Mr. President. I see two other Senators are in the \nChamber.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be pleased to follow the Senator \nfrom Texas. I ask unanimous consent that I follow the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, with the understanding I may resume the \nfloor later this afternoon, I will yield the floor to these Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator from Texas will speak, and then the \nSenator from Minnesota follows; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska. In \nfact, I thank both Senators from Alaska for leading this very long \nfight to open up a very small portion of their State for the purpose of \nexploring and drilling to make America more stable in this crisis in \nwhich we find ourselves.\n  I want to go back over what is in the Murkowski-Breaux amendment \nbecause I think if you listen to some of the debate, you will be \nconfused.\n  First, the key provision is a provision I put in this amendment early \non that says the President must find that it is in our national \neconomic and security interest to drill in ANWR. The President must \nconsider the impact on increasing the independence we would have on \nforeign imports for our basic energy needs in this country.\n  This amendment limits the size of production to 2,000 acres, and in \nthat 2,000 acres it is confined to a part of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge that is plain. There are no trees and wilderness in \nthis part of ANWR. We are talking about drilling on 2,000 acres in an \narea the size of the State of South Carolina, where there are no trees \nwhatsoever.\n  In addition, I think it is important to note that we have limited in \nthis amendment when they can drill. They can drill between November and \nMay, when the land is frozen. There would be ice roads and ice runways. \nThe footprint on the land would be minimal to none because they would \nbe using the ice roads rather than driving on the land.\n  In addition to that, the caribou, which is an animal that mates \nthroughout the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, mates during the \nsummertime. There would be no drilling in the summertime. Any argument \nthat this might in some way disrupt caribou mating is not a valid \nargument at all.\n  There would be 1.5 million more acres of real wilderness that would \nbe designated as wilderness where they could not drill--this is in \naddition to ANWR in exchange for opening this nonwilderness area of the \nCoastal Plain.\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\n  It is a balanced amendment. The environment is protected. It is very \nimportant that we look at the environmental safeguards America would \nput on drilling in ANWR to assure that we will have environmental \nstandards.\n  This same reserve may well be drilled in Russia which is very close \nto Alaska, as we all know. About 20 miles separates them at their \nclosest point.\n  They could drill right across the coast from Alaska, and we do not \nknow what their environmental safeguards would be. We certainly would \nnot have control over them, and that would affect the Alaska coastline \neven more because we would not have control of the way Russia might \ndecide to drill. They might not decide to drill only in the winter. \nThey might not decide to put any limitations on the kinds of ships that \nwould come in and out of the water. I think that maintaining control is \nthe better environmental argument.\n  ANWR would produce at least a million barrels a day. That is about \nthe amount we import from Iraq every day. The percentage of the U.S. \noil needs that would be met by ANWR is nearly 5 percent. We consume 20 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. We import 12 million of those barrels. We \nare right at 60 percent of our needs every day having to be met by \nimports. Our ANWR production would make up for 8 to 10 percent of our \ncurrent imports.\n  I heard the Senator from Massachusetts say this is going to be a drop \nin the bucket for our energy needs; that this really gets us nowhere. \nSo why would we do it?\n  We would do it because we need to do everything we can to maintain \nour own stability and to look to ourselves for our economic and \nsecurity needs. I would rather be looking at American jobs with \nAmerican resources, American production and American control than to \nsay 60 percent imports for our needs is OK. I especially think that the \nargument falls flat when we realize that the 60 percent includes some \nof America's known worst enemies, such as Iraq. Iraq has threatened \nAmerica before; so have some of the other countries from whom we import \noil. Then there are countries with whom we have great friendships, such \nas Venezuela. They also send us about a million barrels a day but they \nare in upheaval. There are strikes and the government is in a very \nprecarious situation. So while we would certainly count Venezuela as a \nfriend, they are not as reliable right now as we need to have.\n  I think we need to look at this whole ANWR issue in light of the \ncircumstances. I have always felt that America needed an energy policy \nthat depended on our own resources. Today, it is no longer an option. \nIt is no longer a matter of good public policy; it is a necessity. It \nis a matter of national security that we control our own economy.\n  If countries, that would do us harm, could say ``we will stop \nexporting oil to America and shut down their factories, keep them from \nbeing able to drive to work, shoot the prices so high the airline \nindustry starts to crater,'' then are we not going to beat them from \nwithin? Maybe we do not have to beat them from without because if their \neconomy starts sinking we are going to win. Of course, they are right.\n  If we allow that to happen, we are not responsible stewards of our \ncountry.\n  Iraq has, in fact, said they are going to stop exporting oil that \ncould come to America. With Iraq using this as a weapon, and other \ncountries possibly doing the same, or deciding that perhaps they cannot \nexport any more because of their internal situations, then what are we \ngoing to do if we have not planned ahead?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts says we should conserve our way out of \nthe crisis, but let's look at that. The 10 most fuel-efficient \nautomobiles in America make up 1.5 percent of the automobile sales in \nAmerica. In America, we have long distances to drive. In America, \npeople have big families, and we know a heavier car is safer than a \nsmall car. So it would seem the Senator from Massachusetts would demand \nthat people have only the choice of an unsafe car, that is not the one \nthey want for their families, as a way to become more stable in our \neconomy.\n\n  I fundamentally disagree with him that this is the right approach. I \nthink we need to look to our own resources as part of a balanced \npackage that would keep our country strong.\n  I think we should have incentives for more fuel-efficient \nautomobiles, so that if people make that choice of their own free will, \nand if that meets their family's needs, they would be able to do that \nand maybe even get a tax credit for it. I think we need to look for \nalternative forms of energy. I think we have walked away from nuclear \npowerplants, which are known to be the most clean and effective ways to \nproduce electricity. I think there are new things we will be able to \nfind in the future, such as ethanol, hopefully, becoming more \nreasonably priced; other forms of wind energy that certainly could \nproduce electricity, not in the great amounts we need at this time, but \nI think Americans are ingenious and we will find other sources. But \nthat should not be all we need to do.\n  We need to have a balanced plan that also allows us to produce the \namount of energy we would need to keep our country strong. The major \nsources of oil in this country are ANWR and the Gulf of Mexico. We are \ndrilling in the Gulf of Mexico, but we have not yet found the \ntechnology to go as deep as we would need to go in parts of the Gulf of \nMexico to tap the added resources that might be available there. We do \nhowever certainly have the capability to look to that resource as well. \nIn the Senate bill, we do not try to help get the Gulf of Mexico oil. \nNo. The House bill allows us to continue the royalty help that we give \nfor deep drilling in the Gulf because it is more expensive and takes \nmore research and exploration.\n  Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana passed a royalty relief bill \nthat takes the first part of oil royalties from deep well drilling in \nthe Gulf. It abates those royalties in order to create an incentive for \ncompanies to add that expense of drilling in that deep Gulf area. That \ncredit lapsed and is no longer in effect. The House energy bill puts \nthat back in play.\n  We should do that. That is a valid incentive because it would produce \nmore oil in the Gulf.\n  In the Senate bill, there is very little about production, aside from \nthe marginal well tax credits which were my in bill. I have fought for \nthe marginal well tax credits for a long time. I am pleased that they \nare in the bill because the marginal well tax credits could help the \nmarginal, small, little bitty wells to give them a floor so that anyone \nwilling to go in and tap a site, that would produce only 15 barrels a \nday or less, would be able to withstand the falling prices. A number of \nthose small wells were closed when oil was $11 a barrel a couple of \nyears ago and they haven't been reopened because of the instability of \nthe prices.\n\n  If all the small wells are drilled and producing, we do have that \ncredit in this bill which will equal the amount we import from Saudi \nArabia. It is a significant amount. It takes 500,000 wells to do it. \nThese are generally small businesspeople. That is good.\n  Other than that, there is nothing in this bill that speaks to \nproduction. The House bill has the incentives for deep Gulf drilling, \nwhich I think is very important and I certainly hope will come out of \nthe conference report if we can pass the bill before the Senate.\n  The House has ANWR, which the Senate does not, and about which we are \nfighting and talking today. ANWR is a significant addition to our own \nnational stability. The ability to control our destiny rests in ANWR \nand deep Gulf drilling. When you put those together with increasing \nnuclear capabilities, clean coal burning, wind, and other forms of \nrenewables, a balanced package of conservation and production includes \nANWR and the deep Gulf incentives.\n  As we debate this, I hope some of our Members, who have said they are \nvery concerned about drilling in ANWR, will look at the facts: ANWR has \nno trees in the part we will drill, it would only be done in the winter \nwhen you use ice roads and ice runways so there is no footprint on the \nland, where it would not hurt the environment, but, in fact, would be \nseverely restricted by environmental concerns.\n  If we are going to have affordable, reliable, and clean energy, we \nmust have a balanced package. Not to pass a bill that gives the amount \nwe import from Iraq and Saudi Arabia and Venezuela is hardly worth the \neffort because it\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nwouldn't give enough stability to control our own destiny.\n  It is essential we pass a bill that allows America to control our \neconomy and will produce American jobs. We are talking hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. That, in itself, helps stabilize our economy. That \nis why the Teamsters Union and the building and trade unions have been \nso helpful in this effort. I have never seen a union so committed and \nso sincere and work so hard as the Teamsters to try to keep these jobs \nin America. We have lost many jobs, thousands of jobs, since September \n11.\n  These are good-paying jobs that would become available if we drill in \nANWR and in the deep Gulf--not only the jobs on the rigs themselves, \nbut all of the companies that produce the pipe, all of the companies \nthat produce the oil-well supplies.\n  It would be a huge boost to our economy. However, most importantly, \nit would stabilize our economy from oil price spikes that will hurt our \nairline industry, that will hurt our factories, that will hurt \nprofitability and start causing more layoffs if we do not get control.\n  I thank my colleagues for finally allowing this amendment to come \nforward. It is our responsibility to pass this amendment for the \nlimited exploration in ANWR with the environmental safeguards and with \nthe very specific times that assure we would not have a footprint on \nthe land. This is our responsibility. It is a national security issue. \nIt is an economic issue. If we don't look out for America, who will? \nThis is the Senate of America and we must look out for the people, for \nthe jobs, for the security of our country. That is what we have been \nelected to do. It is our job and it is time to step up to the plate and \ndo the right thing for the people who have put their trust in us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken with the two managers of the bill. I would \nlike to propound a unanimous consent request that Senator Wellstone be \nrecognized for 20 minutes, Senator Lieberman for 20 minutes, Senator \nBond for 20 minutes, and Senator Lott for 10 minutes, in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, when I first came to the Senate, my \nfirst year here in 1991, I think with Senator Lieberman and Senator \nBaucus, we started a filibuster against well drilling in ANWR. We \nsucceeded. I am proud to be part of this effort as well.\n  With all due respect, as I listen to some of my colleagues speak, \nthey make the case we need to do this for our own national security; we \nneed to do this for energy independence; we need to do it for our \nconsumers. I think it has precisely the opposite effect.\n  We are talking, altogether, the equivalent of what the United States \nconsumes for 6 months. We are talking about oil that is not recoverable \nfor another 10 years. And we are also talking about continuing to \nbarrel down this oil path, this fossil fuel path, which is destructive \nto our environment.\n  I am an environmental Senator from the State of Minnesota. I am \nconcerned about global warming. In many ways, it is not our future. \nThere is a different future.\n  I come from a State, for example, a cold weather State at the other \nend of the pipeline. When we import barrels of oil or MCFs of natural \ngas, we export billions of dollars. Last year our energy bill was \nbetween $10 and $11 billion, but we have wind, biodiesel and ethanol, \nbiomass electricity, saved energy, efficient energy use, and clean \ntechnology and small business. There is another direction that we can \ngo. There is simply no reason to destroy a pristine wildlife refuge. \nThere is no reason to do this environmental damage.\n  One of the most moving meetings I ever had was with the Gwich'in \npeople who live on the land. They made the appeal to me as a Senator \nout of their sense of environmental justice not to let this oil \ndrilling go forward.\n  This whole idea of energy independence for America, based upon \nanother idea that we drill our way to independence, makes no sense. The \nUnited States of America has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, but \nwe use 25 percent of the world's supply. Saudi Arabia has 46 percent of \nthe world's supply.\n  On each point, I take my colleagues to task. I don't think we get \nmore energy independence from this. I don't think we get lower prices \nfor consumers. I don't think we do better for our environment. Frankly, \nthis proposal represents not a big step forward but a big leap \nsideways, at best.\n  On the jobs count, we can go back and forth and back and forth. \nSenator Kerry spoke; Senator Lieberman will speak. I know what the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute has said about the jobs. I also know when \nwe look at the Congressional Research Service, which we all look to as \nan independent research organization, we are talking about 60,000 jobs.\n  If you move down another path where you are not so dependent on big \noil and where you really look at renewable energy and saved energy, it \nis much more labor intensive, it is much more small business intensive. \nIt creates many more jobs, and it is much more respectful of the \nenvironment. It keeps capital in our communities. That is the marriage \nwe ought to make here on the floor of the Senate. We don't need to be \ndoing the bidding of these big oil companies any longer.\n  In part 2 of my presentation--I will stay under 20 minutes because \nthere are many Senators who want to speak--I want to turn my attention \nto a portion of this amendment, the second-degree amendment, which \npurports to address the very serious problem of legacy costs of \nsteelworkers or, in my State, taconite workers--that is to say, people \nwho are retired and who are losing their health care benefits and their \ninsurance benefits.\n  We need to respond to this pain. I am a part of a real effort, a \nbipartisan effort with Senator Rockefeller and Senator Specter, to deal \nwith legacy costs and to provide the help to people. This amendment on \nthis bill is not authentic. It is not a real effort. In many ways I \ncannot think of an amendment I am more in opposition to because I \nthink, frankly, it takes advantage of the pain of people and the hopes \nof people, it is an amendment that does not do the job.\n  Why in the world are we now being told on the floor of the Senate the \nonly way we can get relief to thousands of steelworker retirees around \nthe Nation, where their health benefits and their life insurance is in \njeopardy, is by tying it to what the oil industry wants to do in \nAlaska? I would like to know who made that linkage, and how anyone can \nargue that is the only way we can help steelworkers, retired \nsteelworkers, or, for that matter, whether or not this, in fact, is \neven a real effort.\n  Let me explain. The amendment does not deliver on the promise. \nSenators come out here and say the only way we can do this is from the \nroyalty from the oil drilling. The Senator from Alaska says the legacy \ncosts could be as high as $18 billion. I think the costs are about $14 \nbillion over 10 years. Drilling in ANWR cannot produce those kinds of \nFederal revenues. This amendment dedicates much of the ANWR revenue to \nother purposes.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan CBO, less \nthan $1 billion of the revenue from ANWR is going to be available, in \nthis amendment, to pay for steelworker legacy costs over 10 years. In \nother words, less than one-tenth of what the CBO says we need to cover \nthese legacy costs for steelworkers, for the taconite workers who are \nthe steelworkers in northern Minnesota--less than one-tenth of what we \nneed is covered by this amendment. And that presupposes the House \nRepublican leadership would sign onto it--they have not--and that this \nadministration would sign on to it. They have not.\n  So what we have here is a little bit of sleight of hand, where you \nget oil drilling for ANWR in the House bill--it is in there--and in the \nSenate bill. You get less than one-tenth of what we need for legacy \ncosts. That is all you get. But you do not have any prior agreement \nfrom the House Republican leadership, and they take it out in \nconference. You do not have any prior agreement from the White House. \nThey take it out in conference.\n  I have to tell you, this is in many ways this amendment tells a \nhorrible story. The steelworkers, hard-working people--the range has \nseen tremendous\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\npain. LTV workers are out of work. This doesn't help people out of work \nnow who are also losing their health care benefits. But for retirees, \nit says we can help you, but the only way is if you go along with what \nthe oil industry wants, and if you look at the fine print, you find out \nthis doesn't meet more than one-tenth of the cost.\n  Where is the commitment from the White House? Where is the commitment \nfrom the Republican leadership? I tell you what, we will bring a bill \nout to the floor which will cover legacy costs. Then all Senators get a \nchance to vote on it. Then we can decide who wants to provide the help \nto people.\n  By the way, it is also help to an industry that simply is not going \nto be able to compete without our doing so.\n  I want to say, the second-degree amendment--it is so interesting. I \nhave another piece here. There actually will be no oil produced on \nlease on the Coastal Plain which will be imported except to Israel. \nThere is even language of oil for Israel. Oil for Israel, legacy costs \nfor steelworkers--although not really. It is not real. But this seems \nto me to represent the old politics where you are trying everything to \nget the votes. You do not know what else to do so you start adding on \nall these other amendments, and you think you can buy off this group of \npeople or buy off this vote or get this vote or get this vote.\n  I am a Senator from Minnesota. I want to make the final distinction \nbetween a real effort and my position on ANWR so it is clear. I am \nopposed to the oil drilling. I led a filibuster when I first came here. \nI am opposed to it now. I will vote against oil drilling in ANWR, \nperiod.\n  The second distinction, I am for a real effort to deal with the \nlegacy costs of retired steelworkers. We have to. I am working with a \nbipartisan group of Senators who are equally committed.\n  If we want to talk about what kind of revenue we are going to need, \nit is going to be, over 10 years, about $14 billion. There is less than \n$1 billion revenues from actually ANWR revenues to cover the legacy \ncosts. That doesn't do the job.\n  The steelworkers know this and they have said so. We don't need to be \ndoing the bidding of the oil companies to help the steelworkers. We can \ndo that on our own. We can do that right here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  When we bring the legislation out, it will be a tough fight. I do not \nknow where the administration will be. Frankly, I think we need their \ncommitment first because if we do not get their commitment first, we \nwill never be able to provide it. It will be $14 billion over 10 years. \nWe have to do it for the industry, for this industry to have a chance, \nan industry that is so important to the national security of our \ncountry. This is a national security question. But we also have to do \nit to make sure we get the help to people who have worked so hard all \ntheir lives.\n  Where is the administration on this? I have not heard the \nadministration commit itself to anywhere close to the amount of revenue \nwe are going to need to cover legacy costs. The silence of the White \nHouse on this question is deafening. The silence on the part of the \nHouse Republican leadership is deafening. And the effort to have an \namendment attached onto this amendment which purports to help taconite \nworkers on the Iron Range but which really does not--as opposed to the \nreal effort and the real fight which we will make--troubles me.\n  There are too many people and too much pain. People are hurting. We \nshould not be playing around with this.\n  The second-degree amendment deserves to be defeated. The underlying \namendment deserves to be defeated. I urge my colleagues to vote against \ncloture, and I believe we will have a strong vote against cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMinnesota for what is, for him, a characteristically truthful, \npassionate, and in some senses, courageous statement. But it is typical \nof his service here. I thank him and all the others of our colleagues \nwho have joined in this filibuster to stop the drilling for oil in the \nArctic Refuge.\n  I must say for myself, in the 13 years now that I have been in the \nSenate, I cannot remember the last time I said I would participate or \nproclaim to participate in the leadership of a filibuster. But I have \ndone that in this case because I remember what Senator Byrd instructed \nus on some time ago--that the purpose of the filibuster, which is to \nsay the requirement for a supermajority to proceed with 60 votes, is to \nprevent us from allowing the passions of the moment to sweep through \nCongress and become law and do lasting damage to America's values and \ninterests.\n\n  If there ever was an example of how the temporary passions of a \nmoment, if responded to in law, could do permanent damage to our great \ncountry, its values, and interests, quite literally, then this debate \nover the drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is exactly \nthat.\n  I rise to oppose the amendments before us and oppose the motion for \ncloture. This proposal has been before us for a long time. I remember \ndiscussing it in my campaign for the Senate in 1988. It has risen and \nfallen over the years, but the basic heart of it remains wrong. It is \nto develop one of the most beautiful places in America, the Coastal \nPlain of the Arctic Refuge, known as the American Serengeti, inhabited \nby 135 species of birds and 45 species of land animals. The plain \ncrosses all five different ecoregions of the Arctic.\n  To take this magnificent, unspoiled piece of nature and develop it \nfor what? For a very small amount of oil no sooner than a decade from \nnow, which will not do what all of us say we want to do, which is to \nbreak our dependence on foreign oil. And it will provide no price \nrelief to American consumers of gas and oil.\n  The fact remains that drilling in the refuge would not produce a drop \nof oil for a decade--far beyond the time of the current crisis in the \nMiddle East which some have tried to use to gain support for this \nproposal to drill; and, even then, after the decade, far too little to \nchange in any meaningful way our dependency on foreign oil.\n  Even if we did allow the drilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge, this \nadministration's own Energy Department concluded that drilling in the \nArctic Refuge would only reduce our dependence on oil by 2 percent 20 \nyears from now. That is in the year 2020 or thereabouts. We would \ndepend on foreign sources of oil for 60 percent of the oil we use \ninstead of 62 percent. Is that 2 percent worth destroying this \nbeautiful piece of America?\n  The fact is, even if the oil were coming out of ANWR, notwithstanding \nsuggestions to the contrary, it would be priced at world prices. So \nthere wouldn't be any relief given to America's consumers if we allowed \nthe drilling for oil. No, the only way for us to remove our economy \nfrom the troubles in the Middle East that are going on now or that may \ngo on in years ahead is to end our dependence on foreign oil.\n  As my colleagues have said over and over again, we don't have much \noil left within American control and within America's land--3 percent \nof the world's reserves of which we use 25 percent every year. It is \njust not there. Therefore, if we want to break our dependence on \nforeign oil, as mighty a nation as we are militarily and economically, \nif we want to truly remain strong and invulnerable to pressure from \nnations that are weaker than we are but have oil within their land, \nthen we have to break our addiction on oil. We have to develop new \nsources of energy. We have to conserve more. We have to use the gifts \nof ingenuity and technology that have created so many miracles in our \ntime to help us power our society and our economy in a way that is not \nonly cleaner than oil but, most important to the moment, is within our \ncontrol and our possession. Surely, we can do it.\n  As part of doing this, I say, as so many others who oppose drilling \nfor oil in the Arctic Refuge have said, we are not opposed to all \ndevelopment of America's energy resources. Far from it. While we must \nmove beyond our dependence on fossil fuels, we cannot do it \nimmediately, requiring us to continue to pursue supplies of oil, and \nparticularly to pursue supplies of fuel. In fact, may I say as a \nDemocrat that I am proud that the Clinton administration actually \nleased more land for energy development than either the Reagan or \nprevious Bush administrations.\n\n  But those decisions were evaluated, such as the decisions we shall \nmake\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nand should make in the future, which is to determine the environmental \nimpact of that exploration--to hold the test up. How much energy will \nwe get? What damage will it do to our environment? By that test, the \nArctic Refuge does not pass.\n  Let me show my colleagues a map of the North Slope of Alaska. Here is \nthis very small area of the Coastal Plain. That is what our colleagues \nfrom Alaska want to be able to drill. Compare it to all the rest of \nthis that is now open and, in many cases, already leased for oil \nexploration. This is a very small part of that area. There is very \nactive exploration and drilling going on in the rest.\n  We are not asking to take out every possibility of development in \nenormous swaths of land. The fact is, companies have made promising new \ndiscoveries at the locations in blue that I have just indicated. For \nexample, last winter Phillips announced major discoveries of three \nsignificant oilfields in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The \noil companies have plans to drill up to 59 exploration wells over the \nnext 5 years. None of that is going to be affected by our desire to \nstop these amendments, which aim to get into that last very special and \nimportant area to preserve.\n  What about that small green section in the corner of the map that I \npointed to? The so-called 1002 area of the Arctic Refuge is the small \nbiological heart of the ecosystem. Again, we are not asking for the \nentire North Slope to be protected. We only ask for the small piece of \nland that serves as the most essential and vital habitat in the region. \nMuch to the contrary of what has been argued, the area is not even the \nmost promising of the North Slope for exploration for oil.\n  Let me quote from comments of an oil industry consultant in a recent \nNew York Times article:\n\n       There is still a fair amount of exploration risk here: You \n     could go through eight years of litigation, a good amount of \n     investment, and still come up with dry holes or uneconomic \n     discoveries.\n\n  Listen to the comments of a spokesman for BP Alaska:\n\n       Big oil companies go where there are substantial fields and \n     where they can produce oil economically. Does ANWR have that? \n     Who knows?\n\n  We owe it to the American people to determine whether the measure \nbefore us is responsible and responsive to our energy needs or whether \nit is simply a distraction that threatens to bring down the 400-plus \npages of good energy policy contained in the underlying bill.\n  To determine that, I think we need only to ask a very businesslike, \nvery American question: What do we gain and what do we lose? I can tell \nyou what we would gain in less than a minute. It would take days to \ncatalog what we would lose. We are prepared, if necessary, to take \nthose days to stop this authorization to drill in the Arctic Refuge.\n  What we would gain I have talked about. It would take at least 10 \nyears, and then there would be, at best, a 6-month supply of \neconomically recoverable oil--a yield that would be spread over 50 \nyears.\n  What are the costs? The visible damage would be substantial: an \nenvironmental treasure permanently lost, hundreds of species \nthreatened, international agreements jeopardized, oil spills further \nendangering the Alaskan landscape, and an increase in air pollution and \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  The unseen damage of drilling would be just as real: a nation--our \nNation--lulled into believing it has taken a step toward energy \nindependence, when it has done no such thing; a nation believing it is \nextracting oil using so-called ``environmentally sensitive'' methods \nwhen it will not--all in all, the American people misled in both \nmeanings of that term, not appreciating the reality, and also a failure \nof leadership by those of us who are privileged to serve here in \nWashington.\n  Finally, this plan would violate some of our most treasured American \nvalues. I speak particularly of the values of conservation. This plan \npresents a false promise of job creation, a false promise of economic \nstimulus, a false promise of energy independence, and a false promise \nof environmental sensitivity.\n  The first claim my colleagues make is that drilling in the Arctic is \na necessary part of a balanced, long-term energy strategy. But, I say \nrespectfully, calling drilling in the Arctic Refuge part of a strategic \nenergy plan is like calling oil a beverage. It is literally and \nfiguratively hard to swallow.\n  This ill-considered plan will do nothing to wean us from our \ndependence on foreign oil. But we do have such a proposal which would \ntake aggressive and strategic steps in pursuit of new sources of energy \nand better conservation; and that is the underlying bill fashioned by \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Daschle, and others working with them. It \nwould provide us with the resources we need in the short term by \nmeasures such as expediting the natural gas pipeline from Alaska and \nproviding the resources necessary to process the many lands already \nleased for exploration.\n  I want to share with my colleagues a few words on the question of the \neffect that drilling in the Arctic might have on jobs because that is \nan argument that has been made.\n  Drilling in the Arctic Refuge will actually create fewer jobs than \ndozens of the smarter alternatives that would create new industries \nusing American technology that will be encouraged by the underlying \nbill. The much quoted study claiming that the Arctic drilling would \nresult in 750,000 jobs has since been widely discredited. Even its \nauthors have acknowledged its methodology was flawed.\n  The real job creation figure, in my opinion, is much closer to \n45,000. Those jobs are short term, most of them in construction, as \nopposed to the permanent jobs that would be created by new energy \nindustries, new energy technology industries created all over America.\n  In order to try to settle this question, the Joint Economic Committee \nlooked at the question and found that the proposal would result in \nmodest employment gains, peaking at an estimated 65,000 new jobs \nnationwide in the year 2020. That would be an increase in projected \nemployment by less than one-tenth of 1 percent over that time--\ncertainly nothing to sacrifice a national treasure for, particularly \nwhen we have so many better, new energy alternatives that will create \nso many more longer lasting jobs.\n\n  I would like to say a word about the oil prices impact from drilling \nin the Arctic because American consumers are sensitive and, \nappropriately, accustomed to being concerned about the effect of world \npolitical and economic events on oil pricing and gasoline pricing and \nmay be deceived into thinking that if we drill for oil in the Arctic \nRefuge, we will be protected from international oil price fluctuations.\n  Drilling would have no impact on U.S. oil prices, even under the \ninflated estimates for petroleum potential that are cited by drilling \nadvocates because the price of oil is determined by broad, global \nsupply and demand, not by the presence or absence of an individual \noilfield.\n  Let's look, for example, at the case of Prudhoe Bay. In 1976--the \nyear before the largest oilfield ever discovered in North America \nentered production--a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil sold \nfor $12.65 and standard gasoline averaged--I take a deep breath here--\n59 cents a gallon. That was 1976.\n  Two years later, with Prudhoe Bay now adding more than 2 million \nbarrels a day to domestic supply, in 1978, West Texas Intermediate \ncrude had increased by more than 15 percent to $14.85 a barrel and \ngasoline averaged 63 cents a gallon. It went up. During the next 2 \nyears, as Prudhoe Bay production increased, oil prices also skyrocketed \nto $37.37 per barrel, while gasoline nearly doubled to $1.19 a gallon--\nall because of world oil prices.\n  This obviously does not demonstrate a relationship between Alaskan \noil and gasoline prices that will be paid around the world.\n  In closing, I want to get back to what this all says about our values \nand the choices we have to make. The question is, Are we willing to \ndestroy a habitat that is home to so much beauty and wildlife and \ndeprive future generations of visiting and experiencing this \nmagnificent part of our country in return for what will slightly--2 \npercent out of 62 percent--reduce our dependence on foreign oil two \ndecades from now and will not affect the price the American people will \npay for gasoline and oil?\n  I think the answer has to be no. Wilderness and the oil industry \ncannot\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\npeacefully coexist, certainly not in this case. So we are forced to \nmake a choice. I have made mine. I believe the American people agree. \nWhy? Because conserving our great open spaces is fundamentally an \naffirmation of our core American values. Conservation is not a \nDemocratic or Republican value; it is a quintessentially American \nvalue.\n  What lesson does it teach the generations that come after us if we go \nahead with this terrible mistake of drilling in the Arctic Refuge? That \nwe, as Americans, did not value our national heritage? That we did not \nconserve it for future generations of Americans? That we sold it for, \nessentially, effectively, the equivalent of a barrel of oil?\n  The ethic of conservation tells us it is not only sentimentally \ndifficult to part with beautiful wilderness, it is practically unwise, \nbecause in doing so we deny future generations a priceless piece of our \ncommon culture.\n  Let me close with the words of a great President, a great American, a \ngreat conservationist, and a great Republican, Theodore Roosevelt. In \n1916, he said this:\n\n       The ``greatest good for the greatest number'' applies to \n     the number within the womb of time, compared to which those \n     now alive form but an insignificant fraction. Our duty to the \n     whole, including the unborn generations, bids us [to] \n     restrain an unprincipled present-day minority from wasting \n     the heritage of these unborn generations. The movement for \n     the conservation of wildlife and the larger movement for the \n     conservation of all our natural resources are essentially \n     democratic in spirit, purpose, and method.\n\n  That is a quote from the great T.R.\n  They live and breathe with as much wisdom today as they did in 1916. \nIn addition to all of the pluses and minuses and balances and \nstatistics, they are the ultimate reason why we should reject these \namendments to allow for the drilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to discuss what I think is \none of the most important issues our Nation faces, and that is national \nsecurity.\n  Yes, this is an energy bill. More specifically, we are talking about \nan amendment to drill for oil in a small remote region of Alaska. What \ndoes that have to do with national security? Let's set the stage \nbecause the facts are getting lost in some wonderful rhetoric that \ntakes me away in a dream world. I don't recognize the place I know as \nAlaska when I listen to it.\n  We have tried to put out the facts. I have heard other things that \nare not quite so factual. Just as a beginning, over the next 20 years, \nU.S. oil consumption is projected to grow even after factoring in a \nprojected 26-percent increase in renewable energy supply, which we \nstrongly support, and a 29-percent increase in efficiency. Some people \nthink that is outrageous. Some people have a terrible guilt trip that \nthe United States uses so much oil we don't have enough, so we ought to \ngive up.\n  Drilling in ANWR reasonably could almost double our reserves. The \nUnited States has about 22 billion barrels of proven reserves, 3 \npercent of the world's reserves. ANWR could hold 16 billion barrels of \noil more. That is almost doubling. It is adding 16 to 22 billion in our \nreserves.\n  We use oil. There is no question about it. We have 5 percent of the \nworld's population. We use 25 percent of the world's oil. But we also \nproduce 31.5 percent of the world's total economic output. We are more \nefficient than the world as a whole, and we produce food and medicine \nand goods to improve the lives of Americans and people around the \nglobe.\n  Let's be serious. When we are talking about the fact that we use oil, \nyes, we do. There is no question about it. We need to make sure we have \nadequate oil reserves.\n  We just heard some information from the Energy Information \nAdministration that is a little outdated. There is more recently a \nletter of March 22 to Senator Murkowski from Mary Hutzler, Acting \nAdministrator for Energy Information. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of the letter and the addendum be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2002.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Energy and Natural \n         Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: Enclosed is a response to your \n     March 21, 2002, request for more information from our Service \n     Report, ``The Effects of the Alaska Oil and Natural Gas \n     Provisions of H.R. 4, and S. 1766 on U.S. Energy Markets.'' \n     The information provided relates to an increase in U.S. oil \n     production, a decrease in net petroleum imports, and the \n     change in net import expenditures across the range of cases \n     explored in the Report.\n       The projections show that all of the increase in U.S. oil \n     production from opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     (ANWR) to oil development comes from increased Alaska \n     production, rather than lower 48 production, regardless of \n     the size of the oil resource assumed to be contained in ANWR. \n     The size of the resource assumed to be in ANWR also has an \n     effect on imports. The larger the ANWR resource base, the \n     greater is the reduction in petroleum imports. Reductions in \n     net expenditures on imported crude oil and petroleum products \n     range from $5.7 billion in the low ANWR resource case with a \n     reference case oil price path to $18.3 billion in 2020 (in \n     2000 dollars) in the high ANWR resource case with a high \n     world oil price path.\n       If you have further questions, please contact me on (202) \n     586-6351.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Mary J. Hutzler,\n\n                                             Acting Administrator,\n                                Energy Information Administration.\n       Enclosure.\n\nAddendum to the Effects of the Alaska Oil and Natural Gas Provisions of \n               H.R. 4 and S. 1766 on U.S. Energy Markets\n\n       This addendum responds to a March 21, 2002, request from \n     Senator Frank H. Murkowski for more information from the \n     Energy Information Administration's Service Report, ``The \n     Effects of the Alaska Oil and Natural Gas Provisions of H.R. \n     4 and S. 1766 on U.S. Energy Markets.'' This addendum \n     provides projections on the increase in U.S. oil production, \n     the decease in net petroleum imports, and the change in net \n     petroleum expenditures across a range of cases.\n       All of the increase in U.S. oil production from opening the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil development \n     comes from increased Alaska production, rather than lower 48 \n     production, regardless of the size of the oil resource \n     assumed to be contained in ANWR. In 2020, the increase in \n     total domestic production ranges from 500,000 barrels per day \n     in the low resource ANWR case to 1.43 million barrels per day \n     in the high resource ANWR case (Table 1A). In 2020, ANWR is \n     projected to increase U.S. oil production by 8.9 percent in \n     the low resource case, compared to 25.4 percent in the high \n     resource case, compared to the Annual Energy Outlook 2002 \n     (AEO2002) reference case.\n       The size of the resource assumed to be in ANWR also has an \n     effect on petroleum import reductions. The larger the ANWR \n     resource base, the greater is the reduction in petroleum \n     imports. In 2020, the reduction in net imports of crude oil \n     and petroleum products is projected to range from 450,000 \n     barrels per day in the low ANWR resource case to 1.39 million \n     barrels per day in the high ANWR resource case, compared to \n     the AEO2002 reference case. More than 80 percent of the \n     import reduction is from lower imports of crude oil, as \n     opposed to product imports.\n       When combined with a high world oil price path, the opening \n     of ANWR has a similar impact on oil import reductions to the \n     opening of ANWR in a reference case (Table 2A). In the high \n     world oil price cases with mean and high ANWR resources, \n     import reductions in 2020 range from 780,000 to 1.32 million \n     barrels per day more than the high world oil price case \n     without ANWR. In the high ANWR resource case with high world \n     oil prices, oil consumption is reduced by half a million \n     barrels per day and about 70 percent of the import reduction \n     is from lower imports of crude oil.\n       Reductions in expenditures on imported crude oil and \n     petroleum products range from $5.7 to $16.0 billion compared \n     to the reference case in 2020, depending on the amount of \n     resource in ANWR (in 2000 dollars). Like the volume changes, \n     more than 80 percent of the reduction comes from lower crude \n     oil imports. In the cases which assume the opening of ANWR \n     and high world oil prices, expenditures on oil imports are \n     $11.2 billion to $18.3 billion lower than the high world oil \n     price case without ANWR. The impact on expenditures is \n     greater in the high world oil price cases, because of higher \n     oil prices.\n\n  Mr. BOND. They take a look at the estimates for oil produced at ANWR. \nAnd obviously, since it hasn't been drilled, we can only estimate. If \nit is not there, they won't drill. So this effort is all in vain, but I \nbelieve our U.S. Geological Survey and the other scientific experts \nhave a pretty good idea.\n  On average, if you take in the high and the low, U.S. Geological \nSurvey says there would be an increase of domestic production by about \n14 percent. If you assume the high case, there could be an increase of \n25 percent of domestic production. And when you have this kind of \nproduction, this is what it means for us.\n  People say that is not much oil. In Missouri, 71 years of consumption\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\ncould be sustained by that; or Connecticut, 132 years; Minnesota, 85 \nyears. To say that is not significant misses the picture very badly.\n  What would be our dependence upon foreign oil? Well, without ANWR in \n2020, the energy outlook is that 66.7 percent of our crude oil would \ncome in from abroad. If you take the medium case, the medium production \ncase, it would drop that to 62.2 percent. That is a 5-percent or 4-\npercent reduction. If it is the high case, it would go down to 58.7 \npercent, an 8-percent decline.\n  Those percentages make a huge difference. They make the difference \nbetween whether we have a situation where we can manage it in tight \nconsumption or whether we are up against the wall.\n  The 1.5-million-acre Coastal Plain, called the 1002 area, of the \n19.6-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, is one of the best \nplaces to look for the oil that America needs. When large chunks of \nAlaska were set aside in 1980, they saved a small 1.5-million-acre \nCoastal Plain out of 19.6 million acres. Why did they save it?\n  Well, we have the letter of July 3, 1980, from Senator Hatfield and \nChairman Henry Jackson. They were right when they wrote this in 1980. \nThey said:\n\n       One-third of our known petroleum reserves are in Alaska, \n     along with an even greater proportion of our potential \n     reserves. Action such as preventing even the exploration of \n     the Arctic Wildlife Range, a ban sought by one amendment, is \n     an ostrich-like approach that ill-serves our nation in this \n     time of energy crisis.\n\n  ``Ostrich-like approach,'' those are the words of Chairman Jackson. \nHe said: This is an energy issue. It is a national defense issue. It is \nan economic issue. It is not just an easy vote you can throw away and \nget some greenie points. Chairman Jackson concluded:\n\n       It is a compelling national issue which demands the \n     balanced solutions crafted by the Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee.\n\n  The only regret I have today is that the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee did not have an opportunity to craft a bill because I am \nconfident that they know the energy situation. And they would have said \nthat this is a necessary step.\n  The Energy Department said: The Coastal Plain is the largest \nunexplored, potentially productive onshore basin in the United States. \nThe USGS estimates there are up to 16 billion barrels of recoverable \noil, enough to offset Saudi imports for 30 years.\n  The 1002 area is not a beautiful piece of America. Congress set it \naside for oil exploration. The people who talk about this give these \nword pictures of a magnificent forest. I don't think they have been \nthere. When I go back home, I ask anybody: Have you been to the North \nSlope? Do you know what it looks like?\n\n  They tell me: No.\n  I kid my colleagues from Oklahoma that it is as attractive as a \nfrozen Oklahoma. Nobody I know has refused to drill for oil in Oklahoma \nbecause of its pristine beauty. I have been there. I have swatted away \nthe mosquitos.\n  This is what it looks like in the winter. My good friend, the senior \nSenator from Alaska, refers to it as the proverbial Hades. It is quite \na few degrees colder.\n  When I have been there in the middle of July, it has gone up to 38 or \n39 degrees, and there are those hardy souls who work out there in shirt \nsleeves, 39 degrees, because it is a heat wave.\n  This is the best we can show you. This is what the 1002 area looks \nlike. That is Kaktovik in the background. Look at this magnificent \nbeautiful piece of Alaska. Look a little flat? Look a little same? It \nis. But it has its own beauty. It really does.\n  One of the beauties is it has caribou and wildlife and birds, and \nthey thrive up there. Here is a picture of drilling in Prudhoe Bay. \nThis is Prudhoe Bay. If you can't see very well what it is, all these \nare caribou. The caribou herds thrive. The drilling does put permanent \nstructures in there. But the temporary rock and gravel roads make a \ngreat place for caribou to calve. And the birds are there and the other \nwildlife is there.\n  Somebody said we are going to destroy this great swath, this \nbeautiful natural reserve in Alaska. Are we talking about the same \nthing? We are talking about 2,000 acres, roughly 3 square miles, out of \nthe Coastal Plain of 30,600 square miles. That is less than the size of \nDulles Airport and the State of South Carolina. It is 3 square miles \nout of 30,600 square miles. This was in the area consciously set aside, \non a bipartisan basis, because Chairman Jackson and the people on the \nEnergy Committee then realized that this was where we were going to \nhave to get our natural resources.\n  What would happen if we drilled and they found oil? It would mean \n700,000 jobs would be created across the United States--not from a \nGovernment make-work program, but from private investment.\n  Wildlife habitat will be protected under the world's strictest and \nmost environmental standards. To drill out there, you have to take all \nthe equipment in, in the midwinter on ice roads, when it is 100 to 200 \ndegrees below zero. That is so cold that I cannot even think about it. \nBut you do that so you don't disrupt the land.\n  The caribou herd in and near Prudhoe Bay's oilfield is five times \nlarger than when development began. It is five times larger. Prudhoe \nBay is producing 20 percent of our Nation's oil production.\n  Now, let me say one other thing. As a result of my personal visit up \nthere, the people who live there, the indigenous people, the Native \nAlaskans, the people who live in the region, they understand that this \nis the way they can improve their lives. They can make a positive \neconomic contribution to the welfare of this Nation and benefit from \nit. They begged us to allow them to go ahead and develop a \nresource that will not interfere with their fishing and their hunting \nand the wildlife around them.\n\n  I heard it said that it would be 10 years before we got any oil. \nWell, it depends on how much Congress delays it, how many lawsuits. \nPerhaps as soon as 3 years after the first lease sale. There has \nalready been discovery on State lands of an oilfield that extends under \nthe Coastal Plain. We know it is there, just not how much. If the \nCongress were serious about it and we said we want to develop this in \nan environmentally sound manner and do it quickly, we could get it \nonline.\n  Contrary to a myth that many on the other side have spread, and as my \nfriends from Alaska pointed out, we are not exporting the North Slope \noil. None has been exported since May 2000. The average well at Prudhoe \nBay produces over 550 barrels per day, more than 45 times the 12.5 \nbarrels of oil produced per day by the average oil well in the United \nStates. If the oil in ANWR is locked up, a lot of wells will have to be \ndrilled to replace it, or we will be back in the situation in which we \nfound ourselves several weeks ago.\n  By a very significant majority, 63 Members of this body, said we want \nto continue to be able to give American consumers the choice to drive \nSUVs, light pickup trucks, or vans. We ordered the Department of \nTransportation to use the best scientific and technological information \navailable to push for increased oil and petroleum efficiency, gasoline \ncombustion efficiency, and do everything we can to increase the \nefficiency. But don't force unrealistic standards that merely require \nus to move down to smaller and smaller cars until we are driving around \nin golf carts. If we are going to continue to supply the energy needs \nthat my colleagues who voted with us on the CAFE amendment said we are \ngoing to need, we need the oil coming from ANWR. This is absolutely \nessential for our economy, for the sound development, the business of \nindustry, and, most of all, to supply the transportation needs of our \nfamilies.\n  For each dollar of crude oil and natural gas brought to the market, \nthere will be $2.25 of economic activity generated through the economy. \nThe actual impact of the ANWR oil could be anywhere from $270 billion \nto $780 billion. These are all good economic arguments. But this is not \nthe only question.\n  Keeping the oil production in the United States means we are buying \nless oil from overseas. We keep our domestic dollars at home. These are \nU.S. dollars not going to foreign countries, with leaders who may be on \na mission to destroy our entire existence.\n  If that was too subtle for some colleagues, let me explain it. Just \nlast week, we watched Iraq announced a month-long oil export embargo to \nprotest Israel's response to the terror\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\ncampaign. Some argue that Iraq only produces 1.5 billion barrels a day, \nroughly 4 percent of world production. We are told Saddam Hussein is \nonly supplying 8 percent of U.S. imports. It ought to be time that we \ntell the American people this country can not and should not maintain \nthat level of dependence on Iraqi oil.\n  Last year, we paid Saddam Hussein $6.5 billion. Does that sound like \ngood policy? Do the American people really want to continue any efforts \nto benefit a tyrant such as Saddam Hussein, who continues his reckless \noppression of his own people while threatening the security of the \nworld with the development of weapons of mass destruction?\n  Madam President, let me answer that question emphatically. The United \nStates must not continue this type of dependence, resulting in billions \nof dollars going directly to one of this century's most demented and \nruthless rulers. The time has come for the United States to develop its \nown ability to produce oil and petroleum so we don't have to depend on \nhim.\n\n  I commend President Bush for his actions in the Middle East, and I \nfully support him in the efforts to defend our national security. If it \nshould occur one of these days in the near term when the President, we \nwould hope in consultation with this body, deems it necessary, for the \nprotection of peace and safety in the world and our own security, that \nwe take on Saddam Hussein and his tyrannical regime once again, we must \nnot be held hostage by the fact that they are supplying us oil. Right \nnow, they have us over the oil barrel when we have oil and petroleum \nproducts in the United States we can develop to maintain our security.\n  Drilling for oil in Alaska is not just a good, sound option, it is a \nnecessity. We must decrease our dependence on foreign oil every way we \ncan. As I said a couple weeks ago, the Senate wisely adopted \nreasonable, scientifically based mandates to increase our automobile \nfuel usage. The CAFE provisions mandate an increase in standards that \nwill help reduce our dependence. We provide incentives for alternative \nfuels such as electric power, solar-powered vehicles, and other \nprovisions that include the use of biodiesel in bus fleets and school \nbus systems.\n  Yes, we must have renewables. Last week, the Senate voted in \nopposition to an amendment by my colleagues from California and New \nYork that would have undermined the renewable fuels standards. I \napplaud my colleagues for opposing that effort because renewable \nstandards are one important part of our energy policy. We need to make \nevery effort to decrease our dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n  I urge my colleagues in the strongest possible way to support the \nefforts of the Senators from Alaska. I have been there. I have gone \nwith them to visit this region. I have seen the oil exploration \nunderway. I have seen the wildlife running on those plains.\n  Madam President, when they finish, there will not be any signs of \ndevelopment, and it will still be a barren, mosquito-filled plain in \nthe summer, with its natural attributes and an absolutely hideously \ncold winter, and the wildlife, the birds, and the fish that thrive up \nthere will continue to thrive. We are not destroying anything.\n  Even if they were going in to burn and turn it upside down, we are \ntalking about 2,000 acres--2,000 acres, just a little over 3 square \nmiles out of 30,600 square miles. There is no way anybody can \nlegitimately say we are going to No. 1, destroy anything, because we \nare not destroying it. It is not a pristine wilderness that will not \nsurvive the drilling. We have shown how it can be done, and we are only \ntalking about a thumbnail size out of the entire area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator's time has now \nexpired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank you for that good news, and I urge \nsupport. I ask my colleagues to support the Senators from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that has \nbeen offered by Senator Murkowski to allow for exploration in this area \nknown as ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Also, it is very \nreasonable to pursue what will happen with the funds we would get as a \nresult of opening up this wildlife area. It is important that we look \nat this issue in the most serious way.\n  I just got off the phone with the President's National Security \nAdviser, Condoleezza Rice, talking about the situation in the Middle \nEast. I appreciate the fact Secretary Powell has been there and has \nbeen meeting with the interested parties trying to make some progress \nin that very difficult situation. I am satisfied that we have a better \nfeel now of what can be done, that progress was made in dealing with \nthe situation on the northern border of Israel. But the fact is, we \nstill have a very volatile situation in the Middle East, one that could \ncause disruptions in a number of ways from that region of the world.\n  The oil from Saudi Arabia comprises about 25 percent of the oil the \nworld gets. We have had threats from Saddam Hussein. There is no \nquestion in my mind that he would use any tool of destructive \ncapability he could find, including cutting off the oil that comes from \nIraq.\n  I still agree very strongly with Senator Murkowski that it is \nimpossible to explain why we would be getting oil directly or \nindirectly from Iraq, refining it, and then sending it back to the \nregion to be used in our planes to patrol the region to keep Saddam \nHussein and the Iraqis under control.\n  The oil supply in the world is not in a stable situation. We saw this \npast week in Venezuela a change in Government, and then the former \nGovernment was back in place. This is a country we depend on. I believe \nthe third largest amount of oil we get comes from Venezuela.\n  The point is, we are in danger. Our national security and our \neconomic security could be threatened by the instability in the world, \nby the uncertainty or the unreliability of the sources of this oil and \ngas. If we start losing part of it or large portions of it, we could be \nin a very difficult situation very soon.\n  We need a national energy policy. We need additional production, and \nI predict today that if we do not take advantage of the oil we know \nexist in ANWR, in that northern extremity of Alaska, we will have some \nvery bad situations evolve in the next few months, or in the next \ncouple of years. I do not want to say I told you so, but when the \ngasoline prices go up, when supplies cause dislocation, when we have \nrolling brownouts, it will be traceable right back to this body and to \nthis vote.\n  We need to understand this is for real. We need our own domestic \nenergy supplies, and all the supplies that might be available. We \nshould make better use and more use of nuclear power, but we have \npeople who do not want nuclear power. They do not want to have a \nnuclear waste repository. We should make use of hydropower more, \nalthough in some areas there are people who do not want hydropower \nbecause it might adversely affect some species.\n  We need additional oil and gas, but yet we have people in America who \ndo not want to have exploration off the east coast, the west coast, the \ngulf coast, and now in the northern part of Alaska.\n  We need to make greater use of coal. We can have clean coal \ntechnology that allows us to have the benefit of this source of energy \nwithout being a problem for the environment. Again, a lot of people \noppose that.\n\n  What do they propose doing? How are we going to have the energy we \nneed to fuel the growing economy we all want in America? I think we \nshould do all of these things, and that is my problem with this bill. \nThis bill has a lot of conservation incentives and alternative fuels. \nWe have the tax bill that came out of the Finance Committee. There is a \nlarge amount of tax incentives for hybrid sales in automobiles, and to \nencourage getting these marginal wells back in usage. We have all of \nthat in the bill but not what we need for energy production.\n  The point that is so critical to me--this map I am sure my colleagues \nand the American people have seen. The area we are talking about is an \nextremely small portion on the Arctic Ocean, and the people of the \nregion and the Senators and Congressmen of the State want this to \nhappen. We are being told we cannot do that.\n  We are being told by people from States in the furthest extremities \nof the eastern part of the United States:\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\nWe do not think this should happen in this area.\n  Whatever happened to Senatorial courtesy and trust? For years as a \nMember of Congress in the House and Senate, I put my greatest \nreliance--although I reserve the right to make up my own mind--but I \nput an awful lot of reliance on the Senators and Congressmen from the \nStates.\n  When I had the Congressman from North Dakota say to me and others: \nYes, the Garrison Diversion is something we want--a lot of \nenvironmentalists said we should not have the Garrison Diversion--I \ntook the word of then-Congressman, now-Senator Dorgan about the need \nfor and the justification for the Garrison Diversion.\n  We have had lots of debates in years gone by about water supply in \nArizona. I did not have a Mississippi dog in that fight. I did not know \nall the ramifications of the argument. Who did I rely on? I relied on \nthe word of the Congressmen and the Senators and the people in the \nlocal region.\n  Why are we not doing that now? Two of the most effective, most \nrespected Senators in this body, the Senators from Alaska, Mr. Stevens \nand Mr. Murkowski, are pleading with us to give them the opportunity to \ndo this in a safe, reliable, affordable way in a very small region.\n  We have the letter from the Alaska Natives who live in this area \nasking us to support opening of ANWR, and basically pleading with us to \ngive them an opportunity. The people who live in the region want it. \nThey know it can be done safely. They know it can be done in a way that \nwould benefit the people economically. I am really at a loss for words \nto explain why this should not be done.\n  There is a national movement of some kind by various groups saying we \nmust not let this happen, but when it comes to dealing with energy \nindependence, when it comes to dealing with the likes of dictators in \nIraq such as Saddam Hussein, when it comes to creating new jobs, this \nis the thing to do. It is supported by labor unions. The people who \nwould be involved in transporting the supplies, the people who would be \ninvolved in building the pipelines, they are for this.\n  For those who are worried about the environment, I have never seen a \nproject that has stronger environmental rules that would have to be \nenforced than any project I know of, and they have narrowed the area. \nThey have offered to put more land in pristine reservations. Everything \npossible has been done to make it possible for us in the United States \nto get the benefit of this exploration and this pipeline and the supply \nwe would get from it.\n  So when we look at our current situation, relying on 60 percent \nforeign oil for our energy needs, when we look at the instability in \nthe world, in several countries where we rely on the oil they produce, \nand then when we look at the benefits we get economically, and the \njobs, this is legislation we clearly should pass.\n  An energy policy without ANWR is not complete. In my own case, I have \nspoken about the ability to explore in what is known as the Destin Dome \nin the Gulf of Mexico, close to where I live. I want it because we need \nit. I know it can be done in an environmentally safe way and in a way \nthat will not be damaging to the fish in the Gulf of Mexico, and yet we \nhad a tremendous debate in the Senate about opening up even a part of \nthat area. Yet those of us who live there, the Senators from Alabama \nand Mississippi, although not the case with the Florida Senators, were \nsaying: This can be done, and we need to do it.\n  I believe a map speaks a million words in explaining what is \ninvolved. So I thank Senator Murkowski for his diligence. He has tried \nevery way in the world to make sure the American people understand the \nimportance of this, that they understand this could be done in a way \nthat would benefit America with probably somewhere between half a \nmillion and 735,000 new jobs, that it would reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Some people said if we started today, we would not get it online for \nmonths, perhaps years. Eventually we are going to have to do this. The \ntime will come when America is going to have serious energy problems \nand we are going to have to go where we can get energy the quickest, \nand one of those places is this particular area on that northern slope \nof Alaska.\n  So I wanted to come and add my support for this effort. I do not know \nhow in the world we can justify not being for this. I believe President \nClinton vetoed this effort in 1995, and yet the Congress has passed \nthis several times over the last 20 years. I believe that is correct \ninformation. We should do it once again.\n  I urge my colleagues, if they are undecided or if they have been \nleaning the other way, think about it again. The situation has changed. \nThe need for this oil and the gas that might be involved has changed \nsince this debate began. I would not want to be a Senator who voted no \non this 6 months from now, because we could be having huge problems. \nThis could be a vote that would haunt us forever. I do not mean that as \na threat, I mean it as a plea. We need this.\n\n  The Senator from Louisiana and I are very closely situated to the \nGulf of Mexico. We know we can get oil and gas with the technology now \navailable. That technology is so sophisticated. one does not just take \na potshot down and hope they hit. When they look at the charts, they \nknow exactly where the little shelves are. They can go right to where \nthe oil is.\n  Some of the best fishing I have ever experienced in my life was \naround the oil rigs off the coast of Louisiana, not far from the \nChandelier Islands. I know the area. I have been there. I have not been \nto ANWR.\n  Senator Murkowski and I will have to debate where fishing is the \nbest. He has tried to take me to Alaska, but I said: ``Isn't it very \ncold up there? Isn't it a pretty barren area?'' I would rather go where \nthere are palm trees or oil rigs already in place.\n  I say to my colleague from Alaska, I really appreciate the job he has \ndone. I am going to work with him to the very last minute to see if we \ncannot do what is right, not just for the Senator from Alaska, not even \njust for Alaska. This is for America. If we are from some remote State, \nfor us to say this little piece of 2,000 acres cannot be used to \nproduce oil and gas is irresponsible, in my opinion, when you look at \nwhat we are faced with in terms of threats around the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this. Let us get a good energy bill for \nthe good of our country.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Does the leader know what the temperature is outside \ntoday?\n  Mr. LOTT. In Washington, DC, I think it is approaching 95. What is \nthe temperature on the northern slope of Alaska?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I was hoping the minority leader would respond by \nasking me a question. Having been there exactly a year ago today, with \nSenator Bingaman, who left his gloves at home and we had to find a pair \nof socks for him--we later found him a pair of gloves--and Gale Norton, \nSecretary of the Interior, it happened to be 77 below zero in Barrow. \nThat gives some idea of the contrast between Washington, DC, and \nAlaska.\n  Mr. LOTT. In April it is still that cold?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It was that particular day a year ago today. So I \nthink that is a little reference to the harshness of the environment up \nthere.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to \nwhich I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation,\n\n                                     Kaktovik, AK, April 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Daschle and Lott: The people of Kaktovik, \n     Alaska--Kaktovikmiut--are the only residents within the \n     entire 19.6 million acres of the federally recognized \n     boundaries of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). \n     Kaktovikmiut ask for your help in fulfilling our destiny as \n     Inupiat Eskimos and Americans. We ask that you support \n     reopening the Coastal Plain of ANWR to energy exploration.\n       Reopening the Coastal Plain will allow us access to our \n     traditional lands. We are asking Congress to fulfill its \n     promise to the Inupiat people and to all Americans: to \n     evaluate the potential of the Coastal Plain.\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\n       In return, as land-owners of 92,160 acres of privately \n     owned within the Coastal Plain of ANWR, the Kaktovik Inupiat \n     Corporation promises to the Senate of the United States:\n       1. We will never use our abundant energy resources ``as a \n     weapon'' against the United States, as Iraq, Iran, Libya and \n     other foreign energy exporting nations have proposed.\n       2. We will not engage in supporting terrorism, terrorist \n     States or any enemies of the United States;\n       3. We will neither hold telethons to raise money for, \n     contribute money to, or in any other way support the \n     slaughter of innocents at home or abroad;\n       4. We will continue to be loyal Alaskans and proud \n     Americans who will be all the more proud of a government \n     whose actions to reopen ANWR and our lands will prove it to \n     be the best remaining hope for mankind on Earth; and\n       5. We will continue to pray for the United States, and ask \n     God to bless our nation.\n       We do not have much, Gentleman, except for the promises of \n     the U.S. government that the settlement of our land claims \n     against the United States would eventually lead to the \n     control of our destiny by our people.\n       In return we give our promises as listed above. We ask that \n     you accept them from the grateful Inupiat Eskimo people of \n     the North Slope of Alaska who are proud to be American.\n           Most respectfully and sincerely,\n                                                   Fenton Rexford,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I wonder why they call it barren.\n  Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous consent request \nmomentarily, but I do want to get the attention of the minority leader \nfor 1 second. I am going to have my colleague and friend, John Ensign, \nspeak to Senator Lott based upon the speech Senator Lott just gave. \nWhen the Senator talked about senatorial courtesy and how we should \ngive deference to what Senators from a State want, I want Senator \nEnsign to talk to Senator Lott about Yucca Mountain because it would \nseem fair to me, using the analogy that has been stated for drilling in \nAlaska, the same should apply to Nevada. But we will see.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am always delighted to talk to Senator Reid and Senator \nEnsign. I think maybe the Record will reflect in the past that I did \nlisten very closely to some of his pleas. But we will have a chance to \ndebate that another day.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the two managers. I have \nvisited with virtually everybody in the Chamber. The staff has visited \nwith various other staff members. We have 11 Senators who have \nindicated a desire to speak on this matter, which works out so each \nside goes back and forth, and the time almost works out perfectly also.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin be recognized for 20 \nminutes; following Senator Durbin, that Senator Burns be recognized for \n15 minutes; following Senator Burns, Senator Cantwell be recognized for \n15 minutes; next, Senator Voinovich for 20 minutes; Senator Landrieu \nfor 30 minutes; Senator Feingold for 20 minutes; Senator Domenici for \n15 minutes; Senator Dorgan for 20 minutes; Senator Craig for 30 \nminutes; Senator Graham for 30 minutes; and then Senator Nickles is the \nlast speaker who I have been told wishes to speak, and there would be \nno time limit on him.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object, I want to work with the \nmajority whip. Senator Stevens is going to want to speak and does not \nwant to be limited to any time commitment.\n  Mr. REID. No problem.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am also going to reserve my right to extend my \nremarks. I do not want this list to exclude other Members who may be \nwanting to speak. In the interest of time, I am quite willing to \nproceed with the list as given, subject to the gentlemen and ladies who \nare in the Chamber currently looking for recognition.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask unanimous consent that following Senator \nNickles, Senator Stabenow be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is the understanding, Mr. President, that we will \ngo back and forth.\n  Mr. REID. The consent I propounded does that. The time works out \nquite closely, also.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I reserve the right of Senator Stevens to come in to \nthis sequence if it is necessary. I assume Senator Bingaman will \nreserve that right for himself, as I will, and the majority leader \nwould, as well.\n  Mr. REID. I certainly think the two managers of the bill should be \nable to say whatever they believe is appropriate during this debate. \nBut so we have some understanding, until we get this agreement, there \nis no extended remarks of the two managers. We get this done and \nMembers can speak as long as they wish.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object, I reserve that for \nSenator Stevens because he is in a hearing and he may want to come \nback. I ask unanimous consent he be allowed to come into the sequence \nwhich would involve an interruption.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is fair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Senator Bingaman and I work well together.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I again propound the request, with the \nexception of Senator Stevens, who is involved elsewhere. If he wishes \nto speak, he will be allowed to speak at the appropriate time for \nwhatever time he desires.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We would like to have a copy of the list because there \nare two lists working.\n  Mr. REID. We will get that to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I am not mistaken, I am the first \nSenator under the unanimous consent request. I thank the Senators from \nNevada and Alaska.\n\n  This has turned out to be a historic debate about energy in that we \nhave spent more time on it than any other issue I can remember since I \nhave come to the Senate in the last 5 or 6 years. It is important we do \nspend the time, because if the issue is energy security and energy \nindependence, we see on a daily basis why it is not only timely, but \nabsolutely essential for our national security.\n  We followed the issues in the Middle East for many reasons. There are \nthose who feel a special attachment to the nation of Israel and the \nalliance of the United States with that nation. There are those who \nfollow it for many other reasons. Let's be honest. One of the reasons \nwe consistently look to the Middle East is because it is a source of \nenergy for the United States. We were involved in a war a little over \n10 years ago, the Persian Gulf war, because of the invasion of Kuwait \nby Iraq. President Bush's father made it clear at the time this was \nabout energy, about oil.\n  Time and again, the United States focuses its attention on the world \nbecause of our dependence on other countries for the oil and gas they \nsend to our shores. It is an essential part of our economy, an \nessential part of our daily lives. We Americans are very happy and \ncomfortable with our automobiles and trucks. We like that part of being \nin America. However, it has a price. It has a price not only in \nmaintaining the vehicle but a price in terms of our relationship with \nthe world.\n  The purpose of this energy bill is to talk about how we establish \nsome energy independence and energy security, how we make the right \ndecisions today so we can say to our kids and our grandchildren, in the \nyear 2002, we took a look at the world and said: We will change a few \nthings in the United States so we don't end up totally dependent on \nsome foreign country for our energy, so that your life and your economy \nis going to be less dependent on what happens in Saudi Arabia or the \ngulf states or any other part of the world.\n  That is as noble an aspiration as could be asked for in political \nlife. It generated, thanks to the leadership of Senator Bingaman of New \nMexico, this lengthy tome of suggestions for change when it comes to \nenergy in America. What is curious is the administration, President \nBush, Vice President Cheney, and others, came up with their own plan. \nThat plan was fraught with controversy and political intrigue. At one \npoint, we asked a very simple question of the administration: With whom \ndid you meet? Which corporations and companies and associations did you \nmeet with to draw up your energy plan for America's future?\n  To the surprise of this Senator, and many others, Vice President \nCheney basically said: That is none of your business. We are going to \nput together\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\nour plan and submit it to you. We hope you like it, but you don't have \na right to know with whom we consulted.\n  In the meantime, the Government Accounting Office has taken the \nadministration to court to produce the names of the people with whom \nthey worked. A court in the District of Columbia ordered the disclosure \nof some of the names. To the surprise of virtually no one, the major \ngroups that wrote the administration's policy were the oil and gas \ncompanies, the energy companies. They are the ones that put it \ntogether. Yes, there was an invitation for an environmental group to \ndrop by and say, hello, have a sandwich, and leave, but the substantive \nwork and the appointments were with the energy companies. It is \nreflected in the administration's approach.\n\n  Why are we debating the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge? Frankly, for \nreasons it is hard to explain, it is the centerpiece of the George W. \nBush administration's energy plan for the future of America. We have \nspent more time talking about that tiny piece of real estate in Alaska \nthan many other issues that do bear on the importance of energy \nsecurity.\n  One would be led to believe, if one didn't know the facts, that if we \ncould just drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, if we could \nscatter that Porcupine caribou herd, put up our pipeline and drill, \nAmerica could breathe a sigh of relief. We finally found the oil we \nneed for the next century.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. That is why you have to ask \nyourself, if this is not the answer to our energy prayers, why are we \nspending so much time at this altar? We are spending more time debating \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge than many other critically \nimportant elements of our energy security.\n  It has a lot to do with the group that put together the \nadministration's energy plan. Let's be honest. These oil companies own \nthe rights to drill the oil. If they can get into this wildlife refuge, \nif they can drill, they will make some money out of it. It is part of \nbusiness. It is a natural part of the free market economy. It isn't \nabout energy security. It is about these oil companies and their rights \nto drill and make a profit.\n  Let me tell you what that means in real terms. Here is a report, not \nfrom a left-wing group but from the Energy Information Administration, \npart of the Department of Energy for the George W. Bush administration. \nHere is what they have said about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge:\n\n       Net imports are projected to supply 62 percent of all oil \n     used in the United States by the year 2020. Opening the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is estimated to reduce the \n     percentage share of net imports to 60 percent.\n\n  So if we give to those oil companies the right to move into this \nwildlife refuge, the right to drill in territory and land which we have \nset aside and held sacred now for over 40 years, what does America get \nas part of the deal? A net reduction in our dependence on foreign oil \nby the year 2020 from 62 percent of all the oil we use to 60 percent. \nThe estimates are all of the oil taken out of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge over a 10-year period of time would amount to 6 months' \nworth of energy for the United States.\n  Why, then, if that is what we are talking about, is this the \ncenterpiece of the administration's policy? It goes back to the point I \nmade earlier. It is the centerpiece of their policy because the people \nwho wrote the policy, the special interest groups that sat down and \ncrafted the policy, have another agenda. It isn't energy security; it \nisn't energy independence. It is about profitability.\n  Look at the impact of ANWR on net imports. The green line is net \nimports with ANWR; the blue line is net imports otherwise. They are \nalmost indistinguishable. The chart says the same thing that President \nBush's Department of Energy has already said.\n  So we find ourselves in the position of debating this issue. When \nPresident Eisenhower created the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--and I \nmight remind people, President Eisenhower was not viewed as some \nradical environmentalist--he was following in a long line and a long \ntradition in America where Presidents of both political parties took a \nlook at their heritage, America's lands, and said: There are certain \nthings which we want to honor, respect, and not exploit.\n  They took a tiny piece of real estate in one of the most remote parts \nof America, in this new State of Alaska, and said: This piece we will \nprotect as a wildlife refuge.\n  For over 40 years, President after President, Democrat and \nRepublican, respected that--until today. Today we have an argument from \nthis President and his supporters in Congress that it is time for us to \nmove in and start to drill.\n\n  I suggest to my colleagues that the Arctic Coastal Plain we are \ndiscussing is a unique natural area, one of America's last frontiers. \nThese precious lands will be part of our legacy for future generations. \nBefore we cavalierly say to these oil companies: pull in the trucks, \npull in the rigs, and start drilling, we ought to step back and reflect \nas to whether or not this is sensible or responsible. I do not believe \nit is.\n  In this energy policy we have brought to the floor, there are a lot \nof suggestions about reducing our dependence on foreign oil. There was \none that came to the floor for debate and a vote a week or two ago \nwhich went to the heart of the issue. Of all the oil we import to the \nUnited States today from overseas, 46 percent of it goes for one \npurpose--to fuel our cars and trucks. That is right. Forty-six percent \nof all the oil coming to the United States goes to fuel our automobiles \nand trucks. That number is supposed to grow to almost 60 percent in a \nfew years. In other words, our demands for more vehicles to be driven \non the highway as we want is going to increase our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Doesn't it stand to reason that part of any responsible energy bill \nwould talk about the fuel efficiency of the cars and trucks that we \ndrive?\n  Not in the eyes of the Senate. We had a vote to put a new fuel \nefficiency standard on the books and it lost 62 to 38. The Big Three \nautomakers and their supporters came to the Senate and said: We do not \nwant you to improve the fuel efficiency and fuel economy of vehicles in \nAmerica.\n  The Senate said: You are right. We are not going to touch it.\n  Why is that significant? It is significant for this reason. Look at \nwhat would happen here in terms of the billions of barrels of oil we \nwould have saved just by increasing the fuel efficiency of cars and \ntrucks in America. If we had gone up to 36 miles a gallon by 2015, with \n10-percent trading of credits back and forth, the red line shows we \nwould be saving somewhere in the range of 14 billion barrels of oil \ncumulative; at 35 miles per gallon, you see the blue line is higher \nbecause it is at an earlier date that it is implemented.\n  You have to scroll down here, if you are following this, and look \ndown low and see what the ANWR means in comparison. It is this line \nhere at the bottom, barely over 2 billion barrels of oil in the entire \nhistory of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  This Senate rejected real savings when it came to fuel efficiency and \nfuel economy. We rejected that. We rejected it, incidentally, because \nthe Big Three in Detroit and their lobbyists in Washington effectively \nlobbied the Senate.\n  But today we are being asked to go ahead and drill in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, a refuge that has been set aside for 40 \nyears, and we know it doesn't even hold a candle to the savings \nenhanced fuel efficiency would generate in terms of our energy \ndependence.\n  The lesson and the moral to the story is there are a lot more \nlobbyists for the oil companies than there are for the Porcupine \ncaribou that live in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That is the \nbottom line. There are not a lot of people out there with antlers, \nwaiting in the lobby, but there are a lot of folks with Gucci loafers \non, and they are waiting to tell us: Don't touch the Big Three when it \ncomes to the fuel efficiency of vehicles.\n  I think it is shameful to think that between 1975 and 1985 we passed \na law that doubled the fuel efficiency of cars to a level of about 28 \nmiles per gallon, and that we have not touched that issue for 17 years. \nThat tells me we have been derelict in our responsibility. If we really \ncared about America's independence and security, we would be focusing \non fuel efficiency, fuel economy of the cars and trucks we\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\ndrive. But this Senate walked away from it and said, no, we don't want \nany part of that debate. We are with the Big Three. We are with the \nspecial interests. Instead, let's figure out how we can drill in the \nANWR.\n  That is not the only thing we have ignored. Renewable energy sources, \nwhat are those? Those are the ones that are not expended such as fossil \nfuels. Once you burn the tank of gas, it is gone into the atmosphere. \nWe get the energy out of it and leave the pollution. Renewable energy \nsources, such as wind and solar energy and hydrogen cells and those \nsorts of things, fuel cells, all of those have the potential of \nenvironmentally friendly sources of energy. How much do we in the \nUnited States today rely on that kind of renewable energy to generate \nelectricity? To the tune of about 4 percent of our total, about 4 \npercent.\n  Some of us said: Why don't we take on, as a challenge to America, \nincreasing our dependence on renewable environmentally friendly energy \nsources such as wind power and solar power and fuel cells and hydrogen \npower? Let's increase the renewable portfolio standard to 20 percent \nover a 20-year period of time. Senator Jeffords of Vermont offered \nthat. I cosponsored it. It is not an unrealistic goal. The State of \nCalifornia currently relies on renewable energy sources for more than \n10 percent of its electricity.\n  We can, as a nation, do it, reduce dependence on foreign energy. But \nthis Senate said no because the oil companies, the special interests \nout in the lobby, in their three-piece suits, said: No, we are not \ninterested in that. We don't own the wind. We don't own the Sun. We own \nthe oil. We own the gas. Stay dependent on that, America.\n  So we have a modest goal of increasing our use of renewable energy \nfrom 4 percent to 8 or 10 percent. At a time when we are dealing with \nan energy bill, I think we are suffering from anemia. We are afraid to \nstep out and do what is necessary to make America less dependent on \nforeign fuel.\n  Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is the answer to \nevery lobbyist's prayer. But, honestly, it is not the answer to \nAmerica's prayer. America is praying this Senate comes to its senses, \nthat we understand we can make and must make bold and important \ndecisions today. If we say to the Big Three, you have the wherewithal \nand the technology to produce a more fuel-efficient vehicle so we can \nstill move our kids to soccer games and be safe on the road, they can \ndo it. We issued that challenge before and they did it. They didn't \nlike it. They resisted it.\n  In 1975, when we increased fuel efficiency, the Big Three said that \nwas impossible. Double fuel economy in America? Let me tell you what is \nwrong with that idea: Technically impossible; the cars will be so small \nthey will look like gocarts, they will not be safe, Americans won't \ndrive them, and you are going to drive jobs overseas. That was the \nargument in 1975.\n  Guess what. We ignored them, passed the law, and none of those four \nthings happened. By 1985, we doubled fuel economy and none of those \nthings happened. So in the year 2002, when we get in the same debate \nabout fuel efficiency, what did the Big Three say? Technically, it's \nreally impossible, Senator, for us to improve fuel economy. The cars \nwill be so tiny they will be like gocarts. People won't like them. They \nwon't be safe. And people are going to buy cars from overseas. The same \narguments, the same empty arguments. It shows an attitude of some of \nour manufacturers in this country which in a way is embarrassing.\n\n  Why is it when it comes to the new generation of vehicles on the \nroad, the hybrid vehicles getting 50 or 60 miles a gallon, they all \nhave Japanese nameplates on them? I don't get it. This is the greatest \ncountry in the world, with the strongest military in the world, the \nbest schools in the world, the best engineers in the world. Yet when it \ncomes to automobiles, we are satisfied with the bronze medal every day \nof the week. Frankly, the Senate has not stepped up to its \nresponsibility in adding the provisions that are necessary to make sure \nour energy independence is established.\n  We want energy security but not at the expense of America's last \nfrontier. If we are serious about energy security, we have to reduce \noil consumption in the vehicles in our country. A comprehensive, \nbalanced energy policy will provide for oil and gas development in \nenvironmentally responsible areas--not the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  We can establish conservation measures. We can cut down on our energy \nconsumption. We owe that not only to ourselves but to our children.\n  As James E. Service, a retired vice admiral of the Navy, wrote in a \nrecent Los Angeles Times op-ed:\n\n       National security means more than protecting our people, \n     our cities and our sovereignty. It also means protecting the \n     wild places that make our nation special. Drilling the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge . . . just doesn't make good sense \n     or good policy.\n\n  He said that on January 14 of this year.\n  But someone before him really set the tone for Congress to think \nabout it. His bust is out in our lobby. His name was Teddy Roosevelt. \nAs Vice President, he presided over this Senate. He is the one who \nreally told America to be mindful of the heritage you leave. I quote \nhim:\n\n       It is not what we have that will make us a great nation; it \n     is the way in which we use it.\n\n  Teddy said that almost 100 years ago. On this vote, we will find out \nwhether the Senate remembers Roosevelt's advice to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I think if we have learned one thing from \nthis exercise on energy legislation, it is that we found trying to mark \nup a bill on the floor of the Senate is pretty difficult. I was \nreminded that back in 1992 we almost did the same. We didn't have quite \nthe spirited committee action on energy, but we still got into the same \nkind of a bind when it came to the floor. Maybe it doesn't make a lot \nof difference.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that today we should be talking \nabout a policy we can shape to take us into the future. We are not only \ndealing with the acute situation we find ourselves in today, but where \nwe want to be in 20, 30, 40, or 50 years from now. What do we do about \nnew technologies, and which technologies are able to be developed in \nthat time? That question indicates to me we have a great deal of \nflexibility to allow those new technologies to evolve and be used as \nsoon as they are developed. Whatever we do in Government mandates, \ntherefore we should make sure they are not frozen in place. We should \nallow those new ideas to grow.\n  Market forces will dictate more in the way of conservation than any \nmandate by the Federal Government has ever done.\n  Let me remind you that if gasoline goes to $2 a gallon, you are still \nspending more money for the water you buy in that filling station than \nyou are for the gasoline. You will start looking for conservation \npractices in the things you do in your traveling habits.\n  Fossil fuel has been the primary fuel of our economy since the turn \nof the last century. For over 100 years it has served us well, and it \ncould for the next hundred. However, it should not be the only fuel we \nuse in our everyday lives.\n  New technology has moved us to unlimited use of renewables and \ndifferent sources in the evolution of conservation technology and \npractice. We know the present conditions and situations. We should deal \nwith them and decide what our policy will be after resolving this acute \nsituation. The condition we find ourselves in today is about energy \nsecurity. To those who would use the flimsy argument saying we should \nuse less and produce less, I say there is another one that is acutely \nin our makeup; that is, energy security is economic security is \nnational security. What direction that takes us in is very important. \nOur challenge should be that debating this bill will take us beyond \nthat situation. The world condition is at hand, and it should be dealt \nwith right now.\n  I have iterated many times that we are still dependent on fossil \nfuels. The switch from those fossil fuels is a process that will take a \nlong time, and it will be very expensive.\n  What is at stake here? Let us look at the real facts instead of the \nmisinformation that is floating around this town. Let me remind you \nthat the American people know what is at\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\nstake, and they are not comfortable with the facts they are given. They \nare equally uncomfortable with what is happening on the floor of this \nSenate.\n  I have one simple question: Why are we importing oil from Iraq? \nAgreed, they are allowed to sell oil under the U.N. resolution. The \nincome derived from those sales is to be used to buy food and medical \nsupplies for the citizens of Iraq. If Saddam Hussein sells us anywhere \nfrom 650,000 to 850,000 barrels of oil a day, and also sells some oil \non the black market, what is he doing with that money? Where do you \nthink it goes? I will tell you where it doesn't go. It doesn't go \nto the citizens of Iraq. He buys arms and technology to equip his army \nand support terrorist activities around the world. In fact, we are told \nthat Iraq is paying $25,000 cash to any family who loses a suicide \nbomber. That is going way over the line.\n\n  From the Gulf, we import about 10.8 million barrels of oil a day, and \n1.5 million barrels comes from Saudi Arabia. Nearly a million barrels \ncome from Iraq.\n  Let us take a look at this tiny little spot called the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. Keep in mind that when it was created, this \nlittle area was set aside for oil and gas exploration and production. \nThat is the reason it was set aside--not the whole Arctic Plain, but \njust that little footprint of 2,000 acres or less.\n  Conservative estimates put the total production at about 1.35 million \nbarrels a day. That would replace 55 years of oil from Iraq and 30 \nyears of oil imports from Saudi Arabia.\n  The reserves in ANWR are estimated to be 10 billion barrels. That is \na conservative estimate.\n  Remember how we underestimated Prudhoe Bay. It has produced nearly 20 \npercent of our domestic production in the last 25 years.\n  Since 1973, domestic production has decreased by 57 percent. We are \nonly producing about 8 million barrels a day, and we are using 19 \nmillion barrels a day.\n  Anybody who doesn't understand that didn't take basic math in the \nsame grade school where I went to school, which is a little country \nschool.\n  We hear every day on the floor of the Senate that we should be \nconcerned about our balance of payments. We should be concerned about \nit. Last year alone, we sent $4.5 billion to Saddam Hussein's Iraq for \nhis oil.\n  As I said, energy security is economic security is national security.\n  This has a job impact. We heard all kinds of estimates. But we know \nthis won't happen without the effort of labor. Yesterday, if you had \nstood with the heart and soul of the labor folks in this country and \nheard their arguments that this should happen, then you would \nunderstand why the Nation supports the development and exploration of \nthis tiny spot.\n  We have people living in Montana who work on the North Slope. We have \nhad since the first day they started production up there. They jump on \nairplanes, spend a couple of weeks, and come home for a week. It is \nimportant to my state. If Prudhoe were built today, the footprint would \nbe around 1,500 acres--64 percent smaller than it is. ANWR will impact \n2,000 acres out of 1.5 million acres on the Coastal Plain.\n  I have been up there. I have seen the Porcupine caribou herd. It has \ngrown about three times in size during the last 20 years. That is where \nthey calve. They don't stay there all winter. They are a migrating \nherd. Nothing has kept them from migrating. The people who live in that \narea depend on that herd. That is a source of food supply for them. \nWhen they migrate, that is when they get their winter stores. They \ndon't have grocery stores like we have down here. They don't want \nanything to happen to that herd. I don't think they are going to \nmislead us on how that herd will be impacted.\n  Oil and gas production and wildlife have successfully coexisted in \nthe Alaskan Arctic for over 30 years. The figures bear that out.\n  Despite what is told and the misinformation that flies around here, \nthe folks on the Coastal Plain support this by 75 percent. They \nunderstand what the revenue does. They understand that it provides a \ngovernment service which is demanded by them. That is even taking into \naccount the money that it pumps into the National Treasury. Anybody on \nthe Budget Committee around here would understand that also.\n\n  I know how this impacts a State represented by two Senators who have \nstood in this Chamber and have fought for their people every day. It is \nlike us going to southern Illinois and saying: You can't have any more \noil production down there. But they can't say it because there are no \npublic lands. But in Alaska there are, and that is the difference. \nWithdrawal of public lands from any exploration of natural gas in the \nStates of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and some in New Mexico, has cost \nthe American people 137 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. And that is \ngoing to be the fuel that produces the electricity of the future. We \nthink it is for ``the environment,'' when it could be lifted, produced, \nand moved with hardly a disturbance to any of the surface of our land.\n  And, yes, you are going to see natural gas turn up as a \ntransportation fuel.\n  What we are doing in this argument defies common sense. These are the \nfacts. They should not take away from our investment into new \ntechnologies and our determination for conservation. I will not let \nanybody else redefine the word ``conservation'' because it is defined \nas a wise use of a resource. We should move forward on R into new \ntechnologies. Even coal--and Montana is the ``Saudi Arabia'' of the \ncoal reserves in this country--it is there, it is handy, it is \naffordable, and it is ready for use.\n  Our investment in fuel cell technology will be an important part of \nour energy mix, and we should not depart from its development. I will \ntell you what fuel cells do. Fuel cells are to the electric industry \nwhat the wireless telephone is to the communications industry. They are \nsafe, clean, and now we have a chance to make it affordable. We should \ncontinue our work in that area.\n  But, in the meantime, let's do what common sense tells us to do: \nLet's use that little footprint afforded to this country for the \nproduction of energy because energy security is economic security, is \nnational security.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, seeing no other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I would like to take just a few minutes to share with you \na chart that has already been identified on a couple of occasions but I \nthink needs a little further identification.\n  As I show you on this map what happened to Alaska in 1980. The ANILCA \nland law was passed, and our State was, in effect, gerrymandered by \nCongress.\n  I want you to look at all those stripes across an area that is one-\nfifth the size of the United States because it is entirely the \nTongass--this area in southeastern Alaska where our capital, Juneau, is \nlocated--Ketchikan, our fifth largest city; Wrangell; Petersburg; \nSitka; Haines; Skagway--this is a national forest. There are 16 million \nacres in that national forest. The only thing they forgot is people \nlived in the forest. The communities were there. The assumption was \nthat there would be no real justification for the State selecting land \nthere. It was not even an issue in statehood in 1959.\n  The reason it was not an issue is there was an assumed trust between \nthe people of Alaska and the Congress of this country that those people \ncould live in that forest, they could make a living off the \nrenewability of the resources, the fish and the timber.\n  Previous to statehood, the Department of Interior ran the fisheries \nresources of Alaska. They did a deplorable job. They figured that one \nsize fits all. We actually had our fishermen on self-imposed limits.\n  My point in showing you this detail is this is what happened to \nAlaska. Rather than have a resource inventory of those areas that had \nthe capability for minerals, oil and gas, timber, and fish, there was \nan arbitrary decision made. It was a cut deal by President Carter. As a \nconsequence, these areas of Alaska were withdrawn. They are wilderness \nor refuges or sanctuaries, but they were all withdrawn from \ndevelopment.\n  I want you to take a closer look at the map because here is where the \nreal influence of America's extreme environmental community entered \ninto this national effort.\n  You notice here on the map, clear across where the Arctic area comes\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\ninto play, this is the general area of the Arctic Circle. There is only \na little tiny white spot that was left for access, if you will. And the \naccess we have from the Arctic, from Prudhoe Bay, is through that \nlittle area where we have this red line, which is the pipeline that \nbrings 20 percent of America's total crude oil to market in Valdez.\n  They tried to gerrymander, if you will, the designation of land in \nthis State by closing access. We have this huge area out by Kotzebue \nthat is mineralized. They closed that off. This did not happen by \naccident. This was a cut-and-dry deal in 1980. Now we are living with \nit today.\n  I recognize my good friend from Ohio is in the Chamber, so I will be \nvery brief in making this point because I am going to be making several \npoints throughout the remainder of the day.\n  We have heard quotes from Theodore Roosevelt by some of the speakers. \nI would like to ask just for a brief reflection on another quote in \n1910. Theodore Roosevelt said:\n\n       Conservation means development as much as it does \n     protection. I recognize the right and duty of this generation \n     to develop and use the natural resources of our land, but I \n     do not recognize the right to waste them or to rob, by \n     wasteful use, the generations that come after.\n\n  Let's look briefly at the record. I am referring to the \nadministration of Jimmy Carter in 1980, and the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act. I quote from President Carter's \nremarks on signing H.R. 39 into law, December 2, 1980. I quote former \nPresident Carter:\n\n       This act of Congress reaffirms our commitment to the \n     environment. It strikes a balance between protecting areas of \n     great beauty and value and allowing development of Alaska's \n     vital oil and gas and mineral and timber resources.\n\n  Our timber resources are totally tied up. We do not have the \navailability of developing them. As a matter of fact, there is more \nwood cut for firewood in the State of New York than we cut \ncommercially. We have lost our pulp mills under the previous \nadministration. We have lost our saw mills.\n  So as President Carter indicated, it allows development of ``Alaska's \nvital oil and gas and mineral and timber resources.'' It is a promise \nthat has been broken. He further states:\n\n       A hundred percent of the offshore areas and 95 percent of \n     the potentially productive oil and mineral areas will be \n     available for exploration or for drilling.\n\n  I can tell you, you cannot get a permit offshore, you cannot get a \npermit on the Arctic Ocean to drill today. Go down to the Department of \nInterior and try it.\n  Lastly, I am going to refer to that same meeting, December 2, 1980, \nand the remarks of Representative Udall of Arizona.\n  His conclusion was:\n\n       I'm joyous. I'm glad today for the people of Alaska. They \n     can get on with building a great State. They're a great \n     people. And this matter is settled and put to rest, and the \n     development of Alaska can go forward with balance.\n\n  That is a pretty strong statement. The citizens of the territory of \nAlaska bought that. Of course, we were a State at that time in 1980. We \nbought it, we believed that we could get on with the development of our \nState. The ability to get on with the development of Alaska was the \nability to penetrate the mentality of the Congress and any given \nadministration on the right that we have, as American citizens, to \ndevelop our State.\n  We have been, for all practical purposes, eliminated. Because every \ntime we want to do something, we have to cross Federal land. We don't \neven have access to our State capital. These were promises made to the \npeople of Alaska. These were promises that have not been kept by the \nFederal Government.\n  As we debate the area, the 1002 and ANWR, again, I ask both \nRepublicans and Democrats to recognize, it is not a wilderness. It has \nnever been a wilderness. It is a refuge. The Senator from Louisiana has \ncharts that show us what has happened in refuges. We have oil and gas \nexploration in them all the time.\n  This was reserved for Congress. Only Congress can open it. But for \nthose who think it is an untouched, spectacular area, there are people \nwho live up there. There is the village of Kaktovik.\n  Let's put this discussion in real terms. We are fighting for the \nrights we thought we had obtained when we became a State, the right to \nresponsibly develop the State. This chart shows oil and gas production \nin refuges around this country. Don't tell me that somehow we are doing \nsomething wrong by trying to open a refuge in the Arctic.\n  We will have a lot more to say about this. I did want to address the \ninconsistency and the broken promises that have been made and the fact \nthat our small delegation, Senator Stevens and I and Representative \nYoung, feel very strongly, as do the residents of Alaska, that this \ntrust has been broken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of permitting \noil exploration in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. Permitting oil \nproduction in ANWR will help ensure that the United States is better \nable to meet our growing energy needs in an environmentally sound \nmanner, create and retain hundreds of thousands of jobs, boost our \ndomestic economy, and protect our national security.\n  America's need to continue to fuel our economic recovery and \nguarantee future success will require us to produce ever greater \namounts of energy to keep up with the demand.\n  You can see from this chart, according to the Department of Energy, \nwe have a huge gap between our domestic energy production and our \noverall energy consumption right now. What's more, between now and \n2020, we will have to increase energy production by more than 30 \npercent just to keep up with growing demand.\n  This looming energy crisis requires us to enact a comprehensive \nenergy policy, the likes of which we have never had before in this \ncountry: a policy that harmonizes energy and environmental policies, \nacknowledging that the economy and the environment are vitally \nintertwined; a policy that won't cause prices to spike, hurting the \nelderly, the disabled and low-income families as we experienced in the \nwinter of 2000-2001, particularly in the Midwest; a policy that won't \ncripple the engines of commerce that fund the research that will yield \nfuture environmental protection technologies, technologies that can be \nshared with developing nations that currently face severe environmental \ncrises; and, most importantly, a policy that protects our national \nsecurity and prevents market volatility by increasing domestic energy \nproduction.\n  The current situation in the Middle East and the resulting price \nincreases we have seen at the pump give us a taste of how badly we need \nan energy policy and how much we need to turn towards domestic sources \nto meet that goal. However, as we rely on our own strengths for the \nanswers to the coming energy crisis and though we are blessed with \nlarge reserves of oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear fuel, as well as \naccess to renewable sources of energy, we must remember that no single \nsource of domestic energy is sufficient to meet all our Nation's energy \nneeds. That means we have to broaden our base of energy sources and not \nput all our eggs in one basket.\n  If we were some other nation, diversifying our energy supply might be \na great challenge, but God has blessed the United States of America \nwith resources to solve this problem. Conservation has proven \nsuccessful in reducing energy demand. So often people say: We aren't \ndoing enough to conserve. We are. By incorporating technology \nbreakthroughs into the production of energy-efficient automobiles, \nhigh-efficiency homes, more efficient appliances and machinery, \nconservation has succeeded in saving us millions of dollars while \nsimultaneously improving our environment.\n  Let's look at this chart. According to the 1995 DOE report, the most \nrecent data available, from 1972 to 1991 the United States saved more \nthan $2.5 trillion through conservation. That is a lot of foreign oil \nthat we didn't have to buy. It is safe to say that we have saved much \nmore money since then, underscoring that conservation efforts deserve \nour continued attention.\n  We currently rely very little on renewable sources of energy. In \nfact, wind and solar together make up less than one-tenth of 1 percent \nof our current total energy production. Additionally, they are \nexpensive and heavily subsidized. In fact, the average cost per \nkilowatt hour of electricity from a newly installed windmill is 5 cents \ncompared to 2 cents per kilowatt from a coal-fired facility.\n  On top of this, wind and solar cannot be stored, creating reliability \nproblems and making it difficult to spread our costs out predictably \nover time.\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\n  Currently, total renewables production, which includes geothermal, \nsolar, wind, hydro and biomass, reaches only 8 percent of our overall \ndomestic energy production. We should work to increase that, however, \nsince these forms of energy are environmentally friendly and because \nthey can help reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources. However, \nwe also must be realistic about our challenge. Because renewables make \nup such a small piece of our overall energy picture today, they don't \nhave the capacity to meet our needs in the timeframe we are facing. A \nsudden, forced shift in these sources would severely strain their \nunderdeveloped capacity, causing shortages and price spikes that would \nhurt our economy.\n  For example, the requirement in the Daschle bill that utilities \ngenerate 10 percent of their electricity from renewable sources of \nenergy is estimated to increase the cost of electricity nationwide by 5 \npercent and a whole lot more in a State such as Ohio. Just as we \ndevelop new sources of electricity generation, we should continue to \nencourage development of new energy sources for transportation.\n  In the 1970s, the United States recognized the need for diverse \nenergy supply by expanding the use of natural gas, coal, nuclear, \nhydropower, and other renewables, and decreasing the use of oil for \nnon-transportation uses. In 1978, non-transportation uses of oil in \nthis country accounted for almost 50 percent of our oil consumption. \nToday, these non-transportation uses account for about one-third of our \noil consumption.\n\n  Though home heating oil use remains high in certain regions of the \ncountry, particularly in the Northeast, consumers have increasingly \nsought other sources such as natural gas to heat their home. In \naddition, oil-fired powerplants are virtually nonexistent today in the \nUnited States. Crude oil prices and policy priorities encouraged \nsubstituting oil with other fuels for our non-transportation needs, but \noil products still make up 95 percent of the energy used for \ntransportation in the United States.\n  This number will not decrease unless fuel cells and hybrid vehicles \nbecome more economically viable. But their day is coming. In fact, in a \nrecent meeting I had with General Motors executives in Detroit, I was \ntold that the company sees fuel cell technology becoming a viable power \nsource in the next 10 to 15 years. We are talking reality. It is not \nscience fiction to think that our children and grandchildren will see a \ntime when the roads are traveled by cars that run on hydrogen and give \noff only water.\n  An amendment from the Finance Committee will help encourage the \ndevelopment of these new technologies, providing an estimated $2.1 \nbillion in tax incentives for the use of alternative vehicles and \nalternative motor fuels.\n  We are doing a lot right now to try and move away from the use of oil \nin this country and bring down our demand for it through research, \nincentives, and many other things. Encouraging these new fuel sources \nis worthwhile, but until they become more widely adopted and cost \neffective, we will need to continue relying on oil to move people \nacross town and across the country and to move raw materials and \nfinished goods.\n  As I have mentioned, much of this oil comes from foreign sources. We \nmust increasingly compete against other nations for this oil. As demand \ngrows in response to the expanding world economy, the world economy is \ngrowing. For example, at one time, China produced enough oil to meet \ntheir domestic needs and still have some left over to export. Today, \nthey import oil.\n  What if there was an opportunity in the United States to greatly \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil by using domestic sources of oil? \nFortunately, with the amendment offered by Senator Murkowski, we have \nthat opportunity. For over 40 years, Congress has debated whether or \nnot to develop the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR. Senator \nStevens' words yesterday were eloquent and very informative on the \nhistory of ANWR. I suggest that those who did not hear the Senator, \ntake the time to read his remarks in the Congressional Record. His \nremarks should help them to make a better decision on this amendment.\n  As Senator Stevens reminded us, this debate is about our national and \neconomic security, but, sadly, the reality of ANWR has always been \nmisconstrued and used as a political tool. I have to say, those who are \nopposed to allowing a small portion of ANWR to be used to help meet our \nenergy needs have done an admirable job in trying to sway public \nopinion. Unfortunately, they have incorrectly painted this as a \nwholesale abandonment of the Alaskan wilderness.\n  Thus far, they have had vast success in muddying the facts. Today, \nthough, I will make clear what ANWR is, what we are talking about, and \nwhat limited, precise oil exploration in ANWR means for our Nation.\n  Created in 1960, ANWR was expanded to 19 million acres in 1980 by the \nAlaska National Interest Land Conservation Act. While designating 8 \nmillion of the original acreage as wilderness, Congress treated the 1.5 \nmillion acres of ANWR's Coastal Plain very differently. I am sure \nSenator Stevens may remind us again, but back in 1980 Congress debated \nthe same subject. At that time, Mark Hatfield, the ranking minority \nmember and Henry Jackson, Chairman of the Energy Committee, wrote a \nletter urging their colleagues to support exploration in ANWR because, \nand I quote:\n\n       One-third of our known petroleum reserves are in Alaska, \n     along with an even greater proportion of our potential \n     reserves. Actions such as preventing even the exploration of \n     the Arctic Wildlife Range, a ban sought by one amendment, is \n     an ostrich-like approach that ill-serves our Nation in this \n     time of energy crisis.\n\n  They also said that the issue:\n\n       . . . is not just an environmental issue, it is an energy \n     issue. It is a national defense issue. It is an economic \n     issue. It is not an easy vote for one constituency that \n     affects only a remote, faraway area. It is a compelling \n     national issue which demands the balanced solution crafted by \n     the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n\n  I agree with the points raised in this letter. This is a national \nsecurity issue as well as an economic security issue. When President \nCarter signed the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act in \n1980, he stated this legislation:\n\n       . . . strikes a balance between protecting areas of great \n     beauty and value and allowing development of Alaska's vital \n     oil and gas and mineral and timber resources.\n\n  Section 1002 of the Act mandated a study of the Coastal Plain, or \n1002 area, and its resources. After almost 7 years of researching the \nwildlife and the impact of oil development, the study recommended full \ndevelopment and described the area as ``the most outstanding petroleum \nexploration target in the onshore United States.''\n\n  The report recommended full development of this area while also \nstating that it is the most biologically productive part of ANWR. This \nmeans that in 1987, when the report was issued, it was believed that \nproper environmental steps, combined with technology, which is now 15 \nyears old, would not significantly harm the wildlife.\n  However, the report did say that if the entire area were leased and \noil were found, then there would be major effects on the wildlife. But \nno one here is talking about that. We are talking about 2,000 acres for \noil exploration--2,000 acres out of 1.5 million acres. That is less \nthan one-half of 1 percent of the total area.\n  This is one of the biggest misrepresentations about this debate. The \nentire area of ANWR's Coastal Plain is about the size of the State of \nSouth Carolina. To the casual observer, he or she thinks drilling means \ndrilling throughout the entire refuge, but it is really just a 2,000-\nacre site. That is about the size of Dulles International Airport. If \nyou look at this map, you can see just how small the area is compared \nto the vast wilderness of the Alaska wilderness and ANWR.\n  The two major concerns of the ANWR debate--and the issues that divide \nthe two sides--are the environment and oil. While we know a lot about \nthe wildlife and impact of oil development, we only have estimates \nabout oil because the prohibition on drilling prevents a definitive \nanswer to the question.\n  We know that the central Arctic caribou herd has grown from 3,000, \nwhen development began at Prudhoe Bay, to as high as 23,000 caribou. We \nknow that development on Prudhoe Bay, which was discovered in 1967, \nwould be 64-percent smaller if built today. We know\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\nthat a drill pad that would have been 65 acres in 1977 can be less than \n9 acres today. We know that Alaskan oil companies now build temporary \nice pads, roads, and airstrips instead of using gravel. We know that \nthe pictures in the commercials and magazines refer to ANWR as \n``America's Serengeti.'' They must not be talking about the Coastal \nPlain, for this area is a winter wasteland, where temperatures \nregularly reach 70 degrees below zero for 9 months of the year, with 58 \nconsecutive days of darkness.\n  We also know that the Coastal Plain is along the same geological \ntrend as the productive Prudhoe Bay, and it is the largest unexplored, \npotentially productive onshore basin in the United States. But nobody \nknows for sure what is under there because we are prohibited from \nfinding out.\n  In addition to the initial 1987 report, the Department of the \nInterior has issued assessments in 1991, 1995, and 1998 based on \nupdated data from the U.S. Geological Survey. According to the USGS, it \nis estimated that the Coastal Plain holds between 5.7 billion and 16 \nbillion barrels of recoverable oil, with an expectancy of about 10.3 \nbillion barrels. The Coastal Plain can hold more than that, though. For \nexample, the North Slope, was originally thought to contain 9 billion \nbarrels of oil, but it has produced 13 billion barrels to date.\n  What if there isn't any oil? We know that technology is so advanced \nfor Arctic drilling that there can be hardly, if any, environmental \ndamage from exploratory drilling. For example, an exploratory well \ndrilled in 1985 in the area adjacent to the Coastal Plain did not \naffect the wildlife. If the area does have as much oil as estimated, \nthe benefit could be great. To put the numbers in perspective, Texas \nhas proven reserves of 5.3 billion barrels. There is a 95-percent \nchance that ANWR will yield more oil than all of Texas and a 5-percent \nchance that there is three times as much oil as in Texas.\n\n  One of the half-truths being spread by those opposed to this \namendment is that there is only 6 months of oil in the Coastal Plain. \nThis is misleading because it assumes no other sources of oil--no \nimports, no other domestic supply--except from ANWR. The real truth is \nthat, according to the Department of Energy, ANWR's oil supply would \nlast between 30 to 60 years.\n  Last week, Iraq, one of the ``axis of evil'' nations, announced a \nsuspension of oil exports. Iraq supplies more than 9 percent of the 8.6 \nmillion barrels of oil we import every day. It is a longstanding U.S. \npolicy not to allow oil to be used as a political weapon. We cannot be \nheld hostage to external interests or pressures. Iraq's embargo last \nweek shows there are some countries that still think they can apply \npressure in this manner.\n  I am not upset at the fact Iraq shut its spigot because I have little \ndoubt we will make up whatever dropoff occurs from other sources. \nFrankly, I think it is incredible that we send $24 million a week and \n$4.5 billion a year to a nation that is clearly an enemy of the United \nStates and over which our military flies regular combat missions. It \ndoesn't make sense.\n  Iraq's action puts the embargo card back on the table as a weapon to \ntry to shape American opinion and Government policy. Who is to say \nother leaders in the Middle East might not take the same step in the \nfuture? We know who they are today. But who are they going to be \ntomorrow, particularly in light of growing Muslim extremism. Some of my \ncolleagues may say since all our oil does not come from the Middle \nEast, we can look to other nations. That is true, and one such \nsupplier, Venezuela, is currently undergoing political and labor strife \nwhich has a tremendous impact on its oil industry. Indeed, reports by \nVenezuela's Industrial Council earlier this week indicated that 80 \npercent of the country's oil industry has been shut down. When Chavez \nretook the Presidency, oil prices went up almost 5 percent out of fear \nhe will keep a tight rein on the production volume.\n  It is not out of the question to say our Nation may once again face \nthe long lines we experienced during the 1973 oil embargo. You would \nhave thought we would have learned our lesson and worked to develop \nother oil. However, we have seen our oil imports rise from 35 percent \nin 1973, and we are now at 58 percent. We have made very little \nprogress in achieving our energy independence in the nearly three \ndecades since the 1973 embargo.\n  We had the chance to make significant progress in 1995 when the \nSenate approved exploratory drilling in ANWR. Unfortunately, President \nClinton vetoed the bill. Had he not, the Energy Information \nAdministration estimates that oil could have been flowing to us by as \nearly as next year.\n  When ANWR is developed, the Energy Information Agency projects that \npeak production rates could range from 650,000 barrels to 1.9 million \nbarrels per day. The lowest of this estimate would replace the 613,000 \nbarrels per day we imported from Iraq in 2000. The highest estimate \nwould replace 76 percent of the 2.5 million barrels a day we import \nfrom the Persian Gulf in 2000.\n  It is very simple: We need to break our dependence on unreliable \nforeign energy sources. If the enemies of America are willing to take \nout the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, does anybody doubt that if \nthey had a chance to impact our energy supply, they would do it?\n\n  Shouldn't we be able to at least find out how much oil is in ANWR \nespecially with this commonsense environmentally sensitive amendment? \nThe amendment includes many environmental protections, such as seasonal \nlimitations, reclamation of land to its prior condition, use of the \nbest available technology--including ice roads, pads, and airstrips for \nexploration, and more.\n  Our dependency on foreign nations also threatens our economic \nsecurity. Price shocks and manipulation from OPEC between 1979 to 1991 \nare estimated to have cost the U.S. economy about $4 trillion, while \npetroleum imports cost the United States more than $55 billion a year \nand account for over 50 percent of our trade deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, development of the Coastal Plain will \nbring up to $350 billion into the U.S. economy and create up to 735,000 \njobs at home. In my state of Ohio, the number of jobs created is \nestimated at 52,000 for the petroleum industry and 31,000 for other \njobs, such as oilfield and pipeline equipment manufacturing, \ntelecommunications and computers, and engineering, environmental and \nlegal research. These are real jobs for the people in my State, in \nspite of the fact we are so far away from Alaska.\n  The economic impact for oil development in Alaska is not a surprise; \nwe are experiencing it even today. It has meant a great deal to our \nState and to many other States.\n  I also wish to point out that we have the support of Alaska's \ncitizens and elected officials. We have heard from both of Alaska's \nU.S. Senators. We have heard from the Inupiat Eskimos who live and own \n92,000 acres of Coastal Plain. Twenty years ago, they were opposed to \nthis, but now are for it.\n  We cannot continue to rely on unstable foreign sources to meet our \nenergy needs. The events of September 11 made it clear who our enemies \nare, yet we continue to do business with them and support their \nterrorist activities by buying oil from them. We know we have the \nresources domestically to reduce our addiction to foreign oil. Now is \nthe time to tap them.\n  This amendment is economically sound, it is environmentally \nresponsible, and it responds to our long-term national security needs. \nIt is my fervent hope that my colleagues will recognize these facts and \nsupport this amendment to allow for oil exploration in ANWR, just as \nthey did in 1995 and 1980.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7 \nminutes prior to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to this \namendment, which would open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \noil development. I believe drilling in ANWR is a\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\nshort-term, environmentally unconscionable fix that fails to address \nour Nation's real malady: Our dependence not just on foreign oil, but \nour overdependence on oil itself.\n  I believe there is no way to justify drilling in ANWR in the name of \nnational security. Oil extracted from the wildlife refuge would not \nreach refineries for 7 to 10 years and would never satisfy more than 2 \npercent of our Nation's oil demands at any one time.\n  Thus, it would have no discernable short-term or long-term impact on \nthe price of fuel or our increasing dependence on OPEC imports. Put \nanother way, the amount of economically recoverable oil would \ntemporarily increase our domestic reserves by only one-third of 1 \npercent, which would not even make a significant dent in our imports, \nmuch less influence world prices by OPEC.\n  An ``ANWR is the Answer'' energy policy fails to recognize the \nfundamental truth: we cannot drill our way to energy independence.\n  The United States is home to only 3 percent of the world's known oil \nreserves, and unless we take steps necessary to increase the energy \nefficiency of our economy and, in particular, the transportation \nsector, this Nation's consumers will remain subject to the whims of the \nOPEC cartel. To suggest that drilling in the Arctic is the answer is to \nignore the facts and creates a complacency that truly jeopardizes our \neconomic and energy security.\n  Furthermore, I believe the recent U.S. Geological Survey report on \nthe biological value of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal \nPlain and the impacts of oil and gas development on resident species \nreinforces what many of us have argued from the beginning. Drilling in \nthe Arctic represents a real and significant threat to a wide range of \nspecies including caribou, snow geese, musk oxen, and other wildlife. \nThis report represents sound science. It was peer reviewed and \nsummarizes more than 12 years of research.\n\n  In stark contrast, the Department of the Interior's recent release of \na new two-page memo, which purports to examine the impacts of ``more \nlimited drilling'' in 300,000 acres of ANWR, was prepared in 6 days. \nOne report, 12 years of research; the other report, just 6 days.\n  Essentially, in this report the administration decided to dispute its \nown scientists and say drilling in ANWR was acceptable. I disagree with \nthat.\n  Rather than drilling in ANWR, I believe our task is to craft a \nbalanced policy that will permanently strengthen our national security \nand energy independence. We need an energy policy that endows America \nwith a strong and independent 21st century energy system by recognizing \nfuel diversity, energy efficiency, the great assets that distributed \ngeneration will create in the future, and environmentally sound \ndomestic production as a permanent solution to our Nation's enduring \nenergy needs. We are making some progress on these goals within this \nbill.\n  Obviously, one of the most important provisions the Senate has thus \nfar debated involves the expedited construction of a natural gas \npipeline from Alaska's North Slope to the lower 48 States. There are at \nleast 32 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in existing Alaskan fields, \nand building a pipeline to the continental United States would create \nthousands of jobs, provide a huge opportunity for the steel industry, \nand help prevent our Nation from becoming dependent on foreign natural \ngas, from many of the same Middle Eastern countries from which we \nimport oil.\n  It is very important that we make this investment in new natural gas \nand in job development. Adopting energy efficient technologies can \nsignificantly advance our national and economic security. For example, \na Department of Energy report, and these are amazing figures, but this \nDepartment of Energy report stated that automakers commonly use low-\nfriction tires on new cars to help them comply with fuel economy \nstandards. However, because there are no standards or efficiency labels \nfor replacement tires, most consumers unwittingly purchase less \nefficient tires when the originals wear out, even though low-friction \ntires would only cost a few dollars more per tire and actually would \nsave the average American driver about $100 worth of fuel over the \n40,000 mile life of the tires.\n  Fully phased in, better replacement tires would cut gasoline \nconsumption of all U.S. vehicles by about 3 percent, saving our Nation \nover 5 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years, the same amount \nthe U.S. Geological Survey says can be recovered from ANWR.\n  Unfortunately, I also believe we have thus far missed the single most \nimportant opportunity in this bill for truly enhancing our nation's \nenergy security and minimizing our foreign oil dependence. That is, we \nhave missed the opportunity to put in place real and meaningful CAFE \nstandards, which would increase the efficiency of our Nation's vehicles \nand decrease our foreign oil dependence. I continue to believe the only \nway to permanently ensure our Nation's security is to look beyond 19th \ncentury policies that continue our country's reliance on extraction and \ncombustion of fossil fuels.\n  Now is the time to launch the transition to a new, 21st century \nsystem of distributed generation based on renewable energy sources and \nenvironmentally responsible fuel cells. Imagine today if a significant \nportion of American homes and businesses produced their electricity \nfrom these renewables.\n  I think about the last crisis in the 1970s when our overdependence on \nforeign oil and high prices changed the dynamic in how many homes were \nheated with oil and made significant reductions. Our country needs to \nmake those same changes today.\n  These are policies that will make our energy system truly secure and \nindependent. I agree our national security depends in part on the \nUnited States becoming less dependent on foreign energy resources, and \nthat we must develop more domestic supplies and a better balance of \nrenewable energy that will also make us less dependent on nonrenewable \nfossil fuels. It would be a mistake to look at this ANWR debate in only \none way, and to not invest in our country's new sources of energy. \nTherefore, I cannot support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \noppose it in the name of national security, to move ahead onto new \nenergy sources and a 21st century energy policy.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 minutes as \nallocated under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, with all due respect to my dear friend \nand wonderful colleague from Washington, I rise to oppose the position \nshe has outlined and to support the amendment by the Senator from \nAlaska. I think it is very important for us to spend time on this \nissue. One of the previous speakers said: Why would we spend so much \ntime on this issue? Why would the Senate, all 100 Members of the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world today, spend so much time on \nthis issue?\n  The answer is because this is not a small matter. This is not an \ninsignificant debate. This is not a minor point. This is a major point \nin the debate on the future of this Nation and in what our energy \npolicy is going to look like and how we can strengthen and improve upon \nit.\n  It is said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But given what \nI have heard in this Chamber, I say that balance must be in the eyes of \nthe beholder as well because those of us both for and against this \namendment continue to say we are for a balanced policy. Yet we argue \nthe different aspects of what balance really is. So I am going to give \nit one more shot by saying what I think balance is.\n  The Senators from Alaska have done a magnificent job of making clear \nthat we are not for drilling everywhere; we support a balance.\n  When this area was created, the areas in dark yellow, light yellow \nand green, there was a balance in the creation of this piece of land, \nland that is as large as the State of South Carolina. Here we have a \nbalance: part of a refuge set aside for wildlife of all kinds, and a \nsmall part where we could drill. Why would we want to drill here? \nBecause it is the largest potential onshore oilfield in the entire \nUnited States. It is not a minor field. It has major resources of\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\noil potentially, as well as gas. So a balance was struck. A deal of \nsorts was created.\n  We said let's set aside a huge piece of land for a refuge, for a \nwilderness area, and then let's set aside a part of it to drill.\n  The reason I feel so strongly about opening this section of ANWR to \ndrilling--and it took me a while to come to this position because I \nhave heard a lot of other arguments--is because of this precedent I \nfeel this will set. If we overturn the original dual intent of ANWR and \nblock all drilling there, where will we stop? Instead of adding to \nproduction in the United States, either on our shores or off of our \nshores, we keep taking places off of the map for production. We are not \ngoing in the right direction, and we need to change course. That is why \nthis is so important.\n  I have said this 100 times. The Senator from Alaska has said it, the \nsenior Senator from Louisiana did a magnificent job of saying it this \nmorning, but let me also quote from a person we all respect--both \nDemocrats and Republicans--Richard Holbrooke, whom we know well. I \nwould say there would be no disagreement in this Chamber that this man \nis an expert in international relations and national security policy. I \nwill read what he said in February this year:\n\n       Our greatest single failure over the last 25 years--\n\n  Not one of our great failures, not something that we should have done \na little better--\n\n     was our failure to reduce our dependence on foreign oil--\n     which would have reduced the leverage of Saudi Arabia.\n\n  Why does he say this? Because of headlines such as these: ``Suicide \nBomber Kills 6 as Powell's Talks Begin,'' ``Chavez Reclaims Power in \nVenezuela,'' ``Powell Meets Arafat, Makes Little Progress.''\n\n  Mr. Holbrooke knows the uncertainty of the Middle East and we are all \nlearning of the difficulties in Venezuela. He represented our country \nin the United Nations. He knows what it takes for America to be strong \nto get to the negotiating table free to make the best decisions we can. \nHe knows our energy policy is in lockstep with our national security \npolicy.\n  We have a chance to reverse course and not make the same mistake \nagain. Let's have a balance.\n  Again, we have in ANWR the original intent to have some refuge area, \nsome wilderness area, and some drilling area. Not all drilling. Not \ndrilling everywhere, but where we can. An area for wildlife, for \ngeneral recreation, and one for the bottom line, businesses, workers, \ncompanies, and our economy. This is balanced. Instead, we get no more \ndrilling, a moratorium.\n  Let me show the other moratoria in the country. In addition to Alaska \nbeing taken off the map, we have--Democrats and Republicans are both \nguilty here--imposed moratoria along the entire east and west coasts of \nthe United States. There are places in the interior States where, \nbecause of rules, regulations, slow permitting, lawsuits, and filings \non behalf of certain groups, the production has slowed down, forcing us \nto continue to increase our imports, year after year. These imports do \nnot always come from friendly nations, from nations that share our \nvalues, but sometimes from nations that are in direct opposition to \nU.S. foreign policy and the democratic values for which we stand.\n  My second point is, are we asking something of Alaska that we have \nnot asked of other States? The senior Senator from Louisiana showed \nthis chart, and Senator Murkowski showed it earlier. It is worth \nshowing again. We are only asking to allow drilling in the kind of \nplaces where other States are already allowing it. Drilling is taking \nplace in nine refuges in Texas; 12 in Louisiana; 1 in Mississippi, 1 in \nAlabama. You can see the rest. These are ongoing drilling operations in \nrefuges.\n  Someone in my office the other day, a great labor leader from \nLouisiana, asked: Senator, why are people against drilling? I was \ntrying to explain. I said: Some people said this area is the last great \nplace. He said: Would you tell them America is full of great places? \nLouisiana has great places.\n  I loved when he said, ``America is full of great places.'' There are \ngreat places in all of our States. We will preserve them. We will fight \nto keep them wilderness when we can. But when we refuse to tap domestic \nsources of oil and gas that would help our Nation, help our economy, \ncreate jobs, and release us from our dangerous dependency on imported \noil and gas, it just makes no sense to me.\n  We have been spending a lot of time on this issue because it is at \nthe heart of the debate. We have a weak production policy and, I might \nsay, a weak conservation policy. That is the wrong direction. We need \nto turn around and go the other way: Strong production and strong \nconservation. If we don't, I predict there will be a huge price to pay. \nWe will pay it one way or another, either through the lives of \nservicemen, or through compromised foreign policy. Americans know this. \nThere is no free lunch. We don't seem to know that inside the beltway, \nbut working Americans of all stripes, of all political backgrounds, \nunderstand that. It is important. It is about balance. And we need it.\n\n  People say ANWR will not produce a lot of oil, that it will not come \nonline for several years--and I agree it will take time. But there is \nenough oil, even using the lowest estimates, to replace the oil we get \nfrom Saudi Arabia for about 8 to 10, maybe 8 to 12 years.\n  Ask the American people, Would you like to drill on our own land, \nland that we control, land that we set regulations on, and that we can \ndepend on, or do you want to continue to import oil from Saudi Arabia \nfor 15 years? I don't think there would be many Americans who would \nchoose the latter.\n  The third good reason is jobs. We continue to make decisions in this \nCongress that keep Americans from getting good paying jobs. Every time \nthey want to apply for a job, there may as well be a sign that says: \nCongress doesn't think we should drill. So go look elsewhere for work.\n  I don't know about the Presiding Officer, but I have thousands of \npeople in Louisiana who want to work. I have heard Senators say 60,000 \njobs doesn't matter. This Senator believes 60,000 jobs is a lot of \njobs. We should allow more production, which will lead to more than \n60,000 jobs. We should promote investments in conservation and \nalternative fuels. There are lots of jobs, in science and other high-\nend jobs, associated with alternative fuels. Why not have good jobs for \nboth production and conservation? Why turn down these job-making \nopportunities when it is so important to produce jobs for people in \nLouisiana, for people in Alaska, for people in Delaware, for people in \nNew Mexico? I don't understand it.\n  We can create good, skilled jobs, where people can make a very good \nliving working 40 or 50 hours, overtime, onshore, offshore, whereby \nthey can buy a home, contribute to their community, send their children \nto get an equal or better education than they did. I think it is very \nimportant.\n  The fourth reason we need to support drilling in ANWR besides the \nfact we need it, besides the fact it is balanced, besides the fact we \nare doing it in many other States in the same way we would be asking \nAlaska to contribute, besides the fact that it means thousands and \nthousands of good-paying jobs that people in America would like and \nneed at this time, it is the right thing to do for our environment. I \nmean that sincerely. I know I said some things on the floor about some \nenvironmental organizations, and I believe their positions, with all \ndue respect to the great work they have done, are leading this country \nin the wrong direction.\n\n  I work very well with environmental groups in Louisiana and many of \nour environmental groups around the Nation. But I will say it again: \nWhen we drill and extract resources in America, we can do it in the \nmost environmentally sensitive way in the world. Why? Because we have \nthe strictest rules and regulations.\n  Even the former executive director of the Sierra Club agrees, and he \nis on the record saying that by pushing production out of America, all \nwe are doing is damaging the world's environment.\n  We have the best rules and the best laws. We have a free press and \nthe ability, to punish those who pollute the environment.\n  That does not happen in other places around the world, places without \nthe same confidence in the law that we can have here in the United \nStates. So the pro-environmental position--and I\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\nmean this sincerely--is to drill and explore and extract resources \nwhere we can watch it, where we can control it and where we can make \nsure it is done correctly.\n  If I am wrong I would like someone to come to the floor and tell me: \nSenator, you are not thinking clearly about this.\n  Apart from the many troubled parts of the world where production is \ntaking place, I don't know where else we would drill. And the saddest \npart of that to me, or the most hypocritical part of that to me, is \nthat we consume more than everyone else. If we were not consuming that \nmuch, I would say fine. But we go to poorer countries with less \ninfrastructure, fewer rules, and weaker laws and enforcement, not \nbecause they need the oil but because we need it. And we degrade the \nenvironment and support illegitimate regimes because we will not drill \nin our own country. I do not understand it.\n  I will make another point about Louisiana. I have heard some of my \ncolleagues come to the floor and say: I will not drill in ANWR, but boy \nI will come drill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I want to show the map of these States that are net producers of \nenergy. There are only a few of us. There are only 15. There are only \n15 States in the entire country, just 15, that produce at least 50 \npercent of the energy they consume. You can see the States represented \nhere.\n  We love all of our States, wish them all well, and we are all part of \nthis great Union, but the red States on this chart produce less than \nhalf the energy they consume, which means they do not produce oil, they \ndo not produce gas, they do not produce nuclear, they do not produce \nwind, solar, or hydro, but they want their lights to come on whenever \nthey want and they want to power their businesses and industries.\n  Nobody can look at this map and say this is fair. I know there are \nproducts produced in some States that other States do not produce. I am \nclear. But there are no moratoria on growing corn, no moratoria on \ngrowing cotton. People are not opposed to that or think it harms the \nenvironment to grow corn or grow wheat. But we have a policy growing in \nthis country that we do not want to produce anything but we want to \ncontinue to consume.\n  I am for strong conservation measures. I voted against the proposal \nto reduce CAFE standards, not because I don't agree with the goal, but \nbecause the method was wrong. It would have cost too many jobs in my \nState. There is a better way to get there. I would vote for even more \nstringent measures but not that particular measure.\n\n  There are strong conservation measures that I and many Members \nsupport. But this attitude has to change. We have to have an attitude \namong all of these States that you either reduce your consumption \nsignificantly or you decide how to produce the energy. You have your \nchoice. You can produce it any way you want. But what you cannot do is \nsit on the sideline, complain and complain, prevent other States from \ndrilling, and then just continue to consume.\n  I have an amendment. I am thinking about offering this. I hope people \nwho vote against ANWR will think about ways we can encourage our \nStates, in a fair way, to make their own choices about how they would \nlike to generate more energy or consume less, and to put it in balance, \nso our Nation can truly achieve energy independence. I hope we can do \nthat.\n  Let me show one more chart. This is the Gulf of Mexico. You can see \nthe red areas here where there is active drilling. We have been doing \nthis now for 50 years. We have made some mistakes. I am the first one \nto admit it. We didn't know all the things that we know now back in the \n1940s and 1950s.\n  We did not have the science and the technology. But we have made \ntremendous progress, and we in Louisiana are happy to produce hundreds \nof millions of barrels of oil and gas, and host pipelines that light up \nthe Midwest and New York and California. We want to do it. We are proud \nof the industry, and we are getting better and better at it every day.\n  But it is grossly unfair for our State, and Mississippi and Alabama \nand Texas, to bear the brunt of this production when other States don't \nwant to produce. Then, to pour salt on the wound, we get no portion of \nthe revenues that are generated. Taxpayers may not realize this, but \nthe royalties that come into the Treasury every time you produce a \nnatural resource can keep our personal income taxes lower.\n  When we do not drill, royalties do not come into the Treasury, so \ntaxes have to go up to support Government. So a fifth really good \nreason to explore natural resources is so we can bring money into the \nTreasury, again in a very balanced approach, and keep taxes minimal for \ntaxpayers.\n  However, all that money that goes to the Federal Treasury right now, \nfrom production in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama, is not \nshared with those States. Since 1950, we sent $120 billion to the \nFederal Treasury. Louisiana, which has produced the lion's share of the \noffshore production for the whole Nation, has not received a penny.\n  This is a true story. I know my time is almost to the end, but I am \ngoing to end with a couple of points on this. Two years ago the mayor \nof Grande Isle, a tiny little place down here at the foot of Louisiana, \ntold me of a lot of their unique problems.\n  The mayor called me and said: Senator, I have a problem. I don't have \na sewer system and a water system that is able to bring the fresh water \nthat I need. I have children in school drinking rainwater out of a \nbarrel, dipping a cup into a barrel, drinking the rainwater, because we \ndo not have the right sewer and water system. Because it is a small \ntown, they do not have the necessary resources. I was sitting in my \noffice in Washington thinking about these children dipping that cup and \ndrinking that rainwater. I know if they just looked up and out just a \nfew miles they could see a rig, producing the Nation's oil and gas. The \nmoney it produces is not going to help them get a sewer system which \nthey desperately need. It will not help these children get a road so \nthat when it floods or the weather is bad they can get to school. That \nmoney is coming all the way up to Washington for us to spend on all the \nStates in the Nation.\n\n  When I ask to have a sewer system for them, I have to come back, ask \nand plead for money from the budget to get the kids in Grande Isle a \ndrinking water system. That isn't fair.\n  I will propose and will continue to propose that we have more \ndrilling and that the communities that host drilling share in those \nrevenues. We need infrastructure for the people and families living \nthere, for the workers and the businesses that are participating, and \nfor the associated environmental impacts, which can be minimal. \nSometimes they are a little more challenging. But with good science and \nthe old yankee ingenuity and southern ingenuity, we can get that done \nfor the people of our State.\n  In conclusion, I have given five good reasons why this is so \nimportant.\n  Let me close by reading something out of the Atlantic Monthly, ``The \nTales of a Tyrant'', written by Mark Bowden, author of ``Black Hawk \nDown.'' We are familiar with the incident. Many of us have seen the \nmovie. It is very riveting. I would like to read about the kind of \npeople from whom we are getting our oil.\n     Wearing his military uniform, he walked slowly to the lectern \n     and stood behind two microphones, gesturing with a big cigar. \n     His body and broad face seemed weighted down with sadness. \n     There had been a betrayal, he said. A Syrian plot. There were \n     traitors among them. Then Saddam took a seat, and Muhyi Abd \n     al-Hussein Mashhadi, the secretary-general of the Command \n     Council, appeared from behind a curtain to confess his own \n     involvement in the putsch. He had been secretly arrested and \n     tortured days before; now he spilled out dates, times, and \n     places where the plotters had met. Then he started naming \n     names. As he fingered members of the audience one by one, \n     armed guards grabbed the accused and escorted them from the \n     hall. When one man shouted that he was innocent, Saddam \n     shouted back, ``Itla! Itla!''--``Get out! Get out!'' (Weeks \n     later, after secret trials, Saddam had the mouths of the \n     accused taped shut so that they could utter no troublesome \n     last words before their firing squads.) when all of the sixty \n     ``traitors'' had been removed, Saddam again took the podium \n     and wiped tears from his eyes as he repeated the names of \n     those who had betrayed him. Some in the audience, too, were \n     crying--perhaps out of fear. This chilling performance had \n     the desired effect. Everyone in the hall now understood \n     exactly how things would work in Iraq from that day forward.\n\n  If we cannot get enough of the Senate to vote in favor of this \namendment,\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\nin spite of articles like this, because of movies that we see, because \nof headlines like this, and the disruptions not only in the Mideast but \nin Venezuela, I don't know what will make the Members of this Senate \ndecide that we must produce where we can produce. We can set aside \nlands where we can set aside land, create jobs for our people and \nsecurity for our Nation.\n  I am giving the best I can give. I don't think we have the votes. But \nI submit this for the Record, and hope people will reconsider their \npositions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, under the unanimous consent, I believe \nthe Senator from Wisconsin is the next Senator to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendments \noffered by my colleagues from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski and Mr. Stevens. I \noppose these amendments for several reasons, and I rise to share my \nconcerns with my colleagues.\n  Energy security is an important issue for America, and one which my \nWisconsin constituents take very seriously. The bill before us \ninitiates a national debate about the role of domestic production of \nenergy resources versus foreign imports, about the tradeoffs between \nthe need for energy and the need to protect the quality of our \nenvironment, and about the need for additional domestic efforts to \nsupport improvements in our energy efficiency and the wisest use of our \nenergy resources. The President joined that debate with the release of \nhis national energy strategy earlier this Congress. The questions \nraised are serious, and differences in policy and approach are \nlegitimate.\n  I join with the other Senators today who are raising concerns about \nthese amendments. Delegating authority to the President to opening the \nrefuge to oil drilling does little to address serious energy issues \nthat have been raised in the last few months.\n  Though proponents of drilling in the refuge will say that it can be \ndone by only opening up drilling on 2,000 acres of the refuge, that is \nsimply not the case. The President will decide whether the entire 1\\1/\n2\\ million acres of the Coastal Plain of the refuge will be open for \noil and gas leasing and exploration. Exploration and production wells \ncan be drilled anywhere on the coastal plain.\n  I infer that when proponents say that only 2,000 acres will be \ndrilled, they are referring to the language in the amendment which \nstates, and I am paraphrasing, ``the Secretary shall . . . ensure that \nthe maximum amount of surface acreage covered by production and support \nfacilities, including airstrips and any areas covered by gravel berms \nor piers for support of pipelines, does not exceed 2,000 acres on the \nCoastal Plain.''\n  That limitation is not a clear cap on overall development. It does \nnot cover seismic or other exploration activities, which have had \nsignificant effects on the Arctic environment to the west of the \nCoastal Plain. Seismic activities are conducted with convoys of \nbulldozers and ``thumper trucks'' over extensive areas of the tundra. \nExploratory oil drilling involves large rigs and aircraft.\n  The language does not cover the many miles of pipelines snaking above \nthe tundra, just the locations where the vertical posts that support \nthe pipelines literally touch the ground. In addition, this \n``limitation'' does not require that the two thousand acres of \nproduction and support facilities be in one contiguous area. As with \nthe oil fields to the west of the arctic refuge, development could and \nwould be spread out over a very large area.\n  Indeed, according to the United States Geological Survey, oil under \nthe Coastal Plain is not concentrated in one large reservoir but is \nspread in numerous small deposits. To produce oil from this vast area, \nsupporting infrastructure would stretch across the Coastal Plain. And \neven if this cap were a real development cap, what would this mean? Two \nthousand acres is a sizable development area. The development would be \neven more troubling as it is located in areas that are actually \nadjacent to the 8 million acres of wilderness that Congress has already \ndesignated in the arctic refuge which share a boundary with the Coastal \nPlain.\n  The delegation of authority to open the refuge is controversial, and \nmake no mistake, it will generate lengthy debate.\n  I have also heard concerns from the constituents in my state who have \npaid dearly for large and significant jumps in gasoline prices. \nInvoking the ability to drill in response to a national emergency does \nnot add to gasoline supplies today, nor does it do anything to address \nthe immediate need of the Federal Government to respond to fluctuations \nin gas prices and help expand refining capacity. In some instances, \nthere were reports of prices between $3 to as high as $8 per gallon in \nWisconsin on September 11 and 12, 2001. The Department of Energy \nimmediately assured me that energy supplies were adequate following the \nterrorist attacks, and these increases are being investigated as \npossible price gouging by the Department of Energy and the State of \nWisconsin. With adequate energy resources, constituents need assurances \nthat these unjustified jumps can be monitored and controlled.\n  And I, along with many other Senators, have constituents who are \nconcerned about the environmental effects of this amendment, and what \nit says about our stewardship of lands of wilderness quality.\n  I also oppose opening the refuge for what it will do to the Energy \nbill as a whole. This measure contains important provisions that we \nneed to enact into law. In light of the tragic events of September 11, \na key element of any new energy security policy should be to secure our \nexisting energy system--from production to distribution--from the \nthreat of future terrorist attack. Americans deserve to know that the \nSenate has protected the existing North Slope oil rigs and pipelines \nfrom attack. Americans deserve to know that the Senate has considered \nmeasures to reduce the vulnerability of above ground electric \ntransmission and distribution by providing needed investments in siting \nof below ground direct current cables, in researching better \ntransmission technologies, and in protecting transformers and switching \nstations. Americans want us to review thoroughly the security of our \nNation's domestic nuclear powerplant safety regimes to ensure that they \ncontinue to operate well. Finally, Americans living downstream from \nhydroelectric dams want to know that they are safe from terrorist \ninitiated dam breaching. We must assure them that this existing \ninfrastructure is secure.\n\n  These were issues that the House did not address on August 2, 2001, \nwhen it passed its bill, because the terrorist attacks of September 11, \nwere obviously unthinkable at that time. These are issues that drilling \nin the refuge does not address. But we are a changed country in \nresponse to September 11, and these are very real issues today, issues \nthat must be addressed.\n  In addition, there have been significant technological changes in the \nlast few months that can help us reduce our dependence upon foreign \noil. On September 19, 2001, a model year 2002 General Motors Yukon that \ncan run on either a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent \nconventional gasoline or conventional gasoline alone rolled off the \nline in my hometown of Janesville, WI. The 2002 model year Tahoes, \nSuburbans and Denalis with 5.3 liter engines will be able to run on \neither fuel. But while my constituents could buy a vehicle that can run \non a higher percentage of ethanol fuel, there isn't a place open today \nto buy that fuel in Wisconsin. We could go a long way under this bill \nto reducing dependence on foreign oil by using domestic energy crops \nand biomass more wisely, and we should pass this bill to reflect our \nnew technological capacity.\n  I also oppose this amendment because there is a lingering veil of \nconcern that special corporate interests would benefit over our \ncitizens by this amendment. Oil companies receive a good deal of \nfinancial assistance in the form of tax breaks from the Federal \nGovernment to encourage development of domestic oil supplies. I have \nspoken out, for example, against the percentage depletion allowance in \nthe mining of hardrock minerals, and its use in the oil sector dwarfs \nthe hardrock tax break.\n  This longstanding tax break allows those in the oil business to, in \neffect, write off all of their losses. The ostensible reason for the \ndepletion allowance is to encourage exploration of oil\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\ndrilling sites, which, presumably, no one would do without such a tax \nbreak.\n  The oil industry argues that other businesses are allowed to \ndepreciate the costs of their manufacturing. But this tax break goes \nwell beyond the costs of deducting capital equipment. For example, a \ngarment manufacturer can only deduct the original cost of a sewing \nmachine, whereas an oil well can produce tax deductions as long as it \nkeeps producing oil. So this deduction can amount to many times the \ncost of the original drilling and exploration. The depletion allowance \nis currently set at 15 percent of gross income.\n  The current cost to the U.S. Treasury for the depletion allowance \nexceeds $1 billion a year. This deduction can, in some cases, amount to \n100 percent of the company's net income, which means that all \nprofitability comes from Government tax subsidies.\n  But just in case there is anyone in the oil industry not enjoying \nsufficient profitability, Congress has come up with a number of other \ncushions against the risks of capitalism. Big Oil can immediately \ndeduct 70 percent of the costs of setting up an operation of the so-\ncalled intangible drilling cost deduction. Other industries have to \ndeduct such costs over the life of the operation, so this amounts to \nanother interest-free loan from the Treasury. It also amounts to a \ndouble deduction, since the depletion allowance is supposed to \ncompensate the poor oil producer for the costs of risking a dry well. \nRepealing this deduction would save more than $2.5 billion over the \nnext 5 years.\n  Another tax subsidy encourages oil companies to go after oil reserves \nthat are more difficult than usual to extract, such as those that have \nalready been mostly depleted, or that contain especially viscous crude. \nThis, of course, is more expensive than normal oil drilling. Thus the \n``enhanced oil recovery'' credit helps to subsidize those extra costs. \nThe net effect of this is that we taxpayers are paying for domestic oil \nthat costs almost twice as much as foreign supplies.\n  The combined effect of the depletion allowance, the intangible \ndrilling cost deduction, the enhanced oil recovery credit, and other \nsubsidies can sometimes exceed 100 percent of the value of the energy \nproduced by the subsidized oil. This makes no economic sense at all. I \nmake these points because the taxpayers already give the oil sector a \ngreat deal of assistance, and now we are being asked to give up \nadditional public lands as well.\n  Before we allow the President to open more public lands, I think we \nshould be mindful of the help these industries are already getting.\n  I also am concerned about the effect of a decision to open the refuge \nto oil drilling on resources that we have already designated for \nspecial protection. The 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \ncontains 8 million acres of wilderness that Congress has already \ndesignated. The amendment proposes to essentially trade wilderness \ndesignation for other areas in the refuge, 1.5 million acres in the \nsouthern portion of the refuge for the 1.5-million-acre Coastal Plain. \nThe existing wilderness areas in the refuge, however, are immediately \nadjacent to the Coastal Plain. I am concerned that the President would \npermit drilling on the Coastal Plain of the refuge before Congress \nconsiders whether or not the Coastal Plain should be designated as \nwilderness. Establishment of drilling on the Coastal Plain would be \nallowing a use that is generally considered to be incompatible with \nareas designated as wilderness under the Wilderness Act. We have had \nvery little discussion about the effect of drilling in the refuge on \nthe wilderness areas that we have already designated. I want colleagues \nto be aware that the drilling question threatens not only our ability \nto make future wilderness designations in the Coastal Plain but also \ncould endanger areas that we have already designated as wilderness in \nthe public trust.\n  Colleagues should keep in mind that the criteria established in this \namendment that the President must certify in his determination to open \nof the Coastal Plain as a source of oil do not include any new \ndevelopments or changes in the geological information or economics that \naffect potential development of Arctic resources. The United States \nGeological Survey has already reconsidered those factors in its 1998 \nreassessment of the Arctic Refuge Coastal Plain's oil potential. \nRather, the current discussion, in my view, is prompted by the rhetoric \nand opportunistic efforts of those interests that have long advocated \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge, to exploit the current response with \nregard to terrorism.\n\n  If drilling may impair our ability to make a decision about the \npresent and future wilderness qualities of the refuge, if the refuge \ndoes not contain as much oil as we thought, and if opening the Coastal \nPlain to drilling may do little to affect our current domestic prices, \nwhy, then, are we considering doing this? The facts don't point toward \ndrilling in the refuge: the refuge may not contain as much oil as we \nthink, and opening the Coastal Plain to drilling may have only a minor \neffect on our current domestic prices.\n  I raise these issues because I have grave concerns about the \narguments that oil drilling and environmental protection are \ncompatible. I traveled, a while ago, through the Niger Delta region of \nNigeria by boat, where I observed firsthand the environmental \ndevastation caused by the oil industry. The terrible stillness of an \nenvironment that should be teeming with life made a very powerful \nimpression on me. These are the same multinational companies that have \naccess to the same kinds of technologies, and though they are operating \nin a vastly different regulatory regime, I was profoundly struck by the \nenvironmental legacy of oil development in another ecologically rich \ncoastal area.\n  For these reasons, I oppose this amendment. I appreciate the \nfundamental concern that we need to develop a new energy strategy for \nthis country. I do disagree strongly, however, with drilling in this \nlocation, which I feel is deserving of wilderness designation. I think \nthis bill achieves its objectives without damaging the refuge, and I \nencourage colleagues to oppose these amendments.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the majority leader has authorized me to \nannounce there will be no rollcall votes this evening.\n  I would like to make a unanimous consent request. I have spoken to \nboth managers of the bill. We have, in the unanimous consent queue that \nis now established, Senator Dorgan speaking for 20 minutes. Senator \nDorgan is not going to speak. So in place of that 20 minutes, I ask \nunanimous consent to amend the order to put in Senator Stabenow for 10 \nminutes and Senator Murray for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am continually amazed by the \nability--and I am sorry my friend from Wisconsin has left the Chamber--\nto generalize because that is what we are doing here. There is a \ngeneralization that somehow the oil industry's application in Africa is \nperhaps applicable to Alaska. These tactics I find unacceptable \nbecause, first of all, we have invited many Members of this body to \ncome up and see for themselves.\n  You might not like oilfields. That is the business of each and every \nMember. But the best oilfield in the world is Prudhoe Bay. It is 30-\nyear-old technology. What bothers me about this general criticism is \nnobody seems to care where oil comes from as long as they get it. The \nSenator from Wisconsin generalized on several aspects, implying that \nsomehow the limitation in this bill of a 2,000-acre disturbance was \nbroader than that.\n  Let me read what is in the bill. It ensures that the maximum amount \nof surface acreage covered by production and support facilities, \nincluding airstrips and any areas covered by gravel berms or piers for \nsupport pipelines, does not exceed 2,000 acres on the Coastal Plain. I \ndon't know what could be more understood than that statement.\n  Furthermore, to suggest that exploration is a permanent footprint on \nthe land begs the issue. Here is what exploration looks like in the \nsummertime on a particular area that was drilled. The\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\nreality will show you that the footprint is certainly manageable. To \nsuggest somehow that that particular activity, because of the advanced \ntechnology, is incompatible with this area is really selling American \ningenuity, technology, and American jobs short.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin didn't indicate at all the concern of the \njobs associated with this. He didn't concern himself as to where we \nwould get the oil. He simply said he didn't think it should come from \nthis area. He talked about the flow of technology, refuge and \nwilderness.\n  Let me show you the map one more time. It has been pointed out again \nand again, but perhaps some Members are not watching closely enough. \nThey simply assume that the ANWR Coastal Plain is wilderness. Congress \nspecifically designated it as a specific area outside the wilderness. \nIt is the 1002. Only Congress can open it. It is the Coastal Plain.\n  Within ANWR there are almost 8.5 million acres of wilderness. There \nare 9 million acres of refuge and 1.5 million in the Coastal Plain. \nWhat we proposed--and nobody has mentioned--is the creation of another \n1.5 million acres of wilderness.\n  It is time that Members, before they come to the Chamber, familiarize \nthemselves with what is in the amendment. It is a 2,000-acre \nlimitation. Not too many people want to recognize that. They suggest \nthe entire area is at risk. That is ridiculous. We have an export ban. \nOil from the refuge cannot be exported. We have an Israeli exemption \nproviding an exemption for exports to Israel, under an agreement we \nhave had which expires in the year 2004. We are going to extend it to \nthe year 2014.\n  As I have indicated, we have a wilderness designation, an additional \n1.5 million acres which would be added to the wilderness out of the \nrefuge. Here is the chart that shows that. We are adding to the \nwilderness.\n  If that doesn't salve the conscience of some Members who believe that \nis the price we should pay, I don't know what does.\n  Finally, we have a Presidential finding. This amendment does not open \nANWR. ANWR is opened only if the President certifies to Congress that \nexploration, development, and production of the oil and gas resources \nin ANWR's Coastal Plain are in the national economic and security \ninterests of the United States.\n  We leave all kinds of things up to the President around here. \nDeclarations of war are often, in effect, handled by the President \nrather than the Congress--in the informal stage, at least. We think it \nis a pretty important responsibility. We are giving that responsibility \nto the President. Yet those from the other side, I don't know whether \nthey begrudge, distrust, or whatever, because it happens to be in the \nPresident's energy proposal that we open up the area, and that is good \nenough for me.\n\n  The amendment does not open ANWR. It will only be opened if the \nPresident certifies to the Congress that exploration, development, and \nproduction of oil and gas resources of the ANWR Coastal Plain are in \nthe national economic and security interests of this country.\n  What does that mean? It means different things to different people, I \nsuppose one might say. From the standpoint of at least my \ninterpretation from the former senior Senator from Oregon, Mark \nHatfield, the statement I opened with, I would vote to open up ANWR \nanytime rather than send another young man or woman to fight a war in a \nforeign land over oil. We did that in 1992. We lost 148 lives. At that \ntime, we were substantially less dependent on imported oil.\n  Make no mistake about it. Our minority leader, Senator Lott, \nindicated in his statement the vulnerability of this country. Our \nSecretary of State has not been able to bring the parties together in \nthe Mideast. It remains volatile. The situation in Venezuela is \nunclear. The estimates are this Nation has lost 30 percent of the \navailable crude oil imports that we previously enjoyed--that is an \ninterruption--as a consequence of Saddam Hussein terminating production \nfor 30 days. We have reason to believe Colombia is on the verge of some \nkind of an interruption which will terminate the oil through their \npipeline. This is a crisis.\n  The reason you don't see Members coming down here and saying, ``I \nguess we had better do something about it now,'' is very clear. The \nshoe is not pinching enough. The prices are not high enough. I would \nhate to say there are not enough lives at risk.\n  Members could very well rue the day on this vote, recognizing the \ninfluence of America's environmental community on this issue. I think \neveryone who is familiar with oil development in Alaska understands \nthat we consume this oil that we produce in Alaska. It is jobs in \nAmerica. It is U.S. ships built in American shipyards. These are the \nfacts. By not recognizing the real commitment we have to doing business \nin America, we are going to have to get that oil overseas.\n  When the Senator from Wisconsin generalizes about oilfields, he \ndoesn't give us the credit for the advanced technology moving from \nPrudhoe Bay to the next major oilfield we found in Alaska called \nEndicott. Endicott was 56 acres. It was the 10th largest producing \nfield. Those are the kinds of technological advancements we have in \nthis country.\n  As a consequence, I am prepared to continue to respond to those \ninaccuracies. It is a shame we have to subject ourselves to the \npandering associated with interpretations that have nothing to do with \nthe extent of the risk associated to our national security at this \ntime.\n  The risk is very real. The risk may go beyond the risk associated \nwith just a political view of this issue. In this amendment, we are \ngiving the President of the United States the authority to make this \ndetermination. I would like to think every Member of this body values \nnot only the President but his office to see what is in the best \ninterest of our country, our Nation, and our national security.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We just had him \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee. In all the years I have been on \nthat committee, as I said to my colleagues today and I say to my \ncolleagues here, we have never had a better friend of America as a head \nof state from any country more so than President Pastrana.\n  One distinction that marks his service to his country and to the \nentire region is that when we lose elections here, we get a \npension.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to oppose the proposal to drill \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. With all due respect to my \ncolleagues on the other side, who I know feel strongly, I feel strongly \nas well and have been involved with this issue since my time in the \nHouse of Representatives, where I consistently cosponsored legislation \nthat would not allow drilling to occur.\n  It is important that we continue to stress the fact that drilling in \nANWR will not create energy independence and that we are talking about, \neven if\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\nwe started drilling tomorrow, the first barrel of crude oil would not \nmake it to the market for at least 10 years. So it would not affect our \ncurrent energy needs. There is a real question in all of the debate \ngoing on about the concerns that are immediately in front of us. This \nis not the answer to that.\n  We are talking about whether or not, on the one hand, we risk the \nenvironmentally sensitive Coastal Plain for the equivalent of just 6 \nmonths' worth of usage or consumer usage in the United States. And this \nis not something that will be available for use for 10 years. It \ndoesn't make sense to me.\n  I think that in this energy bill, when we are trying to look to the \nfuture, we ought not to be going to the past in terms of trying to \ndrill our way to energy security and independence.\n  According to the EIA, an independent analytical agency within the \nDepartment of Energy, drilling in the Arctic Refuge is projected to \nreduce the amount of foreign oil consumption by the United States in \n2020 from 62 percent to 60 percent--a whopping 2-percent difference by \n2020. This certainly is not going to address our energy needs. Drilling \nin the Arctic Refuge will not really make a dent in the question of the \noverdependence on foreign oil. Even John Brown, the CEO of BP Amoco, \nadmitted in an interview on ``60 Minutes'' back in February that it was \n``simply not possible for the U.S. to drill its way to energy \nindependence.'' That is why we have a proposal in front of us that is \ncomprehensive.\n\n  I would like to, once again, commend the sponsor and the leader on \nthis issue, Senator Bingaman, for not only his leadership in coming \nforward with a broad plan that moves us to the future, but also his \npatience during this process, as we have moved through all of the \namendments and the different comments in which each of us have been \ninvolved.\n  When we look at the tradeoff, I simply don't believe it is worth it. \nDrilling in the Arctic Refuge will lead, potentially, to environmental \ndamage. The proponents of drilling claim that the modern techniques are \nclean and would cause no environmental damage.\n  First, drilling accidents do happen. Over the past several years, \nacross the Nation, there have been accidents due to poor maintenance, \nequipment failure, human error, even sabotage. Certainly, in this time \nof concern about terrorism, we need to be concerned about that as well. \nIn these accidents, crude oil was dumped into our rivers, our lakes, \nour streams, and wetlands, and often dangerous hydrogen sulfide gas was \nreleased into the air as well.\n  This doesn't seem to be a good tradeoff for the equivalent of 6 \nmonths' worth of oil that we cannot actually begin to use for 10 years. \nWe can create more jobs and help our U.S. steel industry and help our \neconomy and make other kinds of positive benefits without drilling in \nthe Arctic Refuge.\n  There are more than 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas immediately \navailable in the existing oilfields on the Alaskan North Slope. \nCurrently, natural gas is produced with this oil but is reinjected, as \nwe all know, back into the ground because there is no pipeline to bring \nit to the lower 48 States. Constructing the Alaskan natural gas \npipeline will create more than 400,000 new jobs and provide a real \nopportunity to the U.S. steel industry, which, I might add, is \nincredibly important in my State of Michigan, where we are concerned \nabout an integrated steel industry from the iron ore mines in the upper \npeninsula of Michigan to our steel mills.\n  This pipeline would require up to 3,500 miles of pipe and 5 million \ntons of steel. The Alaska natural gas pipeline also would provide \nnatural gas to American consumers for at least 30 years and would be a \nstabilizing force on natural gas prices.\n  We can do that. We agree on that. We can move in this direction. It \ncreates jobs. It adds to the availability of energy sources and does \nnot risk one of the most important, pristine, environmentally sensitive \nareas in our country.\n  There are other, better supply options available to us. Currently, as \nwe all know, in the Gulf of Mexico, it is a source of 25 percent of the \ncrude oil produced in the United States, 29 percent of the natural gas, \nand there are 32 million acres in the western and central portions of \nthe Gulf of Mexico under lease but not developed. Why are we not \ntalking about those areas?\n  In addition, the oil industry is extremely optimistic about the \nprospects of finding additional oil reserves in the National Petroleum \nReserve in Alaska where we are already drilling. In fact, the three \nlargest oil discoveries in the last 10 years were made in the National \nPetroleum Reserve in Alaska. So we have options.\n  I am always perplexed in this debate to hear why this is the focal \npoint of the administration's energy plan, this one piece of land, when \nwe do have other options, and we have other options for creating jobs \nas well.\n  We also know that conservation and investment in new technologies are \nthe real solutions. Given relatively small amounts of oil available in \nthe Arctic Refuge, it does not make sense to endanger this 1.5-million-\nacre Coastal Plain that is the biological heart of this pristine \nnational treasure.\n  An energy policy such as the Senate energy bill that encourages \nconservation and investments in new technologies can help us come \ncloser to achieving independence within 10 years.\n  I am very proud of what is happening in Michigan as it relates to \nalternative fuels, agriculture, and also what we are doing in terms of \ntechnologies that are important for our future.\n  The bottom line is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the \nmost pristine places in the United States. This tradeoff is not worth \nit. We can meet our energy needs in other ways that look to the future. \nWe can create important jobs for our people in other ways with the \nnatural gas pipeline. We have other opportunities to drill that do not \ninvolve risking this important part of our heritage. Our ability to \npass this area on to our children and to protect it is very important.\n  When we look at all of the various wildlife species, all of the \nanimals and birds that are involved in this area of land and the \nhabitat involved, I cannot imagine that we, in fact, will be serious \nabout risking this fragile and irreplaceable national treasure.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with us in protecting this area for \nthe future of our children and our grandchildren, and that we will move \nforward in the other parts of this energy bill and the other \nopportunities we have to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and \ncreate the economic and energy security that we all would like.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to cloture \non these amendments. I want to say a few words about the energy bill in \ngeneral, and then I want to explain my opposition to drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Our country needs a comprehensive energy policy, and certainly that \npolicy needs to recognize the current importance of oil, gas, and coal \nexploration. But to ensure America's energy security for the future, it \nshould support energy efficiency, conservation, clean and renewable \nenergy sources, and it should help diversify our energy sources.\n  Overall, I have to say I am disappointed in the direction in which \nthis energy bill is heading because it has been diverted from achieving \nthese important goals. I am disappointed because we had an opportunity \nto make progress on our long-term challenges.\n  This bill started off in the right direction. Unfortunately, after \nmany amendments, it is now a far different bill, and I believe it does \nnot respond adequately to the challenges we face either in my home \nState of Washington or nationally.\n  It focuses too heavily on coal and natural gas. It does too little to \ndiversify our energy sources.\n  It does not meaningfully raise fuel economy standards, and it does \nnot protect electricity customers. In fact, it creates considerable \nuncertainty in electricity markets. It pursues electricity deregulation \ndespite the hard lessons learned through our recent experiences in \nCalifornia and with Enron.\n  It takes regulatory authority away from the States and gives it to \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  And it does not do enough to encourage investments in our \ntransmission systems.\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\n  Overall, this energy bill reflects the way we have treated energy \npolicy for decades. We have not addressed the long-term problems. \nInstead, we wait until there is a crisis, and then we are stuck at \nlooking at bad, short-term fixes like drilling in ANWR. We have not \ndealt with our long-term dependence on oil. We have not invested enough \nin renewable energy. We have not diversified our energy resources, and \nwe have not put enough financial incentives behind conservation.\n  The responsible way to address our energy problems is to focus on the \nlong-term solutions like reducing our need for oil and investing in \nclean and renewable energy sources.\n  Unfortunately, much of this bill continues to largely endorse the \npast practices of short-term fixes that do not address many of the real \nlong-term problems.\n  Today we are being asked to damage a sensitive ecosystem and spoil \none of our national treasures for the sake of oil production. We cannot \ndrill our way out of energy problems. That is a fact.\n  I ask my colleagues: At what point do we say ``enough is enough''? \nToday we are being asked to allow the President to authorize \nexploration in a critical wildlife refuge. Where will we and future \ngenerations be asked to drill tomorrow?\n  To get out of these short-term traps, we need to invest in long-term \nsolutions, such as diversifying our energy sources.\n  This bill started with a strong renewable portfolio standard which \nwould have diversified our energy sources. After many changes, however, \nthese standards are now no better than the current pathways we have. To \nme, that is a missed opportunity. We should be doing more to diversify \nour energy sources.\n  Currently, Washington State and the Pacific Northwest are very \ndependent on hydroelectric power to meet our energy needs. This \ndependence contributed to severe price spikes during last year's \ndrought and California's disruption of the west coast energy market.\n  I fear that in our rush to address last year's energy shortfall, we \nin Washington State are now becoming overreliant on natural gas. \nDiversifying our energy resources will help us prevent future price \nswings. Developing other resources like wind, biomass, solar, and \ngeothermal energy will protect us from future shortages and will ensure \nour communities and economy they can continue to grow.\n  However, rather than enacting a strong renewable portfolio standard, \nthis bill will continue the failed strategy of digging more, burning \nmore, and conserving less.\n  I refer next to the electricity title in this energy bill. The \nPresiding Officer is from Washington State and she knows we have worked \non and agreed to many amendments. However, electricity consumers in \nthis underlying bill do not appear to be protected. I think we are \nmoving too quickly to deregulate electricity markets and to create \nregional transmission organizations. From the California energy crisis \nto the collapse of Enron, the events of the last few years have \nhighlighted the importance of moving slowly with electricity \nlegislation.\n  In Washington State, our regional transmission system has more than \n40 major bottlenecks. There are many other parts of the Nation that \nalso have major bottlenecks, and we need to fix them.\n  We can build all the generation facilities we need but still not have \npower because the transmission capacity is inadequate.\n  With all of the problems we are experiencing in our transmission \nsystems, this is not the time to dramatically alter the way electricity \nmarkets are regulated and function.\n  With regard to electricity legislation, I think we should proceed \nvery cautiously.\n  I will now turn to the debate over drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, which I strongly oppose. For the record, I have heard \nfrom many residents of my State on this issue. They have called me, \nsent me letters, faxes, e-mails, and a clear majority oppose drilling \nin ANWR.\n  I will vote against oil exploration in ANWR because the potential \nbenefits do not outweigh the significant environmental impacts. The \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge is an important and unique national \ntreasure. In fact, it is the only conservation system in North America \nthat protects the complete spectrum of Arctic ecosystems. It is the \nmost biologically productive part of the Arctic Refuge, and it is a \ncritical calving ground for a large herd of caribou, which are vital to \nmany Native Americans in the Arctic. Energy exploration in ANWR would \nhave a significant impact on this unique ecosystem. Further, \ndevelopment will not provide the benefits being advertised.\n  The proponents of this measure argue that over the years energy \nexploration has become more environmentally friendly. While that may be \ntrue, there are still significant environmental impacts for this \nsensitive region. Exploration means a footprint for drilling, permanent \nroads, gravel pits, water wells, and airstrips. We recognize that our \neconomy and lifestyle require significant energy resources, and we are \nfacing some important energy questions. However, opening ANWR to oil \nand gas drilling is not the answer to our energy needs.\n  Many people are incorrectly stating the exploration of ANWR will \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. As a nation, the only way to \nbecome less dependent on foreign oil is to become less dependent on oil \noverall. The oil reserves in ANWR--in fact, the oil reserves in the \nentire United States--are not enough to significantly reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  There are four ways to really reduce our need for foreign oil. First, \nwe can increase the fuel economy of our automobiles and light trucks. \nHigher fuel economy standards will reduce air pollution, reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions, save consumers significant fuel costs, and reduce \nour national trade deficit.\n  In addition, cars made in the United States will be more marketable \noverseas if they achieve better fuel economy standards. Last month, \nmany of us in the Senate tried to raise CAFE standards, but our efforts \nwere defeated.\n  A second way to reduce our need for foreign oil is to expand the use \nof domestically produced renewable and alternative fuels. That will \nreduce emissions of toxic pollutants, create jobs in the United States, \nand reduce our trade deficit.\n  Third, we can invest in emerging technologies such as fuel cells and \nsolar electric cars. The United States has always led the world in \nemerging technologies, and this should not be any different.\n  Fourth, we can also increase the energy efficiency of our office \nbuildings and our homes.\n  These four strategies will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and \nprotect one of our Nation's most precious treasures.\n  The proponents of drilling in ANWR have argued it will help our \nnational security, and I want to comment on that. Back in 1995, the \nsame proponents of drilling in ANWR fought to lift the ban on exporting \nNorth Slope oil. Prior to 1995, oil produced on American soil, on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska, was, by law, headed for domestic markets. This \nexport ban had been in effect for over 20 years. In 1995, some Members \nworked to lift that ban. On the other hand, I helped lead a bipartisan \nfilibuster, with Mr. Hatfield, a great Senator from the State of \nOregon, to keep the export ban in place because it served our Nation's \ninterest. Since that debate first took place, I have become even more \nconvinced that sending our oil to overseas markets is the wrong policy \nfor our country.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is recognized that gasoline prices in west coast \nStates are frequently among the highest in the Nation. It is estimated \nthat since 1995 more than 90 million barrels of Alaskan oil have been \nexported overseas. Approximately half of that oil went to Korea, a \nquarter of it went to Japan, and the remaining went to China and \nTaiwan. I would respectfully suggest to the administration and the \nproponents of drilling in ANWR that if this debate were really about \nproviding Americans with our own oil or about denying Saddam Hussein \nthe means to develop his evil plans, here in the Senate we would be \nconsidering reimposing the export ban.\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\n  The administration has been silent on reimposing that ban, the House \nhas been silent on reimposing the ban, and I doubt the Senate will move \non it either.\n  Now I suspect that someone from the other side is going to stand up \nand say that the House-passed ANWR bill precludes the exportation of \noil from ANWR and that the pending amendment limits the exportation of \nANWR oil except to our friends in Israel. But it will be easy for \nproponents to do an end run around those provisions.\n  First, the export ban would have to survive in conference. Even if it \nsurvives, oil companies will still be allowed to export more of the oil \nthey drill from other parts of Alaska where the ban does not exist.\n  The proponents will say there have not been any recent exports of \nNorth Slope oil. The fact is that as soon as the economics line up, we \nwill add to the 90 million barrels already sent overseas.\n  Let us remember that the amount of oil in ANWR is too small to \nsignificantly improve our current energy problems, and, further, the \noil exploration in ANWR will not actually start producing oil for as \nmany as 10 years.\n  Exploring and drilling for oil and gas in ANWR is not forward \nthinking. It is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem.\n  For all of these reasons, I oppose energy exploration in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, and I continue to have strong concerns about \nthe energy bill as it is currently written.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, many of us who have come to this Chamber \nover the last 24 hours to speak on this most important issue have \napproached it from a variety of points of view, all of them with some \ndegree of logic that points out a frustration, if not a legitimate \nconcern, about the energy supply of our country.\n  A few moments ago, the Senator from Michigan was speaking about ANWR, \nthat it was only a moment in time that would pass quickly and that we \nought to be much more interested in other sources of energy.\n  While she was speaking, I was thinking of a trip I recently made to \nher State, to Dearborn, MI, to the laboratories of Ford Motor Company, \nand there, for a period of time, I had the opportunity to visit with \ntheir engineers and scientists and look at what clearly is some of the \nlatest technology that the laboratories of Ford Motor Company are \nemploying toward future transportation.\n  One of those is a much touted, much talked about hydrogen fuel cell. \nSomeday in the future, many of our cars might well be fueled by that \nfuel cell, generating the electricity that would drive the electric \nmotors in the hubs of the wheels of that car.\n  I drove that car. I had the privilege to take it out on the track at \nDearborn and drive it around the track. It was an exciting experience, \nto think that this vehicle could be my future, my children's and my \ngrandchildren's future, as a form of transportation. Very clean; a drop \nof water now and then emitting from the tailpipe of that car.\n  So it is an exciting concept, to think we have invested, taxpayers \nhave invested in future technologies that someday may be available to \nthe consuming public as a form of transportation.\n  Let me talk about the rest of the story, about which the engineers \nand the scientists huddled around the hydrogen fuel cell at Ford Motor \nCompany talked. They talked about the tens of billions of dollars it \nwould take to build the infrastructure to fuel the hydrogen fuel cell \nthat would have to be spread across the country, comparable to the gas \nstation on every corner of America today that fuels the gasoline-\npowered cars.\n  Had we thought about that? Well, I had not thought about it to that \nextent, that it would take decades to build that kind of infrastructure \nso that driving a hydrogen fuel cell car would be as convenient as the \ngas-powered car we drive today. Certainly, whether it be Seattle, WA, \nor Boise, ID, I am not confident we would want to drive to one spot, \none location only, to fuel our hydrogen car. I am sure we would want it \nat least as nearly convenient as fueling our gas-powered car of the \nday. That was one issue.\n\n  The other issue is a very real problem in the minds of American \ndrivers today as to the acceptability of hydrogen cars. It is a little \nthing called ``boom,'' a fear that it might blow up. It is a false \nfear. The hydrogen fuel cell car would not blow up because it is a very \nsafe form of energy. But the reality and the public perception is \nthere. A decade of information, hundreds of millions of dollars \ninvested in experiments and public relations and education and \nexperience is all going to be part of that equation.\n  What happened the day I drove that $6 million prototype hydrogen-\nfueled cell car at Dearborn, MI, taught me something. It taught me we \ndo not instantly do new things around here; we don't instantly have a \nnew hydrogen-fueled cell car. Its day will come, and I do believe it \nmight. It clearly is environmentally clean, and it would be important \nfor our economy.\n  Yes, the economy will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and invest \nbillions of dollars to get us into new forms of transportation. \nHowever, they predicted at Ford Motor Company that we were literally \ndecades away, if not double decades, from a hydrogen-fueled cell car.\n  I say to the Senator from Michigan whose economy depends on the \nemployment of the auto industry to make her State go, what do you do in \nthe meantime, if you don't have the fuel to drive the engines of the \ncars that the workers in Dearborn, MI, produce today? That is part of \nwhat the Senator from the State of Michigan represents.\n  I guess you let them be unemployed. If gas goes up to $3 or $4 a \ngallon, certainly the kind of vehicle, if not the quantity of vehicles \nthat are produced in Michigan today and by the auto industry around the \ncountry, is going to dramatically change. Some would say that is \nperfectly fine, that is the way the marketplace ought to work, and, \ntherefore, who cares? I think the Senator from Michigan cares. I know \nthe Senator from Idaho cares because in Idaho, driving from Boise, ID, \nto Twin Falls, ID, is not around the corner. A few minutes down the \nroad is 2\\1/2\\ hours. It is 250 miles. To go anywhere in my State means \ndriving a couple hundred miles. My State is 600-plus-miles long. By the \nway, that is from here to Boston. And it is about 550 miles wide at the \nwidest.\n  My State is a mile-intensive State. People travel long distances. \nTransportation is critically important. Large, safe automobiles that \nconsume a certain amount of energy are necessary and important.\n  Important to my State, which is now becoming a manufacturing State \nand a processing State, are the products we produce which have to get \nto places like Chicago, to the Detroit, the New York, and the \nMinneapolis-St. Paul because we feed a world economy. If we cannot get \nthe product we produce to that economy at a reasonably priced way, then \neither we go out of production or it gets produced closer to that \nmarketplace.\n  The point I am making and the point that has been made by many today \nis we are an energy-dependent economy; we are an energy-dependent \nsociety. We use a great deal of it. We are wealthy because of it. We \nare free because of it. We have great flexibility as a country because \nof it. We are powerful because of it. And we can help other freedom-\nloving people around the world because of our capacity to not only use \nenergy but produce energy.\n\n  Yet today we have heard many coming to the floor opining the fact \nthat production was somehow bad in the name of the environment, in the \nname of the critter, in the name of the pretty little plant, in the \nname of life after, in the name of generational concerns, in the name \nof something. Someone has found a reason not to produce additional \nenergy for this country. Yet their very presence on the floor, the very \nwealth that has created this country was, in part, a direct result of \nthe abundance of reasonably priced, reliable energy.\n  When I listen to some of my colleagues, a fundamental thought goes \nthrough my mind. Don't they get it? Don't they understand the jobs that \nare created in their State are based on a certain economic equation and \nthat if you adjust that equation arbitrarily or you deny its right to \nbe in place, you run the risk of destroying that job and dramatically \nchanging the economy of the country? Don't they get it?\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\n  What happens if we get $3-a-gallon gas in this country? What happens \nto the cost of doing business in this country? What happens to the \nthousands and thousands of people who no longer have a job because of \nthat in this country? Don't they get it? Or is praying at the altar of \na creature, a plant, a concept, an idea so much more important that \nsomehow we stand back and deny the right of this country to produce the \nenergy it needs reasonably, presently, and in an environmentally sound \nway?\n  Don't they get it? Yeah, they get it. We all get it. My wife told me \nlast night: Don't you get emotional over this issue; you really \nshouldn't; keep your cool. I am trying to, but it is very frustrating \nfor me to suggest to my grandchildren that because of a public policy \nthey are going to be denied certain rights, certain freedoms, certain \nflexibilities within their lifetime that I had within my lifetime \nbecause my forefathers recognized the importance of producing, \nrecognized the importance of abundance, and recognized the importance \nof wealth generation for this country.\n  That is the bottom line of the debate we are involved in tonight. It \nis the fundamental debate that has gone on for the last 4 weeks on the \nfloor of the Senate about a national energy policy.\n  The first opportunity I had to visit with President-elect George W. \nBush, the first opportunity our assistant leader, who has just come to \nthe Chamber, had a chance to visit with President-elect George W. Bush \nwas in Trent Lott's office. The issue in Florida had just been solved. \nThe President-elect was in town. He was beginning to put together his \nCabinet. He came to the Hill to visit with us. I will never forget \nthat. We were all so very proud and excited about his Presidency. He \nsaid: I campaigned on education. I campaigned on tax cuts. I campaigned \non the general well-being and the economy of this country and that I \nwould lead these issues before the Congress and before the American \npeople. But let me tell you what is important now. What is important is \na national energy policy for this country that gets us back into the \nbusiness of producing energy. He said: The first thing I am going to do \nis ask Vice President-elect Dick Cheney to head up an energy task \nforce. We will make recommendations to you in Congress, and we hope you \nwill move a national energy policy as quickly as possible for the \ncountry. We all agreed it was a high priority for our Nation to get \nback in the business of producing energy.\n  That was a priority of this President then. It is now. It is a \npriority of Republicans in the Senate. It is a priority of many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  In establishing national energy priorities, I have changed over the \nyears. I used to think that maybe this was the right way to go and this \nwasn't and you could do this but you couldn't do that. I don't agree \nwith that anymore. The policy ought to create the incentives and the \nopportunities to drive all forms of energy. Conservation ought to be a \npart, and it is now a part of this legislation. New technologies \nclearly ought to be a part, and we ought to provide the kind of tax \nincentives that create the investment that brings the capital that \ndrives new technologies. We have put several billion dollars into new \ntechnologies in the last several years: in photovoltaics and wind and \nthe hydrogen fuel cell car that I talked about that I have had the \nopportunity to drive, all of that is moving forward. All of it is out \nthere in somebody's future. But probably not in my lifetime, at least \nnot all of it, and certainly not some of it. But we ought to be doing \nall of that. We ought to be utilizing our coal with new clean coal \ntechnology. It drives 60 percent of electrical generation today.\n\n  My hydro dams in Idaho and in the Columbia and Snake River systems \nought not be threatened. They ought to be retrofitted and managed in a \nway that they are fish friendly, but they ought to be allowed to \nproduce megawatts--10 percent of the national base.\n  What about nuclear? We have included nuclear in this bill, and we are \nenhancing it--we are reauthorizing Price-Anderson--another 20 percent \nof the base. If we believe in climate change and global warming, we are \nprobably going to want nuclear to be a greater portion of that mix in \ntime.\n  So why on the floor of the Senate tonight are we picking and choosing \nand saying this but not this? Do we know better? No, we do not know \nbetter. But we do know that as we have grown increasingly energy \ndependent on someone else's production, we have lost our flexibility as \na country, we have lost our ability to shape domestic and foreign \npolicy, and in the end, we will lose a little bit of our freedom \nbecause our sovereignty, our ability as a country to make those kinds \nof decisions that drive our economy and shape our attitude and our \nrelationships with our foreign neighbors is, in fact, freedom.\n  ``Oh, it is a freedom argument tonight?'' You're darned right it is. \nSomebody is saying you don't need to produce the 15 or 20 billion \nbarrels of oil in the ANWR, or the 7 or the 8 or the 10--we don't know \nhow much is there, but we know there is a lot there. But if we did, one \nexample about the freedom I am talking about, or the flexibility in \nforeign policy, if we did produce ANWR--bring it into the pipeline, \nmake it available to our refineries, allow it to go to the pump for you \nand me to put in our gas tanks--we could turn to Saddam Hussein, who \njust turned his pumps off last Tuesday, and say: Keep them off. We \ndon't need your oil anymore. We don't need to buy 720,000 barrels a day \nfrom you for $4.2 billion a year so you can use that money to pay \nPalestinian families to allow their kids to be human bombs. We don't \nneed to let you do that anymore. Most importantly, we are not going to \npay for it.\n  Our policy today, or the absence of striving toward the form of \nrelative energy independence is, in fact, allowing that policy. Shame \non us. Bad policy. But, somehow, over the years, in this state of \nambivalence toward production, toward self-sufficiency, we have \nwandered off toward Saddam Hussein. On any given day it can be anywhere \nfrom 55 to 60 percent dependency.\n  ``My goodness, Alaska is just a drop in the bucket.'' Some say it \nwill drop our dependency on foreign sources 14 percent for the next 20 \nyears. I'll bet Colin Powell, in the last week, wished he had 14-\npercent greater capacity to bring off a peace settlement or a cease-\nfire between Palestine and Israel. That would have been a phenomenally \nlarger advantage.\n\n  ``Oh, it is only 14 percent.'' Since when did that not count? I think \nit counts. You cannot be cavalier about this issue.\n  Now let's talk environment. I do not make little of the environment. \nI live in a beautiful State. We have very strict environmental \nstandards in my State, and we adhere to them and we believe in them. \nBut we also believe in production. In the 1970s, when we drilled the \nNorth Slope of Alaska under the most strict environmental conditions \never imposed on an oilfield, we did it and we did not hurt the \nenvironment.\n  You have heard speeches in this Chamber today and yesterday about the \nabundance of the caribou herd and all the successes there. A cousin of \nmine was a foreman for Peter DeWitt. He helped build the pipeline. We \nwere visiting the other night about the phenomenal technicalities \ninvolved in building that pipeline, but they got it done.\n  It was the first time; it was never done before. But Congress said do \nit cleanly, do it sound environmentally, and they did and that pipeline \nis 55, 60 miles away from the field we are talking about now.\n  We are not going to hurt the environment. The technologies of today, \nslant drilling and all of those new employments of technology within \nthe energy field, weren't there in the 1970s, and we did it well then. \nWe will do it better today.\n  It is not a matter of hurting the environment; it is a matter of not \ndoing anything. That is the debate here. Do it or do not do it. Take \nthe environmental equation out of it.\n  If you do not do it, why then are they arguing? Why would anyone take \nthat point of view? I suggest because there are some esoteric \nattitudes, if you do that you slow down economic growth, you discourage \nthis, and the world changes. It is kind of a cave and a candle \nsyndrome: Find everybody a cave to live in and have candlelight for \ntheir reading. You will not have to have all these other goodies that \nwe call the\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\nmarketplace, and somehow the world is going to be a better place.\n  I think not. I think we ought to talk about the differences and the \ntradeoffs. We ought to talk about the jobs.\n  My colleagues from Alaska and those who have analyzed this matter \nwould suggest anywhere from 250,000 to 700,000 jobs could be created. \nSince when did jobs become a dirty environmental idea? I think it is a \nclean idea. I think it puts food on the tables of a lot of folks. It \nallows them to buy houses and cars and a college education for their \nkids. That sounds like a clean idea to me, and somehow someone is \nsuggesting that is a bad idea.\n  The point here is simple. It ought not be that frustrating. None of \nus should struggle that mightily about it. It is producing energy for \nthis economy, doing it in a wise and responsible way, doing it in an \nenvironmentally sound way, and, oh yes, doing it where it is. You have \nto go to the oil to get the oil.\n  We know there is oil under the ANWR in Alaska. The work has already \nbeen done. The EIS is already in place. The seismograph estimates a \nsubstantial volume. It is the natural and responsible next step in the \ndevelopment of the oil reserves of the State of Alaska and for this \ncountry.\n  We are going to choose to buy from outside the country, if we do not \ndevelop. We will continue to buy even if we do develop, but we will buy \nless. We will be a little more independent. We will create a lot of \njobs. We will put $70 billion in the U.S. Treasury, and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars will remain in the U.S. economy. To me, that just \nmakes a heck of a lot of good sense.\n\n  I hope the amendments to this energy bill dealing with ANWR that are \non the floor are agreed to. I hope we can vote for them. I hope at \nleast nobody will hide behind a procedural effort. It ought to be up or \ndown, yes or no, are you for it or are you against it? If you are \nagainst it and you can justify it--and, obviously, those who speak \nagainst it can--then so be it. That is the way we shape public policy \nin the Senate: honestly, fairly, and hopefully aboveboard for all the \nAmerican citizens of our great country to see.\n  I believe we ought to explore ANWR. I believe we ought to develop it. \nI think this country needs it. I think we are better for it. We will be \na stronger nation, we will be more independent, we will have greater \nflexibility, we will create more jobs, we will get greater \nopportunities for our kids and our grandkids, and our environment will \nremain clean and sound and the Porcupine caribou herd will flourish and \nthe world will go on.\n  But it will be different if we cannot do that. We will be less free, \nmore dependent, with less flexibility. The job of Colin Powell and his \ncolleagues will be even more difficult because we have less \nindependence to engage our friends and our enemies in trying to create \na safer world. That is part of the issue. That is part of the debate.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma is in the Chamber ready to speak. It is an \nimportant issue. I hope all of us will take seriously the vote that we \nwill be casting, I believe tomorrow, on cloture on this most important \nissue. In my opinion, it is a generational issue that comes before the \nSenate at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Republican leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague, Senator \nCraig from Idaho, for his speech. I also compliment Senator Murkowski \nfor his leadership in trying to put together a good energy bill, as \nwell as Senator Stevens. Both have made extensive speeches on the need \nfor exploration in Alaska. I happen to respect both individuals very \nmuch.\n  I happen to have accepted one of their invitations to visit the area. \nAnd I believe all Senators received this invitation as well. I \nencourage my colleagues to do so.\n  I think there is a long tradition in the Senate where we have given \nhome State Senators great latitude in making decisions that impact \ntheir States primarily. I am kind of bothered by the number of people \nwho are coming out against drilling in ANWR without ever being there, \nwithout ever visiting the people, and without knowing the real impact.\n  Alaska happens to be one of the prettiest States in the Nation. It is \none of the largest. I have been to several points in Alaska, including \nthe Prudhoe Bay area and the ANWR area. Alaska contains beautiful \nscenic areas. However, the ANWR area, and particularly the coastal \nregion, is not one of the prettier areas of Alaska. On the whole, \nalthough, it is a beautiful State.\n  When I heard people say we can't mess up this pristine wilderness, I \nwas thinking that maybe they did not visit the area. Again, many States \nhave gorgeous scenic views, and Alaska probably more than any other \nState. But this particular area can be drilled. It can be explored in \nan environmentally safe and sound manner without disturbing the \nenvironment and without disturbing wildlife.\n  I compliment the home State Senators. I wish people would listen to \nthem. I think too many people have been listening to special interest \ngroups that are trying to raise money on this issue without giving \nattention to some of the serious national and State problems.\n  We have real national problems. We are importing 60 percent of our \noil today. We are spending about $100 billion a year overseas. We are \nshipping that money overseas to buy imported oil. That 60-percent \nfigure means that we are very dependent on other countries for our \nlivelihood. We have evidence of this in the past when we had \ncurtailments. We had a curtailment in 1973 of 26 percent. There was an \nArab oil embargo. This caused long lines at the gas stations as oil \nprices rose dramatically. In addition, unemployment went up as \nfactories stalled and subsequently shut down. We even had schools \nclosed. We had people who weren't able to get heat. We experienced this \nin 1973 when we were importing 26 percent and in 1979 when we were \nimporting 44 percent. At that particular time, the OPEC countries \ndidn't like our policy--sometimes our policy concerning Israel--so they \nwanted to teach us a lesson. They curtailed oil shipments to the United \nStates.\n  Today we find ourselves vulnerable to the hardships we experienced in \nthe past. We are currently importing 60 percent. That number continues \nto rise. It makes us very vulnerable. Without energy security, we don't \nhave national security.\n  It is incumbent upon us to do something. President Bush, to his \ncredit, and Vice President Cheney's, to his credit, formulated a \nnational energy policy--the first administration to do so in decades. \nThe House, to their credit, last June passed a bipartisan energy bill. \nMy compliments to them.\n  Many of us in the Senate wanted to pass a bipartisan energy bill. I \nhave been on the Energy Committee for 22 years. Every major energy \npiece of legislation we passed has been bipartisan--every single one.\n\n  We passed a bill deregulating natural gas prices. It took years, but \nwe did it.\n  In the Finance Committee, we passed a bill to eliminate the windfall \nprofits tax. We passed a bill to repeal the Fuel Use Act. We passed a \nbill to eliminate the Synthetic Fuels Corporation.\n  Many of those mistakes that were made during the Carter \nadministration were enacted by the Democratic Congress which needed to \nbe repealed. And we repealed them in a bipartisan fashion.\n  We started marking up the energy bill. All of a sudden, the majority \nleader tells the chairman of the Energy Committee not to have a markup. \nSo the bill we have before us, in my opinion, is in desperate need of \nimprovement. It is 590 pages. It was never marked up in committee.\n  I have been on the committee for 22 years. I was never able to offer \nan amendment on this bill.\n  Some people say: Why have you been on this energy bill for so long? \nWe have to rewrite the bill on the floor. Why are you spending so much \ntime on ANWR? Guess what. If we had marked the bill up in committee, we \nwould have ANWR in there. We had the votes. I suspect the reason the \nmajority leader told Senator Bingaman not to mark up the bill is \nbecause he is adamantly opposed to exploration in ANWR. He may well \nhave victory on the floor tomorrow. We will find out. I hope he is \nproud.\n  What about the hundreds of thousands of jobs that wouldn't be created \nbecause we will not have exploration? What about the billions of \ndollars that we are shipping overseas to little countries, such as \nIraq, that really aren't\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\nour best friends? Because he is continuing that policy--he is \ncontinuing the dependency, in some cases, on very unstable and \nunreliable sources of oil.\n  Our national energy is tied to our energy security, and we are taking \nsteps to secure ourselves. We could reverse our actions significantly \nby allowing exploration in ANWR. But the majority leader may be \nsuccessful in keeping it off.\n  My guess is, if we had done the bill as we have done every single \nbill for the last 20-some years in committee, that it would have been \nin the bill, and it would have stayed in the bill. I think the majority \nleader knows that. Maybe his tactic will be successful, but he has \ntotally disrupted the precedents and the standard of using committee \nprocedures to mark up bills.\n  We have committees and a process in which they follow. Why \ndisenfranchise 20-some Senators from marking up a bill? This offends \nme. This bill has 590 pages. The first bill we considered had 539 \npages.\n  Again, no Senator got to mark up either bill. This was put together \nby the majority leader. This was put together by Senator Bingaman. No \nother Senators I know of got to mark it up because there wasn't a \nmarkup held.\n  Where is the committee report? The standard procedure in taking up a \nbill is that we will have a committee report and allow individual \nSenators to make comments supporting or opposing the bill's provisions.\n  However, since we seem to have skipped this process, we have to dig \nthrough the bill and find out what is in it. This legislative language \nand not the easiest language to read. There is no common English \nexplanation for it, as we have in almost every major bill.\n\n  I am very offended by the process. It was done I think primarily to \navoid having a vote on ANWR, or making it impossible for us to put ANWR \nin. We will have to put ANWR in. It will take 60 votes. If we had ANWR \nin a committee bill, it would only take 50 votes.\n  The majority leader is able to use the rules and maybe bypass the \nentire committee structure so he can have a victory. Congratulations. \nTell that to the hundreds of thousands of people who don't get a job \nbecause we are not going to explore ANWR. Hundreds of thousands of \njobs?\n  Wait a minute. How many things can we do here? Senator Murkowski has \nsaid many times that this will create thousands and thousands of jobs. \nOne estimation is that it might create 250,000 jobs, while others offer \nhigher estimates.\n  How many times can we pass a bill that will say if we do this we are \ngoing to be able to reduce our dependency on foreign sources, and, \ninstead of spending $100 billion overseas, billions of those dollars \ncan stay in the United States--that will stay with U.S. companies, that \nwill be American made, that will be American owned--and where the \ndividends, royalties, and payments will go to workers and employees of \nAmerican companies? How many times do we have that opportunity?\n  The majority leader may be successful in stopping it, but it makes us \nmore dependent. It makes us more vulnerable to countries such as Iraq \nand other countries that might be upset with our Middle East policies.\n  I disagree with that very strongly. I disagree very strongly with \ncountless Senators. I would love to know how many Senators have never \nbeen up there and are making decisions that say: I know better than \nSenator Murkowski; I know better than Senator Stevens.\n  I know that both Senator Stevens and Senator Murkowski have been \nthere several times.\n  I happen to have been there, I think, once. I learned a great deal. I \nhave been to Kaktovik, and I talked to the villagers. They are all in \nfavor of it. They are more concerned about their environment than \nanyone else. They live there 365 days a year. Yet we are going to deny \nthem an economic livelihood? I think that is a serious mistake.\n  I have heard countless people say: We can't do this because of the \nenvironmental impact. We are talking about 2,000 acres--2,000 acres--\nout of a land mass that is 19.6 million acres. And 2,000 acres may be \nabout the size of an average airport, compared to 19 million acres, \nabout the size of South Carolina. That is a very small percentage, very \nlittle negative impact, if you consider the impact to be negative in \nthe first place. We have hundreds or thousands of wells in my State of \nOklahoma, as Texas and Louisiana do also. We have not seen considerable \nnegative impacts.\n  A pipeline, is that so bad? You ought to look at a interstate \npipeline map and see how many pipeline miles are across the State of \nLouisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas. You don't know they are there, but \nthey are there. And people act like that would just desecrate this \nbeautiful area. I just question that.\n  As a matter of fact, I look at the ANWR Coastal Plain, and it would \ntake just a small connection to be able to tie into the TransAlaska Oil \nPipeline. This small connection would be about 100 miles long.\n  I look at the gas pipeline, and I heard the Senator from Michigan \nsay, oh, she is all in favor of the gas pipeline. That is all new \npipeline, and that is about 3,000 miles. The pipeline we are talking \nabout is maybe 100 miles, connecting from ANWR to the oil pipeline that \nis already built. The oil pipeline is about 800 miles.\n  Now we are talking about a 3,000-mile pipeline, almost all of it new, \ngoing through a lot of virgin territory that has never had roads, never \nhad a pipeline on it. This is the gas pipeline that a lot of people are \nsaying would do 100 times the environmental damage of what we are \ntalking about, connecting to the oil pipeline that is already there--\n100 times the environmental damage.\n  I heard somebody say, what about the caribou, or what about the \nwildlife in the area? I remember flying up there and looking around and \nlooking at the wildlife. Alaska is a gorgeous State that has a lot of \nwildlife. In that particular Coastal Plain area, when I was there, I \ndid not see hardly any wildlife. I could see more wildlife in my State \nof Oklahoma or the State of Louisiana in any square mile than what I \nsaw at the time I happened to visit there. I did not visit there when \nthe caribou were migrating in.\n  I care about the caribou. I saw a lot of caribou at Prudhoe Bay. I \nremember when Prudhoe Bay was originally built, there was about 3,000 \ncaribou. Today, there are 20-some thousand. The caribou herds have \nmultiplied dramatically. I think there are up to 27,000 caribou in the \nPrudhoe Bay area, about 9 times what there was 25 years ago. So the \ncaribou have been protected fairly well. They have multiplied \nsignificantly and have proven not only to survive but to survive quite \nwell with the TransAlaska Pipeline. I am sure they could survive with \nthis small little junction from the ANWR area to the Prudhoe Bay \npipeline.\n  So people who are raising these facades, ``Well, we can't disturb the \nwildlife,'' ``We can't disturb the natural environment,'' what are you \ndoing supporting the gas pipeline that is 3,000 miles through virgin \nterritory versus a pipeline that might be 100 miles connecting ANWR to \nthe TransAlaska Pipeline? That does not make sense. That is absurd. I \nam just shocked by some of the false arguments that are being raised.\n\n  I do want to create jobs. I do want to make us less dependent on \nforeign sources. I do not want Saddam Hussein, who is now talking about \nhaving an oil embargo against the United States for 30 days because he \ndoesn't like our policies in the Middle East--I don't want him to hold \nany type of economic leverage over the United States. Right now we are \nimporting about a million barrels per day from Iraq, from Saddam \nHussein.\n  Guess what. The production we expect to receive from ANWR is about a \nmillion barrels a day, except that it is estimated to last 20, 30, 40 \nyears.\n  The Prudhoe Bay production that we have had for the last 25 years \ngrew to a couple million barrels a day. Now it has declined to about a \nmillion barrels per day. So we have excess capacity of a million \nbarrels, and ANWR could help complement that. Then we would have 2 \nmillion barrels per day coming down the TransAlaska Pipeline. That is \nover 25 percent of our domestic production. Our country--our Nation--\nneeds that for national security. So to deny this, I believe, is a \nnational security issue.\n  So we should give deference to our home State colleagues of Alaska. \nWe should listen to their advice, and we should allow exploration in \nANWR.\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to consider doing what is right for America, \nwhat is right for our country, what is right for our national security, \nand, frankly, what is right for Alaska.\n  This project is supported overwhelmingly by Alaskans because they \nbelieve they need it, both economically and for the national security \nimplications as well.\n  So I urge my colleagues, tomorrow, to support Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Stevens and allow exploration in the ANWR area.\n  Mr. President, one final comment I will make, and that is, there is \nan amendment pending--I guess we may have a vote on it--dealing with \nmoney going to help the steel industry cope with some of the \ndifficulties they have. Some people call them legacy costs, but it is \npicking up health costs for retirees.\n  I think that is a serious mistake. I do not know why the Federal \nTreasury or the taxpayers should have to take general revenue money, or \nmoney coming from this pipeline to pay pension costs or health care \ncosts for one particular industry. If you are going to do it for this \nindustry, then what about the textiles, what about auto workers, what \nabout railroad workers?\n  You have a lot of industries that have a lot of retirees who are \nstruggling with paying their pensions and/or health care plans. They \nmade those contracts. Is the Federal Government responsible to come in \nand assume all the costs of those contracts? If so, we have real \nserious problems. If we are going to do it for one, how can we not do \nit for another? I think it would be a serious mistake and set a serious \nprecedent that I hope we don't follow. So I urge my colleagues to vote \nno on the steel legacy amendment, as it has been called.\n  However, I urge my colleagues, with every fiber in my being, to \nsupport exploration in ANWR, the Murkowski amendment. Let's listen to \nthe Senators from the State of Alaska. They know this issue inside and \nout, far better than anybody else. They have been there countless \ntimes. Let's follow their advice and open up ANWR for exploration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are now debating energy policy in the \nSenate that will affect the lives of generations to come, so we must \nmake sure that our approach is comprehensive and balanced. We cannot \nallow poor energy policy proposals to be used as a smokescreen for an \nunwillingness to focus on the harder long-term issues. Drilling in the \nAlaskan National Wildlife Refuge is one such bad policy proposal.\n  It is impossible for the United States to ``drill'' its way out of \noil dependency. The United States has 3 percent of the world's oil \nreserves but consumes 25 percent of the world's oil. The Arctic refuge \ncontains less than 6 months of economically-recoverable oil and that \noil would not be available for 10 years. This means that drilling in \nANWR would not provide any immediate energy relief for American \nfamilies.\n  Further, the claim that drilling in ANWR would create thousands of \njobs is excessive. The job estimates used to support drilling in the \nArctic refuge were developed by the American Petroleum Institute, API, \nin 1990 and are insupportable. According to the Congressional Research \nService and other recent independent studies, the API used exaggerated \nestimates and questionable economic analysis.\n  More than 95 percent of Alaska's North Slope is open to oil and \nnatural gas exploration or development today. In 1999, the Clinton \nadministration opened nearly 4 million acres of the National Petroleum \nReserve-Alaska to oil and gas drilling and signed a bill lifting the \nban on the export of Alaska North Slope oil, a move strongly supported \nby industry. This action opened 425 tracts on 3.9 million acres, an \narea more than twice the size of ANWR. As a result of improved \ntechnologies and renewed interest in the North Slope, the lease sale \nreturned more than $104 million in bonus bids, 50 percent of which will \ngo to the Federal Government, and 50 percent to the State of Alaska. \nThe oil industry should explore and develop the National Petroleum \nReserve-Alaska before there is any consideration of opening ANWR.\n  As population and the economy grow, so does the demand for energy. We \ndo need to keep the United States at the forefront of innovative energy \nproduction. The efficient use of energy has to be our primary goal and \nwe need to create incentives to conserve. There are many ways to do \nthis. Midwestern farmlands are ideal for growing high-yield ``energy \ncrops,'' including soybeans grown in Michigan, to help power our \neconomy. Corn grown in the Midwest can be used to produce ethanol, a \ncleaner burning fuel for vehicles. While there are barriers that must \nbe overcome to bring these alternative sources of power on line, we \nshould support renewable energy programs by offering incentives to \nthose who use them.\n  Further, a new generation of automotive technology is under \ndevelopment that offers great promise in our quest to achieve greater \nfuel efficiency. Technologies such as hybrid vehicles, which use an \ninternal combustion engine in combination with a battery and electric \nmotor, and fuel cells, which are devices using hydrogen and oxygen to \ncreate electricity and heat, should help to dramatically improve fuel \neconomy and protect our environment.\n  Drilling in our pristine wilderness will not alter our dependence on \nforeign oil, it will only alter our protected wilderness. We have a \nresponsibility to promote a balanced energy plan that invests in \nAmerica's future and protects our environment, not one that damages a \nunique and irreplaceable wilderness.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I got an e-mail from my oldest son, who \ntold me he was surprised by the comments of the Senator from Minnesota \nconcerning this issue being a political issue and politics as usual. I \nam not surprised. But I did tell him I think the Senate has changed.\n  Before I go to my other remarks, I would like to relate to the Senate \nwhat happened to me as a young Senator, a young appointed Senator. I \ncame here in 1968, and by the springtime of 1969, Senator Gordon Allott \nof Colorado, who was a friend from the days when I was in Washington at \nthe Interior Department. When I left I was Solicitor, and I was very \nclose to Gordon Allott. He was a personal friend as well as the person \nI worked with in the Eisenhower administration.\n  He said he thought it would be good if I would meet with some of the \nolder Senators and talk about life in the Senate. So I said I would, \nand a day or two later, Senator Allott said they were going to gather \nup in Senator Eastland's office. At that time it was on the third \nfloor. I think it was room 306, just above what has been one of the \nleader's offices on the second floor.\n  As I walked in, I found that I was facing eight of the senior \nSenators. I hadn't been around long. I had been familiar with Senate \nactivity. But it was a very interesting meeting: Senator Eastland of \nMississippi, Senator Allott of Colorado, Senator Cotton of New \nHampshire, Senator Paul Fannin of Arizona, Senator Hruska of Nebraska. \nI believe the others were Senator Long of Louisiana, Senator Randolph \nof West Virginia, and Senator Talmadge of Georgia.\n  Those were different days. They were days when there was a different \nfeeling in the Senate. These were eight senior Senators, four from each \nside. Obviously, they enjoyed one another's company. Those were the \ndays when, late in the afternoon, there were a few refreshments on the \ntable in Senator Eastland's office. He said to me: Why don't you help \nyourself, son. I did, and I sat down. And Senator Allott said to me \nthey just thought they ought to talk to me a little bit about how it \nwas easy to get along in the Senate if one understood the Senate.\n  For instance, the conversation went to the point of the fact that we \nwere a new State, a young State that had only been in the Union for 10 \nyears. They wanted to make sure I understood the Senate. Senator Allott \ntold them I had been around during the Eisenhower days. I had been with \nthe liaison to the\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\nSenate. They said they wanted me to understand relationships in the \nSenate.\n  We talked about senatorial courtesy and what it means to have a right \nto be consulted concerning appointments to your State. We talked about \njust the idea of the aisle as a separation between individual Senators; \nthis is a place where, if you are going to be here, you ought to know \nwho you are working with, and they welcomed a newcomer, an appointed \nSenator, to visit with them on how they felt about the Senate.\n\n  It was one of the most interesting conversations of my life. The \npoint got around to a new State and the prerogatives of a new State. \nOne of the things they told me was very simple: If you and your \ncolleague agree on an issue that affects your State, for instance, land \nin your State, you let us know because we believe you know more about \nyour State than we do, and we are going to rely on you; we are going to \nrely on you to make the judgments on Federal actions that affect your \nState, and only your State.\n  I thought about that last night. I have listened to people here over \nthe years talk about the rights of their States and what has happened \nto their States and what might happen to their States.\n  I don't think any State has lived through what we have lived through \nin the first years of our statehood. We have been denuded of jobs--I \nwill talk about the people who have done it--by a group that takes \nadvantage of the division of the country in order to achieve objectives \nthey could not achieve but for the divisions that exist in the Senate \ntoday. It is truly a split Senate. Relationships between the majority \nand minority are strained more than I have ever seen them.\n  We have a situation where the two of us, since 1981, have sought the \nfulfillment of a commitment made to us in 1980, and it is apparent now \nthat it will be denied--not permanently; we still will have a chance to \ncome back at this again. This bill will not forever forbid the concept \nof oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Plain of Alaska, but it will not \nhappen until there is an act of Congress to authorize it to proceed.\n  In terms of the relationships of the Senate, I raised the question: \nWhat about other Senators? Are we to presume that the concept of the \nSenate relying upon the two Senators from that State, if they agree on \nan issue pertaining to their State, the Senate will listen to them? I \ndon't think so.\n  I think we have seen really a split in the Senate intentionally \ncaused by the radical environmental organizations of the country that \nthink they really control the country now. I will show you; they \nprobably do. They probably do much more than the public believes.\n  Senator Wellstone said today that he had meetings with the Gwich'in \npeople because of the pristine wilderness, and they live in the area. I \nbeg to correct the Senator. The Gwich'ins live on the south slope of \nthe Arctic range. They are Canadian Indians, at least part of a \nCanadian tribe of Indians called the Gwich'ins. They have land in \nAlaska. They opted not to participate in the great land settlement of \nthe Alaska Native lands settlement. They opted out. They took their \nland and did not want to rely in any way on the Federal Government.\n  As a matter of fact, right after they took their land, rather than \nparticipate in the land claims settlement, they put their land up for \noil and gas leasing. No one wanted to lease it. They put their land up \nfor coal leasing. They do have a lot of coal. And no one wanted to \nlease it.\n  As a matter of fact, we hardly ever heard from the Gwich'ins about \nthis issue until they were hired by one of the environmental \norganizations, and they have become the spokesmen for the environmental \norganizations as a representative of the Alaska Native people. But they \nare Canadian Indians who live in Alaska.\n  The Alaska Native people, the Alaska Federation of Natives, and \nparticularly the great Eskimo community on the Alaska North Slope, \nsupport drilling in the 1002 area of the Alaska Coastal Plain. They \nlive in the area. The Gwich'ins do not. The people who own land within \nthis area at Kaktovik, the Eskimo people, violently support this. They \nwant it to happen. They have been denied the right by Federal order to \ndrill on their own land, and our bill removes that impediment.\n  I have tried my best to explain why we went into the concept of \nlooking at the steel legacy program. One Senator said he thought my \neffort was not real, not authentic, and I sought to take advantage of \nthe hopes and pains of his people. If I had been here, I would have \ntaken a point of personal privilege. That is an accusation of immoral \nconduct on the part of a Senator--were it true. It is not true.\n  Who made that linkage? The people who don't want to work with us. \nThey know my amendment would provide a cashflow to the steelworkers who \nare currently going to be denied their medical care that they thought \nthey were going to get. One Senator said: It is only $1 billion. It is \nonly $1 billion. Well, we are getting $1.6 to $2.7 billion, we believe, \nin the bonus bids. And they only get $1 billion. Between now and 2005, \nthey only get $1 billion. They get $8 billion over 30 years. If it is \ncynical, it is cynical because of the people who don't want to face up \nto their own responsibility.\n  We need that steel. We can't build this gas pipeline from Alaska, \n3,000 miles from the North Slope to Chicago, unless we have steel. We \ncan't have steel unless the steel companies of this country survive. \nThey are not going to survive under the current circumstances.\n  As I said yesterday, 30 steel companies have gone bankrupt in the \nyear 2000. Do the people who represent those areas understand their \nState? I understand mine. My State is bankrupt because the last \nadministration closed down our mines, our timber operations, oil and \ngas activity, and our cruise ships. They have closed us down and want \nus to be a national park.\n  I am trying to represent my people, but I just hope these people here \ndon't come in and accuse me of having taking action to take advantage \nof the hopes and pains of people.\n  I hope I am here then. I hope I am here then. We will have a \ndiscussion then. One said that drilling can't help because they thought \nthat the legacy fund could not be solved by the moneys that would come \nfrom drilling in ANWR. I never said they would be solved. I never said \nthey would be solved. I said we could provide a plug in that fund to \nkeep them going until we got production from the Arctic Plain, and then \nwe could go up to a total of $18 billion in 30 years to make that fund \nsound.\n  Now, it is one thing to not agree with a Senator who is trying to put \ntwo things together. By the way, let me remind the Senate that the \ngreat civil rights legislation of this country was introduced by \nEverett Dirksen of Illinois as a rider to another bill. It was a rider \nto another bill. It was the military structure and school bill. He \nadded the civil rights legislation.\n  From some people on the other side, you would think the Democratic \nParty started civil rights in this country. The person who introduced \nthe major bill was Everett Dirksen of Illinois, working with Lyndon \nJohnson when he was majority leader. Johnson called up the bill so that \nEverett Dirksen could offer that amendment. It was in February 1960.\n  In terms of other debates, when we were talking about the Foreign \nMilitary Sales Act of 1970, John Sherman Cooper of Connecticut and \nSenator Frank Church of Idaho offered an amendment to limit military \noperations in Cambodia. That became a substantial change in that bill. \nIt became two bills, and, because they were joined together, they \npassed.\n  In 1982, we joined the Trade Reciprocity and Dividend Withholding \nActs, and the proponents of both succeeded in bringing them together in \nthe Senate. It is not unknown for a Senator to suggest that two \nseparate pieces of legislation ought to be joined together in order to \nmake a coalition of Senators who believe in an objective.\n  I take umbrage to some of the comments made by those people who don't \nhave the guts to come forward and represent their own people. I would \nrepresent my people here until I die. We have done that. We have gone \nto the wall. I am accused of being the pork chief, or the chief porker \naround here. Why? Because my State is almost dead\n\n[[Page S2808]]\n\ndue to the actions of the last administration in shutting down our \ntimber industry, oil and gas industry, mining industry, and the cruise \nships' total opposition to the State of Alaska in terms of any kind of \ndevelopment on Federal land, whether it was within or without the great \nwithdrawals we have been talking about.\n  When we entered into that agreement in 1980, person after person--\nSenator Murkowski and I read them--including the President, said we \nhave reached an understanding so that the land can be preserved that \nneeded to be preserved, but Alaska can go forward with development of \noil and gas and timber and mining. They said that. They acknowledged it \nin public that there was a deal--a deal.\n  A deal, to me, is not a bad word. Up our way, when we make a deal, we \nshake hands. We don't have to have an act of Congress if you give a man \nyour word, your promise. As Robert Service said, ``A promise made is a \ndebt unpaid.''\n  Congress made a promise to Alaska that this land would be opened to \noil and gas. It was shown in that environmental impact statement that \nthere would be no permanent harm to the fish and wildlife area.\n  Now along comes this environmental group that has to be the most \nhorrendous thing that I have gotten into. I wish I had more time for \nthis, and some day I will take a lot more time for it. I think, because \nof these people, we have lost that ambiance on the floor.\n\n  In the days of Senator Mansfield, we used to have dining groups. \nMansfield encouraged us to get together. As young Senators from both \nsides of the aisle, we would invite people from the other side of the \naisle to our homes for dinner. At least three times a year we used to \nhave dinner with other Senators in each other's homes. We got to know \none another. We took them to our States. We would travel with each \nother. We disagreed here on the floor and we did our job representing \nour people; but we were friends.\n  Many Senators right now are not going to have many friends in the \nSenate after this year is over. It is because of what is happening \nnow--this great division, turning everything into political issues. We \nare told that on every issue the President has to have 60 votes--not a \nmajority, but every one of the President's programs has to have 60 \nvotes in order to stop the opposition of the majority.\n  That is not like the days of Mike Mansfield or Lyndon Johnson. Lyndon \nJohnson cooperated with President Eisenhower. Mike Mansfield cooperated \nwith President Nixon and President Ford. Where is the spirit of \ncooperation from the majority?\n  I think it is high time people understood what is going on here. It \nis going to have a long-term impact on the Senate, as far as this \nSenator is concerned. I still have my friends over there, and I love \nthem. By the way, they are still my friends. They understand what we \nare doing. They are the Senators from the old days who understand that \nwhen two Senators agree concerning an issue in their State, they ought \nto be listened to by the Senate. They don't always agree, but they \ncertainly should not be attacked.\n  Let's talk about the fundraising groups. We have some charts. \nFundraising groups started off as philanthropic organizations that \nraise money to help achieve conservation objectives. They have been the \nsubject of a review by the Sacramento Bee. Why do I look at that? They \nhappen to own our largest newspaper, the Anchorage Daily News. We came \nacross some of these articles that I will ask to put in the Record.\n  The Institute of Philanthropy suggests that fundraising expenses not \nexceed 35 percent. This is the percentage of environmental groups' \ndonations used to raise more money, not for environmental protection. \nThe National Parks Conservation Association uses 41 percent of the \nmoney they raise to raise more money; the Sierra Club, 42 percent; \nDefenders of Wildlife, 50 percent; Greenpeace, 56 percent; National \nPark Trust, 74 percent. So 75 cents out of every dollar goes to raise \nmore money, not to help the parks.\n  Are these philanthropic, eleemosynary institutions? Are they? No. \nThey are organizations that are now there to participate in the \nmanagement of them. Let me show you, for instance, the annual income of \nthese groups. This is just income of the presidents of philanthropic \norganizations. They are not the President of the United States, but you \nwill see that several make more than the President of the United \nStates. All but one makes more money than any Member of Congress. They \nare out raising money from people. They send them letter after letter, \nand they spend more money to go out and get more money, and they raise \nmore money than they do for their objectives. Look at what they do with \nwhat is left.\n  The median household income in the United States in 2000 was $42,148; \nthat is the income of a husband and wife in a household in the year \n2000. The Sierra Club's executive director makes $138,000, which is \nconservative. All they really do now is raise money. That is a pretty \ngood income. The president of the Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund \nmakes $157,000. They raise money so they can sue--not in terms of doing \nanything for the conservation; they are protesters. Defenders of \nWildlife, $201,000. The president of the Wilderness Society, $204,000; \nthat is Fred Gaylord Nelson. He has graduated to a better salary. \nPresident, National Audubon Society, $239,000. World Wildlife Fund, \n$204,000. National Wildlife Federation, $247,000.\n  What is eleemosynary about that? Are these volunteers to save the \nworld?\n  These are people in it for what they can get out of it, and what they \nget out of it is both money for themselves and money to contribute to \npeople who support them. We will get into that, too.\n  This is the amount of mailings sent annually by these groups. These \nare mailings, in the millions, for more fundraising, not money to \nnotify people of a problem: the Audubon Society, 7 million; Greenpeace, \n8; the Sierra Club, 10.5; Defenders of Wildlife, 11; the National \nWildlife Federation, 12.5; National Parks and Conservation, 17; World \nWildlife, 19; Nature Conservancy, 35. They mail about 160 million \nmailings a year. The response is 1 to 2 percent.\n  I wonder who owns the mailing companies. I have to look into that. \nSomebody is making money on just the mailings from these people. What \nare they doing?\n  One hundred sixty million mailings, how many trees does that take, \nMr. President? They are stopping us from cutting our trees in Alaska. \nFrom where are they getting that paper? They are not recycling it all. \nThis group has in mind controlling what the Government does with regard \nto Federal lands in particular.\n  Who spends more to protect the environment? This is from the \n``Environmental Benefits of Advanced Oil and Gas Exploration and \nProduction Technology'' published in the Clinton administration. This \nis not this administration. This is the Clinton administration.\n  It is clear that the oil and gas industry spent $8 billion, in this 1 \nyear, 1996. That is more than EPA's entire budget for 1996 and 333 \npercent more than all environmental groups put together. The oil and \ngas industry spends more to protect the environment by the Clinton \nadministration's findings than all environmental groups put together. \nThe environmental groups spent $2.4 billion in 1996. That is their \ntotal spending, and we have seen most of this is spent to raise more \nmoney--this is from environmental groups--not to protect the \nenvironment, but to raise more money and pad their own wallets.\n  It is amazing, as I look at law firms around the country. They are \nadvertising to get contributions to protect the environment, and what \nthey are really doing is taking contributions and paying themselves to \nrepresent protest groups. It is an interesting connection to the \nenvironment. I am not sure that is advancing the cause of the \nenvironment.\n  In any event, they are really soliciting money for their own \nsalaries, which in my day in practicing law would have been thought to \nbe unethical. It is not unethical now, I guess.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a series of articles from \nthe Sacramento Bee be printed in the Record. They were written by a Bee \nstaff writer in April of last year. The first is called ``Green \nMachine.'' Tom Knudson's article says:\n\n       Dear friend, I need your help to stop an impending \n     slaughter. Otherwise, Yellowstone\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\n     National Park--an American wildlife treasure--could soon \n     become a bloody killing field. And the victims will be \n     hundreds of wolves and defenseless wolf pups.''\n  So begins a fund-raising letter from one of America's fastest-growing \nenvironmental groups--Defenders of Wildlife.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       In 1999, donations jumped 28 percent to a record $17.5 \n     million. The group's net assets . . . grew to $14.5 million, \n     another record. And according to its 1999 annual report, \n     Defenders spent donors' money wisely, keeping fund-raising \n     and management costs to . . . 19 percent of expenses.\n\n  But there is another side to Defenders' dramatic growth.\n  Pick up copies of its federal tax returns and you'll find that its \nfive highest-paid partners are not firms that specialize in wildlife \nconservation. They are national direct mail and telemarketing \ncompanies--the same ones that raise money through the mail and over the \ntelephone for nonprofit groups, from Mothers Against Drunk Driving to \nthe U.S. Olympic Committee.\n       You'll also find that in calculating its fund-raising \n     expenses, Defenders borrow a trick from the business world. \n     It dances with digits, finds opportunity in obfuscation. \n     Using an accounting loophole, it classifies millions of \n     dollars spent on direct mail and telemarketing activities not \n     as fund-raising but as public education and environmental \n     activism.\n\n  Sounds like another Enron to me.\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent this series of articles be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n  There being on objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, Apr. 23, 2001]\n\n               Mission Adrift in a Frenzy of Fund Raising\n\n                            (By Tom Knudson)\n\n       ``Dear Friend, I need your help to stop an impending \n     slaughter. Otherwise, Yellowstone National Park could soon \n     become a bloody killing field. And the victims will be \n     hundreds of wolves and defenseless wolf pups!''\n       So begins a fund-raising letter from one of America's \n     fastest-growing environmental groups--Defenders of Wildlife.\n       Using the popular North American gray wolf as the hub of an \n     ambitious campaign, Defenders has assembled a financial track \n     record that would impress Wall Street.\n       In 1999, donations jumped 28 percent to a record $17.5 \n     million. The group's net assets, a measure of financial \n     stability, grew to $14.5 million, another record. And \n     according to its 1999 annual report, Defenders spent donors' \n     money wisely, keeping fund-raising and management costs to a \n     lean 19 percent of expenses.\n       But there is another side to Defenders' dramatic growth.\n       Pick up copies of its federal tax returns and you'll find \n     that its five highest-paid business partners are not firms \n     that specialize in wildlife conservation. They are national \n     direct mail and telemarketing companies--the same ones that \n     raise money through the mail and over the telephone for \n     nonprofit groups. from Mothers Against Drunk Driving to the \n     U.S. Olympic Committee.\n       You'll also find that in calculating its fund-raising \n     expenses, Defenders borrows a trick from the business world. \n     It dances with digits, finds opportunity in obfuscation. \n     Using an accounting loophole, it classifies millions of \n     dollars spent on direct mail and telemarketing not as fund \n     raising but as public education and environmental activism.\n       Take away that loophole and Defenders' 19 percent fund-\n     raising and management tab leaps above 50 percent, meaning \n     more than half of every dollar donated to save wolf pups \n     helped nourish the organization instead. That was high enough \n     to earn Defenders a ``D'' rating from the American Institute \n     of Philanthropy, an independent, nonprofit watchdog that \n     scrutinizes nearly 400 charitable groups.\n       Pick up copies of IRS returns for major environmental \n     organizations and you'll see that what is happening at \n     Defenders of Wildlife is not unusual. Eighteen of America's \n     20 most prosperous environmental organizations, and many \n     smaller ones as well, raise money the same way: by soliciting \n     donations from millions of Americans.\n       But in turning to mass-market fund-raising techniques for \n     financial sustenance, environmental groups have crossed a \n     kind of conservation divide.\n       No allies of industry, they have become industries \n     themselves, dependent on a style of salesmanship that fills \n     mailboxes across America with a never-ending stream of \n     environmentally unfriendly junk mail, reduces the complex \n     world of nature to simplistic slogans, emotional appeals and \n     counterfeit crises, and employs arcane accounting rules to \n     camouflage fund raising as conservation.\n       Just as industries run afoul of regulations, so are \n     environmental groups stumbling over standards. Their problem \n     is not government standards, because fund raising by \n     nonprofits is largely protected by the free speech clause of \n     the First Amendment. Their challenge is meeting the generally \n     accepted voluntary standards of independent charity \n     watchdogs.\n       And there, many fall short.\n       Six national environmental groups spend so much on fund \n     raising and overhead they don't have enough left to meet the \n     minimum benchmark for environmental spending--60 percent of \n     annual expenses--recommended by charity watchdog \n     organizations. Eleven of the nation's 20 largest include \n     fund-raising bills in their tally of money spent protecting \n     the environment, but don't make that clear to members.\n       The flow of environmental fund-raising is remarkable. Last \n     year, more than 160 million pitches swirled through the U.S. \n     Postal Service, according to figures provided by major \n     organizations. That's enough envelopes, stationery, decals, \n     bumper stickers, calendars and personal address labels to \n     circle the Earth more than two times.\n       Often, just one or two people in 100 respond.\n       The proliferation of environmental appeals is beginning to \n     boomerang with the public, as well. ``The market is over-\n     saturated. There is mail fatigue,'' said Ellen McPeake, \n     director of finance and development at Greenpeace, known \n     worldwide for its defense of marine mammals. ``Some people \n     are so angry they send back the business reply envelope with \n     the direct mail piece in it.''\n       Even a single fund-raising drive generates massive waste. \n     In 1999, The Wilderness Society mailed 6.2 million membership \n     solicitations--an average of 16,986 pieces of mail a day. At \n     just under 0.9 ounce each, the weight for the year came to \n     about 348,000 pounds.\n       Most of the fund-raising letters and envelopes are made \n     from recycled paper. but once delivered, millions are simply \n     thrown away, environmental groups acknowledge. Even when the \n     solicitations make it to a recycling bin, there's a glitch: \n     Personal address labels, bumper stickers and window decals \n     that often accompany them cannot be recycled into paper--and \n     are carted off to landfills instead.\n       ``For an environmental organization, it's so wrong,'' said \n     McPeake, who is developing alternatives to junk mail at \n     Greenpeace. ``It's not exactly environmentally correct.''\n       The stuff is hard to ignore.\n       Environmental solicitations--swept along in colorful \n     envelopes emblazoned with bears, whales and other charismatic \n     creatures--jump out at you like salmon leaping from a stream.\n       Open that mail and more unsolicited surprises grab your \n     attention. The Center for Marine Conservation lures new \n     members with a dolphin coloring book and a flier for a \n     ``free'' dolphin umbrella. The National Wildlife Federation \n     takes a more seasonal approach: a ``Free Spring Card \n     Collection & Wildflower Seed Mix!'' delivered in February, \n     and 10 square feet of wrapping paper with ``matching gift \n     tags'' delivered just before Christmas.\n       The Sierra Club reaches out at holiday time, too, with a \n     bundle of Christmas cards that you can't actually mail to \n     friends and family, because inside they are marred by sales \n     graffiti: ``To order, simply call toll-free . . .'' Defenders \n     of Wildlife tugs at your heart with ``wolf adoption papers.'' \n     American Rivers dangles something shiny in front of your \n     checkbook: a ``free deluxe 35 mm camera'' for a modest $12 \n     tax-deductible donation.\n       The letters that come with the mailers are seldom dull. \n     Steeped in outrage, they tell of a planet in perpetual \n     environmental shock, a world victimized by profit-hungry \n     corporations. And they do so not with precise scientific \n     prose but with boastful and often inaccurate sentences that \n     scream and shout:\n       From New York-based Rainforest Alliance: ``By this time \n     tomorrow, nearly 100 species of wildlife will tumble into \n     extinction.''\n       Fact: No one knows how rapidly species are going extinct. \n     The Alliance's figure is an extreme estimate that counts \n     tropical beetles and other insects--including ones not yet \n     known to science--in its definition of wildlife.\n       From the Wilderness Society: ``We will fight to stop \n     reckless clear-cutting on national forests in California and \n     the Pacific Northwest that threatens to destroy the last \n     of America's unprotected ancient forests in as little as \n     20 years.''\n       Fact: National forest logging has dropped dramatically in \n     recent years. In California, clear-cutting on national \n     forests dipped to 1,395 acres in 1998, down 89 percent from \n     1990.\n       From Defenders of Wildlife: ``Won't you please adopt a \n     furry little pup like `Hope'? Hope is a cuddly brown wolf . . \n     . Hope was triumphantly born in Yellowstone.''\n       Facts: ``There was never any pup named Hope,'' says John \n     Varley, chief of research at Yellowstone National Park. ``We \n     don't name wolves. We number them.'' Since wolves were \n     reintroduced into Yellowstone in 1995, their numbers have \n     increased from 14 to about 160; the program has been so \n     successful that Yellowstone officials now favor removing the \n     animals from the federal endangered species list.\n       Longtime conservationist Peter Brussard has seen enough.\n       ``I've stopped contributing to virtually all major \n     environmental groups,'' said Brussard, former Society for \n     Conservation Biology president and a University of Nevada, \n     Reno, professor.\n       ``My frustration is the mailbox,'' he said. ``Virtually \n     every day you come home, there are six more things from \n     environmental groups saying that if you don't send them fifty \n     bucks, the gray whales will disappear or the wolf \n     reintroductions in Yellowstone will fail . . . You just get \n     supersaturated.\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\n       ``To me, as a professional biologist, it's not conspicuous \n     what most of these organizations are doing for conservation. \n     I know that some do good, but most leave you with the \n     impression that the only thing they are interested in is \n     raising money for the sake of raising money.''\n       Step off the elevator at Defenders of Wildlife's office in \n     Washington, D.C., and you enter a world of wolves: large \n     photographs of wolves on the walls, a wolf logo on glass \n     conference room doors, and inside the office of Charles \n     Orasin, senior vice president for operations, a wolf logo cup \n     and a toy wolf pup.\n       Ask Orasin about the secret of Defenders' success, and he \n     points to a message prominently displayed behind his desk: \n     ``It's the Wolf, Stupid.''\n       Since Defenders began using the North American timber wolf \n     as the focal point of its fund-raising efforts in the mid-\n     1990s, the organization has not stopped growing. Every year \n     has produced record revenue, more members--and more \n     emotional, heart-wrenching letters.\n       ``Dear Friend of Wildlife: It probably took them twelve \n     hours to die. No one found the wolves in the remote, rugged \n     lands of Idaho--until it was too late. For hours, they \n     writhed in agony. They suffered convulsions, seizures and \n     hallucinations. And then--they succumbed to cardiac and \n     respiratory failure.''\n       ``People feel very strongly about these animals,'' said \n     Orasin, architect of Defenders' growth. ``In fact, our \n     supporters view them as they would their children. A huge \n     percentage own pets, and they transfer that emotional concern \n     about their own animals to wild animals.\n       ``We're very pleased,'' he said. ``We think we have one of \n     the most successful programs going right now in the \n     country.''\n       Defenders, though, is only the most recent environmental \n     groups to find fund-raising fortune in the mail. Greenpeace \n     did it two decades ago with a harp seal campaign now regarded \n     as an environmental fundraising classic.\n       The solicitation featured a photo of a baby seal with a \n     white furry face and dark eyes accompanied by a slogan: \n     ``Kiss This Baby Good-bye.'' Inside, the fund-raising letter \n     included a photo of Norwegian sealers clubbing baby seals to \n     death.\n       People opened their hearts--and their checkbooks.\n       ``You have very little time to grab people's attention, \n     said Jeffrey Gillenkirk, a veteran free-lance direct mail \n     copywriter in San Francisco who has written for several \n     national environmental groups, including Greenpeace. ``It's \n     like television: You front-load things into your first three \n     paragraphs, the things that you're going to hook people with. \n     You can call it dramatic. You can call it hyperbolic. But it \n     works.''\n       The Sierra Club put another advertising gimmick to work in \n     the early 1980s. It found a high-profile enemy: U.S. \n     Secretary of the Interior James Watt, whose pro-development \n     agenda for public lands enraged many.\n       ``When you direct-mailed into that environment, it was like \n     highway robbery,'' said Bruce Hamilton, the club's \n     conservation director. ``You couldn't process the membership \n     fast enough. We basically added 100,000 members.''\n       But environmental fund raising has its downsides.\n       It tends to be addictive. The reason is simple: Many people \n     who join environmental groups through the mail lose interest \n     and don't renew--and must be replaced, year after year.\n       ``Constant membership recruitment is essential just to stay \n     even, never mind get bigger,'' wrote Christopher Bosso, a \n     political scientists at Northeastern University in Boston, in \n     his paper: ``The Color of Money: Environmental Groups and the \n     Pathologies of Fund Raising.''\n       ``Dropout rates are high because most members are but \n     passive check writers, with the low cost of participating and \n     translating into an equally low sense of commitment,'' Bosso \n     states. ``Holding on to such members almost requires that \n     groups maintain a constant sense of crisis. It does not take \n     a cynic to suggest . . . that direct mailers shop for the \n     next eco-crisis to keep the money coming in.''\n       That is precisely how Gillenkirk, the copywriter, said the \n     system works. As environmental direct mail took hold in the \n     1980s, ``We discovered you could create programs by creating \n     them in the mail,'' he said.\n       ``Somebody would put up $25,000 or $30,000, and you would \n     see whether sea otters would sell. You would see whether rain \n     forests would sell. You would try marshlands, wetlands, all \n     kinds of stuff. And if you got a response that would allow \n     you to continue--a 1 or 2 percent response--you could create \n     a new program.''\n       Today, the trial-and-error process continues.\n       The Sierra Club, which scrambles to replace about 150,000 \n     nonrenewing members a year out of 600,000, produces new fund-\n     raising packages more frequently than General Motors produces \n     new car models.\n       ``We are constantly turning around and trying new themes,'' \n     said Hamilton. ``We say, `OK, well, people like cuddly little \n     animals, they like sequoias.' We try different premiums, \n     where people can get the backpack versus the tote bag versus \n     the calendar. We tried to raise money around the California \n     desert--and found direct mail deserts don't work.''\n       And though many are critical of such a crisis-of-the-month \n     approach, Hamilton defended it--sort of.\n       ``I'm somewhat offended by it myself, both intellectually \n     and from an environmental standpoint,'' he said. ``And yet . \n     . . it is what works. It is what builds the Sierra Club. \n     Unfortunately the fate of the Earth depends on whether people \n     open that envelope and send in that check.''\n       The vast majority of people don't. Internal Sierra Club \n     documents show that as few as one out of every 100 membership \n     solicitations results in a new member. The average \n     contribution is $18.\n       ``The problem is there is a part of the giving public--\n     about a third we think--who as a matter of personal choice \n     gives to a new organization every year,'' said Sierra Club \n     Executive Director Carl Pope. ``We don't do this because we \n     want to. We do it because the public behaves this way.''\n       Fund-raising consultants ``have us all hooked, and none of \n     us can kick the habit,'' said Dave Foreman, a former Sierra \n     Club board member. ``Any group that gives up the direct mail \n     treadmill is going to lose. I'm concerned about how it's \n     done. It's a little shabby.''\n       Another problem is more basic: accuracy. Much of what \n     environmental groups say in fund-raising letters is \n     exaggerated. And sometimes it is wrong.\n       Consider a recent mailer from the Natural Resources Defense \n     Council, which calls itself ``America's hardest-hitting \n     environmental group.'' The letter, decrying a proposed solar \n     salt evaporation plant at a remote Baja California lagoon \n     where gray whales give birth, makes this statement:\n       ``Giant diesel engines will pump six thousand gallons of \n     water out of the lagoon EVERY SECOND, risking changes to the \n     precious salinity that is so vital to newborn whales.''\n       Clinton Winant, a professor at Scripps Institution of \n     Oceanography who helped prepare an environmental assessment \n     of the project, said the statement is false. ``There is not a \n     single iota of scientific evidence that suggest pumping would \n     have any effect on gray whales or their babies,'' he said.\n       The mailer also says:\n       ``A mile-long concrete pier will cut directly across the \n     path of migrating whales--potentially impeding their \n     progress.''\n       Scripps professor Paul Dayton, one of the nation's most \n     prominent marine ecologist, said that statement is wrong, \n     too.\n       ``I've dedicated my career to understanding nature, which \n     is becoming more threatened,'' he said. ``And I've been \n     confronted with the dreadful dishonesty of the Rush Limbaugh \n     crowd. It really hurts to have my side--the environmental \n     side--become just as dishonest.''\n       Former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo halted the project \n     last year. But as he did, he also criticized environmental \n     groups. ``With false arguments and distorted information, \n     they have damaged the legitimate cause of genuine \n     ecologists.'' Zedillo said at a Mexico City news conference.\n       A senior Defense Council attorney in Los Angeles, Joel \n     Reynolds, said his organization does not distort the truth.\n       ``We're effective because people believe in us,'' Reynolds \n     said. ``We're not about to sacrifice the credibility we've \n     gained through direct mail which is intentionally \n     inaccurate.''\n       Reynodls said NRDC's position on the slat plant was \n     influenced by a 1995 memo by Bruce Mate, a world-renowned \n     whale specialist. Mate said, though, that his memo was a \n     first draft, not grounded in scientific fact.\n       ``This is a bit of an embarrassment,'' he said. ``This was \n     really one of the first bits of information about the \n     project. It was not meant for public consumption. I was \n     just kind of throwing stuff out there. It's out-of-date, \n     terribly out-of-date.''\n       There is plenty of chest-thumping pride in direct mail, \n     too--some of it false pride. Consider this from a National \n     Wildlife Federation letter: ``We are constantly working in \n     every part of the country to save those species and special \n     places that are in all of our minds.''\n       Yet in many places, the federation is seldom, if every, \n     seen.\n       ``In 15-plus years in conservation, in Northern California, \n     Nevada, Idaho, Oregon and Washington, I have never met a \n     (federation) person,'' said David Nolte, who recently \n     resigned as a grass-roots organizer with the Theodore \n     Roosevelt Conservation Alliance--a coalition of hunters and \n     fishermen.\n       ``This is not about conservation,'' he said. ``It's \n     marketing.''\n       Overstating achievements is chronic, according to Alfred \n     Runte, an environmental historian and a board member of the \n     National Parks Conservation Association from 1993 to 1997.\n       ``Environmental groups all do this,'' he said. ``They take \n     credit for things that are generated by many, many people. \n     What is a community ccomplishment becomes an individual \n     accomplishment--for the purposes of raising money.''\n       As a board member, Runte finds something else distasteful \n     about fund raising: its cost.\n       ``Oftentimes, we said very cynically that for every dollar \n     you put into fund raising, you only got back a dollar,'' he \n     recalled. ``Unless you hit a big donor, the bureaucracy was \n     spending as much to generate money as it was getting back.\n       Some groups are far more efficient than others. The Nature \n     Conservancy, for example, spends just 10 percent of donor \n     contributions on fund raising, while the Sierra Club\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\n     spends 42 percent, according to the American Institute of \n     Philanthropy.\n       Pope, the Sierra Club director, said it's not a fair \n     comparison. The reason? Donations to the Conservancy and most \n     other environmental groups are tax deductible--an important \n     incentive for charitable giving. Contributions to the Sierra \n     Club are not, because it is a political organization, too.\n       ``We're not all charities in the same sense,'' Pope said. \n     ``Our average contribution is much, much smalller.''\n       Determining how much environmental groups spend on fund \n     raising is only slightly less complex than counting votes in \n     Florida. The difficultly is a bookkeeping quagmire called \n     ``joint cost accounting.''\n       At its simplest, joint cost accounting allows nonprofit \n     groups to splinter fund-raising expenditures into categories \n     that sound more pleasant to a donor's ear--public education \n     and environmental action--shaving millions off what they \n     report as fund raising.\n       Some groups use joint cost accounting. Others don't. Some \n     groups put it to work liberally, others cautiously. Those who \n     do apply it don't explain it. What one group labels \n     education, another calls fund raising.\n       ``You use the term joint allocation and most people's eyes \n     glaze over,'' said Greenpeace's McPeake. The most \n     sophisticated donor in the world ``would not be able to \n     penetrate this,'' she said.\n       Joint cost accounting need not be boring, however.\n       Look closely and you'll find sweepstakes solicitations, \n     personal return address labels, free tote bag offers and \n     other fund-raising novelties cross-dressing as conservation. \n     You also find that those who monitor such activity are uneasy \n     with it.\n       David Ormsteadt, an assistant attorney general in \n     Connecticut, states in Advancing Philanthropy, a journal of \n     the National Society of Fundraising Executives: ``Instead of \n     reporting fees and expenses as fund-raising costs, which \n     could . . . . discourage donations, charities may report \n     these costs as having provided a public benefit. The more \n     mailings made--and the more expense incurred--the more the \n     `benefit' to society.''\n       The Wilderness Society, for example, determined in 1999 \n     that 87 percent of the $1.5 million it spent mailing 6.2 \n     million membership solicitation letters wasn't fund raising \n     but ``public education.'' That shaved $1.3 million off its \n     fund-raising tab.\n       One of America's oldest and most venerable environmental \n     groups, the Wilderness Society didn't just grab its 87 \n     percent figure out of the air. It literally counted the \n     number of lines in its letter and determined that 87 of every \n     100 were educational.\n       When you read in the society's letter that ``Our staff is a \n     tireless watchdog,'' that is education. So is the obvious \n     fact that national forests ``contain some of the most \n     striking natural beauty on Earth.'' Even a legal boast--``If \n     necessary, we will sue to enforce the law''--is education.\n       ``We're just living within the rules. We're not trying to \n     pull one over on anybody,'' said Wilderness Society spokesman \n     Ben Beach.\n       Daniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of \n     Philanthropy, the charity watchdog, said it is acceptable to \n     call 30 percent or less of fund-raiding expenses \n     ``education.'' But he deemed that the percentages claimed by \n     the Wilderness Society, Defenders of Wildlife and others were \n     unacceptable.\n       ``These groups should not be allowed to get away with \n     this,'' Borochoff said. ``They are trying to make themselves \n     look as good as they can without out-and-out lying. . . . \n     This doesn't help donors. It helps the organization.''\n       At Defenders of Wildlife, Orasin flatly disagreed. The \n     American institute of Philanthropy ``is a peripheral group \n     and we don't agree with their standards,'' he said. ``We \n     don't think they understand how a nonprofit can operate, much \n     less grow.''\n       Even the more mainstream National Charities Information \n     Bureau, which recently merged with the Better Business \n     Bureau's Philanthropic Advisory Service, rates Defenders' \n     fund raising excessive.\n       ``We strongly disagree with (the National Charities \n     Information Bureau),'' said Orasin. ``They take a very \n     subjective view of what fund raising is. We are educating the \n     public. If you look at the letters that go out from us, they \n     are chock-full of factual information.''\n       But much of what Defenders labels education in its fund \n     raising is not all that educational. Here are a few \n     examples--provided to The Bee by Defenders from its recent \n     ``Tragedy in Yellowstone'' membership solicitation letter:\n       Unless you and I help today, all of the wolf families in \n     Yellowstone and central Idaho will likely be captured and \n     killed.\n       It's up to you and me to stand up to the wealthy American \n     Farm Bureau . . .\n       For the sake of the wolves . . . please take one minute \n     right now to sign and return the enclosed petition.\n       The American Farm Bureau's reckless statements are nothing \n     but pure bunk.\n       ``That is basically pure fund raising,'' said Richard \n     Larkin, a certified public accountant with the Lang Group in \n     Bethesda, Md., who helped draft the standards for joint cost \n     accounting. ``That group is playing a little loose with the \n     rules.''\n       Defenders also shifts the cost of printing and mailing \n     millions of personalized return address labels into a special \n     ``environmental activation'' budget category.\n       Larkin takes a dim view.\n       ``I've heard people try to make the case that by putting \n     out these labels you are somehow educating the public about \n     the importance of the environment,'' he said. ``I would \n     consider it virtually abusive.''\n       Not all environmental groups use joint cost accounting. At \n     the Nature Conservancy, every dollar spent on direct mail and \n     telemarketing is counted as fund raising.\n       The same is true at the Sierra Club. ``We want to be \n     transparent with our members,'' said Pope, the club's \n     director.\n       Groups that do use it, though, often do so differently.\n       The National Parks Conservation Association, for example, \n     counts this line as fund raising: ``We helped establish \n     Everglades National Park in the 1940s.'' Defenders counts \n     this one as education: ``Since 1947, Defenders of Wildlife \n     has worked to protect wolves, bears . . . and pristine \n     habitat.''\n       ``It's a very subjective world,'' said Monique Valentine, \n     vice president for finance and administration at the national \n     parks association. ``It would be much better if we would all \n     work off the same sheet of music.''\n       At the Washington, D.C.-based National Park Trust, which \n     focuses on expanding the park system, even a sweepstakes \n     solicitation passes for education, helping shrink fund-\n     raising costs to 21 percent of expenses, according to its \n     1999 annual report.\n       Actual fund-raising costs range as high as 74 percent, \n     according to the American Institute of Philanthropy, which \n     gave the Trust an ``F'' in its ``Charity Rating Guide & \n     Watchdog Report.'' Borochoff, the Institute's president, \n     called the Trust's reporting ``outrageous.''\n       ``Dear Friend,'' says one sweepstakes solicitation, ``The \n     $1,000,000 SUPER PRIZE winning number has already been pre-\n     selected by computer and will absolutely be awarded. It would \n     be a very, very BIG MISTAKE to forfeit ONE MILLION DOLLARS to \n     someone else.''\n       Paul Pritchard, the Trust's president, said the group's \n     financial reporting meets non-profit standards. He defended \n     sweepstakes fund raising.\n       ``I personally find it a way of expressing freedom of \n     speech,'' Pritchard said. ``I can ethically justify it. How \n     else are you going to get your message out?''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the article goes on to say:\n\n       No allies of industry, they have become industries \n     themselves, dependent upon a style of salesmanship that fills \n     mailboxes across America with a never-ending stream of \n     environmentally unfriendly junk mail, reduces the complex \n     world of nature to simplistic slogans, emotional appeals and \n     counterfeit crises, and employs arcane accounting rules to \n     camouflage fundraising as conservation.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Six national environmental groups spent so much on fund-\n     raising and overhead they don't have enough left to meet the \n     minimum benchmark for environmental spending--60 percent of \n     annual expenses--recommended by charity watchdog \n     organizations. Eleven of the nation's 20 largest include \n     fund-raising bills in their tally of money spent protecting \n     the environment, but don't make that clear to members.\n\n  The direct mail costs that we have seen can go up to 74 percent of \nthe total money received and is being reported to members as money \nspent to protect the environment. Are these the people the Senate ought \nto believe? They are the ones the people on the other side have been \nquoting all day. That is why we are raising it. They have been quoting \nthem as the sources for the information they present to the Senate--all \nthese things are going bad in Alaska, all these tragedies that have \nhappened to Alaska. What they do not mention is the human tragedy that \nhas happened to Alaska.\n  This article was printed on April 23, 2001. I hope Senators will read \nthis and all other Sacramento Bee articles in this series. In fact, I \nthink the Sacramento Bee ought to receive an award for them. They are \nenormous in terms of their reach.\n  The Sierra Club, for instance, one time said:\n\n       By this time tomorrow, nearly 100 species of wildlife will \n     tumble into extinction.\n\n  They sent that to retired people and to working people who believe in \nprotecting the environment. This says, as a matter of fact:\n\n       No one knows how rapidly species are going extinct. The \n     Alliance's figure is an extreme estimate that counts tropical \n     beetles and other insects--including ones not yet known to \n     science--in its definition of wildlife.\n\n  And the Defenders of Wildlife are raising money.\n  This article says:\n\n       We will fight to stop reckless clear-cutting of the \n     national forests in California and the Pacific Northwest that \n     threatens to destroy the last of America's unprotected \n     ancient forests in as little as 20 years.\n\n  As a matter of fact: Clear-cutting the forests has stopped. It is \ndown 89 percent from 1990, and yet they wrote that letter after the \ntimber cutting stopped.\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\n  Again, I urge Members of the Senate to read these articles written by \nthe Sacramento Bee. It is high time someone started looking into them, \nand we will do that later.\n  Mr. President, I have another series of articles from the Sacramento \nBee. This time it is called ``Litigation Central.''\n  It says the ``flood of costly lawsuits raises questions about \nmotive.'' I refer to this article of April 24, 2001.\n  It says, in part:\n\n       Suing the government has long been a favorite tactic of the \n     environmental movement--used to score key victories for clean \n     air, water and endangered species. But today, many court \n     cases are yielding an uncertain bounty for the land and \n     sowing doubt even among the faithful.\n\n  ``We've filed our share of lawsuits, and I'm proud of a lot of \nthem,'' said Dan Taylor, executive director of the California chapter \nof the National Audubon Society. ``But I do think litigation is \noverused. In many cases, it's hard to identify what the strategic goal \nis, unless it is to significantly reshape society.''\n  The suits are having a powerful impact on Federal agencies. They are \nforcing some government biologists to spend more time on legal chores \nthan on conservation work. As a result, species in need of critical \ncare are being ignored. And frustration and anger are on the rise.\n  It goes on:\n\n       During the 1990s, the government paid out $31.6 million in \n     attorney fees for 434 environmental cases brought against \n     Federal agencies. The average award per case was more than \n     $70,000 [for attorneys fees alone]. One long-running lawsuit \n     in Texas involving the endangered salamander netted lawyers \n     for the Sierra Club and other plaintiffs more than $3.5 \n     million in taxpayer funds.\n\n  It is a growth industry, suing the Federal Government for an \nenvironmental cause, mythical or otherwise.\n\n       Lawyers for the industry and natural resource users get \n     paid for winning environmental cases.\n  As a matter of fact, the environmental groups are not shy about \nasking for money. This is from this article:\n\n       They earn $150 to $350 an hour . . . In 1993, three judges \n     on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington were so \n     appalled by one Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund lawyer's \n     flagrant overbilling that they reduced her award to zero.\n\n  The lawyer had claimed too much money.\n  I see the Senator from Iowa is in the Chamber. Does he have a \ntimeframe problem?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to speak on ANWR for about 10 minutes if I \ncould, or a little bit less.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do not want to keep the Senator waiting. I have a lot \nmore than that to speak. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nyield to the Senator from Iowa for 10 minutes without losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \nkindness.\n  I have heard discussed in the Senate this area of Alaska being about \n19 million acres, and I have heard that there was only going to be \ndrilling in about 2,000 acres of that 19 million acres. Two thousand \nacres out of 19 million acres is not very many acres.\n  My State of Iowa is about 55,000 square miles, and that multiplies \nout to about 35 million acres. So 19 million acres would be a little \nbit more than half of my State of Iowa. I know how big the State of \nIowa is. I do not want to claim that I know how big the State of Alaska \nis, but I know how big the State of Iowa is because I travel every year \nto all 99 counties to hold at least one meeting in each county.\n  I know how much 2,000 acres happens to be because that would be about \n3 square miles in the neighborhood of my farm in Iowa. Take 3 square \nmiles out of my State of Iowa and it is practically nothing. So I do \nnot know what the big deal is about drilling on 2,000 acres in the \nState of Alaska or even in the State of Iowa. It would be equivalent to \nabout a pinprick on a map of the State of Iowa. That is the way I see \nit.\n  I say to the Senator from Alaska, to me, this ends up almost as a no-\nbrainer. From the facts we have heard, that this will supply enough oil \nfor my State of Iowa for 126 years--I have also heard it would be \nequivalent to the amount of oil we would bring in from Saudi Arabia for \n30 years. I think I have heard the figure of 55 years is the amount of \noil that would come from Saddam Hussein. I have also heard my \ncolleagues say we send $4.5 billion a year to Iraq for oil.\n  If all of this is correct--I do not believe that it has been refuted. \nI have not heard all the debate. But it really comes down to whether or \nnot we would like to get our energy from areas that we control in the \nUnited States, or we want to get oil from unstable governments around \nthe world, and whether or not we ought to save that $4 billion for \nAmerica, spend it in America, or spend it with Saddam Hussein.\n\n  I also believe when we do drill in Alaska--and the Senator from \nAlaska does not have to respond to this unless I am wrong, but I \nbelieve when we drill in Alaska, there are very rigorous environmental \nrules that have to be followed.\n  We hear about the pristine areas of Alaska, and I do not dispute \nthat, but do we not also have pristine areas in Siberia? I assume that \nwhether it is Alaska or whether it is Siberia, there is going to be \nmore oil added to the world pool of oil because it is going to be \nneeded.\n  So would people in the United States rather have us drill under the \nstrict environmental rules of the United States as they would apply in \nAlaska or would they rather have us let the Russians drill in Siberia \nwhere I know there was oil floating out of pipelines for long periods \nof time--and I do not know whether it has ever been cleaned up--and \nwhere there would be little concern about the environment in Siberia \nwhere Russia would be drilling?\n  I would think people in America would rather have us drill under the \nstrict guidelines of the environmental requirements of the United \nStates than they would in a country that does not have such guidelines, \nparticularly considering these are considered pristine environmental \nareas, whether it is in Alaska or whether it is anywhere in the Arctic \narea of the world. I think you would have to look at them the same way.\n  So I have come to the conclusion, I want to tell the Senator from \nAlaska, not just from listening to him but listening to other people \nand studying this, that I happen to think he is right on this issue. I \nthink we have an opportunity not only on this issue but on a lot of \nparts of this legislation to pave the way for a balanced, long-term \nnational energy strategy that will increase U.S. energy independence \nand limit the stranglehold foreign countries have on American \nconsumers. A comprehensive energy strategy must strike a balance among \ndevelopment of conventional energy sources and alternative, renewable \nenergy and conservation.\n  I think the President's approach of incentives for production, \nincentives for conservation, and incentives for alternative and \nrenewable fuels is a very balanced energy program. It is a program \nthat, No. 1, incentives for renewables take care of the short-term \nneeds of the country, and in the case of the second and third points, \nconservation and renewables take care of the long-term energy needs of \nour country.\n  During the past few weeks, I have had an opportunity to express my \nstrong support for renewable fuel provisions included in this bill \nwhich require a small percentage of our Nation's fuel supply to be \nprovided by renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.\n  As a domestic renewable source of energy, ethanol and biodiesel can \nincrease fuel supplies, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and \nincrease our national economic security. But they can't do it alone, \nand it can't be done overnight. That is why we need short-term \nsolutions and we need long-term solutions.\n  The Senate has had an opportunity to consider renewable portfolio \nstandards, which I believe will go a long way to promote renewable \nenergy resources for electrical generation. However, that is only part \nof a solution.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have had an \nopportunity to work with Chairman Baucus to develop an energy-related \ntax amendment that includes provisions for development of renewable \nsources of energy such as wind and biomass and\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\nincentives for energy-efficient appliances and homes. The tax package, \nhowever, unlike the underlying energy bill, recognizes that a balanced \nenergy plan can't overlook the production of traditional energy sources \nsuch as oil and gas.\n  Developing domestic oil resources is vital to our national security. \nThe United States is dependent upon foreign countries for over 58 \npercent of our oil needs. We are currently dependent upon Saddam \nHussein, which I already referred to but, more specifically, for about \n750,000 barrels of oil a day or 9 percent of our U.S. oil imports.\n  Last week, as we have been reminded during this debate, Iraq stopped \nits exports of 2.5 million barrels a day in response to developments in \nthe Middle East, further driving up crude oil prices. It is important \nthat Americans know that last year alone, we spent $4.5 billion of our \nmoney to pay for Saddam Hussein's oil, thereby providing funding to \nhelp Iraq with its war machine.\n  The United States has the resources on our land that could reduce or \neliminate the stranglehold Saddam Hussein has on our economy. By \ndeveloping our resources in Alaska, we could produce 10 billion barrels \nof oil and perhaps as much as 16 billion barrels of oil. This amount \ncould replace the oil I have referenced from Saudi Arabia or the oil \nfrom Iraq for a long period of time. So for the sake of our national \nsecurity, we ought to be developing our own natural resources at home.\n  Opponents have made claims that opening ANWR to oil development would \ndo tremendous environmental harm. But, again, I repeat for my \ncolleagues, 2,000 acres out of 19 million acres is a no-brainer. Only \nthe best environmental technology will be used for exploration and \ndevelopment, leaving the smallest possible footprint.\n  Opponents have also argued that oil development in ANWR will hurt \nwildlife. Remember the warnings from environmental groups about the \ndanger to the caribou if we developed Prudhoe Bay? They were wrong. \nSince the development, we have had increases in herd size. I ask my \ncolleagues, what is better for the environment: Developing resources in \nthe United States, using the toughest environmental standards ever \nimposed, or importing foreign oil produced without much consideration \nfor the environment?\n  We must do more to develop in an environmentally sensitive way the \nresources God has given us in stewardship. I hope my colleagues will \njoin with me to support this approach to opening Alaska and ensuring \nthat the bill before the Senate does more to protect our national \nsecurity and to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil.\n  I thank my colleague from Alaska. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, last night at the Library of Congress I \nran across this ad. I was going to talk about it later, but I wanted \nthe Senator to see this. This is an ad on one of the displays in the \nLibrary of Congress. Millions of acres in Iowa and Nebraska were put up \nfor sale by the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad Company.\n  I will develop later that the West was opened, really, because \nPresident Lincoln offered $1 million and every odd section of the \nright-of-way for the first railroad to link the east and west coasts of \nthe United States. We don't think in terms of that now. Once those \nrailroad companies got a hold of the land, they put it up for sale. \nThey put it up for sale at $2.50 an acre and let people have 10 years' \ncredit to pay for it. That is what stimulated the development of the \nWest. That is what stimulated the expansion of the United States.\n  What have they done in my State, one-fifth of the land mass in the \nUnited States? They have blocked us at every turn, withdrew lands with \neconomic potential, blocked us from using our own lands that had \neconomic potential, closed our mines, closed our pulp mills, closed our \ntimber mills, canceled the permits of the wildcat well drillers for oil \nand gas. We have lost the American dream of private ownership of lands \nin Alaska.\n  I thought the Senator might be interested in that. It is a very \ninteresting exhibit at the Library of Congress. It includes some of the \nartifacts of the history of our great country, including the great move \nto make land available to those people who developed the transportation \nsystem. Talk about blending. Here is the transportation system of the \nUnited States, the first railroad to go from east to west across the \nUnited States. Persons who built that obtained every odd section along \nthe right-of-way of the railroad, and from that came the expansion to \nthe west.\n  People complain about my suggestion that we join together oil \ndevelopment in the Arctic Plain and the future of the great steel \nindustry of the United States.\n  I am pleased to have received this letter addressed to me:\n\n       We write as members of the House with a strong interest in \n     the steel industry to convey our strong support of your \n     efforts to resolve the legacy cost burden of the domestic \n     steel industry, and especially your efforts to assist the \n     steel industry's retirees and their dependents.\n       As you know, the domestic steel industry has significant \n     unfunded pension liabilities as well as massive retiree \n     health care responsibilities that total $13 billion and cost \n     the steel industry almost $1 billion annually. These pension \n     and health care liabilities pose a significant barrier to \n     steel industry consolidation and rationalization that could \n     improve the financial condition of the industry and reduce \n     the adverse impact of unfairly traded foreign imports.\n       It has come to our attention that a unique opportunity has \n     arisen in the Senate to remove this barrier to \n     rationalization while assisting the retirees, surviving \n     spouses, and dependents of the domestic steel industry. It is \n     our understanding that you have offered an amendment to the \n     energy bill this week which will break the impasse on the \n     legacy problem.\n       Once again, we would like to extend our wholehearted \n     support to you in this endeavor. We look forward to working \n     with you to find a viable solution to bring a sense of \n     security to the over 600,000 retirees, surviving spouses, and \n     dependents before the end of the 107th Congress.\n\n  I ask that that letter be put on every desk. It is a bipartisan \nletter signed by an equal number of Democratic Members and House \nMembers in the House of Representatives.\n  I go back to the comments about the Sacramento Bee articles. On \nAugust 19, the article by Thomas Knudson, titled ``Old Allies Now Foes \nin Alaska's Oil Battle'':\n  Environmentalists come under fire for their impassioned efforts to \nbar drilling in a wildlife refuge.\n  It details the problems. For instance, Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, \nwho voted for oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \nis chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and sided with the Bush \nadministration. This article points out that in the House the pro-\ndrilling side won 223 to 206. The Senate is expected to take up the \nmatter this fall.\n  The [environmental] rhetoric has been an insult to us, Clyburn told \nan energy trade journal. A lot of us don't feel obliged to be purists \non this issue.\n  How many times can you cry wolf and have your audience still believe \nin you? said Mark Buckley, a commercial fisherman and member of the \nNational Audubon Society in Kodiak, Alaska, who opposes Audubon's anti-\ndrilling stance.\n  This article goes on to point out, in terms of environmental groups' \nadvocacy against this, advocacy mail-in campaigns on roadless areas, \nnational forests, and genetically modified crops. At least eight major \ngroups are circulating letters on the single topic of the Arctic Refuge \ndrilling.\n  It is a very meaningful article about the way these environmental \ngroups really single out those who support drilling in the Arctic \nPlain. It is, one of the balanced articles that deals with the question \nof this drilling.\n  As the Senator from Iowa said, 2,000 acres out of 1.5 million acres \nis not very much. It is 3 square miles.\n  Here is a nice one: Yours Free When You Contribute $10 Or More . . . \nour polar bear tote bag.\n  It's the perfect way to show you're working to Keep the Arctic Wild \nand Free.\n  If you complete the enclosed reply form and return it with your \nmembership gift of $10 or more, you get a little tote bag. It says: \nKeep The Arctic Wild & Free.\n  It is available only to NRDC members, but it is a concept of what we \nare looking at. For that membership, you can join the club. They do not \ntell you that 75 percent of their money is not spent for conservation.\n  The next article I want to talk about was published on November 11 of \nlast\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\nyear. It talks about the people who live on the slope, on the North \nSlope. It says:\n\n       Like detectives, the two Inupiat Eskimos gathered all the \n     information they could about the Alaska Wilderness League, a \n     relatively new arrival to the environmental community far \n     away in Washington, D.C.\n       From Bloomberg News, the St. Paul Pioneer Press and other \n     sources, Tara Sweeney and Fenton Rexford read about a group \n     that was passionate, self-assured and actively working to \n     halt oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge with \n     a blend of environmental activism--such as street theater and \n     letters to the editor--and lobbying politicians.\n       But when they examined the league's federal tax return, \n     they discovered a group that portrayed itself in a different \n     manner: as a tax-exempt charity focusing on science and \n     education.\n       ``The Alaska Wilderness league sponsored two educational \n     trips to the Arctic refuge . . .'' its tax form says. ``The \n     Alaska Wilderness League supported the `Last Great \n     Wilderness' slide show, seen by thousands of people to \n     educate them'' about the refuge.\n       Rexford, a leader of the Eskimo village of Kaktovik--the \n     only permanent human settlement on the refuge--was \n     astonished.\n       ``What they do and what they tell the IRS they do are two \n     different things,'' said Rexford, who favors oil drilling. \n     Last month, he made his views known to the IRS itself, filing \n     a complaint in which he and other village leaders allege the \n     League is violating tax law by ``devoting substantially all \n     of its resources'' to lobbying.\n       In filing the complaint, Rexford did more than challenge \n     the Alaska Wilderness League. He also struck at a vital \n     support system for environmental groups: their 501(c)(3) tax \n     status. [We are going to go after that too, Mr. President.] \n     That status saves nonprofits millions in corporate and other \n     taxes, makes them eligible for foundation funding and allows \n     contributors to deduct donations from their own income taxes.\n       Rexford and Sweeney said they got the idea from IRS audits \n     of the Heritage Foundation and other conservative nonprofits \n     during the Clinton administration. In June, they watched with \n     interest as the Frontiers of Freedom Institute, a pro-\n     business think tank, filed an IRS complaint against Rain \n     Forest Action Network, a tax-exempt group that scales \n     skyscrapers to protest logging.\n       The League's executive director responded angrily to the \n     Inupiat attack.\n       ``The Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation either has been \n     misinformed by its friends in the oil industry about the law \n     or it has deliberately distorted the facts in a cynical \n     attempt to intimidate America's conservation groups,'' \n     said director Cindy Shogan.\n       ``We have a right to represent the interest of our members \n     . . . so long as our legislative advocacy activities stay \n     within specified IRS limits,'' Shogan said. ``We fully comply \n     with all IRS laws.''\n       But Rexford--who hunts whales, seals and caribou for \n     subsistence--said it is Shogan who is misinformed. He said \n     the Inupiat corporation ``has not solicited information from \n     the oil industry, nor will we. It is apparent that the AWL \n     simply cannot fathom that a native-owned organization has \n     enough intelligence and talent to think independently and .. \n     file a complaint of this nature.''\n       Most environmental groups are 501(c)(3)'s, which means they \n     can receive tax-deductible contributions but can spend only a \n     small portion on lobbying. The spending limit varies. But in \n     many cases, it ranges from 12.5 percent to 20 percent--and \n     cannot exceed $1 million.\n       A handful of others, such as the Sierra Club and \n     Greenpeace, are 501(c)(4)'s, which means their contributions \n     are not tax-deductible but they can spend what they want on \n     lobbying. Based on its federal tax return for 2000, the \n     Alaska Wilderness League does not run afoul of spending \n     limits on lobbying. On that return, the League reported \n     spending $81,283 to influence legislation, well under its \n     legally allowable limit of $130,623.\n       The essence of the Inupiats' complaint is that the League \n     spends most of its money on lobbying but disguises it as \n     education and science. As evidence, they cite League letter-\n     writing and phone campaigns targeting federal lawmakers in \n     several states, testimony before Congress and League-\n     sponsored ``junkets'' for members of congress to the Arctic \n     refuge.\n\n  Another one of these articles on December 9 said:\n\n       Log onto the Web sites of the National Wildlife Federation, \n     the Wilderness Society and other environmental groups and you \n     learn that the struggle to save the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge in Alaska from oil drilling is about more than \n     protecting the environment.\n       ``It is also a human rights issue since the indigenous \n     Gwich'in Indians rely on this important area for their \n     subsistence way of life,'' say the Wilderness Society's Web \n     site: www.wilderness.org.\n       But this fall, Petroleum News Alaska--a trade journal--\n     reported a story that environmental groups have not \n     publicized: Over the border in Canada, the Gwich'in Tribal \n     council joined forces with an oil firm to tap into energy \n     resources on their lands.\n\n  This very same tribe that is paraded around as being the spokesman \nfor Alaska Native people, they drilled on their lands in Canada for oil \nand gas. They formed a partnership.\n  ``It's time for us to build an economic base,'' said Fred Carmichael, \npresident of the tribal council in Inuvik, Canada. That is the Gwich'in \ntribal council.\n  Two Senators said they talked to the Alaska Native people who opposed \nit and said they just assumed all Alaska Natives opposed it. It is not \ntrue at all.\n  The Eskimos have an opposite point of view, this article says.\n  They say drilling can be carried out in concert with the caribou. But \ntheir position is discounted by environmental groups because the \nInupiats have extensive ties with oil companies through their own \ntribal business: the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation.\n  ``The national debate has placed us as caricatures--us, as the tools \nof the oil industry, and them--the Gwich'in--as caretakers of the \nenvironment,'' said Richard Glenn, vice president, lands, for the \nArctic Slope Regional Corporation. ``It's unfortunate. And it's not \naccurate.''\n  I believe these articles ought to be written by those people who are \nvisited by the Gwich'in.\n  It says:\n  But in Alaska, most Alaska natives actually support drilling. In \n1955, the Alaska Federation of Natives, which represents 400 of the \nvillage corporations and is the state's largest native organization, \npassed a resolution in favor of tapping the refuge's energy resources.\n  It says simply:\n  ``Environmental groups are using the Gwich'in to advance their own \nagenda. That's as simple as I can put it,'' Tetpon said.\n  That is John Tetpon, the federation's director of communications.\n  I hope Senators will read some of these things that have been written \nabout these people who are bringing these stories about what is going \non in our State. It is a very difficult problem.\n  I particularly call the attention of the Senate to the article on \nApril 24 of last year because it points out that litigation central, \nthese lawsuits, are not only costing the defendants a lot of money, \nthey are costing the Federal Government a lot of money and they are \ntaking a lot of people who should be working on the environment into \ncourtroom after courtroom after courtroom to defend against these \nlawsuits that are brought. For what? In order to get the attorney's \nfees paid by the winning side in the environmental litigation. In some \ninstances, they do not have to win.\n  These environmental groups are currently raising $9.5 million a day, \n$3.5 billion a year, and you can see where it is going by our charts. \nIt is not going to improve the conservation, it is going to pay \nsalaries--it is going to pay very large salaries--and it is going to \nmake mailings to raise more money.\n  I commend the entire series of Sacramento Bee articles to Senators \nfor further reading from April 22, 2001 through April 5, 2001. Further \ninvestigative articles were printed on November 11, 2001, December 9 \nand December 18, 2001. They are excellent articles and they expose what \nis really happening in the environmental movement in America today.\n  I don't know how to say it other than to say I am appalled that so \nmany people in the Senate rely on them as presenting facts. They do not \npresent facts. They present positions and look for arguments to support \nthem.\n  I think it is time that we tried to get back to the concept of \nreliance upon the people from the State. I said that before. If the \nSenate would listen to the two Senators from Alaska concerning what is \ngoing on in Alaska, the country would be better off, and so would \nAlaska. We live there.\n  Most of the people who criticize us have never been there and won't \ngo there. Particularly, they won't go there in the wintertime.\n  I told the Senate yesterday that when I took my great friend, the \nlate Postmaster General, up there one time, we pulled up to the postal \nsubstation at Prudhoe Bay. The digital thermometer showed minus 99. \nThere was a wind chill factor. I didn't have the courage to tell him it \nwouldn't go below 100. That was as far down as it would go. It was \ndigital. The wind chill and the temperature had a factor greater than \nminus 100 degrees.\n  How many people want to go up there and go around up there? The old \npeople\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\nlive there. The Eskimos live there year-round in that climate. We have \nlearned how to exist and how to care for ourselves in our environment. \nI have not really been in that too long myself, frankly. I am not that \nacclimated to it.\n  I think the real problem is that no one here understands that we \ndon't drill in the Arctic in the summertime. It is not a summertime \noperation. You can't get vehicles across the tundra. We wouldn't want \nto do it. It would leave scars. We don't leave scars. They did in times \ngone by, but everybody learned from the mistakes of the past. We wait \nuntil it is frozen. We take water in, spray water, create an ice road, \ngravel the top of that, and put more water on top of that to make a \ncompact ice road. We use it until the springtime when it starts to \nbreak up, and they don't bring things across that road anymore. As a \nmatter of fact, most in the State don't use gravel. They only place \ngravel is used is where they have to have some traction going up the \nhills. There are not many hills, by the way.\n  I want to go back again to this problem of steel. I want to first \ntake the occasion to thank the great labor leaders of this country who \ntook time to join us yesterday in a press conference across from the \ndoors of the Senate.\n  We had Terry O'Sullivan of the Laborers; Mr. Sullivan of the Building \nTrades Department; Marty Malonie of the Pipefitters; Frank Handly of \nthe Operating Engineers; Joe Hunt of the Iron Workers; Terry Turner of \nthe Seafarers; Mike Sacco, President of the Seafarers; Mano Frey, \nPresident of the Alaska AFL-CIO; Jerry Hood, President of the Alaska \nTeamsters and special assistant to President James Hoffa of the \nNational Teamsters Union.\n  They came to speak to the members of their unions through the press \nto urge them to contact their Senators and ask them to support the \ndrilling in the Arctic Plain. They know it means jobs.\n  I just heard the Senator from Massachusetts say that at most it is \nonly 1 percent of the world's reserves--only 1 percent. These are the \nsame people who not 6 months ago were saying ANWR could only produce \noil that would sustain the United States for 6 months. The projection \nthey have on this is the projected estimated reserve. The projected \nreserve in Prudhoe Bay was 1 billion barrels. We have already produced \n13 billion barrels, and we believe there is another 15 years there--\nabout a third more. We will have produced 20 billion barrels when the \nestimate was reported that the world's reserves were 1 billion barrels. \nSo much for reserves.\n  The real issue is jobs. That is why these labor leaders were with \nus--jobs. They know we are talking about jobs. When we send our money \nto Saddam Hussein to buy oil from Iraq, we don't involve American jobs. \nWe have to find some way to sell something abroad to bring those \ndollars back or we have an imbalance of trade. We have had that for a \nlong time. It harms our economy and currency. But we are exporting jobs \nas we import oil.\n  That is why they were there. They were there in order to get us to \nunderstand that they want to help us deal with the creation of jobs \nthat would come from pursuing the oil and gas potential of that area.\n  They were great friends of Scoop Jackson. They understood, as he \nunderstood, the Arctic from the point of view of jobs. Jackson did not \noppose drilling in the Arctic. As a matter of fact, he and Senator \nTsongas made it possible for us to be here today arguing to proceed as \nwas intended in 1980.\n\n  We have added to this the idea of the pending second-degree \namendment--the amendment I offered which the Senator from Minnesota \nsaid is a sham amendment. Raising the visibility of the needs of the \nsteelworkers and the coal workers is not a sham amendment. You may not \nagree with it, but it is offensive to call it a sham amendment. It is \nonly sham because they won't support it. If they supported it, it would \nbe very valid, even from their point of view.\n  The question is, Can we find a way to reverse the trend that prevents \nthe building of the pipeline necessary to bring the already discovered \nand measured gas from Prudhoe Bay to the Midwest? We know it is there--\n50 to 70 trillion cubic feet. I don't have the exact figures because it \nwas reinjected into the ground. It was estimated to be 50 to 70 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas produced from the oil since 1968. The gas \nhas been reinjected into the ground. We need a 3,000-mile pipeline.\n  We are trying to find some way to ask people to address the question \nof how to maintain a steel industry that can support a pipeline of that \nsize--1,500 miles of gathering pipelines, thousands of valves, hundreds \nof trucks, hundreds of backhoes, and hundreds of pieces of road-\nbuilding equipment to build access to these areas. It is enormous. It \nis the largest gas delivering plan in the world. It is projected to be \nthe largest private enterprise project in the history of man--totally \nfinanced by private enterprise. But if private enterprise doesn't \nsurvive in the steel industry, we are not going to have that pipeline \nin the timeframe that we need it. If we started it in 2003, the first \ngas would be coming through in about 2010 or 2011. Knowing that the \nenvironmental opposition will sue, that will add 6 years to that. We \nare talking about between 2015 and 2020 making that gas available to \nthe U.S.\n  That is why I brought that poster here, to ask people to think ahead. \nLincoln, one of our greatest Presidents, thought about how to connect \nthe east coast and the west coast of the United States. He conceived \nthe idea himself to offer a bounty incentive to the railroad industry \nto build the railroad from the east coast to the west coast. He got \nCongress to approve it, and they paid for it. One million dollars was \nto be paid to the first railroad that completed a coast-to-coast \nrailroad. Every section along the right-of-way was loaned by the \nFederal Government.\n  The problem of the country today is the people living in these States \ndon't know the policies that led to their private enterprise as \ncompared to the policies that led to our serfdom under the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We thought when we became a State that we had a right--and we did \nhave a right--to 103.5 million acres to be selected from vacant, \nunappropriated and unreserved Federal land. To us, that meant as of the \nday we became a State in January of 1959.\n  To the people in the Congress, in 1980, it meant those lands that \nwere left after they had reserved 104 million acres for special \npurposes for these elite areas. You can't get to them. As I said \nbefore, only three of them can be reached by road. Most of them don't \nhave an airport. You fly in by float plane, or you hike in. They are \nrecreational areas for the elite few of the world.\n  But, in any event, they withdrew them, preventing the State from \ngetting lands it was going to select, preventing the Natives from \ngetting the lands they were going to select from the Alaska Native \nLands settlement.\n  People ask: Why were people disturbed? That 1980 act took away from \nthe 365-million-acre pool of lands that were available to be selected \nfor the State and Native settlements, and reserved them--directly \ncontrary to the historical policy of the United States to make Federal \nlands available for sustaining the private enterprise economy.\n  By what these people are doing now, we are going to be a dependent \ncolony of the United States. We are going to be dependent upon having \nsomeone, in a position such as mine, who can add to the budget the \nmoneys that are necessary for survival in Alaska.\n  The real problem about this is that, when you look at the basic law, \nit is July 1, 1862, that led to that. It led to that. Following that, \nin 1984, the Federal Government issued a table of grants to States. I \nwant to put this in the Record because it shows what every single State \nhas received. There is no question that, as the Nation moved West, the \npolicies of the United States were to enhance the development of the \nprivate sector, as I have said before.\n  We end up with a situation, where as of 1983, 3 years after that act \nwas passed, the Federal Government still owned 87.9 percent of Alaska. \nThe part that we own is subject to control through acts such as the \n1980 act. So it really does not matter. I think that the development of \nthese lands, and the use of Federal lands, is a question we ought to \nexplore sometime in the future.\n  But for now I would like to put in the Record the table that shows \nthe grants to the States, from 1803 to 1984, showing what happened in \nthe other 49\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\nStates--48 States. Hawaii had the same problem. Hawaii really was not \ntreated properly in terms of their lands. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the table be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n

 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are in a situation where one provision \nof our bill--it is in our amendment and in Senator Murkowski's \nunderlying amendment--grants the Kaktovik village the right to drill on \ntheir land. They have land that is owned by their Native village. It \nwas part of the 1971 settlement. Their people settled their claims \nagainst the United States by accepting conveyance of lands that were \ndue to them. Each village was given the township in which it was \nlocated and further lands depending on population.\n  But for this village only, in the State of Alaska, there is a Federal \nlaw in another provision of basic law that says they cannot drill on \ntheir land, I believe it says, until the 1002 area is authorized to be \ndrilled by the Federal Government. In the old days we would have said \nthat shows the forked tongue of the Federal Government.\n  It told them they had a settlement. It told them they got the right \nto their lands. It gave them fee title to the surface. It gave the \nsubsurface to their regional organization. But they cannot use it. Why? \nBecause of the policy with regard to the 1002 area. But even there, it \nwas, again, an imposition on the private structure of our State.\n  I think the great problem I have here is what is going to happen now \nto the steel industry. I have raised the issue, and, apparently, I may \nhave done more harm than good, according to some people, at least if \nyou listen to the Democratic Senators; that is what they are saying. I \ndon't know what good they are doing for them.\n  I challenge the Democratic Senators to come up with a proposal to \nfind a funding stream to save the rights of the steelworkers and the \ncoal workers and be within the budget and not subject to points of \norder and the possibility of being passed. With their help, this would \npass. With their opposition, it is not going to pass. I know that.\n  But what happens to the steelworkers? What happens to the future of \nour gas pipeline if there is no steel industry in the United States? \nYou can't even plan ahead. You can't order ahead. I said yesterday, you \nhave to order ahead a piece of that big 52-inch diameter, one-inch-\nthick pipe, and test it to see if this new concept of a chemically \ntreated pipe will withstand the pressures it has to withstand in order \nto have gas pumped 3,000 miles to the market.\n  That is not going to exist. The assets of the steel industry are \ngoing to be burdened by the claims of the working people who have \nretired and who will be put out of work between now and 2004. And it \nmakes no sense. It makes no sense that there are over 600,000 who are \nout of their health care. And the Democratic leadership is promising a \nvote on steel legacy costs with no source of money. Where is the money? \nWhere are the bucks? Where are the dollars? They have a solution, but \nno one has mentioned from where the money is going to come. Where can \nthey find a cash stream that will come in from a new source, replacing \nthe money we send out to Saddam Hussein? We would take that money and \nuse a portion of the moneys that come to the Federal Government from \nthat activity in the Alaska Coastal Plain and solve the problem of the \nsteel industry and the steelworkers and let them proceed to reorganize \nthe steel industry of the United States.\n  Two weeks ago, I am told, 82,000 retirees of LTV Steel lost their \nhealth care benefits. Another 100,000 are coming. Bethlehem Steel and \nU.S. Steel--\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\nchapter 11--could go in chapter 7 bankruptcy. No other steel company, \nother than Bethlehem Steel, could have rolled the steel to repair \nthe U.S.S. Cole after it was attacked by terrorists. It is in \nbankruptcy facing extinction. And I am criticized for trying to find \nsome way to solve the problem that might lead them further down that \nroad to extinction.\n\n  I am happy to tell the Senator from those States that I will vote for \nany plan they can come up with which is funded and within the budget \nand does not raise taxes that will solve the problems of their \nretirees. I challenge them to come up with that program. They have \ncriticized my suggestion, a legitimate, bona fide attempt to meld two \nbasic issues that should be before this Senate. We used to call that \nwin-win. It is lose-lose now. We lose; the steelworkers, the coal \nworkers lose, too.\n  They are not voting one way or the other in my State. I have coal \nworkers, but there is no steel in my State. I am not involved in that. \nIt is not a political issue, as far as I am concerned.\n  I have not told very many people, but I worked in a steel mill once. \nI spent 8, 9 hours a day lifting pieces of rolled steel off the belt. \nOthers were lifting the other side. I had one side I was lifting--8\\1/\n2\\ hours a day. That was just before I entered the military to become \nan Army Air Corps cadet. But I have had a lot of jobs. I have had union \ncards, and I am proud of it.\n  It offends me greatly that some of these people, some of these people \nwho never did a day's work in their life--they never dug a ditch; they \nnever lifted steel; they never lifted concrete bags; they really never \ndid any real manual work--don't know laborers. They appeal to them \npolitically, but they don't know them.\n  The laboring people want a check. They want a job. They do not want a \nbunch of BS from the people who represent them. They want their \nbenefits to be secured. They depend upon their Government to see it is \ndone.\n  I do not think they are offended at me for suggesting this. I have \nnot had one call from any steelworker or coal worker saying: Hey, guy, \nwhat are you doing messing up our future? No way. The people are \naccusing me of being crass. And opportunists are afraid of their own \nfuture, these Senators who won't face up to representing their people. \nI am tired of being accused of doing something wrong by trying to help \nthem.\n  This is the testimony of a Leo Gerard of the U.S. Steelworkers. He \nopposes this amendment because of his commitments in the past, but he \ngives the story of what happened to the health care and pension \nbenefits of the great steel industry. It is quite a story. He points \nout that there are subsidies in other countries for these. We subsidize \nagriculture. We subsidize so many things through entitlements.\n  We don't face up to the problem of what we do about retirees who lose \ntheir benefits because of the failure of the economic system. I don't \nthink it is wrong to think about how to use new revenues that come to \nthe Federal Government by virtue of legitimate Federal action and \nseeking development on Federal lands, how we can use those revenues to \nmeet this crisis as outlined by Mr. Gerard.\n  I will not include this testimony because he agrees with me. He \ndoesn't agree with me, but he does point out the plight of these people \nhe represents. Many of them are retirees who--how can I say this \ngracefully--are approaching my age. They are at the point where they \nare going to need help by the Federal Government one way or the other.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the testimony of Mr. \nGerard in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to you in closing--I won't be talking on this \namendment again, I don't think--the Senators who represent coal and \nsteelworkers have made their own choice. The environmental movement is \nmore important to them than the unemployed workers and retirees who \nlose their benefits in their States. That is the fact. They don't like \nit, but that is the fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Testimony of Leo W. Gerard, President United Steel Workers of America \n  Before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, \n                             March 14, 2002\n\n       Madam Chair and distinguished members of the Committee, \n     thank you for your invitation to appear before you today to \n     discuss the health care and pension crisis facing several \n     hundred thousand steelworkers across the nation.\n       By every measure, the American steel industry is in crisis. \n     As of today, 32 U.S. steel companies representing nearly 30 \n     percent of U.S. steelmaking capacity have filed for \n     bankruptcy. Twenty-one steelmaking plants are idled or \n     shutdown representing the loss of 25 million tons or 19 \n     percent of this nation's steelmaking capacity.\n       Some analysts mistakenly believe that minimills (which \n     produce steel by melting scrap in electric are furnaces) \n     haven't been hurt by unfair trade and record low prices, it \n     is noteworthy that fifteen of these 21 shutdowns are \n     minimills. In fact, shut down steel capacity is almost evenly \n     divided between integrated steelmakers and minimills.\n       Steel prices have fallen to the lowest levels in twenty \n     years. The December, 2001 composite average of steel prices \n     published by Purchasing Magazine had declined by $140 per ton \n     or 33 percent from the average between 1994 and 1997. The \n     industry posted a combined operating loss of $1.3 billion \n     during the first nine months of 2001.\n       How did this happen?\n       The USWA warned our policymakers as early as 1997 that the \n     Asian economic crisis and the collapse of the Russian economy \n     would, if not dealt with correctly, lead to a flood of \n     imported steel. The delay by our own government in responding \n     to the crisis made matters considerably worse. The events of \n     1997 and 1998 were only the latest in what the U.S. \n     Department of Commerce has identified as thirty years of \n     predatory unfair trading practices and government subsidies \n     by many of our trading partners.\n       Some today suggest that the American steel industry must be \n     restructured, as if this had not already happened before. \n     Between 1980 and 1987, the American steel industry underwent \n     a painful restructuring, eliminating 42 million tons of \n     steelmaking capacity. Over 270,000 jobs were eliminated. Many \n     workers were forced to take early retirement based on the \n     promise of a pension and continued health care benefits. The \n     tax base in steel communities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, \n     West Virginia, Minnesota, and elsewhere shrank as workers \n     went from earning paychecks to collecting unemployment \n     benefits. Some local communities have never recovered from \n     the last steel crisis.\n       Yes at the same time that our American steel industry has \n     been contracting and downsizing our foreign competitors have \n     been adding additional steelmaking capacity. OECD data \n     indicates that foreign steel producers had excess raw steel \n     production capacity amounting to over 270 million metric \n     tons. That is more than twice the total annual steel \n     consumption in the United States. Recent multilateral talks \n     in Paris on reducing global overcapacity have revealed that \n     despite the reductions in U.S. capacity, our trading partners \n     fully expect the U.S. steel industry to continue to downsize \n     even further. The Paris talks are instructive for they \n     illustrate yet again that multilateral negotiations are no \n     substitute for strong enforcement of our own trade laws, \n     including Section 201 and our anti-dumping laws.\n       The testimony which you have heard today from steelworkers \n     and retirees from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota \n     illustrates the depth of concern across the nation by our \n     active members and retirees. They have worked hard and given \n     the best years of their lives to this industry. Now, they are \n     simply asking that promises made become promises kept.\n       At the end of 1999, American steel's retiree health care \n     benefit obligation totaled an estimated $13 billion. Health \n     care benefits for 600,000 retired steelworkers, surviving \n     spouses, and dependents annually cost domestic steel \n     producers an estimated $965 million or $9 per ton of steel \n     shipped. Another 700,000 active steelworkers and their \n     dependents rely upon the domestic steel industry for health \n     care benefits. The average steel company has approximately 3 \n     retirees for every active employee--nearly triple the ratio \n     for most other major basic manufacturing companies. Several \n     steel companies have retiree health care costs that are \n     substantially higher than the industry average. Our active \n     members and retirees are concentrated most heavily in \n     Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Maryland, Illinois, West \n     Virginia, Minnesota, and Michigan, but they live all across \n     the nation.\n       In the U.S. up to now, we have made a public policy choice \n     in favor of employment-based health insurance coverage rather \n     than guaranteed national health insurance. This means that \n     when an employer goes bankrupt or liquidates its operations, \n     absent a social safety net, workers are at risk of losing \n     their health insurance and access to health care services. \n     Regrettably, thousands of steelworkers from Acme, Laclede, \n     Gulf States, CSC, Northwestern Steel and Wire, and \n     various other steel companies are now facing this terrible \n     prospect.\n       The USWA is very proud of its record in negotiating decent \n     health care coverage for both its active workers and its \n     retirees. In 1993, our union made history when we negotiated \n     pre-funding of retiree health care in\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\n     the iron ore industry. Benefits provided to steel industry \n     retirees are equivalent and, in some cases, more modest, than \n     benefits provided to retirees from other basic manufacturing \n     companies, such as Alcoa, Boeing, and General Motors.\n       These plans typically include cost containment provisions, \n     such as deductibles, co-payments, pre-certification \n     requirements, coordination with Medicare, and incentives to \n     utilize managed care. Most of our retirees pay monthly \n     premiums from 25 to 40 percent of their retiree health care \n     benefit, plus several hundred dollars a year in deductibles \n     and co-payments. Retiree premiums from major medical coverage \n     vary by employer due to differences in demographics, regional \n     health care costs, utilization, and design of the plan. The \n     USWA estimates that the average major medical premium during \n     2001 was approximately $200 per month for a non-Medicare \n     eligible couple and $150 a month for a Medicare-eligible \n     couple.\n       American steel's international competitors do not bear a \n     similar burden. In one form or another, foreign producers' \n     retiree health care costs are offset by government subsidies.\n       In Japan, the government provides government-backed \n     insurance programs. Government subsidies cover some \n     administrative costs and contributions to Japan's health care \n     programs for the elderly.\n       In the United Kingdom, the UK's National Health Service is \n     85 to 95 percent funded from general taxation with the \n     remainder coming from employer and employee contributions.\n       In Germany, health care is financed through a combination \n     of payroll taxes, local, state, and federal taxes, co-\n     payments, and out-of-pocket expenses, along with private \n     insurance. Insurance funds with heavy loads of retired \n     members received governmental subsidies.\n       In Russia, de facto government subsidies exist. While \n     Russian steel companies theoretically pay for workers' health \n     care, the national and local governments allow companies not \n     to pay their bills--including taxes and even wages. At the \n     end of 1998, Russian steel companies owed an estimated $836 \n     million in taxes. According to the Commerce Department \n     report, the Russian government's ``systematic failure to \n     force large enterprises to pay amounts to a massive \n     subsidy.''\n       The U.S. is the only country in the industrial world in \n     which the health care benefits of retirees are not assumed by \n     government to facilitate consolidation in one form or \n     another. It is now very clear that American steelworker \n     retirees stand to be hit twice by the collapse of the steel \n     industry since a majority of them were forced into retirement \n     (350,000)--many prematurely--during the massive restructuring \n     of the steel industry during the late 1970s and the 1980s. \n     First, they lost their jobs before they were ready to retire, \n     and now they may lose their health care and a significant \n     portion of their pension now that they are ready to retire. \n     Our own government's inadequate enforcement of our trade laws \n     is the principal reason that steelworkers and steelworker \n     retirees' health care benefits are now at risk.\n       Because our government has allowed this unlevel and unfair \n     trade environment to develop and consume our industry, \n     government now has a responsibility to our steelworkers and \n     retirees and to the steel industry to help craft a solution \n     to this problem.\n       Why is action needed?\n       Retirees under age 65 and older active employees who have \n     been displaced by plant shutdowns are not yet covered by \n     Medicare.\n       They cannot purchase COBRA continuation coverage because \n     companies are not obligated to provide COBRA coverage when \n     they no longer maintain a health care plan for employees \n     actively at work. Steel companies which have filed for \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcy (i.e., liquidation) have already moved \n     to terminate health care plans for their workers and \n     retirees.\n       They cannot afford COBRA premiums even when such coverage \n     is available.\n       They cannot afford commercially-available health insurance \n     coverage.\n       Many cannot meet insurability requirements (and may not \n     have continuous coverage under HIPAA).\n       Many have difficulty in finding new jobs that pay similar \n     wages or benefits.\n       Why is action needed for retirees age 65 and over?\n       Because Medicare has significant gaps in its coverage. \n     Medicare also has significant deductibles and co-payments. \n     There is no coverage for expensive outpatient prescription \n     drugs. Also, health care providers often do not accept \n     Medicare reimbursement rates as full payment, at which point \n     they go after the retiree for full payment.\n       Medicare Supplemental Insurance (``Medigap'') is available, \n     but it is costly and has limited prescription drug coverage. \n     The most comprehensive of the Medigap supplements (Plan J) \n     covers only 50 percent of prescription drug costs and limits \n     drug benefits to $3,000 per year.\n       The average retiree receives a monthly pension benefit of \n     less than $600 to $700 per month. Most surviving spouses \n     receive monthly benefits under $200 per month.\n       Finally, Medicare HMOs (or as they are sometimes referred \n     to ``Medicare+Choice'') are available only in limited areas \n     of the nation.\n       Some who have looked at this problem, particularly with \n     respect to access to prescription drugs, have said the Bush \n     Administration's proposed ``Medicare Prescription Drug Card'' \n     might be a possible solution. The proposed card would provide \n     discounts of 10 to 25 percent from retail drug prices.\n       But low income drug assistance is limited to people below \n     150 percent of the Federal poverty level. That's an \n     individual with an annual income of $12,000 or a couple with \n     a combined annual income of $15,000. In fact, more than half \n     of Medicare beneficiaries would not qualify for Low-Income \n     Drug Assistance. The Low-Income Drug Assistance proposal does \n     not describe how premiums would be set nor does it describe \n     the level of out-of-pocket expenses (i.e., deductibles or co-\n     payments) to be paid by Medicare recipients. Also, states \n     would be required to assume 10 percent of the cost of the \n     Low-Income Drug Assistance proposal at a time when nearly \n     every state is facing budget deficits because of the \n     recession and sharply-rising costs for their Medicaid \n     programs.\n       The Bush Administration is also considering tax credits as \n     a device for helping the uninsured. Under this proposal, a \n     refundable tax credit of $1,000 to $3,000 (depending on \n     family size) would be made available to individuals without \n     employer-provided health insurance. The problem here is that \n     the tax credits are too small to make health insurance. The \n     problem here is that the tax credits are too small to make \n     health insurance affordable. A ``Family USA'' study found \n     that a healthy 25-year-old woman pays an average of $4,734 \n     per year for coverage under a standard health plan, compared \n     to the $1,000 tax credit offered.\n       Until the steep increases in health care costs can be \n     contained, the real value of any refundable tax credit will \n     diminish year by year. A recent report from the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is an arm of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, says that health \n     care costs are expected to grow at a rate of 7.3 percent \n     annually between now and 2011. That means that by 2011, \n     Americans will be spending $9,216 per person on health care, \n     or about double what they spent in 2000. The nation's health \n     care bill could reach $2.8 trillion, or 17 percent of the \n     nation's gross domestic product, by 2011.\n       Clearly, this problem is not going to go away.\n       While the United Steelworkers was pleased that the \n     President took a step toward reigning in steel imports by \n     imposing variable tariffs on steel products in the recent \n     Section 201 case, the President pointedly chose not to \n     address the matter of the retirement and health security of \n     steelworkers and our retirees. He is apparently leaving this \n     unfinished business in Congress' hands.\n       Let me state this very clearly. It is the view of the \n     United Steelworkers of America that the pension and health \n     care commitments made to our active workers and retirees must \n     be honored. These issues are every bit as important to us as \n     the recent Section 201 determination on restraining foreign \n     steel imports.\n       Our active members as well as our retirees look to you for \n     action. We will work with you and your colleagues in both the \n     House and Senate continuously until this problem is solved \n     and we will not relent in our efforts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am not going to be debating the specific \namendment on the floor now but, rather, a context in which I believe \nthis amendment and most other aspects of this energy legislation should \nbe considered.\n  There are three principles I would like to discuss at this hour of \nthe evening. First is, when should we, the Congress of the United \nStates, adopt an energy policy? When can we legislate dispassionately, \nnot in response to an immediate emergency?\n  Second, an energy policy for when? It makes a considerable difference \nif we are developing a policy for the next 10 years as opposed to what \nI think should be the more appropriate timeframe, at least the next 50 \nyears, that we are legislating not for ourselves but for our \ngrandchildren.\n  And third, an energy policy should include a recognition of other \naffected issues--economic, environment, and more.\n  A persistent problem in crafting energy policy is the fact that our \nwillingness to act is greatest in the midst of a crisis, a disruption, \nor spikes in prices. History has repeatedly shown us that energy crises \nare the worst time to try to solve our problems. Short-term policy \ninitiatives that deal with things such as market upheavals are often \ncounterproductive. They respond to temporary circumstances. They might \nbe political; they might be economic. They could even be climactic.\n  California blackouts were the initial impetus for the energy \nlegislation we have today. Those blackouts are now hopefully a thing of \nthe past. Yet we now are casting this issue as how to respond to the \nthreat from Saddam Hussein, that he will cut off supplies from Iraq.\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\n  Even if there were silver bullets that the Congress could use to deal \nwith these short-term energy disruptions, Congress often moves too \nslowly to shoot those bullets in the right direction to hit the right \ntarget.\n  Long-term measures, such as promoting energy efficiency and launching \nnew forms of energy production, don't have time to affect the market if \nthese conditions are temporary.\n  It would seem to me that the solution to this problem is both logical \nand obvious. The solution, however, goes against our natural \ninclinations. The time to address energy issues is between crises, when \nthere is a better chance to do something that will actually work.\n  If I could refer on this special day, the 54th anniversary of the \nestablishment of the State of Israel, to an event which occurred in \nthat region of the world and is recorded in the Book of Genesis. It is \nJoseph's interpretation of the Pharaoh's dream about 7 good years \nfollowed by 7 lean years.\n  What Joseph's interpretation teaches us is that if we are going to \ndeal with famine, the time to do so is not when the famine has \ncommenced but, rather, the time to do so is during those years of \nplenty, to set aside for the lean years that will surely be ahead.\n  The core of a wise energy policy is to avoid a focus on the here and \nnow and look over the 50-year horizon. The focus should not be on us, \nthe current generation but, rather, should be on the well-being of our \ngrandchildren.\n  An astute public official once said:\n\n       If we ever go into another world war, it is quite possible \n     that we would not have access to the petroleum reserves held \n     in the Middle East. But in the meantime, the use of those \n     middle eastern reserves would prevent the depletion of our \n     own domestic petroleum reserves.\n\n  That wise public official was Navy Secretary James Forrestal. And the \ndate of his wise statement was 1946.\n  Forrestal's statement was remarkable in several respects. First, he \nwas looking beyond the next year to what would be happening over the \nnext half century, setting a good example for the kind of thinking to \nwhich we should repair as we ask the question: What kind of an energy \npolicy for America, for when?\n  Second, James Forrestal suggests that we can't change the inevitable. \nWe are not going to be able to produce our way out of the challenges \ncreated by our appetite for oil. If we were to take a 50-year view as \nMr. Forrestal suggested, what are the challenges we must overcome?\n  First, there is no likely scenario that will alter the reality that \nmost of the oil consumed in the United States from today into the \nfuture will come from foreign sources. Shares of imported oil have been \nrising steadily for years. Proposals such as those before us in the \npast few days might slow this trend, but they will not reverse it.\n  Second, we will likely see the need to dramatically reduce greenhouse \ngases that are the by-product of fossil energy use.\n  There is definitive evidence that greenhouse gases impact our climate \nand our environment. Because greenhouse gases accumulate in the \natmosphere and remain there for decades, or longer, we must commence \naction now in order to avoid unrestrainable consequences in the future.\n  We must prepare by taking steps to ensure that strong, early action \nwill avoid the need for drastic, expensive, and maybe unavailable steps \nwhen it is too late.\n  Third, we must develop and utilize alternative fuels, both as a means \nof reducing our total fossil fuel consumption and the greenhouse gases \nwhich are an outgrowth of the use of fossil fuel. Alternatives are an \nimportant component of a diverse national environmental portfolio. They \nrepresent a solution to our dependence on fossil fuels and \nenvironmental problems associated with fossil fuels. Alternatives are \ncritical in a policy that does not believe we should focus our energy \ngoals on draining America first.\n  I suggest that there are some opportunities in an enlightened energy \npolicy for our Nation. There are three points contained in the energy \nbill upon which I believe we can all agree. I will point to these as \nthe core of an intelligent energy policy.\n  Point No. 1: We know we need to increase storage in the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve in order to provide a greater cushion against \ndisruption in oil supplies. Since the price of oil fell in the mid-\n1980s, we have missed many opportunities to build petroleum reserves at \na time when we can do so relatively inexpensively. One reason may have \nbeen the false sense of security that the end of the Persian Gulf war \nbrought in the early 1990s.\n  During that period, we were able to replace the lost production from \nIraq and Kuwait with only a minor release from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. Why did this seem to happen so effortlessly? Primarily because \nwe were fortunate to have allies, such as the Saudis, increase their \nproduction. The Saudis have been good allies on numerous occasions, but \ndo we really want to have an energy policy for the next 50 years that \ndepends upon the good will of our allies and their own uninterrupted \nexcess capacity?\n  One of the positive aspects of the President's strategy for energy is \nhis announced support for filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to \nits current capacity. This act alone will not solve our problems, but \nit is a good first step and should be implemented. A larger reserve \nwill not eliminate our vulnerabilities, but it will reduce the economic \nimpacts of disruptions and threats from abroad.\n  Point No. 2: We must use the energy we have available as efficiently \nas possible. Energy efficiency cannot be accomplished in one giant \nstep. It takes time for manufacturers to modernize their means of \nproduction. It takes even longer for equipment stock to turn over so \nthat customers are buying the more efficient product.\n  What we need is steady progress. This is a marathon, not a 100-yard \nsprint. We cannot rely solely on research and development. Low average \nenergy prices in the United States limit the economic incentives to \nresearch and develop fuel-saving technologies. More broadly, the entire \nmarketplace does not fully reflect environmental and long-term \nstrategic concerns.\n  In order to mitigate these realities, we have used efficiency \nstandards for automobiles and appliances to achieve national goals. \nThese standards have allowed us to make significant strides in reducing \nenergy use. During the 1990s, while we made significant progress in \nsome areas, such as the efficiency of refrigerators, we have moved \nbackward in the area that is the largest consumer of fossil fuels, \nwhich is transportation. During this period, numerous technological \nadvances for automobiles were introduced and widely implemented, such \nas airbags, crumple zones, and all-wheel drive. But none of these \nadvances was aimed at increasing the efficiency, increasing the gas \nmileage of the vehicle.\n\n  Now we are on the verge of additional technologies coming to the \nmarket, such as the electric hybrid vehicle which is making its debut \nto very promising reviews. Let's assure the American people that some \nof these technological advances will go to reducing the amount of money \nwe spend on petroleum. In the appliances market, we can reduce the \nsummer peak loads of electricity by insisting on greater efficiency for \nair-conditioners. It will take years for new, more efficient models to \ncompletely absorb the market. The sooner we start, the sooner we will \nbegin to see the results.\n  Point No. 3: We must increase the share of alternative sources of \nenergy. If we try to do this all at once, the economic cost will be \nhigh. But if we opt for a steady progress toward greater use of \nalternative energy sources, we can expand our energy options and do so \nat a reasonable cost. We also must do this with flexibility. We are a \ndiverse nation of States. Each State, each locale, has conditions that \nmake it different from others. Those differences often impact on the \nways in which States can participate in national initiatives, including \nthe efforts to increase the use of alternative energy and thus reduce \nthe reliance on fossil fuel.\n  Point No. 4: We should strive for diversity in our energy sources. \nRenewables will contribute to that diversity. Another area that I \nbelieve has and, in the future, will contribute to that diversity is \ncommercial nuclear power. It wasn't long ago that commercial nuclear \npower was providing 25 percent of our Nation's electric generation. \nToday, it is down to 20 percent and\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\nsliding lower. At the same time, that proportion of energy that used to \nbe provided by nuclear is being provided by natural gas. While there \nare some compelling environmental reasons that natural gas is an \nattractive energy source for electric production, it contributes to the \ndepletion of an important American natural resource, to use an energy \nsource which is a direct provider of energy, to become an indirect \nprovider of energy by converting natural gas into electric generation. \nI applaud the provisions of this legislation that will, hopefully, \nbegin to re-energize a safe and secure contribution to the diversity of \nour electric generation capacity through nuclear.\n  In the coming years, we will see ups and downs in energy prices. We \nhave been on a roller coaster for the past several months, seeing some \nof the highest and some of the lowest gasoline prices in recent memory. \nWe will likely see times of turmoil. We are likely to see oil \nincreasingly being used as a weapon in geopolitical disputes. We are \nlikely to see times of calm. During those times, energy seems to be the \nleast of our worries.\n  But we have before us now an opportunity, an opportunity to create an \nenergy policy for the next generations of Americans, the next \ngenerations of citizens of this planet. We are given the opportunity to \ndevelop an energy policy that can help us leave a cleaner, safer, more \nprosperous world, and a world in which energy is used to serve human \npurposes, not as a source of intimidation.\n  Our grandchildren will thank us.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the weekend of April 19, \n2002, as we commemorate Cancer Awareness Month, hundreds of women from \naround the country will gather in my home town, Detroit, MI, to \ncelebrate breast cancer survivorship among African American women. This \nis a very special group of women, in that they are all survivors of the \nmost common type of cancer of women in the United States. I take great \npleasure in welcoming them to Detroit and want to bring to your \nattention, the many accomplishments of the sponsoring organizations and \nthe goals of this conference.\n  The 4th Annual National Breast Cancer Conference, which is sponsored \nby the Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit's nationally renowned cancer \ntreatment center and breast care center, and Sisters' Network, Inc. \npresents an aggressive agenda focusing on the survivorship of African \nAmerican Women who have, and who will encounter the challenge of breast \ncancer, a disease which has claimed far too many lives of the members \nof any community, but within the African American community, 28 percent \nmore than other ethnic groups. According to a recent report appearing \nin the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers said that \nstudies have shown that black women are more likely to be diagnosed \nwith late stage breast cancer and to have a shorter survival time than \nwhite women. We should all find these statistics unacceptable. During \nthis conference, with the guidance of medical professionals from around \nthe country, including Detroit's own Dr. Lisa Newman, Associate \nDirector of the Waltz Comprehensive Breast Center, there will be \ndiscussions on how to eradicate all of those barriers women of the \nAfrican American community face when assaulted by this dreaded disease.\n  I am proud to acknowledge the work and dedication of Cassandra Woods, \nmy Michigan Chief of Staff, who is the president of the Greater \nMetropolitan Detroit Chapter of Sisters' Network, Inc, and a breast \ncancer survivor and the national president and founder of the Network, \nMs. Karen Jackson. These women and the members of the 37 chapters from \naround the country are committed to increasing local and national \nattention to the devastation that breast cancer has in the African \nAmerican community. These women believe that through education, \nadvocacy, research, and support for each other, they can make a marked \ndifference in breast cancer outcomes and the rate of survival among \ntheir sisters.\n  I applaud this effort, I support this effort, and I ask my colleagues \nto join me in wishing the best of outcomes for this conference and with \nthe challenges ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2820-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2820-S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE UNITED STATES/RUSSIAN PLUTONIUM DISPOSITION AGREEMENT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to bring the \nSenate's attention to a matter of tremendous international importance \nto our efforts to prevent the terrorists' use of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I wish to talk about the United States/Russian plutonium disposition \nagreement, a commitment between our two countries to each permanently \ndispose of 34 metric tons of plutonium from nuclear weapons. Thirty-\nfour tons is enough material to make over 4,000 nuclear weapons.\n  I was pleased to help develop aspects of that agreement during \nseveral interactions with the Russian leadership of Minatom, both here \nand in Russia. I was in Moscow with our President in 1998 when the \nfirst agreement was initialed. I believe this agreement represents one \nthe most significant accomplishments between the United States and \nRussia in the last 10 years in our joint efforts to keep the material \nand technology of weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of those \nthat seek to do us harm.\n  The agreement basically commits the United States and Russia to \nturning 34 tons of plutonium into fuel that can be burned in commercial \nnuclear power plants. In this way, electricity is produced and the used \nfuel is left in a condition that makes it unusable in the future for \nnuclear bombs. Facilities will be built in both the United States and \nRussia to perform this work.\n  Our Government completed a 4-year process to decide what type of \nfacilities was needed for this disposition mission, and where those \nfacilities should be built. The United States considered four sites, \nWashington State, Idaho, Texas, and South Carolina, and after a \nvigorous competition in which the State of South Carolina lobbied very \nhard to get the mission, the decision was made to site the disposition \nfacilities in South Carolina.\n  Now, South Carolina is hesitating. The plutonium disposition \nagreement\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\nis being imperiled by the unwillingness of the State of South Carolina \nto reach an agreement with the Department of Energy on taking shipment \nof the plutonium identified for disposition and building the required \nfacilities.\n  It is appropriate for the Governor of South Carolina to insist on \nevery assurance that his State will be treated fairly, and will not \nsimply become the permanent storage site for unwanted nuclear material \nif for some reason the plutonium agreement should fall apart.\n  But the Governor has done that, he has succeeded, he has won. He \nshould be congratulated.\n  The Governor has gotten the Secretary of Energy to provide South \nCarolina all of the assurances they never got from the Clinton \nadministration, including full funding for the MOX program, a strict \nconstruction schedule, and a number of mechanisms, including statutory \nlanguage and other measures, to ensure that the agreement will be \nlegally enforceable.\n  However, the Governor is apparently insisting that this matter should \nbe thrown to the courts and resolved through the mechanism of a court \nordered consent decree. Putting the courts in charge of executive \nbranch non-proliferation and foreign policy affairs will slow our \nability to meet our goals of reducing Russian nuclear material \nstockpiles, and will allow others who are opposed to the program's \ngoals have a voice in their implementation. Ultimately, I fear \nAmerica's national security will be undermined.\n  Further delay in reaching agreement with South Carolina will \nundermine the United States/Russian plutonium disposition agreement. We \nmust move forward with the construction of the MOX plant that will be \nused to dispose of the plutonium at issue in order to honor our \ncommitments to the Russian Federation. That will be very difficult, if \nnot impossible, in the face of litigation from the Governor of the \nState where the plant will be located.\n  The Russians will not go along to reduce their plutonium inventory \nunless we do. A failure in this program means more material may end up \non the black market where terrorists could have access to it.\n  For 50 years now the State of South Carolina, like my home State of \nNew Mexico, has hosted some of the most important facilities within our \nnuclear weapons complex. For 50 years, tens of thousands of the sons \nand daughters of South Carolina proudly toiled in relative anonymity so \nthat the rest of the country, and the world, could enjoy the peace \nprovided by our nuclear shield during the long, dark days of the Cold \nWar. I am proud of the citizens of South Carolina and their unique \nservice for our county.\n  Today, the children and grandchildren of the previous generations of \nSouth Carolina heroes have a tremendous opportunity to almost \nliterally, as the prophet Isaiah said, ``beat their swords into \nplowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.'' They stand on the \ncusp of a grand new opportunity to lead the world community in \nconverting nuclear weapons to electric power while at the same time \nkeeping the material out of the hands of would be terrorists.\n  We must go forward with this important agreement. Thus, I will close \ntoday by urging both the Secretary of Energy and the Governor of South \nCarolina to work together to resolve their differences, move out \ntogether, and not threaten this effort by resorting to \nlitigation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2821-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL LIBRARY WEEK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as a strong supporter of Federal \nprograms to strengthen and protect libraries, I am pleased to recognize \nApril 14--20 as National Library Week. This is the 44th anniversary of \nthis national observance and its longevity is evidence of the great \nimportance our Nation places on libraries, books, reading and \neducation.\n  National Library Week grew out of 1950's research that showed a \ntroublesome trend--Americans were spending more money on radios and \ntelevision and less on buying books. The American Library Association \nand the American Book Publishers joined forces and introduced the first \nNational Library Week in 1958 in an effort to encourage people to read \nand to use their libraries.\n  When the free public library came into its own in this country in the \n19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because \nof its commitment to the principle of a free and open exchange of \nideas, much like the Constitution itself. Libraries continue to be an \nintegral part of all that our country embodies: freedom of information, \nan educated citizenry, and an open and enlightened society.\n  I firmly believe libraries play an indispensable role in our \ncommunities. They promote reading and quench a thirst for knowledge \namong adults, adolescents, and children. More importantly, they provide \nthe access and resources to allow citizens to obtain timely and \nreliable information that is so necessary in our fast-paced society. In \nthis age of rapid technological advancement, libraries are called upon \nto provide not only books and periodicals, but many other valuable \nresources as well audio-visual materials, computer services, Internet \naccess terminals, facilities for community lectures and performances, \ntapes, records, videocassettes, and works of art for exhibit and loan \nto the public.\n  Libraries provide a gateway to a new and exciting world for all the \nplace where a spark is often struck for disadvantaged citizens who for \nwhatever reason have not had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge \nand emerging technology available to others. In this information age, \nthey play a critical role in bridging the digital divide. Many families \ncannot afford personal computers at home, yet the role of computers has \nbecome almost necessary to a basic educational experience. The children \nof these families would suffer without the access to emerging \ntechnology that libraries provide to all patrons regardless of income. \nIn addition, special facilities libraries provide services for older \nAmericans, people with disabilities, and hospitalized citizens.\n  During National Library Week, I wish to salute those individuals who \nare members of the library community and work so hard to ensure that \nour citizens and communities continue to enjoy the tremendous rewards \navailable through our libraries. Library staff, volunteers and patrons \nwork to ensure existing libraries run smoothly and have adequate \nresources, as well as advocate for increased funding and new libraries.\n  I am proud that Maryland is a State of readers. Recent statistics \nshow that Maryland citizens borrowed more public library materials per \nperson than those of almost any other State, nearly 9 per person. In \naddition, 67 percent of the State's population are registered library \npatrons. We are lucky to have 24 public library systems, providing a \nfull range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long \ntradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. The State \nLibrary Network that provides interlibrary loans to the State's public, \nacademic, special libraries and school library media centers has \nenhanced this policy. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding \nservice by showing their continued enthusiasm and support for our \npublic libraries. I have worked closely with members of the Maryland \nLibrary Association, colleges and universities and others involved in \nthe library community throughout the State, and I am very pleased to \njoin with them and citizens throughout the Nation in this week's \ncelebration of ``National Library Week.'' I look forward to continuing \nthis relationship with those who enable libraries to provide the unique \nand vital services available to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2821-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2821-S2822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PASSAGE OF THE HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET AMENDMENTS OF 2001 (S. 1533)\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, almost 39 million Americans wake \nup each morning, hoping that they or their families do not face illness \nor a serious accident--because they have no health insurance. Many more \nare underinsured and do not have access to a good health provider. They \nawake hoping that they and their loved ones will not get sick. For \nmany, falling ill can mean financial ruin, or even death, because they \ncannot afford the critical health services they need.\n  During this time when our country struggles through the worst \neconomic downturn in a decade, we must find innovative ways to provide \naccess to\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\nhealth care for our most vulnerable citizens. States are facing more \nthan $40 billion in deficits, unemployment is up, and the number of \nuninsured are rising.\n  Today, we offer Americans hope. I am proud that the U.S. Senate has \njoined together in passing the Health Care Safety Amendments of 2001. \nThis bill reauthorizes two critical programs that serve our poorest \npopulations--the health centers program and the National Health Service \nCorps. It also creates the Healthy Communities Access Program, HCAP. By \nbringing together public and private providers, HCAP will help improve \nthe coordination of services for communities' most vulnerable \npopulations.\n  At a time when our health care system too often treats people as \nstatistics, this Nation's community health centers and our health \nprofessionals working through the National Health Service Corps treat \nthem as patients who deserve the best available health care. They know \ntheir communities, they understand their concerns, they know their \nnames, and they speak their languages.\n  For more than 30 years, these programs have provided health care to \nAmericans who have no where else to go for services. In fact, it is \ndifficult to imagine what health care in the United States would be \nlike today without them. Without their extraordinary achievements, \nmillions of the most vulnerable Americans would not receive the health \ncare they need to live healthy and productive lives. Without the health \ncenters and the National Health Service Corps, there would be higher \nrates of tuberculosis, infant mortality, AIDS, substance abuse, and \nmany other debilitating conditions in our low-income neighborhoods. \nWithout these two programs, the Nation's emergency rooms would be \nflooded with even more patients seeking primary care.\n  Despite their extraordinary accomplishments, far too often these \nhealth centers and providers struggle each day just to keep their doors \nopen. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  Over the years, our community health centers have more than proven \ntheir worth. And as a result, last year, health centers received more \nsupport than ever before. We set a goal of doubling the Federal \nfinancial commitment to community health centers over the next 5 years. \nWe need to continue expanding these programs and get more health \nprofessionals on the ground in health centers in America's small \nfarming communities, urban centers, and sprawling suburbs.\n  And we must continue our commitment to the Healthy Communities Access \nProgram. HCAP plays a very important role in our health care safety \nnet. From the physician in private practice to the community health \ncenters to the hospitals, all will work hand-in-hand to coordinate \ntheir efforts to reach the vast number of Americans who fall between \nthe cracks in today's health care system. We must ensure that we \ncontinue to fund this program to help safety net providers develop \ninnovative ways to coordinate the care for the uninsured and \nunderinsured. We should not put this important safety net program at \nrisk of receiving lower levels of funding.\n  I commend President Bush for making the health centers program and \nthe National Health Service Corps a priority in his 2003 budget, and I \nhope the administration will support the bipartisan HCAP program. I \nalso commend Senator Frist, Senator Jeffords, and the members of our \ncommittee for their hard work on this bill.\n  For more than 30 years, I have been inspired by those who invest \ntheir lives in caring for Americans who have no place to turn for \nhealth care. I thank my colleagues today for passing the Safety Net \nbill which will aid our health centers and doctors in delivering \ncritical health care services in our poorest communities. In doing so, \nwe not only offer the tools for ensuring healthier lives, but we \nprovide hope for millions of struggling families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2822-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COLONEL TIMOTHY A.

Peterson, Chief, Senate Liaison Division, Office \nof the Chief of Legislative Affairs, and Department of the Army who \nwill retire on June 1, 2002. Colonel Peterson's career spans over 28 \nyears, during which he has distinguished himself as a soldier, scholar, \nleader and friend of the United States Senate.\n  A New York native, Colonel Peterson graduated from the United States \nMilitary Academy in 1974 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the \nField Artillery Branch of the U.S. Army. During his career he has \ncommanded soldiers from the battery through the installation level. At \nSchofield Barracks in Hawaii, he commanded the 7th Battalion, 8th Field \nArtillery Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division and later served as \nthe Installation Commander of the U.S. Army Garrison at Fort Dix, NJ. \nAs a scholar Tim Peterson has sought opportunities to improve himself \nthroughout his career. In addition to teaching mathematics to cadets at \nthe United States Military Academy, he has served as an American \nPolitical Science Association Congressional Fellow and a Army Senior \nFellow, Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship, as well as receiving \nadvanced degrees from the University of Puget Sound, University of \nWashington, the Salve Regina College and the U.S. Naval War College.\n  Since September 1999, Tim Peterson has served with distinction as the \nChief Army Senate Liaison. He has superbly represented the Chief of \nLegislative Liaison, the Army Chief of Staff, and the Secretary of the \nArmy while promoting the interests of the soldiers and civilians of our \nArmy. His professionalism, mature judgement, sage advice and \ninterpersonal skills have earned him the respect and confidence of the \nMembers of Congress and Congressional staffers with whom he has worked \non a multitude of issues affecting our Army, its soldiers and \ncivilians. In almost 3 years on the Hill, Tim Peterson has been a true \nfriend of the United States Senate and the Congress. Serving as the \nArmy's primary point of contact for all Senators, Congressional \nCommittees and their staffs, he has assisted Congress in understanding \nArmy policies, operations, requirements and priorities. As a result, he \nand his staff have been extremely effective in providing prompt, \ncoordinated and factual replies to all inquiries and matters involving \nArmy issues. In addition, he has personally provided invaluable \nassistance to Members and their staffs while planning, coordinating and \naccompanying Senate delegations traveling worldwide. His substantive \nknowledge of the key issues, keen legislative insight and ability to \neffectively advise senior Army leaders have directly contributed to the \nsuccessful representation of the Army's interests before Congress.\n  Throughout his career, Colonel Tim Peterson has demonstrated his \nprofound commitment to our Nation, a deep concern for soldiers and \ntheir families and a commitment to excellence. Colonel Peterson is a \nconsummate professional whose performance in over 28 years of service \nhas personified those traits of courage, competency and integrity that \nour Nation has come to expect from its professional Army officers.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Colonel Peterson for his \nhonorable service to our Army, its soldiers and the citizens of the \nUnited States. We wish him and his family well and all the best in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2822-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2822-S2823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO INTEGRITY LODGE #51\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

This celebration will \ntruly highlight the contributions as well as the many accomplishments \nthat this fine organization has made to its community.\n  Under the direction of Prince Hall Masons, the Integrity Lodge has \nenjoyed countless success stories. The Integrity Lodge has been \nrecognized for guiding and providing leadership to African Americans. \nAdditionally, the Integrity Lodge has made countless charitable \ncontributions which in turn have positively affected many lives.\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\n  Through the efforts of this group of people, the community of \nPaterson has been enriched.

Mr. President, I rise today to give \ntribute to some Oregon heroes. Over the past year, I have come to the \nSenate floor on several occasions to describe the tragic events in the \nKlamath Basin last year. Today, I wish to salute some of the heroes, \nwho when watching their neighbors in need, responded with great \ncompassion and service to their community.\n  In April of last year, the farm economy of Klamath Falls was sent \ninto a tailspin when the decision was made to forego water deliveries \nto farmers in favor of protecting threatened and endangered fishes. \nAlmost overnight, the devastating effects of the water shut-off began \nto be felt. In one month's time, the number of families seeking \nassistance from the local food bank jumped by seven hundred.\n  The response from the surrounding community was incredible. Farmers, \ncar dealerships, coffee shops, gas stations, banks, schools, and \ncountless others came together to lend their support to folks in the \nKlamath Basin. On June 15 of last year, Joe Gilliam, President of the \nOregon Grocers Association, with the help of grocers from around the \nState, gathered 240,000 pounds of food. This food helped feed the \ncommunity for nearly two months.\n  In August, Oregon Senator and farmer Gary George of Pendleton, Oregon \ndecided that he too had to do something. He set out and, with the help \nof Oregonians In Action, raised $30,000. Also in August, K-Dove Radio, \nPerry Atkinson and his son Oregon Senator Jason Atkinson, and sixty \nchurches in the Medford area, joined together in collecting 27,000 \npounds of food. They delivered it in two twenty-four-foot Ryder trucks.\n  The examples of kindness go on and on. For as tragic as the situation \nlast year in the Basin was, Oregonians from around the State responded \nwith an equal level of benevolence. With the help of hundreds of \ncommunity volunteers and under the direction of Niki Sampson, the \nKlamath Falls-Lake County Food Bank has distributed 830,000 pounds of \nfood and non-food products.\n  This has been a very emotional year, and as a U.S. Senator and as an \nOregonian, I am very proud of how the people in my State have \nresponded. The generosity shown by so many truly reaffirms one's faith \nin the goodness of people. In my mind, every single person who \nvolunteered his or her time or resources is a hero. Today, I salute the \nworkers, the volunteers, and all those who gave of themselves to help \nthis community in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2823-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               VENEZUELA\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise regarding recent events in \nVenezuela and my concern that the response of the administration was \ninconsistent with our foreign policy goal of promoting democracy \nabroad.\n  On April 12, following anti-government protests by civil opposition \nsectors, supported by parts of the military, President Hugo Chavez was \nbriefly forced to resign power. The civil-military movement named \nbusinessman Pedro Carmona as interim president, and he then took steps \nwhich further undermined constitutional order, dissolving the \nlegislature and the Supreme Court. Instead of protesting these clear \nviolations of democratic order, the U.S. found itself virtually alone \nin the region in seemingly welcoming the undemocratic change in \ngovernment in Venezuela.\n  Latin American presidents, meeting in Costa Rica, quickly condemned \nthe coup as contrary to democratic obligations of members of the \nOrganization of American States. Their action had nothing to do with \nsupport for President Chavez, whose radical declarations and friendly \nlinks to Cuba and Iraq had caused discomfort in the region and in \nWashington.\n  However, the American government did not acknowledge that a coup had \noccurred and referred to the action as ``a change in the government.'' \nAfter 2 days, the lack of full support inside the Venezuelan military, \nthe extreme nature of the actions of the interim president in voiding \nVenezuela's democratic institutions, and the clear opposition of \nhemispheric leaders resulted in Chavez being reinstated to the \npresidency.\n  The Inter-American Democratic Charter, which the United States and \nthe other members of the Organization of American States agreed to last \nyear, commits all member governments to condemn and investigate the \noverthrow of any democratically elected OAS member government. These \nevents tested the resolve of Western Hemisphere leaders in their \nsupport of democracy, and Latin American leaders responded decisively. \nUnfortunately, the American government failed the test.\n  Our government must support changes of government through a \nconstitutional process, not military means. America's failure to \ncondemn the illegal overthrow of a democratically elected leader in \nVenezuela has seriously undermined our credibility in the Western \nHemisphere.\n  The United States must be a leader in promoting the strengthening of \ndemocracy in our hemisphere. We can do this by abiding by the OAS \ncharter and by working within the OAS to maintain close scrutiny of \ndemocracies at risk.\n  The Secretary-General of the OAS, Dr. Cesar Gaviria, arrived in \nVenezuela this week to evaluate the latest developments and explore how \nthe OAS can support Venezuela in its efforts to strengthen democracy. \nAs a member of the OAS, our government should strongly and \nunequivocally support Secretary-General Gaviria's mission. We must also \nsupport the right of the voters of Venezuela to decide their political \nfuture. At the same time, President Chavez should fully respect \nindividual freedoms, including freedom of the press, due process, and \nthe rule of law. The OAS should continue to monitor the situation in \nVenezuela closely, and the U.S. Government should renew its commitment \nto democracy and democratic standards in the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2823-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO TASK FORCE 2-153, ARKANSAS NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor and \nprivilege to recognize the ``Arkansas Gunslingers.'' Task Force 2-153, \ncommanded by Lieutenant Colonel Steve Womack, made military history on \nJanuary 13, 2002 by becoming the first pure Army National Guard unit to \nrepresent the United States in performing the Multinational Force and \nObserver, MFO, mission on the Sinai peninsula in Egypt which was born \nout of the 1979 Camp David Peace Accords.\n  Soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry headquartered in \nSearcy, AR, along with other elements of the 39th Infantry Brigade were \nmobilized October 8, 2001 as part of President Bush's Homeland Defense \ninitiative and the War on Terrorism. Under the strong leadership of \nLieutenant Colonel Womack, Major Franklin Powell and Command Sergeant \nMajor John Hogue, Task Force 2-153 exceeded all post-mobilization, pre-\ndeployment, and post-deployment requirements. This accomplishment is \nparticularly noteworthy given that these citizen-soldiers were given \nthis critical and highly visible assignment just 90 days prior to \ndeployment, at most, half the time to prepare routinely given to \nRegular Army units. When called upon by their commander in chief, this \nproud group of Arkansans literally lived up to their motto: ``Let's \nGo''!\n  It is with great pride that I have risen today to pay tribute to the \nmore than 500 soldiers who make up the Arkansas Gunslingers. They have \nselflessly put their private lives on hold to answer the call of duty. \nTheir presence on the Sinai Peninsula is a powerful symbol of peace. \nThe people of Arkansas are grateful for their service, and extremely \nproud that they have been chosen to represent the United States of \nAmerica in this important mission.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2824-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n       COMMEMORATING THE 54th ANNIVERSARY OF ISRAEL'S STATEH0OOD\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on this date 54 years ago, the \nState of Israel was founded. Today, all over the world, friends of \nIsrael are observing this anniversary of Israel's independence.\n  The United States, under President Harry S. Truman, was the first \ncountry to formally recognize the State of Israel in 1948. We have a \nlegacy of a special relationship based on shared values, among them \nsupport for democracy and human rights.\n  Preservation of the integrity, vitality and sovereignty of Israel is \nthe cornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East, as well as a \nfundamental prerequisite for winning the global War on Terrorism.\n  On this day, when Israel and its allies should be celebrating, \ninstead we see daily acts of violence and acts of terrorism that have \nled to the loss of innocent lives. The ability of the people of Israel \nand of the region to lead normal lives has been shattered.\n  The United States is committed to leading the international community \nin ending the conflict and beginning the slow walk back to negotiations \nfor peace.\n  I urge President Bush and his Administration to recognize the \nimportance of ongoing U.S. engagement in the Middle East at this \ncrucial time. As the world's sole remaining superpower and the leader \nof the efforts to eradicate terrorism from the Earth, our commitment to \nallies such as Israel cannot and must not falter.\n  Once a framework for peace is in place, and we pray that day will \nsoon come, there should be no question that the United States \nrecognizes we will be called upon to play an ongoing role in the \nregion, and we are prepared to accept that role.\n  Again, we offer our congratulations to the State of Israel on its \n54th anniversary. And we assure our Israeli brothers and sisters that \nwe share with them their quest for peace and the dream of turning \nswords into plowshares so that they can raise their children and \ngrandchildren in a region of harmony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2824-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING INSIGHT COMMUNICATIONS IN LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a proper \nsalute to Insight Communications of Louisville, KY. The Cable \nTelevision Public Affairs Association recently presented Insight with \nthe coveted Beacon Award in the category of education for introducing \ntheir ``Young Women's Technology Fellowship'' initiative to the \nLouisville Community.\n  The Fellowship initiative, which arose from a partnership established \nbetween Oxygen Media and Insight Communications, was a two-month after-\nschool program designed to provide advanced technical training and \nresources to twelve motivated young women who would typically be denied \naccess to this level of technical education. During the curriculum, the \nyoung women were instructed to design an online magazine devoted to \nsocial issues. In the process, the girls were able to learn valuable \ncomputer applications as well as technical and journalistic skills \nwhile paying appropriate attention to social issues affecting the \nLouisville/Jefferson County community.\n  I applaud the efforts of Insight Communications and Oxygen Media. I \nwould also like to thank these two organizations for their enduring \ncommitment to education and service. The Fellowship program was an \nexcellent forum for young women to not only learn invaluable technical \nand journalistic skills but also provide the community with pertinent \ninformation surrounding existing social issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2824-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION LINES AND ENHANCED COST RECOVERY\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the demand for natural gas is \nexpected to increase tremendously in this country over the next 15 \nyears. By some accounts demand for natural gas will go from \napproximately 23 trillion cubic feet in 2000 to over 31 trillion cubic \nfeet by 2015, a 34 percent increase. The existing natural gas \ntransmission infrastructure simply cannot accommodate this increased \ndemand.\n  Natural gas offers an environmentally friendly and secure source of \nenergy, and we must ensure that we have the infrastructure in place to \nmeet this increased demand. Otherwise, we could suffer adverse \nenvironmental consequences and undermine the potential for economic \ngrowth, which depends upon safe and secure sources of energy. Natural \ngas also has the added advantage of reducing our dependence on foreign \nenergy sources, which in today's environment, is a major advantage.\n  The Senate Finance committee took several steps to address this \nissue. Improving the depreciation period for natural gas distribution \nlines and clarifying that natural gas gathering lines are seven-year \nproperty is a step in the right direction. However, I am concerned that \nthe bill we are now considering, as well as the House-passed energy \nlegislation, does not address cost recovery for natural gas \ntransmission lines. Reliable estimates indicate that we will have to \nbuild over 38,000 miles of additional transmission lines, a fifteen \npercent increase over current capacity, to deliver the increased amount \nof natural gas that will be required to meet the increased demand over \nthe next fifteen years. My concern is that if the Congress determines \nthat enhanced cost recovery is necessary to generate the additional \ninvestment required to meet this enormous demand, that it is necessary \nto address the entire natural gas delivery system, including both \ndistribution and transmission lines.\n  There is no doubt that the demands for capital investment in this \narea are very large indeed. Industry studies show that the natural gas \nindustry will require almost $50 billion in new investment for pipeline \ntransmission lines over the next fifteen years, over $3.2 billion per \nyear, to meet this demand. These expenditures also include the United \nStates portion of an Alaskan Gas Pipeline, which offers tremendous \npotential for this country in meeting its energy needs.\n  These are daunting sums. I am very concerned whether this capital can \nbe raised in both the current economic climate and under our current \ncost recovery system. Over the past year, the companies we depend upon \nto raise the capital required to build these transmission lines lost \nover $60 billion in market capitalization. This situation will impede \ntheir ability to raise the necessary capital in the market. Accelerated \ndepreciation will help alleviate this problem by increasing cash flow, \nthus reducing a company's need to borrow money to build additional \npipelines and lower the cost of capital that must be borrowed to \ncomplete the projects. Our committee recognized as much, as did the \nHouse, when it chose to lower the depreciation period for natural gas \ntransmission lines from 20 to 15 years. I supported this decision, but \nwe may not be able to utilize fully this increased distribution \ncapacity if we do not take similar steps regarding transmission. After \nall, natural gas will not arrive at the distribution point unless the \ntransmission infrastructure is sufficient to handle the increased \namount of natural gas required.\n  There is no question that the capital investment required to ensure \nthat we have adequate transmission pipelines to deliver natural gas is \nvery significant. There is also no question that Congress needs to \nexamine the entire delivery system to ensure that the benefits of any \nimproved cost recovery are utilized efficiently and do not produce \nunwanted bottlenecks.\n  I think it would be appropriate for us to review carefully the need \nfor shorter depreciation periods not just for distribution lines but \nfor natural gas transmission lines as well when this matter goes to \nconference. Any decisions regarding natural gas depreciation must be \nmade with an eye towards their effect on the system as a whole, \nincluding transmission lines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2824-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2824-S2825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 21, 1991 \nin Brattleboro, VT. A lesbian woman was struck by an attacker who was \nheard to say ``There's another . . . queer.''

I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2825-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2825-S2827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last month the former Chairman of \nthe Federal Communications Commissions, Newton Minow, delivered the \nMorris I. Liebman Lecture at Loyola College in Baltimore.\n  Mr. Minow's address was entitled ``The Whisper of America,'' and is \nfocused on the need for the United States to significantly increase the \nresources it devotes to international broadcasting.\n  I believe Mr. Minow makes a very thoughtful case for expanding our \nefforts in this area. In order that it may be available to a wider \naudience, and to call it to the attention of my colleagues, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         The Whisper of America\n\n       In World War II, when the survival of freedom was still far \n     from certain, the United States created a new international \n     radio service, the Voice of America. On February 24, 1942, \n     William Harlan Hale opened the German-language program with \n     these words: ``Here speaks a voice from America. Every day at \n     this time we will bring you the news of the war. The news may \n     be good. The news may be bad. We will tell you the truth.''\n       My old boss, William Benton, came up with the idea of the \n     Voice of America. He was then Assistant Secretary of State \n     and would later become Senator from Connecticut. He was \n     immensely proud of the Voice of America. One day he described \n     the new VOA to RCA Chairman David Sarnoff, the tough-minded \n     and passionate pioneer of American broadcasting. Sarnoff \n     noticed how little electronic power and transmitter scope the \n     VOA had via short-wave radio, then said, ``Benton, all you've \n     got here is the whisper of America.''\n       Although The Voice of America, and later other \n     international radio services, have made valuable \n     contributions, our international broadcasting services suffer \n     from miserly funding. In many areas of the world, they have \n     seldom been more than a whisper. Today, when we most need to \n     communicate our story, especially in the Middle East, our \n     broadcasts are not even a whisper. People in every country \n     know our music, our movies, our clothes, and our sports. But \n     they do not know our freedom or our values or our democracy.\n       I want to talk with you about how and why this happened, \n     and what we must do about it.\n       First, some history:\n       At first, the Voice of America was part of the Office of \n     War Information. When the war ended, the VOA was transferred \n     to the Department of State. With the beginning of the Cold \n     War, officials within the government began to debate the core \n     mission of the VOA: Was it to be a professional, impartial \n     news service serving as an example of press freedom to the \n     world? Or was it an instrument of U.S. foreign policy, a \n     strategic weapon to be employed against those we fight? What \n     is the line between news and propaganda? Should our \n     broadcasts advocate America's values-or should they provide \n     neutral, objective journalism?\n       That debate has never been resolved, only recast for each \n     succeeding generation. In August 1953, for example, our \n     government concluded that whatever the VOA was or would be, \n     it should not be part of the State Department. So we \n     established the United States Information Agency, and the VOA \n     became its single largest operation.\n       A few years ago, Congress decided that all our \n     international broadcasts were to be governed by a bi-partisan \n     board appointed by the President, with the Secretary of State \n     as an ex- officio member.\n       This includes other U.S. international broadcast services \n     which were born in the Cold War, the so-called ``Freedom \n     Radios.'' The first was Radio Free Europe, established in \n     1949 as a non-profit, non-governmental private corporation to \n     broadcast news and information to East Europeans behind the \n     Iron Curtain. The second was Radio Liberty, created in 1951 \n     to broadcast similar programming to the citizens of Russia \n     and the Soviet republics. Both Radio Free Europe and Radio \n     Liberty were secretly funded by the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, a fact not known to the American public until 1967, \n     when the New York Times first reported the connection. The \n     immediate result of the story was a huge controversy, because \n     the radios had for years solicited donations from the public \n     through an advertising campaign known as the Crusade for \n     Freedom. Such secrecy, critics argued, undermined the very \n     message of democratic openness the stations were intended to \n     convey in their broadcasts to the closed, totalitarian \n     regimes of the East.\n       In 1971, Congress terminated CIA funding for the stations \n     and provided for their continued existence by open \n     appropriations. The stations survived and contributed to \n     American strategy in the Cold War. That strategy was simple: \n     to persuade and convince the leaders and people of the \n     communist bloc that freedom was better than dictatorship, \n     that free enterprise was better than central planning, and \n     that no country could survive if it did not respect human \n     rights and the rule of law. Broadcasting into regimes \n     where travel was severely restricted, where all incoming \n     mail was censored, and all internal media were tools of \n     state propaganda, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty \n     communicated two messages that conventional weapons never \n     could--doubt about the present and hope for the future.\n       They did so against repeated efforts by Soviet and East \n     European secret police to sabotage their broadcast \n     facilities, to create friction between the stations and their \n     host governments, and even to murder the stations' personnel. \n     In 1962, I personally witnessed an effort by Soviet delegates \n     to an international communications conference in Geneva to \n     eliminate our broadcasts to Eastern Europe. Because I was \n     then Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the \n     Soviets assumed I was in charge of these broadcasts. I \n     explained that although this was not my department, I thought \n     we should double the broadcasts.\n       Listening to the radios' evening broadcasts became a \n     standard ritual throughout Russia and Eastern Europe. Moscow, \n     no matter how hard it tried, could not successfully jam the \n     transmissions. As a result, communism had to face a public \n     that every year knew more about its lies. In his 1970 Nobel \n     Prize speech, Aleksander Solzhenitsyn said of Radio Liberty, \n     ``If we learn anything about events in our own country, it's \n     from there.'' When the Berlin Wall fell, and soon after the \n     Soviet Union crumbled, Lech Walesa was asked about the \n     significance of Radio Free Europe to the Polish democracy \n     movement. He replied, ``Where would the Earth be without the \n     sun?''\n       Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty continue to broadcast, \n     from headquarters in downtown Prague, at the invitation of \n     Vaclav Havel. The studios are now guarded by tanks in the \n     street to protect against terrorists.\n       With very little money, Congress authorized several new \n     services: Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Iraq, Radio Free Iran, \n     Radio and TV Marti, Radio Democracy Africa, and Worldnet, a \n     television service that broadcasts a daily block of American \n     news. After 9/11, Congress approved funding for a new Radio \n     Free Afghanistan. What most people don't know is that this \n     service is not new--Congress authorized funds for Radio Free \n     Afghanistan first in 1985, when the country was under Soviet \n     domination. Even then the service was minimal--one half-hour \n     a day of news in the Dari and Pashto languages. When the \n     Soviets withdrew, we mistakenly thought the service was no \n     longer needed. We dismantled it as the country plunged into \n     chaos. We are finally beginning to correct our mistakes with \n     a smart new service in the Middle East called ``The New \n     Station for the New Generation.''\n       Indeed, as the Cold War wound down, we forgot its most \n     potent lesson: that totalitarianism was defeated not with \n     missiles, tanks and carriers, but with ideas--and that words \n     can be weapons. Even though the Voice of America had earned \n     the trust and respect of listeners for its accuracy and \n     fairness, our government starved our international \n     broadcasts. Many of the resources that had once been given to \n     public diplomacy--to explaining ourselves and our values to \n     the world--were eliminated. In the Middle East, particularly, \n     American broadcasting is not even a whisper. An Arab-language \n     radio service is operated by Voice of America, but its budget \n     is tiny and its audience tinier--only about 1 to 2 percent of \n     Arabs ever listen to it. Among those under the age of 30--60 \n     percent of the population in the region--virtually no one \n     listens.\n       As we fell mute in the Cold War's aftermath, other voices \n     grew in influence.\n\n\n                               Al Jazeera\n\n       In the past few months, Westerners began to learn about Al \n     Jazeera as a source of anti-American tirades by Muslim \n     extremists and as the favored news outlet of both Osama bin \n     Laden and the Taliban. The service had its beginnings in \n     1995, when the BBC withdrew from a joint venture with Saudi-\n     owned Orbit Communications that had provided news on a Middle \n     East channel. The BBC and the Saudi government clashed over \n     editorial judgments, and the business relationship fell \n     apart. Into the breach stepped a big fan of CNN, Qatar's \n     Emir, Sheikh Hamed bin Khalifa Al Thani. He admired CNN's \n     satellite technology and decided to bankroll a Middle East \n     satellite network with a small budget. He hired most of the \n     BBC's anchors, editors and technicians, and Al Jazeera was \n     born.\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\n       Al Jazeera means ``the peninsula'' in Arabic, and the name \n     is fitting. Just as Qatar is a peninsula, the station's \n     programming protrudes conspicuously into the world of state- \n     controlled broadcasting in the Middle East. Several \n     commentators, including many Arabs, have sharply criticized \n     the service for being unprofessional and biased. CNN and Al \n     Jazeera had a dispute this year and terminated their \n     cooperative relationship.\n       Well before September 11, Al Jazeera had managed to anger \n     most of the governments in its own region. Libya withdrew its \n     ambassador from Qatar when Al Jazeera broadcast an interview \n     with a critic of the Libyan government. Tunisia's ambassador \n     complained to the Qatari foreign ministry about a program \n     accusing Tunisia of violating human rights. Kuwait complained \n     after a program criticized Kuwait's relations with Iraq. In \n     Saudi Arabia, officials called for a ``political fatwa'' \n     prohibiting Saudis from appearing on any Al Jazeera \n     programming. In March 2001, Yasser Arafat closed Al Jazeera's \n     West Bank news bureau, complaining of an offensive depiction \n     of Arafat in a documentary. Algeria shut off electricity to \n     prevent its citizens from watching Al Jazeera's programs. \n     Other countries deny Al Jazeera's reporters entry visas.\n       And of course, our own country has plenty to complain about \n     Al Jazeera.\n       Al Jazeera came to our notice first because a 1998 \n     interview with Osama bin Laden called upon Muslims to \n     ``target all Americans.'' Al Jazeera broadcast the tape many \n     times. As the only network with an office in Afghanistan, Al \n     Jazeera was the only one the Taliban allowed to broadcast \n     from the country. On October 7, 2001, the network's Kabul \n     office received a videotape message from Osama bin Laden, \n     which it transmitted around the world. Hiding in caves, Osama \n     could still speak to the world in a voice louder than ours \n     because we allowed our story to be told by our enemies.\n       Forty years ago, I accompanied President Kennedy on a tour \n     of our space program facilities. He asked me why it was so \n     important to launch a communications satellite. I said, ``Mr. \n     President, unlike other rocket launches, this one will not \n     send a man into space, but it will send ideas. And ideas \n     last longer than people do.'' I never dreamed that the \n     ideas millions of people receive every day would come from \n     Al Jazeera.\n\n\n                      The Global Media Marketplace\n\n       Whatever one thinks of Al Jazeera, it teaches an important \n     lesson: The global marketplace of news and information is no \n     longer dominated by the United States. Our own government, \n     because it has no outlet of its own in the area, is looking \n     into buying commercial time on Al Jazeera to get America's \n     anti-terrorism message out. And because of privatization and \n     deregulation in the international satellite business, a huge \n     number of Americans now have direct access to Al Jazeera \n     through the EchoStar satellite service.\n       The point is simply this: Whether the message is one of \n     hate or peace, in the globalized communications environment \n     it is impossible either to silence those who send the \n     message, or stop those who want to receive it. Satellites \n     have no respect for national borders. Satellites surmount \n     walls. Like Joshua's Trumpet, satellites blow walls down.\n       That was the last lesson of the Cold War. In Beijing, the \n     Chinese government would not begin its brutal sweep through \n     Tianamen Square until it thought the world's video cameras \n     were out of range. In Manila, Warsaw and Bucharest, \n     dissenters first captured the television station--the \n     Electronic Bastille of modern revolutions. In Prague, a \n     classic urban rebellion became a revolution through \n     television. The Romanian revolution was not won until \n     television showed pictures of the Ceaucescus' corpses and \n     scenes of rebels controlling the square in Bucharest. In the \n     final days of the Soviet Union, the August 1991 coup against \n     President Mikhail Gorbachev failed when video of the \n     supposedly ill president was broadcast by satellite around \n     the world. Those satellites, Gorbachev later said, \n     ``prevented the triumph of dictatorship.'' Now, we have the \n     newer technologies of the internet and e-mail--technologies \n     the Voice of America and the Freedom Radios use with \n     enthusiasm without adequate support.\n       What we have failed to realize is that the last lesson of \n     the Cold War is also the first lesson of the new global \n     information age. We live now in a world where we are the lone \n     superpower, and the target of envy and resentment not just in \n     the Middle East but elsewhere. Terror is now the weapon of \n     choice.\n       But if you believe we are only in a war against terrorism, \n     you are only half-right. Nation-states can sponsor terrorism \n     and provide cover to terrorists, but the war against \n     terrorism is asymmetric. This is my friend Don Rumsfeld's \n     favorite word--asymmetric. This means that war is not waged \n     by a state against another state per se, but against an \n     ideology. Think of the campaign of the past few months. The \n     enemy has been a band of religious zealots and the Al Qaeda \n     terrorists they harbor, not the people of Afghanistan. \n     President Bush has been emphatic and effective on this point, \n     as have Prime Minister Tony Blair and other world leaders.\n       Asymmetry also refers to the strategies and tactics used by \n     those who cannot compete in a conventional war. In an \n     asymmetric war, it is not enough to have Air Forces to \n     command the skies, Navies to roam the seas, or Armies to \n     control mountain passes. Although the Cold War led to \n     staggering advances in military technology to win the \n     battles, there is not a corresponding change in our \n     government's use of communications technology to win the \n     peace.\n       Asymmetry, in other words, is not limited to what happens \n     on the battlefield. While U.S. Special Operations forces in \n     Afghanistan use laptops and satellites and sophisticated \n     wireless telecommunications to guide pilots flying bombing \n     missions from aircraft carriers in the Arabian Sea, we still \n     use obsolete, clumsy and primitive methods, such as short-\n     wave radio, to communicate to the people.\n       Here is another incongruity: American marketing talent is \n     successfully selling Madonna's music, Pepsi Cola and Coca \n     Cola, Michael Jordan's shoes and McDonald's hamburgers around \n     the world. Our film, television and computer software \n     industries dominate their markets worldwide. Yet, the United \n     States government has tried to get its message of freedom and \n     democracy out to the 1 billion Muslims in the world and can't \n     seem to do it. How is it that America, a nation founded on \n     ideas--not religion or race or ethnicity or clan--cannot \n     explain itself to the world?\n       In the months since September 11, Americans have been \n     surprised to learn of the deep and bitter resentment that \n     much of the Muslim world feels toward us. Our situation is \n     not just a public relations problem. Anyone who has traveled \n     the world knows that much anti-American sentiment springs \n     from disagreements with some of our economic and foreign \n     policies. Our support of authoritarian regimes in the Muslim \n     world has not endeared us to the people who live there. And \n     there is no more poisonous imagery than that of Palestinians \n     and Israelis locked in mortal and what seems to be never-\n     ending combat.\n       Still, the United States has an important story to tell, \n     the story of human striving for freedom, democracy and \n     opportunity. Since the end of the Cold War, we have failed to \n     tell that story to a world waiting to hear it on the radio \n     and see it on television. We have failed to use the power of \n     ideas.\n       Within days of the Taliban's flight from Kabul, television \n     was back on the air in the country. The Taliban had not only \n     banned television broadcasts, but confiscated and destroyed \n     thousands of TV sets. They hung the smashed husks of TV sets \n     on light poles, along with videocassettes and musical \n     instruments, as a warning to anyone who might try to break \n     the regime's reign of ignorance. And yet no sooner were the \n     Taliban driven from the city than hundreds of TV sets \n     appeared from nowhere. Even in the midst of a totalitarian, \n     theocratic regime, there had been a thriving underground \n     market for news and information. Television antennas were \n     quickly hung outside of windows and on rooftops. The antennas \n     are like periscopes, enabling those inside to see what is \n     happening outside.\n       Where were we when those people needed us? Where were we \n     when Al Jazeera went on the air? It was as if we put on our \n     own self-created burka and disappeared from sight. The voices \n     of America, the voices of freedom, were not even a whisper.\n\n\n                           The New Challenge\n\n       I believe the United States must re-commit itself to public \n     diplomacy--to explaining and advocating our values to the \n     world. As Tom Friedman put it in his New York Times column \n     not long ago: ``It is no easy trick to lose a PR war to two \n     mass murderers--(Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein) but \n     we've been doing just that lately. It is not enough for the \n     White House to label them `evildoers.' We have to take the PR \n     war right to them, just like the real one.''\n       There are two leaders of both parties who need our support \n     in this fight for aggressive, vigorous public diplomacy. \n     Illinois Republican Congressman Henry Hyde, chairman of the \n     House International Relations Committee, wants to strengthen \n     the Voice of America and the many Freedom Radio services that \n     broadcast from Cuba to Afghanistan. Democratic Senator Joseph \n     Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is \n     on the same page. He has developed legislation known as \n     ``Initiative 911'' to give special emphasis to more \n     programming for the entire Muslim world, from Nigeria to \n     Indonesia.\n       In November, Congress finally set aside $30 million to \n     launch a new Middle East radio network. The AM and FM \n     broadcasts (not short wave) will offer pop music--American \n     and Arabic--along with a mix of current events and talk \n     shows. The proposal to fund Radio Free Afghanistan is for \n     $27.5 million this year and next, and will allow about 12 \n     hours a day of broadcasting into the country. The goal is to \n     make our ideas clear not just to leaders in the Muslim world, \n     but to those in the street, and particularly the young, many \n     of whom are uneducated and desperately poor, and among whom \n     hostility toward the United States is very high.\n       These efforts are late and, in my view, too timid. They are \n     tactical, not strategic. They are smart, not visionary. The \n     cost of putting Radio Free Afghanistan on the air and \n     underwriting its annual budget, for example, is less than \n     even one Commanche helicopter. We have many hundreds of \n     helicopters which we need to destroy tyranny, but they are \n     insufficient to secure freedom. In an asymmetric war, we must \n     also fight on the idea front.\n       Bob Shieffer put the issue well not long ago on CBS' ``Face \n     the Nation'':\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\n       ``The real enemy is not Osama, it is the ignorance that \n     breeds the hatred that fuels his cause. This is what we have \n     to change. I realized what an enormous job that was going to \n     be the other day when I heard a young Pakistani student tell \n     an interviewer that everyone in his school knew that Israel \n     was behind the attacks on the Twin Towers and everyone in his \n     school knew all the Jews who worked there had stayed home \n     that day.\n       ``What we have all come to realize now is that a large part \n     of the world not only misunderstands us but is teaching its \n     children to hate us.''\n       Steve Forbes, who once headed the Broadcasting Board of \n     Governors, put the issue even more bluntly: ``Washington \n     should cease its petty, penny-minded approach to our \n     international radios and give them the resources and capable \n     personnel to do the job that so badly needs to be done right. \n     . . . What are we waiting for?''\n\n\n                              The proposal\n\n       What are we waiting for? I suggest three simple proposals. \n     First, define a clear strategic mission and vision for U.S. \n     international broadcasting. Second, provide the financial \n     resources to get the job done. Third, use the unique talent \n     that the United States has--all of it--to communicate that \n     vision to the world.\n       First, and above all, U.S. international broadcasting \n     should be unapologetically proud to advocate freedom and \n     democracy in the world. There is no inconsistency in \n     reporting the news accurately while also advocating America's \n     values. The real issue is whether we will carry the debate on \n     the meaning of freedom to places on the globe, where open \n     debate is unknown and freedom has no seed. Does anyone \n     seriously believe that the twin goals of providing solid \n     journalism and undermining tyranny are incompatible? As a \n     people, Americans have always been committed to the \n     proposition that these goals go hand in hand. As the leader \n     of the free world, it is time for us to do what's right--to \n     speak of idealism, sacrifice and the nurturing of values \n     essential to human freedom--and to speak in a bold, clear \n     voice.\n       Second, if we are to do that, we will need to put our money \n     where out mouths are not. We now spend more than a billion \n     dollars each day for the Department of Defense. Results in \n     the war on terrorism demonstrate that this is money well \n     invested in our national security.\n       Whatever Don Rumsfeld says he needs should be provided by \n     the Congress with pride in the extraordinary service his \n     imaginative leadership is giving our country. As President \n     Bush has proposed, we will need to increase the defense \n     budget. When we do, let's compare what we need to spend on \n     the Voice of America and the Freedom Radio services with what \n     we need to spend on defense. Our international broadcasting \n     efforts amount to less than two-tenths of one percent of \n     Defense expenditures. Al Jazeera was started with an initial \n     budget of less than $30 million a year. Now Al Jazeera \n     reaches some 40 million men, women and children every day, at \n     a cost of pennies per viewer every month.\n       Congress should hold hearings now to decide what we should \n     spend to get our message of freedom, democracy and peace into \n     the non-democratic and authoritarian regions of the world. \n     One suggestion is to consider a relationship between what we \n     spend on defense with what we spend on communication. For \n     example, should we spend 10 percent of what we spend on \n     defense for communication? That would be $33 billion a year. \n     Too much. Should we spend 1 percent? That would be $3.3 \n     billion, and that seems about right to me--one dollar to \n     launch ideas for every $100 we invest to launch bombs. This \n     would be about six times more than we invest now in \n     international communications. We must establish a ratio \n     sufficient to our need to inform and persuade others of the \n     values of freedom and democracy. More importantly, we should \n     seek a ratio sufficient to lessen our need for bombs.\n       Third, throwing money alone at the problem will not do the \n     job. We need to use all of the communications talent we have \n     at our disposal. This job is not only for journalists. As \n     important as balanced news and public affairs programming are \n     to our public diplomacy mission, the fact is that we are now \n     in a global information marketplace. An American news source, \n     even a highly professional one like the VOA, is not \n     necessarily persuasive in a market of shouting, often \n     deceitful and hateful voices. Telling the truth in a \n     persuasive, convincing way is not propaganda. Churchill's and \n     Roosevelt's words--``never was so much owed by so many to so \n     few''--``The only thing we have to fear is fear itself''--\n     were as powerful as a thousand guns.\n       When Colin Powell chose advertising executive Charlotte \n     Beers as Under Secretary of State for public diplomacy and \n     public affairs, some journalists sneered. You cannot peddle \n     freedom as you would cars and shampoo, went the refrain. That \n     is undoubtedly so, and Beers has several times said as much \n     herself. But you can't peddle freedom if no one is listening, \n     and Charlotte Beers is a master at getting people to listen--\n     and to communicate in terms people understand.\n       So was another visionary in this business, Bill Benton. \n     Before he served as Assistant Secretary of State, Benton had \n     been a founding partner in one of the country's largest and \n     most successful advertising firms, Benton and Bowles. To win \n     the information war, we will need the Bentons and Beers of \n     this world every bit as much as we will need the journalists. \n     We have the smartest, most talented, and most creative people \n     in the world in our communications industries--in radio, \n     television, film, newspapers, magazines, advertising, \n     publishing, public relations, marketing. These men and women \n     want to help their country, and will volunteer eagerly to \n     help get our message across. One of the first people we \n     should enlist is a West Point graduate named Bill Roedy, who \n     is President of MTV Networks International. His enterprise \n     reaches one billion people in 18 languages in 164 countries. \n     Eight out of ten MTV viewers live outside the United States. \n     He can teach us a lot about how to tell our story.\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       In 1945, a few years after the VOA first went on the air, \n     the newly founded United Nations had 51 members. Today it has \n     189. In the last decade alone, more than 20 countries have \n     been added to the globe, many of them former Soviet \n     republics, but not all. Some of these new countries, as with \n     the Balkan example, have been cut bloodily from the fabric of \n     ethnic and religious hatred. Some of these countries are \n     nominally democratic, but many--especially in Central Asia--\n     are authoritarian regimes. Some are also deeply unstable, and \n     thus pose a threat not only to their neighbors, but to the \n     free world. Afghanistan, we discovered too late, is a concern \n     not only to its region, but to all of us.\n       In virtually every case, those whose rule is based on an \n     ideology of hate have understood better than we have the \n     power of ideas and the power of communicating ideas. The \n     bloodshed in the Balkans began with hate radio blaring from \n     Zagreb and Belgrade, and hate radio is still common in the \n     region today. The murder of 2 million Hutus and Tutsis in \n     central Africa could not have happened but for the urging of \n     madmen with broadcast towers at their disposal. The same has \n     been true of ethnic violence in India and Pakistan.\n       I saw this first hand in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. \n     President Kennedy asked me to organize eight American \n     commercial radio stations to carry the Voice of America to \n     Cuba because the VOA was shut out by Soviet jamming. We \n     succeeded, and President Kennedy's speeches were heard in \n     Spanish in Cuba at the height of the crisis. As we kept the \n     destroyers and missiles out of Cuba, we got the Voice of \n     America in because we had enough power to surmount the \n     jamming. On that occasion, our American broadcasts were more \n     than a whisper.\n       Last spring--well before the events of September 11--\n     Illinois Congressman Henry Hyde put the need eloquently. I \n     quote him: ``During the last several years it has been argued \n     that our broadcasting services have done their job so well \n     that they are no longer needed. This argument assumes that \n     the great battle of the 20th century, the long struggle for \n     the soul of the world, is over: that the forces of freedom \n     and democracy have won. But the argument is terribly \n     shortsighted. It ignores the people of China and Cuba, of \n     Vietnam and Burma, of Iraq and Iran and Sudan and North Korea \n     and now Russia. It ignores the fragility of freedom and the \n     difficulty of building and keeping democracy. And it ignores \n     the resilience of evil.''\n       Fifty-eight years ago, Albert Einstein returned from a day \n     of sailing to find a group of reporters waiting for him at \n     the shore. The reporters told him that the United States had \n     dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, wiping out the city. \n     Einstein shook his head and said, ``Everything in the world \n     has changed except the way we think.''\n       On September 11 everything changed except the way we think. \n     It is hard to change the way we think. But we know that ideas \n     last longer than people do, and that two important ideas of \n     the 20th century are now in direct competition: the ideas of \n     mass communication and mass destruction. The great question \n     of our time is whether we will be wise enough to use one to \n     avoid the other.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2827-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2827-S2828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants to promote positive health behaviors in women; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nentitled the ``Community Health Workers Act of 2002'' would improve \naccess to health education and outreach services to women in medically \nunderserved areas in the United States-New Mexico border region.\n  Lack of access to adequate health care and health education is a \nsignificant problem along the United States-New Mexico border. While \nthe access problem is in part due to a lack of insurance, it is also \nattributable to non-financial barriers to access. These barriers \ninclude a shortage of physicians and other health professionals, and \nhospitals; inadequate transportation; a shortage of bilingual health \ninformation and health providers; and culturally insensitive systems of \ncare.\n  This legislation would help to address the issue of access by \nproviding $6 million in grants to State, local, and tribal \norganizations, including community health centers and public health \ndepartments, for the purpose of hiring community health workers to \nprovide health education, outreach, and referrals to women and families \nwho otherwise would have little or no contact with health care \nservices.\n  Recognizing factors such as poverty and language and cultural \ndifferences that often serve as barriers to health care access in \nmedically underserved populations, community health workers are in a \nunique position to improve health outcomes and quality of care for \ngroups that have traditionally lacked access to adequate services.\n  The positive benefits of the community health worker model have been \ndocumented. Research has shown that community health workers have been \neffective in increasing the utilization of health preventive services \nsuch as cancer screenings and medical follow up for elevated blood \npressure. Preliminary investigation of a community health workers \nproject in New Mexico suggests that community health workers also help \nto increase enrollment in health insurance programs such as Medicaid \nand the Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP.\n  According to an Institute of Medicine, IOM, report entitled, \n``Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in \nHealthcare,'' ``community health workers offer promise as a community-\nbased resource to increase racial and ethnic minorities' access to \nhealth care and to serve as a liaison between healthcare providers and \nthe communities they serve.''\n  Although the community health worker model is valued on the United \nStates-Mexico border as well as other parts of the country that \nencounter challenges of meeting the health care needs of medically \nunderserved populations, these programs often have difficulty securing \nadequate financial resources to maintain and expand upon their \nservices. As a result, many of these programs are significantly limited \nin their ability to meet the ongoing and emerging health demands of \ntheir communities.\n  The IOM report also notes that ``programs to support the use of \ncommunity health workers . . . especially among medically underserved \nand racial and ethnic minority populations, should be expanded, \nevaluated, and replicated.''\n  I am introducing this legislation to increase resources for a model \nthat has shown significant promise for increasing access to quality \nhealth care and health education for families in medically underserved \ncommunities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Health Workers Act \n     of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Chronic diseases, defined as any condition that \n     requires regular medical attention or medication, are the \n     leading cause of death and disability for women in the United \n     States across racial and ethnic groups.\n       (2) According to the National Vital Statistics Report of \n     2001, the 5 leading causes of death among Hispanic, American \n     Indian, and African-American women are heart disease, cancer, \n     diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and unintentional \n     injuries.\n       (3) Unhealthy behaviors alone lead to more than 50 percent \n     of premature deaths in the United States.\n       (4) Poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and \n     alcohol and drug abuse are the health risk behaviors that \n     most often lead to disease, premature death, and disability, \n     and are particularly prevalent among many groups of minority \n     women.\n       (5) Over 60 percent of Hispanic and African-American women \n     are classified as overweight and over 30 percent are \n     classified as\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\n     obese. Over 60 percent of American Indian women are \n     classified as obese.\n       (6) American Indian women have the highest mortality rates \n     related to alcohol and drug use of all women in the United \n     States.\n       (7) High poverty rates coupled with barriers to health \n     preventive services and medical care contribute to racial and \n     ethnic disparities in health factors, including premature \n     death, life expectancy, risk factors associated with major \n     diseases, and the extent and severity of illnesses.\n       (8) There is increasing evidence that early life \n     experiences are associated with adult chronic disease and \n     that prevention and intervention services provided within the \n     community and the home may lessen the impact of chronic \n     outcomes, while strengthening families and communities.\n       (9) Community health workers, who are primarily women, can \n     be a critical component in conducting health promotion and \n     disease prevention efforts in medically underserved \n     populations.\n       (10) Recognizing the difficult barriers confronting \n     medically underserved communities (poverty, geographic \n     isolation, language and cultural differences, lack of \n     transportation, low literacy, and lack of access to \n     services), community health workers are in a unique position \n     to reduce preventable morbidity and mortality, improve the \n     quality of life, and increase the utilization of available \n     preventive health services for community members.\n       (11) Research has shown that community health workers have \n     been effective in significantly increasing screening and \n     medical followup visits among residents with limited access \n     or underutilization of health care services.\n       (12) States on the United States-Mexico border have high \n     percentages of impoverished and ethnic minority populations: \n     border States accommodate 60 percent of the total Hispanic \n     population and 23 percent of the total population below 200 \n     percent poverty in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would provide for a five-year temporary suspension of the duty on \nimports of Nylon MXD6, through December 31, 2007.\n  Nylon MXD6 is polyamide, classified under Chapter 39 of the \nHarmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, subheading 3908.10.10, \nHTSUS. It is a tough, transparent resin that is used by several \ncompanies throughout the U.S. to make packaging for food and other \nproducts.\n  Temporary duty suspensions, when properly utilized, are an effective \nway to confer ``win-win'' benefits on consumers and the economy. \nSuspending the duty on an imported good encourages increased supply and \navailability of that good, and such increases benefit U.S. consumers. \nSo long as we first ensure that no domestic businesses will be harmed, \nand that the impact on Federal revenue is negligible, such temporary \nduty suspensions clearly make for smart trade policy.\n  The merits of a temporary duty-suspension bill are typically judged \nbased on whether or not it is ``non-controversial.'' Such a bill is \ngenerally considered non-controversial only if there are no domestic \nproducers who would be harmed by increased imports, and the revenue \nimpact would be de minimis, that is, roughly $500,000 per year or less. \nBased on these criteria, this bill should not be controversial. It is \nmy understanding that there are no domestic producers of Nylon MXD6, \nand that the duties paid on imports of the resin have historically been \nat or under $500,000.\n  In addition to the usual benefits of this kind of legislation, it is \nmy understanding that the importer of Nylon MXD6, Mitsubishi Gas \nChemical-America, has plans to establish a domestic production facility \nin the United States, and hopes to have it on-line before this proposed \nduty suspension would expire. Temporarily suspending the duty on the \ncompound would help ease the company's transition to domestic \nproduction. The planned facility, in turn, would create new U.S. \nmanufacturing jobs and contribute to our overall economic vitality. The \nfacility would purchase domestically one of the two principal raw \nmaterials used to make the resin, and the revenue that local, state, \nand federal governments would collect from a permanently established, \ndomestic production facility are likely to far outweigh the amount that \nwill be collected through the duties imposed under current law.\n  This is a good bill with no substantial costs involved. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2181. A bill to review, reform, and terminate unnecessary and \ninequitable Federal subsidies; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am re-introducing \nlegislation to establish a process to evaluate Federal subsidies and \ntax advantages received by corporations to ensure they are in the \nnational interest, not the special interest. This bill, ``The Corporate \nSubsidy Reform Commission Act,'' is identical to a bill I introduced in \nprevious years.\n  Because we face diminishing resources, we must prioritize our level \nof Federal spending. Therefore, corporate welfare simply must be \neliminated.\n  There are more than 100 such corporate subsidy programs in the \nFederal budget today, requiring the Federal Government to spend \napproximately $65 billion a year.\n  Terminating even some of these programs could save taxpayers tens of \nbillions of dollars each year, money that could be used to cut taxes \nfor lower-income Americans, bolster Social Security, pay down the \nnational debt, and strengthen our military forces.\n  In years past, Congress has insisted that it would eliminate the \nexistence of this corporate welfare, but virtually no such program has \nbeen eliminated. Consequently, taxpayer dollars continue to be wasted \nas I speak.\n  The Corporate Subsidy Reform Commission Act aims to remove the \nspecial treatment given to politically powerful industries and restore \nall taxpayers to a level playing field. It defines inequitable \nsubsidies as those provided to corporations without a reasonable \nexpectation that they will return a commensurate benefit to the public.\n  The Act excludes any subsidies that are primarily for research and \ndevelopment, education, public health, public safety, or the \nenvironment. Also excluded are subsidies or tax advantages necessary to \ncomply with international trade or treaty obligations.\n  The Act would create a nine-member commission nominated by the \nPresident and the Congressional leadership. Federal agencies would be \nrequired to submit to the Commission, at the time of the \nAdministration's next budget, a list of subsidies and tax advantages \nthat each agency believes are inequitable.\n  The Commission will provide recommendations to either terminate or \nreduce the corporate subsidies. The President has the authority under \nthe Act to either terminate consideration of the Commission's \nrecommendations, or submit the Commission's recommendations to the \nCongress as a legislative initiative.\n  The Congress would then have four months to review the Commission's \nrecommendations that have been endorsed by the President. At that time, \nthe actions of all involved committees in each respective legislative \nbody would be sent to the floor for debate, under expedited procedures.\n  Many Federal subsidies and special-interest tax breaks for \ncorporations are unnecessary, and do not provide a fair return to the \ntaxpayers who bear the heavy burden of their cost. If a corporation is \nreceiving taxpayer-funded subsidies or tax breaks that are unsupported \nby a compelling benefit to the public, the subsidy should be ended.\n  Does it make sense for the Agriculture Department to spend $80 \nmillion a year on a program, the Market Access Program, that subsidizes \nthe overseas advertising campaigns of cash-strapped corporations such \nas Pillsbury, Dole, and Jim Beam?\n  Why should the Commerce Department spend $211 million a year on the \nAdvanced Technology Program to give research grants to consortiums of \nsome of the largest and richest high-tech companies in this Nation?\n  Where is the accountability to taxpayers here? They have been \nshortchanged at the expense of the special interests. This undermines \nour Nation's fiscal house, and impairs Congress' ability to respond to \ntruly urgent needs such as health care, education, debt reduction, and \nnational security.\n  Unfortunately, the pervasive system of pork-barreling and special \ninterest legislating is speeding along unabated in Washington. Instead \nof pursuing our Nation's priorities, both parties continue to spend \nwithout accountability. During my service in the Senate, I have worked \nto eliminate wasteful earmarks in appropriations bills. And yet this \nyear alone, about $15 billion in pork barrel spending was approved by \nthe Senate without going through any merit-based review process.\n  I would rather eliminate corporate subsidies and inequitable tax \nsubsidies without resorting to a commission. But we know that the \ninfluence of the special interests will prevent that effort from \nsucceeding unless forceful action is taken.\n  We need a credible process to identify corporate pork and eliminate \nit. This legislation is the first important step in alleviating the \npublic burden of unnecessary corporate subsidies and tax \nbreaks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2182. A bill to authorize funding for computer and network \nsecurity research and development and research fellowship programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Americans today live in an \nincreasingly networked world. The system of interlinked computer \nnetworks known as the Internet, which not so long ago was a platform \nused only by a relatively narrow group of academic researchers, is \ntoday a core medium of communications and commerce for many millions of \nAmericans. According to the Commerce Department, more than half of all \nAmericans were using the Internet by last September, and the numbers \nare only growing.\n  The spread of the Internet presents great new opportunities for the \nAmerican society and economy. But there is a downside to an \ninterconnected,\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\nnetworked world: security risks. The Internet connects people not just \nto friends, potential customers, and sources of information, but also \nto would-be hackers, viruses, and cybercriminals.\n  Last July, after I became Chairman of the Commerce Committee's \nSubcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space, I chose cybersecurity \nas the topic for my first hearing. The message from that hearing was \nthat cybersecurity risks are mounting. The complexity of computer \nnetworks and the breadth of functions handled online are growing faster \nthan the country's computer security capabilities. New technologies, \nfor example, ``always on'' Internet connections and wireless networking \ntechnologies, often make the problem worse, not better.\n  The events of September 11 make this matter even more urgent. The \nfact is, America needs to be prepared for the possibility that future \nterrorists will try to strike not our buildings, streets, or airplanes, \nbut our critical computer networks.\n  Government can't provide a silver bullet solution to this problem. \nUltimately, progress with respect to cybersecurity is going to require \nthe energy and ingenuity of the entire technology sector.\n  But one thing government can and should do is support basic \ncybersecurity research, so that the country's pool of cybersecurity \nknowledge and expertise keeps pace with the new and constantly evolving \nrisks. This is an area where government involvement is sorely needed.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce today the Cyber Security \nResearch and Development Act. Thanks to the leadership of Congressman \nSherry Boehlert, this legislation has already passed the House by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote. I hope the Senate will be able to follow \nsuit soon.\n  This legislation, which has the widespread support of the Nation's \ntechnology sector, would significantly increase the amount of \ncybersecurity research in this country by creating important new \nresearch programs at the National Science Foundation, NSF, and National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, NIST. The NSF program would \nprovide funding for innovative research, multidisciplinary academic \ncenters devoted to cybersecurity, and new courses and fellowships to \neducate the cybersecurity experts of the future. The NIST program \nlikewise would support cutting-edge cybersecurity research, with a \nspecial emphasis on promoting cooperative efforts between government, \nindustry, and academia.\n  I believe the stakes are high. In addition to the damage that \ncyberattacks could cause directly, the mere threat of security breaches \ncan cripple the ongoing development of e-commerce. If the Internet is \nto reach its full potential, security must be improved.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in making cybersecurity \nresearch and development a top priority, and to work with me in moving \nthis bill forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2182\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the reissuance of a rule relating to \nergonomics; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to join \nmy colleague Senator Breaux in introducing legislation which would \nrequire the Secretary of Labor to issue a new ergonomics standard \nwithin two years of the bill's enactment. The measure is similar to \nlegislation I cosponsored last year, S. 598, but includes additional \nprovisions to ensure that a truly protective standard is issued.\n  Following the overturning of the Clinton Administration's proposed \nergonomics regulation by Congress in 2001, I expected the Department of \nLabor to issue a new rule to protect our Nation's workers. Rather than \nimplement a new standard, however, the Department unveiled an \nergonomics plan on April 5, 2002, that calls for voluntary industry \nguidelines, enforcement measures, and workplace outreach. I have \nconcern that such an approach adequately addresses the safety of our \nNation's workforce.\n  I voted in favor of the Joint Resolution of Disapproval of the \nproposed ergonomics standard because I had concerns over its potential \ncost and complexity. Last year, as Chairman of the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I held two \nhearings on this contentious matter where I heard from witnesses on \nboth sides of the debate. They testified that the potential costs of \nthe rule ranged from $4.5 billion to as much as $1 trillion. There was \nalso considerable disagreement over whether the regulation needed to be \nas complex as it was. I came away from these hearings with the \nconclusion that there was a need for promoting worker safety. But I was \nalso concerned as to whether the entire matter ought to be \nsubstantially simpler.\n  I firmly believe that the best way to protect our Nation's workers \nfrom work-related musculoskeletal disorders and workplace hazards is \nfor the Department of Labor to issue a new ergonomics standard, but one \nthat is substantially simpler than the rule overturned last year. I had \nhoped that the Department would take action on its own to issue a new \nrule, and Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao left open this possibility \nin response to an inquiry I made prior to the ergonomics vote. She \nstated in a March 6, 2001, letter to me:\n\n       Let me assure you that in the event a Joint Resolution of \n     Disapproval becomes law, I intend to pursue a comprehensive \n     approach to ergonomics which may include new rulemaking that \n     addresses the concerns levied against the current standard.\n\n  The key word in her response was ``may,'' and I remain disappointed \nthat the plan put forward by the Department of Labor does not include \nsuch a new rulemaking. For that reason, I believe it is important to \npress ahead with today's legislation.\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as an \noriginal co-sponsor of S. 2184, which provides for reissuance by the \nDepartment of Labor of a rule to prevent repetitive stress injuries. \nToo much time has passed with too little action on what is acknowledged \nto be the most critical workplace safety issue we face. After a year of \ninaction and delay, it is clear that this Administration is not serious \nabout protecting workers from repetitive stress injury hazards in the \nworkplace. Congress must now step in and require the Department to act.\n  This is a problem that affects countless numbers of workers. Each \nyear, roughly 1.8 million workers suffer repetitive stress injuries on \nthe job. That translates to 5000 injured workers a day, one worker \ninjured every 18 seconds. Women suffer disproportionately from \nrepetitive stress injuries. In particular, 67 percent of reported \ncarpal tunnel cases and 61 percent of tendonitis cases are women, even \nthough women comprise only 46 percent of the work force and account for \nonly 33 percent of total workplace injuries.\n  Notwithstanding the gravity of the problem, this Administration and \nits Republican allies in Congress saw fit to overturn the ten years of \neffort that went into developing an OSHA standard for protecting \nworkers from repetitive stress injury hazards in the workplace. In its \nplace, Secretary of Labor Chao and President Bush promised a \n``comprehensive plan'' to combat this serious workplace safety issue.\n  Yet after months of delays and inaction, what the Department of Labor \nhas now produced is a sham. It's emphasis on voluntariness, toothless \nenforcement, and unnecessary and duplicative research in my view turns \nthe clock back to before the first Bush Administration when Secretary \nof Labor Lynn Martin initiated the repetitive stress injury rulemaking \nproceeding.\n  Voluntary approaches alone have not protected workers from repetitive \nstress injuries. OSHA itself reports that only 16 percent of employers \nin general industry have put in place ergonomic programs to reduce \nhazards. Each year 1.8 million workers suffer repetitive stress \ninjuries and recent Bureau of Labor Statistics reports show that injury \nnumbers and rates are increasing, particularly in high risk industries \nand occupations.\n  We have been as patient as possible with this Administration, but it \nis clear that they have no intention of addressing this problem in a \nserious manner. Time is running out for the millions of workers at risk \nof repetitive stress injury. Congress must act now. And we must act \ndecisively.\n  The bill we introduce today is a balanced approach to fashioning a \nrepetitive stress injury standard that will benefit all workers. In \nparticular it requires the Department of Labor to issue, within two \nyears, a standard for addressing work-related repetitive stress \ninjuries and workplace ergonomic hazards. The bill requires the new \nstandard to describe in clear terms when an employer is required to \ntake action, what actions the employer must take, and when an employer \nis in compliance with the standard. Under the bill's terms the new \nstandard must emphasize prevention and cover workers at risk only where \nmeasures exist to control the hazards that are both economically and \ntechnologically feasible. The standard must be based on the best \navailable evidence and employer experience with effective practices. \nFinally, the bill clarifies that the new rule cannot expand the \napplication of state workers' compensation laws, it requires the \nDepartment of Labor to issue information and training materials, and \nprovides the Department with authority and flexibility to issue an \nappropriate standard.\n  In sum, this bill represents a balanced and comprehensive approach to \ndealing with the most serious workplace safety issue we face. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this measure. Action on the issue \nof repetitive stress injury is long overdue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 2185. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to provide workers with individual account plans with \ninformation on how the assets in their accounts are invested and of the \nneed to diversify the investment of the assets; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \ndesigned to promote investor education. The collapse of Enron has left \nCongress searching for answers as to how such a disaster could have \nhappened and how it can be prevented from happening in the future. I \nserve on both the Commerce and Governmental Affairs Committees which \nare investigating Enron and a central concept I have taken away from \nthese investigations is the importance of ensuring that investors have \nadequate and current information regarding their retirement plans. \nEmployees need to be armed with knowledge in order to protect \nthemselves and their hard earned retirement savings.\n  My bill would require that employee investors in company 401(k) plans \nreceive quarterly reports detailing the contents of their 401(k) plans. \nUnder\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\ncurrent law, employers are only required to provide annual reports with \na statement of benefits accrued under the plan. Enron certainly \nillustrates what a difference a year makes. Employees should have \ntimely access to information about their 401(k) plan, enabling them to \nmake choices in their investments. My bill would require that employees \nreceive quarterly reports with a specific listing of: 1. the fair \nmarket value of the assets of each investment option; 2. the percentage \nof plan investment in each asset; and 3. the percentage of investments \nin employer securities and how much of that investment came from \nemployee contributions.\n  My bill would also require that quarterly reports contain a ``warning \nlabel'' informing employees of the potential danger of investing too \nheavily in employer stock. I believe that employees should have the \nability to choose how to invest and diversify their own 401(k) plan. \nHowever, I also believe employees should be able to make informed \nchoices. Providing employees with the basic information that investing \ntoo heavily in any one security, including their own company stock, \nviolates commonly accepted investing principles is simple common sense. \nThus, my bill requires that a warning label be provided to employees \nupon enrollment in a plan and included in quarterly reports that reads: \nUnder commonly accepted principles of good investment advice, a \nretirement account should be invested in a broadly diversified \nportfolio of stocks and bonds. It is unwise for employees to hold \nsignificant concentrations of employer stock in an account that is \nmeant for retirement savings.\n  We may not be able to prevent company executives from lying, cheating \nand stealing like the executives of Enron, though we should ensure a \nclimate of strict enforcement to deter such behavior. However, we can \narm employees with the information and tools to protect themselves and \ntheir retirement savings. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \nnew Assistant Secretary to perform operations, preparedness, security \nand law enforcement functions, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nrequested by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as a courtesy to the \nSecretary and the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. Except in unusual \ncircumstances, it is my practice to introduce legislation requested by \nthe Administration so that such measures will be available for review \nand consideration.\n  This ``by-request'' bill would allow VA to create an office, directed \nby an Assistant Secretary, to address operations, preparedness, \nsecurity, and law enforcement functions. With the increased focus on \nhomeland security has come increased emphasis on the role that VA is \nexpected to play in providing medical care to veterans, active duty \nmilitary personnel, and civilians during disasters. In order to improve \nemergency preparedness without sacrificing its primary mission, caring \nfor the Nation's veterans, the Secretary has proposed creating an \nOffice of Operations, Security, and Preparedness to help coordinate \npreparedness strategies, both within VA and with other Federal, State, \nand local agencies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and Secretary \nPrincipi's transmittal letter that accompanied the draft legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2186\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herein a draft \n     bill ``To amend title 38, United States Code, to increase the \n     number of certain Officers to perform operations, \n     preparedness, security and law enforcement functions, and for \n     other purposes.'' We request that it be referred to the \n     appropriate committee for prompt consideration and enactment.\n       America has entered into an extended war against terrorism \n     in which the front lines include the home front as well as \n     the foreign battlefield. The tragic events of September 11, \n     2001, served as a reminder that terrorists are willing and \n     able to attack our civilian population, our centers for \n     military command and control, and our economic system. The \n     anthrax attacks that surfaced during October underscored our \n     nation's vulnerability to asymmetric attacks.\n       National Defense and Homeland Security Offices project that \n     terrorist attacks on the United States will continue. \n     Terrorists may use any lethal means against domestic targets, \n     including chemical, biological, radiological, or kinetic \n     devices. Moreover, we can assume that terrorists and other \n     entities supporting terrorists may use chemical or\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\n     biological weapons against U.S. military members engaged in \n     combat operations. VA must anticipate military casualties in \n     numbers or of a type that could tax the Department of Defense \n     (DOD) medical system. Additionally, the United States can \n     expect terrorists to attempt to degrade our national \n     infrastructure by any means available to them, including \n     sabotage and cyber warfare.\n       Congress has assigned to the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     statutory functions for response to terrorist attacks and \n     other emergencies and disasters, that are especially \n     challenging, particularly when compared with those of some \n     other executive branch agencies. The statutory functions \n     include the duty to provide medical services to military \n     personnel referred in time of war by the Department of \n     Defense; responsibilities in four emergency support \n     functions, as tasked under the Federal Response Plan by the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency under the Stafford Act; \n     and the role of providing care to members of the community \n     during emergencies on a humanitarian basis.\n       We can properly perform these responsibilities, however, \n     only in a way that ensures the effective continuity of VA's \n     primary mission of serving veterans.\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA or the Department) \n     has emerged from the events of the past few months with a \n     heightened commitment to our statutory roles as a key support \n     agency for disaster response and mitigation, including \n     response to the use of nuclear, chemical, or biological \n     weapons of mass destruction (WMD), as well as its traditional \n     Federal Response Plan roles. Since September 11, VA has \n     joined with other Federal agencies in greatly expanded inter-\n     agency work. The necessary time commitment will expand \n     further as the Homeland Security Council (HSC), Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Health and \n     Human Services (HHS), and Department of Defense (DoD) \n     programs become fully operational and expand, and VA is asked \n     to provide additional support.\n       In response, VA is reorganizing certain of its elements in \n     order to best meet its responsibility to protect veterans, \n     employees, and visitors to its facilities, to assure the \n     continuity of veterans' services, while at the same time \n     providing enhanced emergency preparedness and planning. These \n     responsibilities, which in recent months have become even \n     more imperative, belong to VA as a whole. They thus transcend \n     the Administrations and the staff offices. To help ensure the \n     Department as a whole meets these broad responsibilities, VA \n     needs a separate, and a separately accountable, coordinating \n     and policymaking entity. This reorganization creates a new \n     Office of Operations, Security & Preparedness (OSP) to carry \n     out Operations, Preparedness, Security and Law Enforcement \n     functions. VA's experiences during the last several months of \n     increased emergency management activities demonstrate that \n     OSP requirements are full-time activities for an Assistant \n     Secretary. In order to provide appropriate leadership and \n     accountability, the reorganization places OSP under a new \n     Assistant Secretary. Executive Branch requirements, as well \n     as the strategic and day-to-day requirements of OSP are \n     significant and require a full-time Assistant Secretary to \n     provide the necessary level of executive representation and \n     leadership and to meet time demands.\n       To support the establishment of this new organization, this \n     draft bill would amend section 308 of title 38, United States \n     Code, to increase the number of Assistant Secretaries from \n     six to seven and would add Operations, Preparedness, Security \n     and Law Enforcement functions to the functions and duties to \n     be assigned to the Assistant Secretaries.\n       The proposed OSP will enable the Department and its three \n     administrations--Veterans Health Administration (VHA), \n     Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery \n     Administration (NCA)--to operate more cohesively in this \n     new, uncertain environment, and will help assure \n     continuity of operations in the event of an emergency \n     situation. OSP will:\n       (a) Ensure that operational readiness and emergency \n     preparedness activities enhance VA's ability to continue its \n     ongoing services (Continuity of Operations);\n       (b) Coordinate and execute emergency preparedness and \n     crisis response activities both VA-wide and with other \n     Federal, State, local and relief agencies;\n       (c) Develop and maintain an effective working relationship \n     with the newly established US Office of Homeland Security and \n     reinforce existing relationships with the Department of \n     Defense (DOD), Federal Emergency Management Agency, \n     Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, Department of Justice, and other \n     agencies actively involved in continuity of government, \n     counter-terrorism and homeland defense;\n       (d) Ensure enforcement of the law and oversee the \n     protection of employees and veterans using VA facilities \n     while ensuring the physical security of VA's infrastructure;\n       (e) Evaluate preparedness programs and develop Department-\n     wide training programs that enhance VA's readiness and \n     exercises.\n       The creation of this new organization will shift \n     responsibility for emergency preparedness, continuity of \n     operations, continuity of government, law enforcement, \n     physical security, and personnel security programs from the \n     Office of the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and \n     Administration (HR) to OSP. The Office of Security & Law \n     Enforcement (S) will be transferred from HR to OSP. In \n     addition, all or part of the following functions and offices \n     will transfer from VHA's Emergency Management Strategic \n     Healthcare Group (EMSHG) to OSP: DOD contingency support, \n     National Disaster Medical System, and Federal Response Plan.\n       The reorganization establishing OSP would create a \n     standing, around-the-clock readiness operations capability to \n     monitor potential and ongoing situations of concern to the \n     Department and its administrators. It would create a more \n     resourced and focused approach to coordinating and executing \n     the Department's missions to respond as a key support agency \n     in national emergencies and to provide contingency support to \n     DOD in time of war.\n       This proposed organization would have the capability to \n     meet both ongoing and projected operations center \n     requirements, while providing sufficient personnel to address \n     Departmental planning and policy development needs, and to \n     conduct ongoing training and evaluation at the Departmental \n     level. In addition, OSP would help the Department address \n     growing inter-agency cooperation responsibilities, much of \n     which is required to support the Homeland Security Council.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program to the submission of this proposed legislation to the \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                      Anthony J. Principi.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2187. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish health care during a major \ndisaster or medical emergency, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today \nto highlight, and acknowledge in law, a mission that already exists in \nfact: VA's role in offering health care and support to individuals \naffected by disasters. I am pleased to be joined in offering this \nlegislation by my colleague on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator \nDaniel Akaka.\n  VA's first, and most familiar, three missions include caring for our \nNation's veterans, training future health care personnel, and fostering \nscientific and clinical research to improve future medical care. In \n1982, Congress assigned to VA a fourth mission: serving as the primary \nmedical back-up system to the Department of Defense during times of war \nor domestic emergencies. If necessary, VA estimates that it could make \nabout 3200 beds available immediately, and about 5500 beds within 72 \nhours, to care for injured troops.\n  VA has expanded this Fourth Mission to encompass a much greater share \nof the Federal responsibility for public health during crises beyond \ncaring for active duty military casualties. VA also serves as a \nsupporting agency in the Federal Response Plan for domestic disasters, \nas a cornerstone of the National Medical Disaster System, and by \nmanaging the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile. Through these programs, \nVA provides personnel, supplies and medications, facilities, and, if \nnecessary, direct patient care to communities whose resources have been \noverwhelmed by medical crises.\n  VA conducts large-scale disaster training exercises with its military \npartners, cooperates with other agencies to staff emergency medical \nteams during high-profile public events, and can deploy its group of \nexperts in radiological medicine anywhere in the United States within a \nday. VA's mental health care professionals offer expertise in post-\ntraumatic stress disorder counseling that is unparalleled anywhere in \nthe world.\n  VA has responded to every major domestic disaster of the last two \ndecades, including the Oklahoma City attack, and Hurricanes Andrew and \nFloyd, by sharing skilled medical staff and supplies with community \ncaregivers. Following catastrophic flooding in Houston last year, the \nlocal VA medical center remained the only area hospital with power, and \nits staff extended care to rescue workers and the public. On September \n11, VA physicians cared for at least 68 injured individuals in New \nYork, and VA coordinators identified more than half of the 20,000 beds \nthat would have been available for the care of victims in New York and \nVirginia through VA's community hospital partnerships. In the weeks \nfollowing the terrorist attacks, VA continued to provide skilled \nmedical specialists, including mental health professionals, to care for \nrescue workers and\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\nservicemembers in New York and at the Pentagon.\n  The legislation that we introduce today would confer no new \nresponsibilities or missions upon VA, but would recognize VA's already \nenormous contribution to public safety and emergency preparedness. As \nCongress continues to prepare for the threat of terrorism, it becomes \nincreasingly important to focus not only the public health community, \nbut those capable of providing medical care during mass casualty \nevents.\n  As the largest health care system in the nation, VA medical centers \ncan and will offer invaluable services during a public health care \nemergency, whether that emergency is terrorism or a natural disaster. \nWhen VA health care providers are called upon to care for disaster \nvictims, they serve not only as part of the Federal response to \nemergencies, but as part of the communities in which they live. This \nlegislation would extend the Congressional mandate calling upon VA to \nprovide care for active duty military personnel during a disaster to \nrecognize VA's contribution to general public safety during crises. I \nurge my colleagues in the Senate to join Senator Akaka and me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2187\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the \nlegislation offered by the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, \nto authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, existing emergency \npreparedness activities.\n  Currently, VA participates in the National Disaster Medical System, \nNDMS, and the Federal Response Plan through VA's Fourth Mission, \nmandated by Congress in 1982 to establish VA's role as the medical \nback-up to the military during conflicts. When VA has offered medical \ncare to the general public during every major U.S. disaster since \nHurricane Andrew, it has done so without the statutory authority to \ncare for non-veterans and non-active-duty military personnel. The VA \nEmergency Medical Care Act of 2002 would give this authority.\n  Already an active participant in disaster response and preparedness, \nVA partners with the Departments of Defense and Health and Human \nServices and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to form the \nNational Disaster Medical System, NDMS. The Act would codify and \nauthorize VA's existing efforts to provide health care to the general \npublic following activation of the NDMS.\n  VA is an emergency responder through the Federal Response Plan, a \nsigned agreement between 27 Federal agencies and the Red Cross that \ncoordinates Federal assistance when State and local resources are \noverwhelmed by a major disaster. VA serves as a support agency for four \nof the Emergency Support Functions outlined in the Federal Response \nPlan, including Mass Care and Health and Medical Services. VA is also \nthe principle provider of mental health services to disaster survivors.\n  I commend the work done by VA employees in responding to national \nemergencies. Because of their dedication and initiative, this \nlegislation does not create new VA programs nor authorize any \nadditional funds. I urge my colleagues to support the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Emergency Medical Care Act of 2002. This legislation \nis a first step in acknowledging the work that VA performs now to help \nall Americans respond to major disasters and medical crises.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 2188. A bill to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \namend its flammability standards for children's sleepwear under the \nFlammable Fabrics Act; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Burns, I \nam introducing the Children's Safe Sleepwear and Burn Prevention Act of \n2002. This legislation is designed to prevent sleepwear-related burn \ninjuries and reverse the 1997 decision of the Consumer\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\nProduct Safety Commission on children's sleepwear safety regulations.\n  In 1996, the CPSC made two principle changes to the sleepwear safety \nregulations. First, the Commission determined that because children age \n0-9 months were not mobile, they were not at risk from fire. \nConsequently, the revised regulations totally exempted sleepwear for \nyoung infants from any safety regulations. Second, the CPSC decided \nthat so-called ``tight-fitting'' sleepwear did not have to meet any \nfire safety requirements on the mistaken assumption that tight-fitting \ngarments do not burn.\n  As a result of the Commission's action, I heard from the Shriners \nHospital in Shreveport, Louisiana. The Shirners Hospitals for children \noperate four burn centers in the United States and treat over 20 \npercent of all serious pediatric burns in the country. The Shriners \nHospitals conducted a study comparing the incidence of sleepwear-\nrelated burn injuries during the period 1995-1996, before the \nregulations were changed, to the period 1998-1999 after the changes had \nbeen put in place.\n  The results of the Shriners study are sobering indeed. From 1995-\n1996, Shriners Hospitals treated 14 children for sleepwear-related burn \ninjuries. For the period 1998-1999, the number of children suffering \nfrom these sleepwear-related burns increased to 36, a 157 percent \nincrease!\n  The Shriners Hospitals also examined pediatric burn injuries where it \nwas impossible to determine the exact type of clothing involved or \nwhere the children was not technically wearing sleepwear but may have \nbeen using this clothing to sleep in. Over the relevant time period, \nthe number of children suffering clothing-related burn injuries \nincreased from 70 to 147, a 110 percent increase! Similarly, the number \nof pediatric burn injuries where it was impossible to determine \nanything about the clothing being worn because the clothing had been \ntotally burned away increased from 218 to 311, a 43 percent increase! \nAll told, the number of burned children treated at Shriners Hospitals \nincreased from 302 in 1995-1996 to 494 in 1998-1999, a 64 percent \nincrease!\n  The data regarding infants age 0-9 months is also revealing. In 1995-\n1996 Shriners Hospitals treated just five children for sleepwear-\nrelated burn injuries under nine months of age. For 1998-1999, the \ntotal number of infants suffering such injuries rose to nineteen, a 280 \npercent increase!\n\n  As a practical matter, almost all pediatric burn injuries involve \nignition of the clothing and some other materials. While the safety \nregulations cannot save a child trapped in a raging inferno, a 1972 HEW \nstudy concluded that children in fires whose clothing ignited had a \nfour to six-fold increase in mortality and morbidity compared to those \nwho clothing did not ignite. Take, for example, a situation where the \nhouse is on fire and a parent picks up her infants and flees the \nburning house. Sparks are flying, but the infants garments do not \nignite because they are flame resistent. If the sleepwear is not flame \nresistant, the sparks catch the clothing.\n  The Children's Safe Sleepwear and Burn Prevention Act directs the \nCommission to restore the safety protections that it removed in 1997. \nHenceforth, young infants will not have to face the dangers of using \nsleepwear that provides no protection whatsoever against fire. Tight-\nfitting or snug sleepwear will also have to meet these fire safety \nrequirements. There is, however, more that must be done to ensure a \nfire safety environment for our children.\n  Another problem regarding the children's sleepwear regulations must \nbe addressed. Under the CPSC's regulations, even the pre-1997 version, \nclothing that the manufacturer did not intend to be used as sleepwear \nwere not required to meet the flammability safety requirements. \nConsequently, a manufacturer could simply label an item as day wear as \nsleepwear and completely avoid the safety requirements.\n  This legislation eliminates this ``labeling loophole'' by creating a \nfunctional definition of sleepwear for children up to seven years of \nage. If, as a practical matter, clothing is used for sleepwear, then \nshould meet the safety requirements. The legislation provides some \nguidance as to what types of garments are used for sleepwear with some \nregularity such as togs, bunny suits and garments with cartoon \ncharacters that are particularly attractive to young children.\n  One might ask what alternatives are there to untreated cotton. \nAdvances in technology now provide such alternatives. Cotton can be \ntreated with a flame retardant that does not wash out because it is \nbonded to the cotton through a chemical process at the atomic level. \nThe treatment adds little to the cost of children's sleepwear.\n  The defense of our innocent children from the dangers of sleepwear \nrelated burn injuries should be a priority. If you have ever seen a \nchild severely burned by flaming sleepwear, you have some sense of the \nsuffering and horror that these injuries entail. We can make these \nhorrible burn injuries less frequent by enacting this important piece \nof legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Safe Sleepwear \n     and Burn Prevention Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO CHILDREN'S SLEEPWEAR FLAMMABILITY \n                   REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Consumer Product Safety Commission (in \n     this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') shall, with \n     respect to the Commission's flammability standards for \n     children's sleepwear sizes 0 through 14, promulgated pursuant \n     to the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191 et seq.; parts \n     1615 and 1616 of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations)--\n       (1) not enforce or enact a standard with respect to \n     children's sleepwear that--\n       (A) exempts--\n       (i) diapers and underwear (including disposable diapers and \n     underwear);\n       (ii) infant garments sizes 0 through 6X, infant garments \n     sizes 9 months or smaller, or other garments described in \n     part 1615.1(c) of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations; or\n       (iii) tight-fitting garments; or\n       (B) includes as a part of any definition of children's \n     sleepwear (or of any item of such sleepwear) a standard based \n     on the intent of the manufacturer or retailer; and\n       (2) provide a functional definition of children's sleepwear \n     for ages 0 through 7 years (encompassing, at a minimum, \n     infant and children's garment sizes 2 through 6X, as such \n     sizes are defined by the Department of Commerce Voluntary \n     Product Standard (previously identified as Commercial \n     Standard CS151-50 ``Body Measurements for the Sizing of \n     Apparel for Infants, Babies, Toddlers, and Children''), \n     including children's clothing used with some regularity as \n     sleepwear, such as--\n       (A) ``togs'';\n       (B) ``onesies'';\n       (C) body suits with snaps at the bottom for easy access to \n     a diaper;\n       (D) all-in-one ``bunny'' suits with enclosed feet; and\n       (E) any garments sized for children ages 0 through 7 years \n     with cartoon characters or symbols that the Commission finds \n     are particularly attractive to young children.\n       (b) Rulemaking.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Commission shall promulgate regulations with \n     respect to the flammability of children's sleepwear \n     consistent with the provisions of this Act.\n       (c) Effective Date.--Sleepwear manufactured or imported on \n     or before the effective date of the regulations promulgated \n     by the Commission under subsection (b) shall not be treated \n     as being in violation of the Flammable Fabrics Act or such \n     regulations if the sleepwear complied with the rules of the \n     Commission in effect at the time the sleepwear was \n     manufactured or imported.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Dayton, \n        and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2189. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to remedy certain \neffects of injurious steel imports by protecting benefits of steel \nindustry retirees and encouraging the strengthening of the American \nsteel industry; to the Committee on Finance.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the American steel industry \nwill not consolidate and will not survive without relief from their \nunique burden of substantial retiree health care costs. Failing to \nassist the American steel industry with its retiree health care costs \nputs our industry at a tremendous disadvantage as it competes in\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nthe world markets. If we are to have a competitive, viable industry, we \nmust not shirk our responsibility. In the case of steel in America, \nthat means three things: tariffs under Section 201, as is provided for \nunder our trade laws; legacy, retiree health, relief; and effective \nconsolidation of the steel industry.\n  Earlier this year, the President imposed limited and temporary steel \ntariffs under Section 201. Today, I introduce the Steel Industry \nConsolidation and Retiree Benefits Protection Act of 2002, the Steel \nLegacy bill. This bill provides strong incentives for consolidation in \nthe United States steel industry by supporting companies' retiree \nhealth care costs. This bill provides desperately needed medical care \nto retirees whose companies have been forced out of business by \nimports. This bill is critical to the preservation of the American \nsteel industry, and it is humane to those individuals who have paid a \nvery high price for our nation's free trade policies.\n  The American steel industry has been facing an unprecedented crisis \nsince 1997, when the Asian financial crisis disrupted global steel \ntrade and diverted much of the world's excess steel capacity to the \nU.S. market. Thirty-three U.S. steel companies, representing over 40 \npercent of domestic steelmaking capacity, have gone into bankruptcy \nsince 1999, including such venerable names as Bethlehem Steel and LTV. \nWheeling Pittsburgh Steel in my state is in the process of \nreorganizing. Many more steel companies have been forced into \nliquidation. Almost 50,000 steelmaking jobs have been lost in this \ncountry since the steel crisis began in 1998--losses that come on top \nof hundreds of thousands of steel job losses in the two preceding \ndecades.\n  The cause of this crisis in the industry is not that demand for steel \nhas suddenly collapsed or that the competitiveness of the American \nsteel industry has suddenly collapsed, but because foreign steelmakers \nhave enjoyed decades of government subsidies and protection. Those \nforeign subsidies have created massive global steel overcapacity, and \nthat foreign protection has ensured that most of the world's \novercapacity has been directed at the U.S. market, which has been the \nmost open major market in the world.\n  The crisis our steel industry currently faces could well mean the end \nof steelmaking in the United States. This would have grave consequences \nfor steel companies and steel workers, for the steel communities that \ndepend on them, and for our nation's industrial base and our national \ndefense. In recognition that this could not be allowed to happen, the \nPresident announced last month that he would impose temporary Section \n201 tariff measures on some steel imports. These measures will help \ngive the U.S. steel industry some breathing room to recover. I commend \nthe President for recognizing the importance of maintaining a domestic \nsteel manufacturing base and for taking these steps.\n  Still, I think it's essential to realize that the Section 201 \nmeasures are limited in their scope and duration: first, the tariffs \nrange from 8 percent to 30 percent, far less than the level recommended \nby two of the ITC Commissioners and the level that I and many others in \nthe steel industry had argued for. And these tariffs are lowered \ndramatically each year, and stop after only three years. The tariffs do \nnot apply to all steel products. Because of this, foreign steel \ncompanies will be able to engage in circumvention measures to get \naround the tariffs, as they have with antidumping measures. Under the \n201 relief, tariffs were imposed on some grades of steel, others were \nexempted altogether, numerous exemptions for specific steel products \nhave been issued, and for the critical category of slab, a tariff rate \nquota has been imposed that is unlikely to have any positive effect \nwhatsoever. The tariffs are not being applied across the board to all \nforeign steel producers; the relief exempts all steel from developing \ncountries and from NAFTA members, who between them represent a \nsignificant portion, over a third, of overall U.S. steel imports.\n  We knew from the beginning of the 201 process that even in the best \nof circumstances, it was clear that Section 201 tariffs were going to \nprovide only part of the solution to help the domestic steel industry \nrespond to this crisis. But the Section 201 remedy imposed, with its \nexclusions and exemptions and declining tariffs, makes the need for \nadditional measures even more compelling.\n  Section 201 will slow the tide of imports. But it will not resolve \nthe other critical issues that will determine whether America's \nintegrated steelmaking capacity survives. America's integrated \nsteelmakers face massive ``legacy costs'' for retiree health and \npension benefits, stemming from the dramatic reduction in the American \nsteel industry's active workforce over the past two decades, which in \nturn results from successive Administrations' inability to negotiate an \nagreement for foreign governments to stop subsidizing their \nsteelmakers. These legacy costs both hurt American steel's \ninternational competitiveness and serve as a liability that has \nprevented the consolidation of the fragmented domestic steel industry. \nIndustry consolidation is another issue that must be addressed: with \nforeign steelmakers merging to create a new level of top tier \nsteelmakers, American steelmakers risk being permanently consigned to \nthe second rank, with sub-scale facilities and insufficient revenues to \nfund the necessary investment in research and technology. Finally, we \nmust take measures to mitigate the human cost of this steel crisis, \nparticularly the cost to retirees who worked long, hard years to earn \nhealth and pension benefits for themselves and their families, but now \nrisk seeing all that taken away because the company that pays those \nbenefits is threatened by unfair foreign trade practices.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Steel Industry Retiree Benefits \nProtection Act of 2002, addresses the toughest of these problems. It \nguarantees the health care coverage and a very limited life insurance \nbenefit for steel industry retirees whose employer is acquired by \nanother steelmaker or whose employer is forced to shut down because no \nother steelmaker will acquire it. This will ensure that in steel \ncommunities throughout the nation, no retirees will lose their critical \nhealth benefits simply because of a crisis in the global steel industry \nthat our government failed to avert. Equally important, this bill will \naddress retiree legacy costs in a way that will enhance our steel \nindustry's competitiveness, by clearing the way for the industry \nconsolidation that is necessary and inevitable if the American steel \nindustry is to survive.\n  The mechanics of the bill are fairly simple. A Federal trust fund \nwill be established that will assume the retirees' health care and life \ninsurance costs for steel, iron ore, and coke producers, and those who \ntransport steel mill products for steelmaking operations, that are \nacquired by another company; that are in bankruptcy and attempted \nunsuccessfully to be acquired by another company, and thus have been \nclosed, or are in imminent danger of closing, or have been unable to be \nacquired for at least two years; that are in bankruptcy and sell a \nsignificant steelmaking operation to another company; or, finally, in \norder to ensure that the assumption of legacy costs does not distort \ncompetition within the domestic steel industry, if a significant \nportion of the entire industry's legacy costs have been assumed by the \nFederal trust fund, all steel industry retirees and beneficiaries would \nbe eligible to be covered by the program.\n  The money for the Fund to pay for these legacy costs will come from \nthe following: steel tariff revenues; an acquired steelmaker's retiree \nhealth care trust fund assets; payments for 10 years by the qualified \nsteel company of $5 per ton of steelmaking capacity, subject to the \nbill's provisions; retiree premiums; and, and appropriated funds if \nnecessary.\n  In order to simplify the management of the program, retiree health \nbenefits assumed by the Fund will be limited to Federal Blue Cross/Blue \nShield health benefits, a fair and reasonable standard of health \ncoverage. Life insurance will be limited to a one-time payment of \n$5,000 dollars. The program will be administered by the Secretary of \nCommerce and by Trustees who are designated by both management and \nlabor.\n  This bill is supported by both the integrated steelmakers and by the \nsteel unions, who understand what it will take to save the American \nsteel industry. They know that legacy costs have been the major barrier \nto consolidation\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\nof the American steel market and that it is critical that we resolve \nthat problem if we are to preserve retiree health benefits and an \nintegrated domestic steel industry. I am introducing this legislation \nwith my partner as Co-Chair of the Senate Steel Caucus, Senator \nSpecter. We have a history of working together on issues that are vital \nto the core industries in our states and the workers who have helped \nfuel and build this nation. I am pleased that Senators Wellstone, \nDurbin, Mikulski, Sarbanes,  and Dayton, and the distinguished Senate \nMajority Leader, who have long been champions of retirees and workers \nhealth care issues, join me today as cosponsors. We have also worked in \nclose consultation with our colleagues on the House side, especially \nmembers of the House Steel Caucus, who share our concern that these \ncritical legacy cost issues be addressed.\n  But, make no mistake, this steel legacy legislation will not happen \nwithout the active involvement of the President. This bill is fair, it \nis pro-competition, and there is a broad consensus that legacy cost \nlegislation like this is absolutely necessary if we are to preserve \nintegrated steelmaking in the United States, as well as the communities \nand businesses that depend on those facilities. But realistically, a \nprogram like this is only going to be enacted with the strong support \nand active engagement of the President.\n  The President's announcement of his decision on Section 201 tariffs \nlast month was an encouraging sign that the President was committed to \nthe preservation of the American steel industry, and his recognition \nthat, if equipped with the right tools and competing in a fair market, \nthe domestic steel industry can regain its former role as the world's \nleader. I surely hope so. But I know that without President Bush's \nsupport for a legacy cost bill, the Section 201 tariffs he announced \nlast month will not be enough, and we will witness the erosion of a \nvital national asset, the American steel industry.\n  I appeal to the President to maintain his personal interest in the \nwell-being of our steel industry. It is vital to our nation's economy \nand to our defense capability. I encourage the President to lead on \nthis issue because surely, in these times, without his support and \nquick involvement, we will not be able to get a bill through this \nCongress. I hope the Administration will work with us here in the \nSenate to pass a legacy cost bill that will ensure fairness for \nAmerica's retired steelworkers and a competitive future for America's \nintegrated steel industry. We need legacy cost legislation like that \noutlined in the bill I am submitting today, if we are to preserve the \nU.S. steel industry. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2189\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Steel \n     Industry Consolidation and Retiree Benefits Protection Act of \n     2002''.\n       (b) Congressional Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) The United States Department of Commerce has documented \n     that American steelworkers and their employers have been \n     forced over the last 30 years to compete in a global steel \n     market in which foreign governments have engaged in market \n     distorting practices that to this day sustain enormous \n     overcapacity in world steel supplies.\n       (B) The United States International Trade Commission, in \n     its recent investigation of steel imports to the United \n     States under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, has \n     concluded that surges of imported steel since the Asian \n     crisis of 1997 have caused serious injury to American \n     producers of most steel products.\n       (C) Since 1997, 32 American steel companies have been \n     forced to seek bankruptcy protection, over 45,000 \n     steelworkers have lost their jobs, and over 100,000 steel \n     retirees have suffered a complete cutoff of vital medical and \n     life insurance benefits.\n       (D) Many steel industry retirees were forced into \n     retirement as a result of the restructurings of the 1980's \n     and 1990's, and then, as a second blow, recently lost their \n     retiree medical insurance.\n       (E) Recent steel imports have pushed steel prices to such \n     record lows that surviving American steelmakers face imminent \n     financial collapse, and these firms employ over 185,000 \n     workers in family-supporting jobs and provide crucial medical \n     coverage to hundreds of thousands of retirees and \n     beneficiaries.\n       (F) As American steel companies continue to weaken or fail, \n     a very different trend is underway in other countries where \n     governments shoulder a substantial portion of retirement \n     costs and foreign steelmakers are now merging into companies \n     of unprecedented size and market influence.\n       (G) If the American steel industry is to survive and \n     compete, it must transform itself from a group of relatively \n     small producers into a consolidated market force.\n       (H) For many American steel companies, the ability to \n     consolidate is undermined by the burden of retiree health and \n     life insurance obligations.\n       (2) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure \n     that--\n       (A) retired steelworkers receive medical and life insurance \n     coverage, and\n       (B) the American steel industry can continue to provide \n     livelihoods to tens of thousands of American workers, their \n     families, and communities through the receipt of assistance \n     in consolidating its position in world steel markets.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr President, I have sought recognition at this \ntime to comment briefly on legislation that I am pleased to cosponsor \nwith my colleague, Senator Rockefeller. That legislation, the ``Steel \nIndustry Retiree Benefits Protection Act of 2002,'' would set the \nNation on a path of assuring the retirement health care benefits of the \nNation's retired steelworkers and their dependants, and the survival of \na domestic integrated steel industry. I crafted this bill jointly with \nSenator Rockefeller with extensive consultation by the integrated steel \nindustry and representatives of the United Steelworkers of America. I \nam pleased to note that labor and management have joined in a common \neffort to resolve the near-intractable problems that face the industry \ntoday, and I thank them for that spirit of cooperation and compromise.\n  The reasons for this legislation are succinctly stated in the \nfindings set forth in the preamble of the bill. The domestic steel \nindustry has been forced to compete over the last 30 years in an \ninternational marketplace in which foreign governments have subsidized \nboth domestic production and employee healthcare costs and, \nsimultaneously, stimulated the creation and maintenance of excess world \nsteelmaking capacity. During the 1980's and 1990's, the steel industry \nadapted, but literally hundreds of thousands of steel workers were \nforced into early retirement as the industry streamlined productions \nmethods. Since 1997, the situation has worsened, due to the unfair \npractices of overseas producers and governments and a resultant glut of \nforeign imports, to the point that 32 American steel companies have had \nto resort to bankruptcy protection, causing 45,000 steelworkers to lose \ntheir jobs and over 100,000 steel industry retirees to lose vital \nmedical insurance benefits. Record-low steel prices place remaining \nsteel producers, and their workers and retirees, in an increasingly \nuntenable position.\n  A clear consensus now exists that the only way a domestic integrated \nsteel industry can survive is through consolidation. It is true that \nthe ranks of U.S. integrated producers have been decimated; one need \nonly drive through Pennsylvania to see ample evidence of that. But a \ndomestic industry does indeed survive. It will continue to survive only \nif there is further consolidation and the emergence of a relatively few \ndomestic companies with the muscle to compete in a global marketplace \nwith subsidized foreign behemoths. But there is a significant \nimpediment to such consolidation: the so-called ``legacy costs'' of \ndomestic producers which might otherwise be acquired and consolidated \ninto larger, more efficient U.S. operations.\n  To summarize, a relatively healthy domestic steel producer might find \nthe acquisition, and the continued operation, of a weaker steel \ncompany's manufacturing operations to be quite attractive but for one \nmajor problem: such operations typically are owned by companies which \nare weighed down by the health care costs of prior generations of \nretirees, retirees who are relatively young due to the premature \nwithdrawal of workers from the rolls due to downsizing in the 1980's \nand 1990's. Potential acquirers of such assets have ``legacy costs'' of \ntheir own to deal with; they cannot afford to assume those of their \nformer competitors, a result that would be unavoidable were they to \nsimply purchase and consolidate the assets of former competitors. If we \nwant consolidation to happen, and it is unquestionably in the Nation's \nself-interest that it happen; few would dispute that the common defense \nrequires a viable domestic steel industry, potential acquirers of these \nassets must gain relief from the ``legacy cost'' obligations that would \notherwise run with the acquired assets.\n  My colleagues might ask: if an acquiring steel company is relieved of \nthese obligations, who would take them on? The answer is this: a \nFederally-sponsored trust fund, financed with steel tariff receipts; \nfunds previously placed in trust by acquired companies for retiree \nhealth and life insurance benefits; fees to be paid by acquiring \ncompanies; and, yes, as necessary to cover shortfalls, appropriations. \nTo those who say the public cannot take on these obligations, I offer \nthe following logic: when steel producers go under, as they will if we \ndo not act, the public may very much face exposure to these obligations \nvia the Medicare and Medicaid programs; taking them on before the \ncompanies go under will at least assure that the defense-critical steel \nindustry survives. It is an unpleasant choice we face, but it is one \nwhich we must face: we may either assume ``legacy cost'' obligations \nnow and save a vital industry; or we can wait and watch a vital \nindustry die and face up to ``legacy costs'' later.\n  I strongly appeal to my colleagues in the Senate to seriously \nconsider this Hobson's choice. If they do, I trust they will come to \nthe same conclusion that I have: we must save this industry by clearing \nthe way for the consolidation that will be necessary to compete in the \ninternational market of the future. And we must protect those who have \nlost, or may yet lose, their health care benefits due to unfair \ncompetition from abroad. The steelworkers of America, many from the \n``Greatest Generation'' and from my home, Pennsylvania, built the \nNation in the 20th Century. They made the United States the world's \nonly superpower. We need to assure that their post-retirement years are \nsecure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Chafee):\n  S. 2190. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to provide employees \nwith greater control over assets in their pension accounts by providing \nthem with better information about investment of the assets, new \ndiversification rights, and new limitations on pension pla blackouts, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today with a great deal of \npride to introduce the Senate's first bipartisan\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\npension reform bill since Enron's downfall ruined the lives of \nthousands of workers and their families. I am introducing this bill \nwith Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, who has worked closely with me to \ndevelop a much-needed proposal that will greatly help our nation's \nworkers to achieve greater pension security and receive better \ninvestment information and advice. Our bill is called the ``Worker \nInvestment and Retirement Education Act of 2002,'' or the WIRE Act. \nSenator Snowe and I are pleased that Senator Feinstein and Chafee have \njoined with us as original cosponsors.\n  As you know, Enron's bankruptcy, which caused thousands to lose their \nretirement savings, since their pensions were invested heavily in Enron \nstock, has prompted many members of Congress in both parties to \nintroduce pension-related legislation. President Bush has also \nsuggested several reforms. Many of these proposals share some common \nelements, while others contain measures that are objectionable to one \nside or the other. Senator Snowe and I share the view that worker \nretirement protection is much too important to become another partisan \nissue, where the upcoming elections cloud our judgment and prevent us \nfrom passing much-needed legislation. We can, and should, pass critical \npension reform this year that helps American workers fee secure about \ntheir retirement savings. In my view, the playing field has been tilted \nagainst workers for far too long, and it is unfortunate that it takes a \ntravesty like Enron to make those of us in Congress act in their \ninterests.\n  Of course, the pension issue is one that falls in the jurisdiction of \ntwo Senate committees. I strongly support Senator Kennedy's bill, which \nrecently passed out of the HELP committee here in the Senate. Soon, \nhowever, the Senate Finance Committee will also consider pension \nreform. Given that the history of that Committee is one in which the \nbest bills are often bipartisan, I wanted to work with Senator Snowe to \ndevelop a pro-worker bill for the Finance Committee that can be \ncombined with Senator Kennedy's bill later on.\n  The House of Representatives has also followed such a two-committee \napproach, although I have some significant reservations that the final \nbill that passed last week does not do enough for workers. I hope to \nwork within the Finance Committee and with Senator Kennedy to develop a \nbetter bill here in the Senate, so we can pass legislation this year \nthat the President will sign. Our goal should be to pass a bill that \nreceives a two-thirds vote in both chambers not because we think \nPresident Bush will veto it, but because we want to signal to the \ncountry that partisan politics can be pushed aside when the true \ninterests of hard-working Americans are at stake.\n  Despite all of the news in recent months about corporate greed and \nexcess, recent polls show that nearly two-thirds of the public believes \nthat the most important issue with Enron's collapse is the loss of jobs \nand savings. With 38 million people controlling nearly $1.7 trillion in \n401(k) plan assets, and with nearly 40 percent of large-plan assets \ntied up in company stock, much of which cannot be sold until workers \nreach a certain age, it is clear that the playing field needs to be \ntilted back towards workers. Our bill does just that, and because it is \na complete approach, including all types of so-called ``defined \ncontribution'' plans, as opposed to just some plans, it does so without \nopening any major new loopholes that would allow workers to be \nfurther exploited.\n\n  The first thing workers need out of a pension reform bill is better \ninformation, because for millions of Americans, their retirement \nsavings is their only true asset other than their homes. Under our \nbill, all covered workers would be given basic, unbiased information on \nthe basics of investing, as well as personalized information from their \nemployers to help them know if they are adequately preparing for their \nretirement years. This additional information will make a huge \ndifference to millions of workers who currently have no knowledge about \nthe basics of investing, or if they are saving enough to live \ncomfortably in retirement.\n  Next, since current law prevents most workers from receiving any \nsound guidance about financial planning, our bill includes the text of \nS. 1677, the Bingaman-Collins investment advice bill. Under this bill, \nmillions more workers will benefit from professional, independent \ninvestment advice paid for by their employers. Workers will be able to \nselect appropriate investments and better plan for their retirements \nwithout the creation of new conflicts of interest.\n  Like other bills, our bill addresses the issue of blackout periods, \nthose times when plan participants are prevented from making changes to \ntheir asset allocations. Senator Snowe and I believe that companies \nshould provide adequate notice before any blackout period, our bill \nrequires 30 days' notice, and inform workers of its expected length. In \naddition, blackouts should generally be limited to 30 days for plans \nthat are heavily invested in company stock. Exemptions could be granted \nto small businesses or companies in unusual circumstances, such as a \nmerger. This latter rule is one that distinguishes our bill from many \nof the others. But it seems common-sense to use that plans with more \nvolatile assets, such as plans heavily invested in company stock, \nshould be forced to end blackout periods as quickly as possible in \norder to minimize market risk for the workers.\n  Moreover, during blackout periods, management should be prohibited \nfrom selling large blocks of stock on the open market. We command \nPresident Bush for suggesting this additional protection for rank-and-\nfile employees, and we will work with him to help it become law.\n  But most important, workers want and deserve a greater say in where \ntheir money is invested. Diversification is a key principle in any \nbalanced investment strategy. Workers should be empowered with the \nability to direct where their retirement savings are invested.\n  While the shift to more broad-based stock ownership is generally a \npositive trend in our society, employees should no longer be forced to \nbuy company stock with their own contributions. In addition, if workers \nchoose to buy company stock with their own funds, they should be able \nto diversify these contributions whenever they wish. It's their money, \nafter all, and they should never be forced to relinquish control of it.\n  For employer contributions to retirement plans, workers should be \nallowed to begin diversifying these contributions once they are vested \nin the plan. Our bill accomplishes that goal while avoiding new \nloopholes by applying different diversification rules based on the type \nof contribution, worker payroll deduction, employer matching \ncontribution, or employer nonmatching contribution, rather than the \ntype of plan. We want to make sure that the situation with Enron never \nhappens again, and the protections in our bill will accomplish that \ngoal.\n  In our view, Congress should also provide special diversification \nrights for older workers, because the closer you are to retirement, the \nmore you have to lose should stock prices fall. Therefore, under our \nbill, once a worker turns 55, he or she would be permitted to \ncompletely diversify their retirement assets, with no restrictions. \nThis will be the case regardless of tenure with the firm, and \nregardless of the type of plan. Companies must notify workers of this \nright to diversify when the worker has reached 55 years of age, thereby \ngiving older workers the additional layer of protection they deserve \nafter a lifetime of work and saving.\n  I want to say a word about ESOPs. Employee stock ownership plans are \nimportant in that they give rank-and-file employees an ownership stake \nin their firms, which is largely a good thing. We should continue to \nencourage firms, both public and private, to include their workers in \ntheir success. Many public companies are converting parts of their \n401(k)s to ESOPs to take advantage of a feature in the tax code that \nallows them to deduct dividends paid on the shares in the plan. \nHowever, these conversions to so-called KSOPs have downsides, in that \nthese plans are generally more restrictive than 401(k)s when employee \ndiversification right are concerned.\n  As a result, Congress must include both KSOPs and ESOPs in any new \ndiversification rules, to the extent that the plans are at public \ncompanies. If we fail to include them, or include one but\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\nnot the other, we would open a new loophole while limiting workers \nrights. But again, since broader employee ownership is a generally \npositive development, we need to help workers without killing publicly-\ntraded ESOPs. Our bill does so. Plus, another unique feature of the \nKerry-Snowe bill is that for all workers under age 55 who choose to \ndiversify some of their KSOP or ESOP shares, the firm will still be \nallowed to deduct for tax purposes the dividends that would have been \npaid on those shares, for the year of the sale and the following two \nyears. This provision will smooth the transition to a more worker-\nfriendly system.\n  Finally, the government should create an Office of Pension \nParticipant Advocacy, similar to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, where \nboth unionized and non-unionized workers can turn to voice their \nconcerns about pension policy. The Pension Participant Advocate would \nissue an annual report to Congress recommending changes to the pension \nlaws. This idea is one that appears in several bills before Congress, \nand it is long overdue.\n  All of these proposals will protect our workers, and more \nimportantly, they will do so without prompting reductions in benefits. \nBusinesses could still contribute stock to retirement plans. Workers \nwill be empowered to diversify their assets, but they would not face \nany new rules that limit their own choices, such as a hard cap on the \namount of a single stock they could own. Our bipartisan approach will \nensure that workers are better off in the long run, and that's the \noutcome we all want.\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Kerry \nin introducing the Worker Investment and Retirement Education, or WIRE, \nAct of 2002. The WIRE Act seeks to empower workers by giving them \ncontrol over all of the assets in their retirement accounts and ensures \nthat, in addition to having the ability to take command of assets, they \nhave the information they need to make sound and informed choices.\n  While the need for pension reform was highlighted by the recent \ncollapse and bankruptcy of Enron, a review of pension regulations is \ncritical for all of the approximate 48 million workers nationwide who \nparticipate in a defined contribution retirement plan.\n  And, as Congress sets out to review existing pension laws, we must \nrecognize that there has been a significant shift in Americans' \nretirement savings vehicles over the past several years. In fact, use \nof what we think of as the typical ``pension'', or defined benefit \nplan, has fallen from one-third of all plans to one-tenth in 20 years. \nAnd, the actual number of defined benefit plans has fallen each year \nsince 1986. Although they still account for almost 45 percent of all \nemployer-sponsored retirement plan participants, that figure was much \nhigher, at 74 percent, just 20 years ago.\n  This shift away from defined benefit plans has resulted in the \nexplosion of participation in defined contribution plans, giving \nindividuals the opportunity to make investment decisions according to \ntheir own needs and plans for the future. However, with this ability \ncomes added responsibility and, depending on the investment choice, \ngreater risk. And it is this risk that was so clearly personified by \nthe experience of Enron employees.\n  On Enron's 40,000 employees, almost 21,000 were participating in the \nEnron Savings Plan, the 401(k) plan. These loyal employees heavily \ninvested in Enron, only to be hit by the one-two punch of losing their \njobs and losing their life savings, with the retirement savings losses \namounting to over $1 billion. It is their experience that has led us to \nwrite the legislation we are introducing today.\n  While it is critical that the Congress ensure that such a massive \nloss of retirement savings never reoccurs, it is also vital that we \nconsider reforms that empower employees, and do not discourage \nemployers from contributing to their employees' retirement plans. As we \nset out to draft the WIRE Act we sought first and foremost to do no \nharm to the private pension system.\n  The WIRE Act, in seeking to increase employees' access to information \nand ensure that employees have the knowledge necessary to make sound \ninvestment decisions, requires that individual workers receive annual \nstatements regarding the assets in their accounts. In addition, our \nlegislation directs the Departments of Labor and the Treasury to \nproduce annually a document for all employees giving them basic \nguidelines for retirement investing. This assures that employees \nreceive fundamental investment information from an independent \nauthority.\n  Additionally, the WIRE Act incorporates the language of the \nIndependent Investment Advice Act of 2001, clarifying the fiduciary \nrules for plan sponsors who offer access to investment advice by \nproviding companies with a safe harbor from liability if they provide \nqualified, independent investment advice for their workers.\n\n  Just as it is critical that we provide access to the information \nnecessary to make informed decisions, it is essential that we increase \nemployees' diversification rights without inhibiting an employee's \nability to invest in their company.\n  And, certainly a review of the investment decisions of employees \nacross the country tells us that the decision of Enron employees to \ninvest their retirements heavily in Enron stock is not unique. In fact, \nthe employees of many of America's leading companies, our top brand \nnames, have chosen similarly to invest more than half of their \nretirement plan assets in company stock, Procter and Gamble, 94.7 \npercent, Sherwin-Williams, 91.6 percent, Pfizer, 88.5 percent, \nMcDonald's, 74.3 percent, the list goes on and on.\n  And so where does that leave us? How does Congress balance an \nindividual's right to make their own investment decisions, with trying \nto make sure that no other class of employees suffer as significant a \nloss as that experienced by Enron employees?\n  The WIRE Act proposes that the answer to these questions lies in the \nability of employees to access and diversify company stock. Therefore, \nwe create specialized diversification rights that are dependent upon \nthe manner in which the stock was added to the employee's account.\n  For instance, for voluntary purchases of company stock by employees, \nworkers should be able to diversify those shares at any time, after \nall, it is their own money. For employer-matching contributions made in \nthe form of company stock, half of those shares can be diversified \nafter three years of service, and one hundred percent can be \ndiversified after five years of service.\n  Importantly, as our intent is to first do no harm to the current \nemployer-sponsored pension system, the WIRE Act attempts to mitigate \nany potential loss of tax incentives enjoyed by employers for making \ncontributions in the form of company stock when that stock is \ndiversified. We do this by allowing employers to continue to deduct the \ndividends that would have been paid on employee held company stock for \nthe remainder of that calendar year and for two additional years. This \nprovision, which is unique to the WIRE Act, would ensure that the \ndiversification rights given to employees does not have the unfortunate \neffect of reducing employer contributions to pension plans--which would \nbe harmful to both the employees and the employers.\n  The bill we introduce today aims to do nothing to limit personal \nchoice, which is the cornerstone of American beliefs, but instead \nempower investors with the knowledge and ability to make some of the \nmost fundamental financial decision a person can make. However, as we \nbegin to consider how best to empower and educate employees, it is just \nas essential that we do not create any disincentives for employers to \nstop participating in their employees' retirement security. Employers \nplay a critical role in the retirement planning of their employees and \nit is critical that we encourage this role to continue.\n  Retirement is part of the American dream, and to that end we must do \nwhatever we can to ensure that this dream is achievable for everyone. I \nlook forward to working with the other members of the Finance \nCommittee, and the Senate, to consider addressing the need for pension \nreform.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2850-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         SENATE RESOLUTION 244--ELIMINATING SECRET SENATE HOLDS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S. Res. 244\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIMINATING SECRET SENATE HOLDS.\n\n       Rule VII of the Standing Rules of the Senate is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``7. A Senator who provides notice to party leadership of \n     his or her intention to object to proceeding to a motion or \n     matter shall disclose the notice of objection (or hold) in \n     the Congressional Record in a section reserved for such \n     notices not later than 2 session days after the date of the \n     notice.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am submitting, along with my \ncolleague Senator Wyden, a Senate resolution to amend the Senate rules \nto eliminate secret holds.\n  I know Senators are familiar with the practice of placing holds on \nmatters to come before the Senate.\n  Holds derive from the rules and traditions of the Senate.\n  In order for the Senate to run smoothly, objections to unanimous \nconsent agreements must be avoided.\n  Essentially, a hold is a notice by a Senator to his or her party \nleader of an intention to object to bringing a bill or nomination to \nthe floor for consideration.\n  This effectively prevents the Senate leadership from attempting to \nbring the matter before the Senate.\n  A Senator might place a hold on a piece of legislation or a \nnomination because of legitimate concerns about that legislation or \nnomination.\n  However, there is no legitimate reason why a Senator placing a hold \non a matter should remain anonymous.\n  I believe in the principle of open government.\n  Lack of transparency in the public policy process leads to cynicism \nand distrust of public officials.\n  I would maintain that the use of secret holds damages public \nconfidence in the institution of the Senate.\n  It has been my policy, and the policy of Senator Wyden as well, to \ndisclose in the Congressional Record any hold that I place on any \nmatter in the Senate along with my reasons for doing so.\n  As a practical matter, other Members of the Senate need to be made \naware of an individual Senator's concerns.\n  How else can those concerns be addressed?\n  As a matter of principle, the American people need to be made aware \nof any action that prevents a matter from being considered by their \nelected Senators.\n  Senator Wyden and I have worked twice to get a similar ban on secret \nholds included in legislation passed by the Senate.\n  But, both times it was removed in conference.\n  Then, at the beginning of the 106th Congress, Senate Leaders Lott and \nDaschle circulated a letter informing Senators of a new policy \nregarding the use of holds.\n  The Lott/Daschle letter stated,\n\n       . . . all members wishing to place a hold on any \n     legislation or executive calendar business shall notify the \n     sponsor of the legislation and the committee of jurisdiction \n     of their concerns.\n\n  This agreement was billed as marking the end of secret holds in the \nSenate and I took the agreement at face value.\n  Unfortunately, this policy has not been followed consistently.\n  Secret holds have continued to appear in the Senate.\n  For example, last November, it became apparent that an anonymous hold \nhad been placed on a bill, S. 739, sponsored by Senator Wellstone.\n  This bill had been reported by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  However, neither Senator Wellstone nor Senator Rockefeller, as \nchairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, were ever informed as \nto which Senator or Senators had placed the hold.\n  The time has come to end this distasteful practice for good.\n  This resolution that Senator Wyden and I are submitting would do just \nthat.\n  It would add a section to the Senate rules requiring that Senators \nmake public any hold placed on a matter within two session days of \nnotifying his or her party leadership.\n  This change will lead to more open dialogue and more constructive \ndebate in the Senate.\n  Ending secret holds will make the workings of the Senate more \ntransparent.\n  It will reduce secrecy and public cynicism along with it.\n  This reform will improve the institutional reputation of the Senate \nand I would urge my colleagues to support the Grassley-Wyden \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2850-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2850-S2851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 245--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 5 THROUGH MAY 11, \n       2002, AS ``NATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH WEEK''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Feingold) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 245\n\n       Whereas every year, more than 6,000 people die from job-\n     related injuries and millions more suffer occupational \n     injuries or illnesses;\n       Whereas every day, millions of people go to and return home \n     from work safely due, in part, to the efforts of many unsung \n     heroes--the occupational safety, health, and environmental \n     professionals who work day in and day out identifying hazards \n     and implementing safety advances in all industries and at all \n     workplaces, thereby reducing workplace fatalities and \n     injuries;\n       Whereas these safety professionals work to prevent \n     accidents, injuries, and occupational diseases, create safer \n     work and leisure environments, and develop safer products;\n       Whereas the more than 30,000 members of the 90-year-old \n     nonprofit American Society of Safety Engineers, based in Des \n     Plaines, Illinois, are safety professionals committed to \n     protecting people, property, and the environment globally;\n       Whereas the American Society of Safety Engineers, in \n     partnership with the Canadian Society of Safety Engineers, \n     has designated May 5 through May 11, 2002, as North American \n     Occupational Safety and Health Week (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``NAOSH week'');\n       Whereas the purposes of NAOSH week are to increase \n     understanding of the benefits of investing in occupational \n     safety and health, to raise the awareness of the role and \n     contribution of safety, health, and environmental \n     professionals, and to reduce workplace injuries and illnesses \n     by increasing awareness and implementation of safety and \n     health programs;\n       Whereas during NAOSH week the focus will be on hazardous \n     materials--what they are, emergency response information, the \n     skills and training necessary to handle and transport \n     hazardous materials, relevant laws, personal protection \n     equipment, and hazardous materials in the home;\n       Whereas over 800,000 hazardous materials are shipped every \n     day in the United States, and over 3,100,000,000 tons are \n     shipped annually; and\n       Whereas the continued threat of terrorism and the potential \n     use of hazardous materials make it vital for Americans to \n     have information on these materials: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 5 through May 11, 2002, as \n     ``National Occupational Safety and Health Week'';\n       (2) commends safety professionals for their ongoing \n     commitment to protecting people, property, and the \n     environment;\n       (3) encourages all industries, organizations, community \n     leaders, employers, and employees to support educational \n     activities aimed at increasing awareness of the importance of \n     preventing illness, injury, and death in the workplace; and\n       (4) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Occupational Safety and Health Week'' with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, One of the Senate's most popular \nprocedures cannot be found anywhere in the United States Constitution \nor in the Senate Rules. It is one of the most powerful weapons that any \nSenator can wield in this body. And it is even more potent when it is \ninvisible. The procedure is popularly known as the ``hold.''\n  The ``hold'' in the Senate is a lot like the seventh inning stretch \nin baseball: there is no official rule or regulation that talks about \nit, but it is has been observed for so long that it has become a \ntradition.\n  The resolution that Senator Grassley and submit today does not in any \nway limit the privilege of any Senator to place a ``hold'' on a measure \nor matter. Our resolution targets the stealth cousin of the ``hold,'' \nknown as the ``secret hold.'' It is the anonymous hold that is so \nodious to the basic premise of our democratic system: that the exercise \nof power always should be accompanied by public accountability.\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\nOur resolution would bring the anonymous hold out of the shadows of the \nSenate.\n  Senator Grassley and I have championed this idea in a bipartisan \nmanner for six years now. In 1997 and again in 1998, the United States \nSenate voted unanimously in favor of our amendments to require that a \nnotice of intent to object be published in the Congressional Record \nwithin 48 hours. The amendments, however, never survived conference.\n  So we took our case directly to the leadership, and to their credit, \nTom Daschle and Trent Lott agreed it was time to make a change. They \nrecognized the significant need for more openness in the way the United \nStates Senate conducts its business so Tom Daschle and Trent Lott sent \na joint letter in February 1999 to all Senators setting forth a policy \nrequiring ``all Senators wishing to place a hold on any legislation or \nexecutive calender business [to] notify the sponsor of the legislation \nand the committee of jurisdiction of their concerns.'' The letter said \nthat ``written notification should be provided to the respective Leader \nstating their intentions regarding the bill or nomination,'' and that \n``holds placed on items by a member of a personal or committee staff \nwill not be honored unless accompanied by a written notification from \nthe objecting Senator by the end of the following business day.''\n  At first, this action by the Leaders seemed to make a real \ndifference. Many Senators were more open about their holds, and staff \ncould no longer slap a hold on a bill with a quick phone call. But \nafter six to eight months, the Senate began to slip back towards the \nold ways. Abuses of the ``holds'' policy began to proliferate, staff-\ninitiated holds-by-phone began anew, and it wasn't too long before \nlegislative gridlock set in and the Senate seemed to have forgotten \nwhat Senators Daschle and Lott had tried to do.\n  My own assessment of the situation now, which is not based on any \nscientific evidence, GAO investigation or CRS study, is that a \nsignificant number of our colleagues in the Senate have gotten the \nmessage sent by the Leaders, and have refrained from the use of secret \nholds. They inform sponsors about their objections, and do not allow \ntheir staff to place a hold without their approval. My sense is that \nthe legislative gridlock generated by secret holds may be attributed to \na relatively small number of abusers. The resolution we are submitting \ntoday will not be disruptive for a solid number of Senators, but it \nwill up the ante on those who may be ``chronic abusers'' of the \nLeaders' policy on holds.\n  Our bipartisan resolution would amend the Standing Rules of the \nSenate to require that a Senator who notifies his or her leadership of \nan intent to object shall disclose that objection in the Congressional \nRecord not later than two session days after the date of the notice. \nThe resolution would assure that the awesome power possessed by an \nindividual Senator to stop legislation or a nomination should be \naccompanied by public accountability.\n  The requirement for public notice of a hold two days after the intent \nhas been conveyed to the leadership may prove to be an inconvenience \nbut not a hardship. No Senator will ever be thrown in jail for failing \nto give public notice of a hold. Senators routinely place statements in \nthe Congressional Record recognizing the achievements of a local Boys \nand Girls Club, or congratulating a local sports team on a State \nchampionship. Surely the intent of a Senator to block the progress of \nlegislation or a nomination should be considered of equal importance.\n  I have adhered to a policy of publicly announcing my intent to object \nto a measure or matter. This practice has not been a burden or \ninconvenience. On the contrary, my experience with the public \ndisclosure of holds is that my objections are usually dealt with in an \nexpeditious manner, thereby enabling the Senate to proceed with its \nbusiness.\n  Although the Senate is still several months away from the high season \nof secret holds, a number of important pieces of legislation have \nalready become bogged down in the swamp of secret holds this year. The \nday is not far off when any given Senator may be forced to place holds \non numerous other pieces of legislation or nominees just to try to \n``smoke out'' the anonymous objector. The practice of anonymous \nmultiple or rolling holds is more akin to legislative guerilla warfare \nthan to the way the Senate should conduct its business.\n  It is time to drain the swamp of secret holds. The resolution we \nsubmit today will be referred to the Senate Committee on Rules. It is \nmy hope that the Committee will take this resolution seriously, hold \npublic hearings on it and give it a thorough vetting. This is one of \nthe most awesome powers held by anyone in American government. It has \nbeen used countless times to stall and strangle legislation. It is time \nto bring accountability to the procedure and to the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2851-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3135.

I thank my good friend, the majority whip from Nevada. \nI am sure at some point in time the situation will be reversed, and we \nwill be on a Nevada issue of some torturous nature, Yucca Mountain or \nsome such issue, and he will be here through the evening time.\n  I recognize the hour is late, and I also recognize the issue before \nus is the crux of the energy debate. It is the so-called lightning rod \nknown as ANWR.\n  It has been interesting to be here today and participate with a \nnumber of Senators, almost all of whom have never been to my State and \nvisited ANWR. They certainly had some strong opinions about it. One has \nto question where those opinions may have come from, but I am sure they \nmeant well and their own convictions as they stated them were \nreflective of information they had.\n  I am going to spend a little time tonight on information and \neducation. Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, you and I both know \nwe are speaking to an empty Chamber. On the other hand, I appreciate \nthe courtesy of your attention and that of the staff who is still with \nus.\n  We have a different audience out there, and we do not know who they \nare, but I think it is fair to say that from the debate here, a lot of \nMembers of this body are not too well informed on the factual issues in \nmy State of Alaska. Senator Stevens and I have attempted to change that \nby a characterization that we think is representative of the facts \nassociated with resource development in our State.\n  I hope as we address whatever audience may be out there, that they, \ntoo, recognize certain realities of those of us who have been elected \nby our constituents to represent their interests. It is in that vein \nthat I speak to you tonight, Mr. President.\n  I guess this all started in the sense of a slippery slope when \nRepublicans lost control of this body. We had a vote on ANWR in 1995. \nIt passed in the omnibus bill. President Clinton vetoed it. At that \ntime, control of the Senate was in Republican hands, 55 to 45. Now it \nis 50 to 49 in favor of the Democrats. This is a clear reality, and I \nam sure it will be reflected in the cloture votes tomorrow.\n  One could say that the salvation of ANWR is pretty much directed by \nthe Republican Party. That certainly has been the case in the past, and \nit appears to be the case today. We will see where it is tomorrow.\n  The last time we had an ANWR vote, it was a simple majority. We were \nnot faced with a cloture vote. We were not faced with having to \novercome 60 votes. Equity is equity and rules are rules, and I \nunderstand that. But the manner in which this occurred is particularly \noffensive to me because I happened to be at the beginning of this year \nthe chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. One of my \ngoals, of course, was to present before that committee that I chaired \nthe ANWR amendment, debate it, and vote it out.\n  Then we had a little change of structure in the Senate in June and, \nas a consequence, the Republicans lost control of the Senate. I still \nhad hopes because some of my Democratic friends had actually visited \nANWR and they were convinced it could be opened up safely. As a \nconsequence of the chronology of that, I had assumed we would take up \nthe energy bill in the committee of jurisdiction, debate it, come up \nwith amendments, and present it on the floor of the Senate.\n  Had that been done, we would not have been required to have a 60-vote \npoint of order on a cloture vote, and we all know that, but that was \nnot the case because I can only assume through a recognition of the \nexposure that the Republicans had lost control of the Senate and the \nrecognition of the availability of the rules that the Democratic \nleadership found a way to get around that.\n  What they did is they simply took the energy bill away from the \ncommittee of jurisdiction and proceeded to introduce it on the floor of \nthe Senate, as is the prerogative of the majority leader.\n  Whether it is crooked or not, whether you feel bad or not, it is \nwithin the rules of this body and, as a consequence, it was done.\n  That presented the dilemma that Senator Stevens and I faced in \nproceeding. It was a little more complex than that because it put a \nburden on other Members, as well, because the other Members clearly, as \nwe got into the intricacies of the energy bill, were faced with an \neducational process of electricity, alternative energy sources, some \nrelatively complex issues that ordinarily would be addressed in the \nvein of the committee process, and go to the floor with specific \nrecommendations and block bases of support.\n  In any event, to get to the bottom line, we are faced with the \nreality that we now need 60 votes because it was structured that way. \nThere was no other way to avoid it because we simply could not get a \nsimple majority vote for the reason we had to add the ANWR amendment \nin, and in so doing, we were under the exposure of cloture.\n  Had it been in the bill, we would have been faced with the much more \nfavorable alternative of a simple majority. So that is where we are \ntoday.\n  I think it is important to reflect a little bit on where the \namendments are relative to what is before us. As I think\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\neveryone is quite familiar with by now, we have a second degree, and \nthe second degree is very specific in its recognition of what it does. \nIt specifically states that any proceeds from the development of ANWR, \nwhich would result from the leases and the royalty bids, would go to \nthe steel industry.\n  I think the rationale for this is quite evident. The steel industry \nis in a difficult position. We have seen a decline of that industry. \nPeople have indicated from time to time there are a couple of things we \nhave to have as a nation. One is steel. One is energy. One is food. We \nhave seen our steel industry reduced dramatically in the last couple of \ndecades to the point where the viability of the American steel industry \nis clearly in question.\n  What we had was an opportunity to meld two projects together. This \nwould address jobs, this would address the opportunity to revitalize \nthe American steel industry, because, as has been pointed out, with the \ndiscovery of natural gas in Prudhoe Bay, we came across about 36 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  I am going to point out the general area of Prudhoe Bay. As a \nconsequence of that discovery of gas, the question was: When and how \ncan it be developed?\n  It was found as a consequence of developing the Prudhoe Bay oilfield. \nAs we developed the oilfields, we found more gas. We did not have any \nway to take that gas to market. So we began to develop some proposals.\n  The blue line on the chart indicates the proposed route of the \nTransAlaska gasline. That line is estimated to be about 3,000 miles \nlong. It would go ultimately to the Chicago city gate. It would move \nabout 4 billion cubic feet a day and have a capacity of about 6 billion \ncubic feet a day. I have to be careful with the numbers because the \ndesign capacity is in the trillions. The movement per day is in the \nbillions.\n  As a consequence, it would be the largest construction project ever \nundertaken in North America. The cost is estimated to be about $20 \nbillion.\n  We have had some experience because we built an oil pipeline that \ntraversed a significant portion of Alaska. That oil pipeline is seen on \nthis particular chart. It goes from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. All of that \npipe came from Japan, Korea, and Italy. Why? Because we did not make \n48-inch oil pipe.\n\n  With this other proposal I have outlined, the obvious opportunity for \nthe American steel industry, for rejuvenation, is, who is going to make \nthis pipe? This is going to be 52-inch pipe. It is going to be X-80 to \nX-100 steel. That is the tinsel strength of the steel. The significance \nof that is obvious. Somebody is going to build it. If it is not built \nin America, where is it going to be built? I assume Japan, Korea, \nTaiwan perhaps.\n  Is there a way we could build that steel in this country, stimulate \nthe rejuvenation of the industry and, as a consequence of the \nopportunity, recognize that we were probably going to generate \nsomewhere between $10 billion and $12 billion over 30 years from the \nroyalties and lease sale of ANWR? Why not put it into the steel \nindustry?\n  The second-degree amendment that is pending and will be voted on \nfirst tomorrow, which should be of great interest to the steel industry \nand the unions, as well as some 600,000 current retirees who, I \nunderstand, are in jeopardy of losing their health care benefits, would \nbe an opportunity to address that.\n  We structured a revenue split for the second-degree amendment. \nInitially, it would contribute to the steel legacy program \napproximately $8 billion. Recognizing that there is a shortfall in the \nUnited Coal Mine Workers combined benefit funds, there was a proposal \nthat a billion dollars would go into that fund.\n  Some people are going to criticize this and say this is a way to buy \nvotes; this is a way to take money from the Federal Treasury.\n  I encourage Members to reflect a little bit on what our obligation is \nto those who depend on Medicare. Many of those people will fall into \nthat category, if they are not already there. Obviously, we have an \nobligation to consider how to take care of those that have contributed \ninto retirement funds and found those funds not adequately funded for \nthe benefits.\n  So as we address the merits of how this effort is structured, we \nshould consider a more positive contribution, and that is the $232 \nmillion that is proposed for commercial grants for the retooling of the \nindustry so they can address competitively a large project like the $5 \nbillion natural gas pipeline, some 3,000 miles of pipeline.\n  Further, there was funding for $155 million of labor training. There \nwas also another $160 million for conservation programs, for \nmaintenance of park and habitat restoration. That is what the second-\ndegree amendment is all about. It says the money that is recognized \nfrom the sale of leases and royalties from ANWR, which is Federal land, \nwill go back and rejuvenate the steel industry so it can get back on \nits feet and again address its opportunity to participate in the \ncontinued development of steel products in this country as opposed to \nhaving them imported.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this administration just granted a \n30-percent protective tariff on steel. So clearly they have an \nopportunity, they have kind of a comfort zone, if they are willing to \nrecognize the benefits of this.\n  I understand some Members said we are going to take this up \nseparately anyway, but the fallacy in that argument is where is the \nmoney going to come from? There is no identification of the funds. If \nwe do not open ANWR, we are not going to have that availability of this \n$10 billion to $12 billion. What is going to be done about rejuvenating \nthe steel industry? What is going to be done about the prospects of a \nmajor order for 3,000 miles of pipe? I guess we will just shrug and \nsay: Well, there goes another contract overseas that could have been \ndone by American labor.\n  So that is the second degree we are going to be voting on first \ntomorrow.\n  In line with that, I have been handed a letter from Phil English and \nBob Ney, both Members of Congress:\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                    Washington, DC April 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: We write as members of the House with \n     a strong interest in the steel industry to convey our strong \n     support of your efforts to resolve the legacy cost burden of \n     the domestic steel industry, and especially your efforts to \n     assist the steel industry's retirees and their dependents.\n       As you know, the domestic steel industry has significant \n     unfunded pension liabilities as well as massive retiree \n     health care responsibilities that total $13 billion and cost \n     the steel industry almost $1 billion annually. These pension \n     and health care liabilities pose a significant barrier to \n     steel industry consolidation and rationalization that could \n     improve the financial condition of the industry and reduce \n     the adverse impact of unfairly traded foreign imports.\n       It has come to our attention that a unique opportunity has \n     arisen in the Senate to remove this barrier to \n     rationalization while assisting the retirees, surviving \n     spouses, and dependents of the domestic steel industry. It is \n     our understanding that you have offered an amendment to the \n     energy bill this week which will break the impasse on the \n     legacy problem.\n       Once again, we would like to extend our wholehearted \n     support to you in this endeavor. We look forward to working \n     with you to find a viable solution to bring a sense of \n     security to the over 600,000 retirees, surviving spouses, and \n     dependents before the end of the 107th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n         Phil English, Bob Ney, Steven LaTourette, Robert \n           Aderholt, George Gekas, Jack Quinn, John Shimkus, Frank \n           Mascara, Ralph Regula, Alan Mollohan, William Lipinski, \n           and Melissa Hart.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. There is an expression from a dozen or so House \nMembers saying this is an opportunity. You might not get it again. We \nhave identified significant funding to rejuvenate the steel industry, \ntake care of the retirees, and put it back on its feet.\n  As we address the amendment, I want to make sure everybody \nunderstands what is in it. There have been generalizations from the \nother side that this is simply a second-degree amendment which takes \nany funds that would open up ANWR and provides for the rejuvenation of \nthe steel industry, while the first degree would be an up-down vote on \nopening ANWR.\n  First of all, this amendment does not open ANWR. ANWR would only be \nopened if our President certifies to Congress that the exploration, \ndevelopment, and production of oil and gas resources in the ANWR \nCoastal Plain are in the national economic and security interests of \nthe United States.\n  It is pretty simple. The President of the United States has to \ncertify that\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\nthe ANWR Coastal Plain should be open. Then the Secretary of the \nInterior will implement a leasing program. Then the following will \napply.\n  I don't want to hear any more that this is an up-down vote to open \nANWR. It is to give our President extraordinary authority, almost a \ndeclaration of war. Don't we trust him and his Cabinet to make a \ndetermination that this is in the national security interests of this \nNation? I certainly trust our President to make that finding. The \nPresident has to certify to us, the Congress, that exploration, \ndevelopment, and production are in the national economic and security \ninterests. I can state now it is certainly in the national security \ninterests relative to the situation in the Middle East where we are 58-\npercent dependent on imported oil. I will get into that later. The \nstimulation of the steel industry alone substantiates that particular \ncover.\n  We will look at what is in this. There is a Presidential finding. The \nPresident has the authority. We are giving it to him. He has to come to \nCongress and certify, again, production is in the national economic and \nsecurity interests.\n  We have mandated a 2,000-acre limitation on surface disturbance. It \nis that simple. That is what it means, 2,000 acres. We have an export \nban. Oil from the refuge cannot be exported.\n  I heard a conversation the oil will be exported or has been exported. \nThe natural market for Alaskan oil is the west coast of the United \nStates. We have a chart that demonstrates where Alaskan oil goes. It \ngoes to the nearest refining areas. This chart shows Alaska and Valdez. \nIt shows it goes to Puget Sound in the State of Washington, it goes to \nSan Francisco, Los Angeles, and some to Hawaii. We do not see a line to \nJapan. We exported some to Japan. It was excess to the west coast \nrefineries. That is the economics of it. Why send it further? Can you \nget more for it? That is kind of hard to figure because you bring it \nover from Iraq or from Saudi Arabia when you have it in proximity \nrelative to Alaska.\n  The other thing unique about this oil, it could only go in U.S. ships \nbecause of the Jones Act, mandating carriage between two American ports \nbe in U.S.-flagged vessels. These are American jobs. Every one of the \nships was built in a U.S. yard. Every one of those is crewed by U.S. \ncrews and carries an American flag. And 85 percent of the total tonnage \nin the American merchant marine is in the Alaskan oil trade. Bring oil \nfrom Saudi Arabia, you could bring it from Iraq, you can bring it in a \nforeign ship. What happens in Seattle, Puget Sound, San Francisco, Los \nAngeles? Talk about all the conservation you want, but you will still \nbring oil because the world and America moves on oil. That is the only \ntransportation method.\n  This issue of export is not a factor because it is banned. It says it \ncannot be exported, with one exception, and that is to Israel. We have \nhad with Israel an oil supply agreement that expires in the year 2004. \nWe are extending that to the year 2014.\n  Where is the Israeli lobbying group? I will throw a few in the \nRecord: the Zionist Organization of America, Americans For A Safe \nIsrael, B'Nai B'rith International.\n  I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record.\n  Thee being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Zionist Organization of America,\n\n                                  New York, NY, November 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: On behalf of the Zionist \n     Organization of America--the oldest, and one of the largest, \n     Zionist movements in the United States--we are writing to \n     express our strong support for your efforts to make our \n     country less dependent on foreign oil sources, by developing \n     the oil resources in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge.\n       At time when our nation is at war against international \n     terrorism, it is more important than ever that we work \n     quickly to free ourselves of dependence on oil produced by \n     extremist dictators. Such dependence leaves the United States \n     dangerously vulnerable.\n       Your initiative to develop the vast oil resources of Alaska \n     will make it possible to rid America of this dependence and \n     thereby strengthen our nation's security.\n           Sincerely,\n     Morton A. Klein,\n       National President.\n     Dr. Alan Mazurek,\n       Chairman of the Board.\n     Dr. Michael Goldblatt,\n       Chairman, National Executive Committee.\n     Sarah Stern,\n       National Policy Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Americans For A Safe Israel,\n\n                                  New York, NY, November 30, 2001.\n     Attention: Brian Malnak\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: Americans for a Safe Israel is a \n     national organization with chapters throughout the country \n     and a growing membership including members living in other \n     countries. AFSI was founded in 1971, dedicated to the premise \n     that a strong Israel is essential to Western interests in the \n     Middle East.\n       We have many Middle East experts on our committees, who \n     have authored texts on Israel and the Arab states and have \n     appeared in television interviews, forums, and on newspaper \n     op-ed pages. U.S. senators and representatives have been \n     guest speakers at AFSI annual conferences.\n       Americans for a Safe Israel is strongly in support of your \n     amendment which would permit drilling for oil in the ANWR \n     area of Alaska. Your eloquence in addressing the Senate \n     yesterday and this morning should have convinced the \n     undecided that the arguments offered by senators in the \n     opposition, or by environmental activists, are not based on \n     the facts or realities in the ANWR and of our need for energy \n     independence.\n       We at Americans for a Safe Israel would be pleased if you \n     would include our organization among American Jewish \n     organizations in support of your amendment regarding oil \n     exploration in the ANWR.\n           Sincerely,\n     Herbert Zweibon,\n       Chairman, Americans for a Safe Israel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   B'nai B'rith International,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2002.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write to you as the US Senate \n     debates national energy legislation, a critical national \n     security issue, in support of both modest Corporate Average \n     Fuel Economy increases and the environmentally safe \n     exploration and extraction of petroleum from the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge. Together Washington will lessen the \n     nation's reliance on foreign energy sources, now estimated at \n     close to 60 percent of our consumption.\n       We endorse the recent compromise proposal to bring required \n     fuel economy ratings for vehicles--including sport utility \n     vehicles now subject to a lower standard--up to 35 miles per \n     gallon by 2015. As you know, under current federal \n     regulations automakers are required to achieve an average of \n     27.5 mpg for new passenger cars, and only 20.7 mpg for new \n     light-duty trucks. The reinstitution of a meaningful CAFE \n     standard will serve as a hallmark of America's conservation \n     policy; the National Academy of Sciences concluded recently \n     that CAFE requirements have resulted in a savings of \n     ``roughly 2.8 million barrels of gasoline per day from where \n     it would be in the absence of CAFE standards.''\n       Similarly, it must be recognized that conservation alone is \n     not a meaningful answer to the new realities our nation \n     faces. Ending our dependency on oil and natural gas from \n     dictorial regimes and authoritarian governments that actively \n     sponsor international terrorist groups--including al-Qaeda \n     and other movements that threaten our nation's most cherished \n     principles--requires increasing domestic production, too. \n     Such a plan includes exploration and extraction in the Arctic \n     refuge. While B'nai B'rith International sympathizes with \n     some of the environmental issues that have been raised \n     regarding that area's future, we believe that, in wartime, \n     our number one priority must be to take all credible steps \n     necessary to protect our national security interests. \n     Replacing up to 30 years worth of oil imports from Saudi \n     Arabia or 50 years of oil imports from Iraq will provide \n     critical leverage for American foreign policy in the years to \n     come.\n       To be sure, it will be several years before both of these \n     important proposals will have a discernable impact on US \n     energy policy. At this time there is every reason to believe \n     that we will still be fighting terrorists who seek to destroy \n     our nation. Accordingly, it is imperative that both measures \n     are enacted into law at the earliest opportunity so that by \n     decade's end America will be less reliant on foreign energy \n     and enjoy greater national security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Richard D. Heideman,\n                                          International President.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. A few of the national Jewish organizations recognize \nwhat is happening currently, and that is oil is funding terrorism.\n  We all remember September 11 when, for the first time, an aircraft \nwas used as a weapon. Now we have statements from people such as Saddam \nHussein. What is he saying? Oil is a weapon.\n  Are we contributing to those weapons? Yes, we are. Here is, \ncurrently, an\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nexample. Perhaps it is extreme and perhaps a little inappropriate, but \nwhere and who funds the suicide bombers in Israel? We know who funds \nthem. Oil. Who has the oil? Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein, via \nAmerican oil purchase. When we go to the gas station, we should think \nof our responsibility because our responsibility goes beyond filling \nour gas tank. Where do we get some of our oil? There is 58 percent that \ncomes from overseas.\n  How much do we get from Saddam Hussein currently? A million barrels. \nHow much did we get September 11? It was 1.1 million on September 11, \nthe highest of any other time.\n  This is off the Bank of Baghdad, $25,000, which is what he is paying \nthe suicide bombers. He used to pay $10,000. That is an incentive that \ncould reach our shores. That is some of the vulnerability we have as we \nlook at the consequences of increasing our dependence on imported oil.\n  This Senator from Alaska understands we are not going to eliminate \nour dependence, but if we make a commitment, we will open ANWR; we will \nreduce our dependence; we will send a very strong message not only to \nSaddam Hussein but OPEC and that cartel over there. It is illegal to \nhave a cartel in this country. That cartel over there, we are going to \nsend them a message that we mean business about reducing our \ndependence.\n  Do you know what OPEC did not so long ago? They got together, had \ntheir cartel meeting, said we want the price to go up, and said we are \ngoing to put a floor and ceiling, $22 as a floor, $28 as a ceiling. How \ndo they do it? By controlling the supply. It is just that simple \nbecause we are addicted to Mideast oil.\n  Here is another photo of our friend, Saddam Hussein. Here is where it \ncomes from. It has been increasing all the time--1.1 million, that was \nfrom Energy Information, September 2001. Here is where we get our oil: \nIraq, Persian Gulf, OPEC. American families are counting on them, I \nguess.\n  That is why we have to protect Israel. That is why we are extending, \nin this legislation, the U.S. oil supply arrangement through the year \n2014.\n  Furthermore, we are going to increase wilderness. What we are going \nto do is we are going to take the 1002 area, which everybody has \nconcluded is at great risk, although Alaskans believe it can be \ndeveloped responsibly--that is 1.5 million acres--what we are going to \ndo is add another 1.5 million from a refuge and put it in in \nperpetuity, so we are going to increase this wilderness area from about \n9 million acres to about 10.5 million acres. We think that is a fair \ntrade. Yet not one Member of the other side has acknowledged that is of \nany significance.\n  I can only assume the other side has been pretty well--I won't say \nbrainwashed, but there have been some convincing arguments from our \nextreme environmental friends. Somehow, more wilderness is not the \nanswer. It is simply to kill ANWR. And the rationale is obvious: ANWR \nhas been a cash cow and these organizations have milked it for all it \nis worth.\n\n  To give some idea, we have a State that is pretty big. It is one-\nfifth the size of the United States. We have a map here that gives some \nidea of the comparison. This is a comparative scale. Alaska over the \nUnited States, the comparative scale, it will run roughly from Florida \nalmost to California. It will run almost from the Canadian border to \nalmost the Mexican border. It is a big chunk of real estate. I don't \nsee anybody from Texas here, but it is 2.5 times the size of Texas.\n  It is a big piece of real estate, and it is an important piece of \nreal estate, but it has a small population, a very small population. As \nwe look at that population and recognize that over 75 percent support \nopening ANWR, we begin to reflect a little bit on what this debate is \nall about. It is all about a theory that there has to be somewhere, \nsomeplace, in the minds of a lot of Americans, that is untouched, where \nthere is no footprint, that only the hand of God has caressed.\n  We all respect, obviously, the well-meaning environmental groups. But \nas far as our State is concerned, we believe we have been overexposed \nbecause a few years ago, we counted up the number of environmental \ngroups that had offices in Alaska, primarily Anchorage. There were \nabout 62. The last time I looked there were over 90. These are \norganizations that are located outside that have offices in Alaska. \nThey have young environmental lawyers who are almost coming up to do a \nmissionary commitment. They file an injunction on any project anywhere, \na log dump, a driveway, wetlands--you name it.\n  As a consequence, we think we have done a pretty good job in Alaska. \nWe think we have responsible development. We think Prudhoe Bay is the \nbest oilfield in the world. I said in this Chamber time and time again: \nYou might not like oilfields, but Prudhoe Bay is the best in the world.\n  Americans do not seem to care where their oil comes from as long as \nthey get it. If it comes from the scorched Earth fields of Iraq or \nIran, it doesn't make any difference. We can do it right. And we have \ndone it right because Prudhoe Bay is the best in the world and it is \n37-year-old technology.\n  We can go to newer fields such as Endicott, 53 acres--that is the \nfootprint. How many acres do we have in Alaska, 356 million?\n  Here is a State far to the north. Most people have never been to it. \nThen in our State we have this Arctic area, the ANWR area way up in the \ntop, that ANWR area. If you are going to take a trip up there, you \nbetter have $5,000 in your pocket or go on one of the environmental \ngroups' funded trips because that is what it costs to get up after \nFairbanks, charter into the area. Have somebody take care of you as you \nenjoy your wilderness experience because you just don't wander around \nin that area. It is very harsh.\n  Here we have this area in the northern part of the United States, and \nwe have the extraordinary outside influences of these outside groups \ndictating terms and conditions. They made it a business because it is a \nbig business. They generate millions of dollars in membership and \ndollars.\n  Why do they do it? Because it enhances their organizations. It gives \nthem a cause, and they make a contribution. I am not suggesting they do \nnot, but it has gotten to be a big business, and as a consequence \nAlaska is a little overexposed because if you look at this other chart, \nyou can get an appreciation of what was done in 1980. We are \nrecognizing all these areas of Alaska that are scratched in blue are \nFederal withdrawals. They are parks. They are wilderness. We have 56 \nmillion acres of wilderness, more than the entire State of California. \nWe appreciate and manage our wilderness areas appropriately. But that \nis a pretty good chunk of Federal land to have withdrawn because you \nhappen to be a public land State.\n\n  Maybe we should have cut a better deal when we came into the Union in \n1959. Maybe we were a little naive. Maybe we trusted big government.\n  What we got is this, and this was the land claims settlement in 1980. \nWhat they did is they were very crafty. They said: All right, you have \n356 million acres in your State. We think the State ought to have 104 \nmillion acres in the Statehood Compact. They said: Your Native people \nought to have 40 million acres, so that leaves you with 250 million \nacres or thereabouts for the Federal Government.\n  Instead of letting the new State go ahead and select the land, \nautomatically the lands were frozen under Carter. So the Federal \nGovernment got the first selection instead of the State. But here is \nwhat I want to point out.\n  You see that little red line? You see right in between the two blues? \nThat is the only access our State has north and south, the only access, \nand that is where our pipeline has to go and that is where our gasline \nhas to go because we cannot get access across Federal parks, wilderness \nareas--refuges. We cannot do it without congressional action and that \nis what we are doing right tonight. We are trying to get congressional \naction to open up that little oilfield up there.\n  That did not happen by accident. That did not happen on the free will \nof the people of Alaska. That was gerrymandered by people who did not \nwant Alaska developed.\n  If you go east and west, you can see they almost crossed over. There \nare a few little areas--we have a mine now. Do you know how many mines \nwe have in Alaska? We have one major gold mine, one major zinc and lead \nmine, and Red Dog, and at Greens Creek we\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\nhave a large silver mine. We have three major mines in this huge area. \nWe used to have four times those in the State.\n  Do you know how many pulp mills we have? Zero. I don't know how many \nyou have in New York, but I do know that New York cuts more wood for \nfirewood than we cut as commercial timber in the State of Alaska. Yet \nwe have the largest of all the national forests: 16 million acres in \nthe Tongass--all this area. As a matter of fact, we live in the \nforests. Some people think we live in the dark forests. But Juneau, our \nState capital, is in the State forest. Ketchikan is in the forest; \nWrangell, Petersburg, Haines, Skagway, Sitka, Yakutat, Cordova--they \nare in the forest.\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the Chair).\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Why didn't we get a land selection there? We thought \nwe could trust the Forest Service. We thought we could work in harmony. \nWe rue the day, but here it is, and we have to live with it. We have to \ncome to the Congress and plead for understanding. We have to, as one \nState, take on the whole national environmental community that has one \ncause--stop development in Alaska, because of their membership and \ndollars.\n  What we have attempted to do in this amendment is add more \nwilderness--1.5 million acres. We are adding to the Coastal Plain, as \nthe chart indicates.\n  What else do we do? We impose strict environmental protections in \nthis legislation.\n  I don't hear anyone on the other side of the aisle commenting as to \nthe adequacy or inadequacy.\n  We impose seasonal limitations to protect the denning migration of \nthe animals.\n  Some ask: What about the polar bear? Are we going to protect the \npolar bear? The polar bear, for the most part, den on the ice. They do \nnot den on land. The greatest protection we have for the polar bear is \nthe marine mammal law. Polar bears are marine animals. You can't take \nthem as trophies. You can't shoot them. If you want to shoot them, you \ngo to Russia or Canada. But you can't do it in Alaska. These bears get \nalong pretty well. You have seen this picture time and time again. You \nhave been very patient. These are a few of the bears. They do not \nhappen to be polar bears. They are grizzly bears and brown bears. They \nare walking on top of the pipeline because it is easier for them to \nwalk on the pipeline. They are not threatened. You can't take a snow \nmachine in there. You can't hunt in there. We think these are pretty \nresponsible conservation efforts.\n  A further provision is that the leasers must reclaim the land and put \nit back to its prior condition. That means it has to be put back in its \nnatural state.\n  What does it look like in Alaska after you drill a well? Let me show \nyou what it looks like in the Arctic. The only problem is we only have \nabout 2 \\1/2\\ months where it looks like this. There is the tundra. \nThere is the little Christmas tree. Where are they talking about these \nbig gravel roads? It isn't done anymore. We use technology. That is it. \nIt is a nice road. There is the well. It is pretty bleak country. Some \npeople say you couldn't find oil in a better place. That is reality.\n  We require use of ice roads, ice pads, and ice airstrips for \nexploration. If the oil isn't there, you are not going to see a track. \nWe prohibit public use on all pipeline access and service roads. We \nrequire no significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife and no \nsignificant impact. We require consolidation of facility siting. Tell \nme where in the world oil is developed that you have these kinds of \nrestrictions.\n  Further, we give the Secretary of the Interior the authority to close \nareas of unique character at any time after consultation with the local \ncommunity.\n  Here we have structure. There are two amendments. The second-degree \namendment would fund rejuvenation of America's steel industry and \naddress the steel legacy by funding so that our steel industry can \nresurrect itself, be internationally competitive, and participate in \nthe largest construction project in the history of North America, the \nbuilding of a 3,000-mile pipeline. The order alone is worth $5 billion.\n  The first-degree amendment opens the area up so that the leases can \nbe sold and so that the funds can be designated--$8 billion to the \nlegacy, $1 billion to the United Mine Workers, and commercial grants \nfor $232 million to retool the industry; labor training, $115 million; \nand conservation for National Park Service maintenance and backlog, et \ncetera. We think that is pretty good balance.\n  We wish we had a few more days on this issue. We might be able to \nfurther communicate to the American public really what we are trying to \ndo.\n  Again, the first-degree is not an authorization to open. We give that \nauthority to the President. The President has the determination to open \nit.\n  We don't have the level of support we had hoped. It is pretty hard \nfor one State to compete with national environmental groups. But we are \nnot giving up because sooner or later ANWR will be opened.\n  I can only guess, as you can, the consequences of this vote tomorrow \nbecause we don't know what the future holds. We do know there is an \ninferno in the Mideast. We do know we are importing 58 percent of our \noil. We know Saddam Hussein is obviously up to no good with the money \nhe generates from oil sales to the United States. We know he pays his \nRepublican Guards to keep him alive. We also know he is developing \nweapons of mass destruction. We just do not know when we are going to \nhave to deal with it or how.\n  We are enforcing that aerial no-fly zone over Iraq. We have bombed \nthem three times since the first of the year, and several times last \nyear he attempted to shoot us down. We have the lives of our men and \nwomen at risk. We take his oil and go use it to bomb him. He takes our \nmoney, pays his Republican Guard to keep him alive, and he develops \nthese weapons of mass destruction.\n  We look back to September 11 and say: Gee, if we had only had the \nintelligence, we would have averted that tragedy at the World Trade \nCenter, the Pentagon, and saved the brave people in the aircraft as \nthey tried to take it over before it went down in Pennsylvania.\n  We know there is a threat from Saddam Hussein. We don't know when or \nhow. But do we wait?\n  These are grave responsibilities for our President and the Cabinet \nand the Joint Chiefs of Staff. These are real. But every time we go to \nthe gas station, we are buying Iraqi oil--some of it, at least. He gets \nbillions. What does he do with it?\n  Here is that check again. We know he is doing that. He has a reward \nout.\n  Where is the principle of the United States, for heaven's sake? Why \ndo we succumb to do business with a tyrant? There is a principle \ninvolved here. If you or I were in business, we wouldn't do it. We \nwould say: Hey, enough is enough. Let us send a message out here.\n  We can go down a million rabbit trails for excuses as to why we \nshouldn't or couldn't open this area. These are all things that are \ntied together. Some Members obviously don't want to talk too much about \nit because it is not a pleasant subject. But for the Israelis who are \non a bus who are innocent bystanders, and suddenly a young woman gets \non the bus rigged with a bomb, and it blows up, believe me, that is a \nset of facts. That is why so many of the Jewish organizations are \nsaying enough is enough; we ought to stop importing from Iraq.\n  I have an amendment pending which I am going to bring up. We are \ngoing to have a vote on it because the leader gave me a commitment to \nhave a vote on it--that we ought to sanction oil imports from Iraq. \nIsn't it rather ironic? He has already done it to us, because he said \nlast week he was going to terminate production for 30 days. What \nhappens? The supply goes down and the price goes up.\n  I don't know, but the way I read it, charity begins at home. We \ncertainly should not be doing business with this guy just because we \nneed more oil.\n  I know my critics will say: Well, Senator Murkowski, you are not \ngoing to get any relief for awhile. I am talking about sending a \nmessage that we mean business about reducing our dependence on Iraq. \nThat is going to be a strong message.\n\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side saying that there is no \nsignificant potential in ANWR that would offset our imports. Let me \nshow you a chart. We have lots of charts. This is\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\ngoing to be a show and tell. We are probably going to go through every \nchart we have because this is probably going to be the only time we \nhave that opportunity.\n  But this is a chart that shows what happened to imports when we \nopened Prudhoe Bay. This might be a little tricky, but let me just show \nyou. The blue line at the bottom is Alaskan oil production from 1973 \nthrough 1999. We started small, and the blue line running across the \nchart shows the production, and then in 1977, more production--and then \nmore production, more production. We were producing 2 million barrels a \nday. That was 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in the United \nStates. That is how much it was.\n  As the blue line shows, in 1988, 1989, production at Prudhoe Bay \nbegan to decline. And it declined and declined, and now it is a little \nover a million barrels a day.\n  So what happened, as depicted by the red line, is interesting, \nthough, because that shows our total imports. We started out, per the \nchart, at roughly 3 million barrels a day, and we kept going up and up \nand up; and then, suddenly, at the peak, we opened up Prudhoe Bay. So \nthose who say ANWR is not going to make any difference, I defy them to \ncounter this reality.\n  Look at what happened to our imports. They dropped. Why? Because we \nincreased production domestically. We did not relieve our dependence on \nimported oil, no, not by any means, but we clearly reduced our imports.\n  Now, what has happened? And we have more conservation. You can go out \nand buy a 50-mile per gallon car. But we are using more. Why are we \nusing more? Well, it is just the harsh reality that oil imports are \ntaking place because other production in the United States is in \ndecline, and we are using more oil. It is just a harsh reality.\n  As we look at this chart, we recognize that we can refute the \ngeneralization that ANWR isn't going to make any difference with the \nreality that it will make a difference. It will make a big difference.\n  So let's take that chart down and reflect on how much oil might be \nthere.\n  We have had some discussion about the Energy Information \nAdministration, the EIA, providing an analysis of the effect of ANWR on \nU.S. domestic oil production and the net imports of crude oil. And we \nhave had it all over the ballpark.\n  From the EIA report of February 11, for purposes of addressing ANWR's \nimpact on national security, crude oil imports--which is an accurate \nmeasure, since ANWR provides only crude oil--this is what they project \nregarding domestic production of ANWR. Assuming the U.S. Geological \nService mean case for oil in ANWR, there would be an increase of \ndomestic production of 13.9 percent.\n  I have heard the Senator from Massachusetts communicate some 3 \npercent. All I can do is submit for the Record the EIA USGS mean case \nof a 13.9-percent increase of domestic production.\n  Assuming the USGS high case for oil in ANWR--the high case is a 16-\nbillion-barrel reserve--that would be a 25.4-percent increase in \ndomestic production. That is a pretty big percentage. That is about 25 \npercent.\n  You have to put this in perspective. I have a hard time doing this \nwith those in opposition because they do not want to sit still long \nenough to reflect on what this means.\n  How much oil is it?\n  For Washington, it is 66 years; for Minnesota, it is 85 years; for \nFlorida, it is 30 years--this is a lot of oil--for New York, it is 35 \nyears; for Rhode Island, 570 years; for Delaware, it is 46 years; for \nWest Virginia, it is 260 years, for Maryland, it is 98 years; for the \nDistrict of Columbia, it is 1,710 years; for Maine, it is 235 years. I \ncould go on and on. You can all see your individual States. Where is \nMassachusetts on there? There it is: 87 years. I want to make sure \nMassachusetts gets in there. I do not want to leave Massachusetts out. \nFor Alaska, it is 87 years.\n  So there is a lot of oil. But how does it compare, say, with my \ngeneralization that Prudhoe Bay has provided, for the last 27 years, \nsomewhere between 20 and 25 percent of the total crude oil? Well, you \ncan only do that by applying the projections associated with ANWR, \nwhich are somewhere between 5.6 billion and 16 billion barrels. If you \ntake halfway--10 billion barrels--it is as big as Prudhoe Bay because \nPrudhoe Bay was supposed to be 10 billion barrels, but it produced 13 \nbillion barrels. So it is significant, make no mistake about it. I want \nto put that argument to rest once and for all. It will make a \ndifference in reducing our imports.\n  So, as we talk about this, and we find that most of the critics have \nnever been there, and we look at some of the things that Alaska's oil \ndevelopment does for other States, such as providing them with a secure \nsource of oil, that is defended by the U.S. Navy--I am talking about \noil from Alaska and the west coast of the United States--it clearly is \na reliable supply.\n  I have addressed the reality that Prudhoe Bay is the best oilfield in \nthe world.\n  Do you remember the pictures in 1991, 1992, of the burning oilfields \nof Kuwait? The fleeing Iraqi troops set more than 600 of Kuwait's 940 \noil wells ablaze with explosives and sabotage. Do we have any of those \npictures with us? Yes. Do you want to see an oilfield burning, set fire \nto? Do you know who did it? Saddam Hussein. We have heard of him a \ncouple times tonight, haven't we? Talking about a burn, that burn is \nall through. It is a tough reality. Was there wildlife there? Camels, \ngoats, other wildlife once lived there. The land is dead. Yet this is \nwhere we choose to get our oil.\n  Our President told Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the United \nStates will deal with him soon if he continues to produce weapons of \nmass destruction. I am sure, Mr. President, both you and I have had an \nopportunity to be with President George W. Bush. I do not think there \nis any question he means what he says. He says the U.S. ``will deal \nwith him soon'' if he continues to produce weapons of mass destruction.\n  I guess the question is, When and how?\n  In Alaska, in the United States, we have the most stringent \nenvironmental regulations on Earth. Maybe we are not doing it right, \nand maybe we can do better, but we are doing it better than anybody \nelse.\n  Those who suggest that somehow Prudhoe Bay is a disaster fail to \nrecognize that it is still the best oilfield in the world. I am proud \nto be an Alaskan. I am proud that we can make that commitment as a \nState because we have two levels of environmental oversight. The State \nDepartment's environmental conservation is very prudent, some think too \nprudent. And we have the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, and \nothers. But they are doing their job, and they are doing the best job \nin the world because they are using the best technology in the world.\n  We have heard other Members talk about--I think Senator Grassley--\nsome of the history of Russian oil development. Anything goes. It is to \nget the oil. It doesn't make any difference how much you spill or how \nmuch you drill. Workers drill too fast, too many holes, don't make \nproper recovery. Do we have any charts on that?\n  How about this? You would never see anything like that in the United \nStates. You would never see that in Alaska. There is a puddle of oil, a \nbusted pipeline, a disaster.\n  Does the United States care where America gets its oil? Evidently, \nnobody really cares if it is there. If it is not there, they scream. If \nthe price is too high, they scream. If they have to wait too long to \nget it, wait in line around the block, they blame Government.\n  Since the House passed their energy bill in August, which had a \nprovision for opening ANWR--some say the House of Representatives is \npretty representative--America has imported 231 million barrels of oil \nfrom Iraq. That fact disturbs me greatly, and I would hope it disturbs \nmy colleagues and addresses their digestion. Some of that money went \nstraight into Saddam's pocket. I would prefer 100-percent homegrown \nenergy because we can do it safer and better here in the United States.\n  As this debate continues, I hope my colleagues will take a long and \nhard look at the alternatives to Alaskan oil because that is what they \nare and what it means to the environment on a global scale. Again, I \nhope they will recognize Alaskan oilfields are the best in the world.\n  I will add a little partisan reference here from the Wall Street \nJournal,\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\nApril 16, 2001, just the other day. It is entitled ``Labor Revolt.'' It \nsays:\n\n       You might not see picket lines, but a chunk of America's \n     labor movement is staging a notable walkout--against the \n     Democratic Party. The trend is already having consequences in \n     Congress and could echo through November and into 2004.\n       Leading the revolt is James Hoffa, head of the AFL-CIO's \n     third largest union, the 1.4 million Teamsters. Mr. Hoffa has \n     become a key and very public supporter of [President Bush's] \n     energy plan, which is also backed by a coalition of \n     carpenters, miners and seafarers. He has lobbied inside Big \n     Labor for a more neutral political bent and his officials \n     were recently overheard giving Democrats on Capitol Hill hell \n     for killing jobs.\n\n  This gasline and ANWR are jobs issues.\n\n       Today, some 500 Teamsters will help present the Senate \n     amendment to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  We had that press conference the other day. We had hundreds of \nlaborers out front on the issue. We had, in addition to the Teamsters, \nmy good friend Jerry Hood. We had Ed Sullivan, president of the \nBuilding and Construction Workers, the AFL-CIO, members of the Building \nTrades Union, the president of Operating Engineers, and the Seafarers \nUnion.\n  They are concerned about two things: They are concerned about jobs, \nand, obviously, they are concerned about national security interests \nrelative to our Nation and our Nation's continued dependence on foreign \noil. It is very real.\n  That article goes on to say:\n\n       Meanwhile, the United Auto Workers, electricians and \n     machinists have rebelled against Democrats on issues from \n     fuel-efficiency standards to nuclear energy.\n\n  That is going to come up at another time as we debate the nuclear \nindustry and the future of it and what we are going to do with our \nwaste. I know my good friend Senator Reid is going to be very active in \nthat debate because that debate affects his State. I respect that set \nof circumstances.\n\n  The problem with nuclear waste is nobody wants it. If you throw it up \nin the air, it won't stay there. It has to come down somewhere. As a \nconsequence, we can't agree where to put it.\n  In my opinion, there is an answer to it; that is, you reprocess it. \nBy so doing, you recover the plutonium, put it back in the reactors, \nand you vitrify the waste, which obviously has very little ability for \nproliferation. That is what the Japanese are doing. That is what the \nFrench are doing. Do you know why we can't do it? Because we have such \nan active nuclear environmental lobby, we don't allow it. So we walk \naround saying, what in the world are we going to do with our waste? \nWhere are we going to put it? Nobody wants it. Nevada says they don't \nwant it. We have decided to put it there, and so all hell is going to \nbreak loose.\n  Anyway, United Auto Workers, electricians, and machinists have \nrebelled. Why have they rebelled? They are looking at jobs.\n  This article goes on to say that this issue has:\n\n       . . . alienated many of old industrial unions which grow \n     only when the private economy does. Many of these unions \n     don't share the cultural liberalism of the Washington AFL-CIO \n     elites, who are often well-to-do Ivy-Leaguers.\n\n  Well, there is a bit of a change among some of the unions. I suppose \nthat happens around here, too.\n  But I think it is fair to conclude from this article:\n\n       Mr. Hoffa and fellow unions are now doing the same for oil-\n     drilling in Alaska, spending heavily on ads across the \n     country. He's vowed to ``remember'' Democrats who vote \n     against drilling.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2001]\n\n                              Labor Revolt\n\n       You might not see the picket lines, but a chunk of the \n     American labor movement is staging a notable walkout--against \n     the Democratic Party. The trend is already having \n     consequences in Congress and could echo through November and \n     into 2004.\n       Leading the revolt is James P. Hoffa, head of the AFL-CIO's \n     third-largest union, the 1.4 million Teamsters. Mr. Hoffa has \n     become a key and very public supporter of the Bush energy \n     plan, which is also backed by a union coalition of \n     carpenters, miners and seafarers. He ha lobbied inside Big \n     Labor for a more neutral political bent and his officials \n     were recently overheard giving Democrats on Capitol Hill hell \n     for killing jobs. Today, some 500 Teamsters will help present \n     the Senate amendment to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge.\n       Meanwhile, the United Auto Workers, electricians and \n     machinists have rebelled against Democrats on issues from \n     fuel-efficiency standards to nuclear energy. They follow last \n     year's resignation from the AFL-CIO by the influential United \n     Brotherhood of Carpenters, along with its half-million \n     members and $4 million in annual dues.\n       Some of this is issue specific, but it's also a sign of \n     deeper labor tensions. When John Sweeney took over the AFL-\n     CIO in 1995, he turned it in a markedly more partisan and \n     ideological direction. He aligned Big Labor with a coalition \n     of interest groups on the cultural and big government left. \n     This is fine with most public-sector unions (teachers \n     especially), which grow along with government.\n       But this leftward tilt has increasingly alienated many of \n     the old industrial unions, which grow only when the private \n     economy does. Many of these unions also don't share the \n     cultural liberalism of the Washington AFL-CIO elites, who are \n     often well-to-do Ivy Leaguers. They resent the money being \n     pushed into political campaigns and would rather spend more \n     on shop-room organizing. In Mr. Sweeney's tenure, the union \n     share of the private-sector work force has actually fallen, \n     to 9.1%\n       All of these tensions have come to the surface in the \n     energy debate, where Democrats have had to choose between the \n     greens (enviros) and blues (unions). Senator (and would-be \n     President) John Kerry thought he could win over the greens \n     and suburbanites by pushing new car-mileage standards, but \n     instead he inspired a labor rebellion. Nineteen Senate \n     Democrats, primarily from industrial states, joined \n     Republicans to kill Mr. Kerry's proposals.\n       Mr. Hoffa and fellow unions are now doing the same for oil-\n     drilling in Alaska, spending heavily on ads across the \n     country. He's vowed to ``remember'' Democrats who vote \n     against drilling. And he specifically singled out New \n     Jersey's Robert Torricelli (up for re-election this fall) and \n     Michigan's Debbie Stabenow (a top recipient of union cash in \n     her 2000 race). In case they don't' believe him, the \n     Teamsters have already endorsed three GOP Congressional \n     candidates in Michigan.\n       President Bush has noticed all of this, naturally, and is \n     openly courting union support. Having won only a third of \n     union households in 2000, Mr. Bush knows he has lots of votes \n     to gain. Sometimes his effort runs to schmoozing, as when he \n     made Mr. Hoffa one of his noted guests at the state of the \n     Union. But sometimes he's bowed to political temptation and \n     bent his principles, as with his 30% steel tariff.\n       Mr. Bush might keep in mind that Mr. Hoffa has helped him \n     even though last year he ignored Teamster objections and \n     fulfilled his campaign promise to allow Mexican trucks into \n     the U.S. The President is also no doubt aware that Mr. Hoffa \n     wants an end to 13 years of federal oversight into his \n     union--which should only happen on the legal merits.\n       Unions are moving to the Republicans less out of love for \n     the GOP than from disillusionment with Democrats. Democrats \n     had better be careful or they'll give Mr. Bush the chance to \n     form a formidable majority.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. What it does is simply say these are job issues and \nour business is jobs and productivity for the American people. This has \nbecome an issue where, clearly, if you look at the vote the last time \nthat we voted on this issue in the Senate, it was 45 to 55, and ANWR \nwas passed in the 1995 vote on the omnibus act. That is when \nRepublicans controlled the Senate.\n  Well, that was then and this is now. Now we have a 50-49-1 ratio in \nfavor of the Democrats. Clearly, we are in a situation where we don't \nhave control. As a consequence, ANWR is in trouble because it has to \novercome the 60-vote point of order. Make no mistake about that.\n  We have had quite a discussion throughout the day, but there are a \nfew points that have been overlooked. One of them that bothers me the \nmost is overlooking the people of my State, the people who are \naffected, the people who live in the Arctic and reside in the Coastal \nPlain. These are a few of the kids. There is not very many of them. \nThere are about 300 of them in that village. But they are like your \nkids or your grandkids or mine: Looking for a future, looking for an \nopportunity for a better lifestyle, educational opportunities, sewer, \nwater--some of the things we take very much for granted.\n  This is another picture of their community hall. This is Kaktovik. It \nis of an elder Eskimo, a snow machine, with his grandson, and a bike. \nThat is the way it is up there.\n  Some Members would have you believe there is nothing there. Let me \nshow you a picture of Kaktovik. It has been portrayed time and time \nagain--a small community, small village. It has an airport, has some \nradar installations. And it is actually in ANWR. It is\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\nin the Arctic Coastal Plain. It is in the 1.5 million acres. In fact, \none oilwell has been drilled in that area.\n  We have another chart here that gives you a little better idea of \nthat particular geographic area. The thing I want to make sure \neverybody understands is that all of ANWR, all of that 1.5 million \nacres is not Federal land.\n  These Native American citizens own 95,000 acres. That is diagrammed \nin the square. The only problem is, while they have title to that land, \nthey have no authority for any access--absolutely none. Only Congress \ncan give them that authority. We are going to be addressing that, \nbecause to have an aboriginal group of natives, American citizens, and \ngive them land that has been their ancestral land--it has been their \nland to begin with; that is where they have been for generations--and \nnot allow them to have access because everything around it is Federal \nland is simply wrong; it is unjust. We would not do it anywhere else in \nthe country. You would say you are entitled to access. I know because I \nhave been there time and time and time again.\n  I had the Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton, there with me last \nyear. So was Senator Bingaman. The temperature today was 95 here. A \nyear ago, it was 77 below zero there. That caught your attention. It is \na harsh environment.\n  My point is that only through an act of Congress will those people be \nallowed access to their own land. What would it take? Well, it would \ntake some kind of a corridor across Federal land--maybe 300 feet wide. \nAccess to what? Access just to State land. Where does State land start? \nOver on the other side of that yellow line. On this side is Federal \nland. They cannot get from there to the State land unless we do \nsomething about it.\n  Let me read you a little letter. This is from the Kaktovik Inupiat \nCorporation. These are the people who live in that village. I want to \nshow these other pictures. I want you to get the flavor. Nobody has \nmentioned on that side of the aisle, during the entire debate, the \ndreams and aspirations of these people. You have kids going to school \nin the snow. Nobody shovels the snow away. They dress a little \ndifferently perhaps. They wear mucklucks. They wear fur. You have some \nkids up there.\n  Let them take a peek at that so the kids in the gallery can see it.\n  This is how the kids in the Arctic go to school. It is a little \ndifferent. But these kids are American citizens. They are Eskimos. They \nhave rights, dreams, and aspirations. Yet what kind of a lifestyle do \nthey have?\n  Here is a letter:\n\n       Dear Senators Daschle & Lott:\n       The people of Kaktovik . . . are the only residents within \n     the entire 19.6 million acres of the federally recognized \n     boundaries of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. . . .\n\n  These people live right up at the top of the world in Kaktovik.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       [The Kaktoviks] ask for your help in fulfilling our destiny \n     as Inupiat Eskimos and Americans. We ask that you support \n     reopening the Coastal Plain of ANWR to energy exploration.\n\n  They are asking that we open it.\n\n       Reopening the Coastal Plain will allow us access to our \n     traditional lands. We are asking Congress to fulfill its \n     promise to the Inupiat people and to all Americans: to \n     evaluate the potential of the Coastal Plain.\n\n  These people are talking to us as landowners. They go on to say:\n\n       In return, as land-owners of 92,160 acres of privately \n     owned land within the Coastal Plain of ANWR, the Kaktovik \n     Inupiat Corporation promises to the Senate of the United \n     States:\n       1. We will never use our abundant energy resources ``as a \n     weapon'' against the United States, as Iraq, Iran, Libya, and \n     other foreign energy exporting nations have proposed.\n       2. We will not engage in supporting terrorism, terrorist \n     States, or any enemies of the United States;\n       3. We will neither hold telethons to raise money for, \n     contribute money to, or any other way support the slaughter \n     of innocents at home or abroad;\n       4. We will continue to be loyal Alaskans and proud \n     Americans who will be all the more proud of a government \n     whose actions to reopen ANWR and our lands will prove it to \n     be the best remaining hope for mankind on Earth; and\n       5. We will continue to pray for the United States, and ask \n     God to bless our nation.\n\n  These are my people, Mr. President. They further state:\n\n       We do not have much, Gentlemen, except for the promises of \n     the U.S. government that the settlement of our land claims \n     against the United States would eventually lead to the \n     control of our destiny by our people.\n       In return, we give our promises as listed above. We ask \n     that you accept them from grateful Inupiat Eskimo people of \n     the North Slope of Alaska who are proud to be American.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't think we would get a letter like this from any \nother potential supplier of oil in the Mideast. I think you would agree \nwith me. So here we have a situation where my people are deprived of a \nbasic right that any other American citizen would not be. It is very \ndisappointing because the human element was not brought up once.\n  What we have talked about today is whether ANWR can be opened safely. \nThere is no evidence that it cannot. Is there a significant amount of \noil that could make a difference? You bet. There is more oil in ANWR \nthan there is in all of Texas. I think the proven reserves in Texas are \nabout 5.3 billion barrels. What are we talking about here? Are we \ntalking about charades or about some kind of a conveyance, trying to \nportray to the American people that we cannot open it safely. They say \nit will take 10 years. We have a pipeline halfway to ANWR. Another 50 \nmiles, we would be hooked up. They say 10 years. Come on, let's \nexpedite the permit.\n  If anybody wanted to talk about history--and this was not brought up \non the other side today--the arguments we are using on the floor of the \nSenate at 9:35 p.m. are the same arguments we used 30 years ago on the \nissue of whether or not to open the TransAlaska Pipeline system--not to \nopen but to build it, because the environmental groups weren't as well \norganized then. But they were making a case. They said: You can't build \nan 800-mile fence across Alaska because if you do, you are going to \nbuild a fence that will keep the caribou and the moose on one side or \nthe other. You are putting that pipeline in permafrost. It is a hot \nline, and permafrost is frozen. It is going to melt. It is going to \nbreak.\n  The doomsayers were wrong. The same argument here: Can't do it \nsafety. They said the animals--look at the caribou, Mr. President. \nThere are a few of them. That is a new picture. I want to make sure you \nunderstand that we have more than one picture. These guys are under the \npipeline. Why? Why not? You see the water behind them. They are \ngrazing. That pipeline doesn't offer them any threat.\n  Somebody said that is an ugly pipeline. Well, I don't know. I guess \nit depends on your point of view. I could probably take 10 pictures of \nother pipelines and we could have a contest on whose pipeline is the \nugliest. But, you know, you either bury them or put them on the \nsurface. That is all in steel. It is designed to withstand earthquakes. \nIt is the best that the 30-year-old technology had, and we can do \nbetter now.\n  This is another picture. This is real. These are not stuffed. These \nare caribou. They are lounging around. The extraordinary thing is this \nis Prudhoe Bay, and we had, I believe, 3,000 animals in the central \nArctic herd. Today we have somewhere in the area of 26,000. Why? You \ncannot shoot them, and you cannot run them down with a snow machine. \nThey are protected. They do very well. The argument is bogus.\n  They say it is a different herd, a Porcupine herd. We are not going \nto allow any activity during the 2\\1/2\\ months that is free of ice and \nsnow because you cannot move in that country. We do not build gravel \nroads; we build ice roads. It represents better and safer technology \nand does not leave a scar on the tundra.\n  We have made great advances as a consequence of our lessons, but it \nis beyond me to reflect on the opposition here other than its core \nopposition: We are opposed to it. The rationale behind it lacks an \nindepth understanding. Here is the new technology. We do not drill the \nway we used to. They do not go out and punch a hole straight down, and \nif they are lucky enough, they find oil.\n  We have directional drilling capability. We can drill under the \nCapitol and come up at gate 4 at Reagan National Airport. That is the \ntechnology we have.\n  We can hit these spots that are under the ground with this 3-D \nseismic, one footprint. That is the change. We have proven it because \nwe built Endicott.\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\nNobody wants to talk about Endicott on the other side: 56 acres; \nproduced over 100 million barrels.\n  I also want to touch on another myth that the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from New Mexico used several times \nrelative to why do you want to go to ANWR when there are other areas. \nIf you are going to rob somebody, you might as well go to the bank; \nthat is where the money is.\n  We have the greatest prospect for discoveries, and that area is \nspecifically in ANWR. We have what they call National Petroleum \nReserve, Alaska. We have pictures of that area. This chart is a bit of \na contrast because this shows the top of the world. I want to reference \nthis with this big map. I want to reference where this area is.\n  Point Barrow is at the top. That is one of our Eskimo communities, \nand the nice thing about Point Barrow is you cannot go any further \nnorth. You fall off the top. The Arctic Ocean is right ahead. This is \nthe National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. It used to be Naval Petroleum \nReserve, Alaska. I wish the cameras had the intensity to pick up on \nthis to see all this gray/blue area. These are lakes within the \nreserve.\n  This is ANWR. Mr. President, do you see any lakes on the Coastal \nPlain? This is strategic from an environmental point of view, from the \nstandpoint of migratory birds. Where do they go? They do not squat on \nthe land. They go to the lakes. This is a huge mass of lakes.\n  The opponents are suggesting we go over there. That is fine except \nfrom an environmental point of view, we are not going to get permits in \nmany of these areas. While there have been some discoveries right on \nthis line within NPRA, this is where the oil happens to be because that \nis where the geologists tell us it is most likely to be.\n  We will put up lease sales in these fringe areas, but we are not \ngoing to get anything around the lakes. To suggest this area is already \nopen is contrary to reality.\n  Another thing the Senator from Massachusetts says is instead of \nopening ANWR, we should drill anywhere but Alaska. I find that \nincredible. We have the infrastructure. We have an 800-mile pipeline, \nand we are drilling on land.\n\n  Do my colleagues know what we are doing in the Gulf of Mexico? We are \nin 2,000 feet of water. We have had 8,000 leases in the gulf, many of \nwhich are not currently producing. There are a lot of endangered and \nthreatened species, including marine mammals, sea turtles, and coastal \nbirds. I cannot fathom why the Senator from Massachusetts believes it \nis better to drill where there are endangered species than where we \nhave a thriving wildlife population that obviously we take care of, as \nthey do in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  What stuns me is it seems to me common sense we should develop areas \nwhere people support the development. Many of these leases sit off the \ncoast of Florida are objectionable to the people of Florida, and I \nrespect their objections. Yet the people of the Alaska Coastal Plain \noverwhelmingly support development in Alaska.\n  Even the Teamsters who support development in Alaska disagree with \nthe Senator from Massachusetts that we ought to massively increase our \ndrilling in the Gulf of Mexico overnight.\n  We have a lot of species in the Gulf of Mexico that are threatened or \nendangered: The blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, the northern \nright whale, sei whale, threatened endangered sea turtles, green sea \nturtles, hawksbill, loggerheads, endangered beach mice which I am not \nfamiliar with, the Florida salt marsh vole, the piping plover, and the \nbrown pelican. I am not going to bore you with these, Mr. President.\n  The point is, that is tough drilling in 3,000 feet of water. There is \na lot of risk. On land you can contain the risk. We have done a pretty \ngood job of it in Alaska. They have done an excellent job in the Gulf \nof Mexico, make no mistake about it.\n  As we look at some of the suggestions that are made in general, such \nas we go someplace else in Alaska, remember, NPRA has 90 percent of the \nbirds on the North Slope and over 90 bird species, millions of shore \nbirds. There they are, Mr. President. They are not in ANWR. I just do \nnot understand why Senators suggest they will not support development \nin an area with more oil and less wildlife diversity. It does not make \nany sense at all other than those Senators have been influenced by some \nof the groups that clearly are using ANWR as a symbol.\n  Others suggest that the development of Alaska's gas--for example, I \nthink the chairman suggested we face a growing threat from foreign \ndependence on natural gas. Without going into that in too much detail, \nwe only import 15 percent of our natural gas needs compared with 58 \npercent of dependence on foreign oil.\n  Let us take a look at that because I am all for alternatives, but \ndon't believe they do not leave a footprint. I have a chart that shows \nthe San Jacinto. If you do not know where this is, if you are driving \nfrom Palm Springs to Los Angeles and you happen to go through Banning, \nthe pass, this is it. It is probably the largest wind farm in the \nworld. Look at the little windmills in the back at the bottom. There \nare hundreds of them. They call it Cuisinart for the birds because a \nbird that gets through there is lucky--if he is flying low.\n  There is an equivalent energy ratio. This wind farm is about 1,500 \nacres and produces the equivalent of 1,360 barrels of oil a day. Two \nthousand acres of ANWR will produce a million barrels of oil a day. \nThere is the footprint.\n  How much wind power does it need to equal that of ANWR's energy? \nAbout 3.7 million acres, equivalent to all of Rhode Island and \nConnecticut. If one put them all on a wind farm, then they would equal \nabout what ANWR's energy input is capable of. We have a couple more of \nthese charts so we might as well show them.\n  When we talk about the Sun, we naturally think of solar. Solar is \nworthwhile, but it is not very good in Point Barrow, AK, because the \nSun only rises in the summertime. I should not say that but in the \nwinter it is dark for a long time.\n  Two thousand acres of solar panel produce the energy equivalent of \n4,400 barrels of oil a day. Two thousand acres of ANWR will produce a \nmillion barrels of oil a day. So it would take 448,000, or two-thirds \nof Rhode Island all in solar panels to produce as much energy as 2,000 \nacres of ANWR.\n  Solar panels do have a place in Arizona, Florida, New Mexico, and \nother areas, but do not think America is going to be moved on solar \npanels.\n  There has been a lot of discussion taking place on ethanol. Ethanol \nis an alternative made from vegetable products, corn and other products \nthat come from our farmers. Two thousand acres of ethanol farmland \nproduce the energy equivalent of 25 barrels of oil a day. Two thousand \nacres will produce 25 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Two thousand \nacres of ANWR will produce a million barrels of oil a day, and that \nsource is the national renewable energy lab.\n  Make no mistake about it, a byproduct is produced with the corn, \nwhich is the corn husk. I am not sure what one does with them, but we \ncould speculate. It would take 80.5 million acres of farmland, or all \nof New Mexico and Connecticut, to produce as much energy as 2,000 acres \nof ANWR. So we could plant New Mexico and Connecticut in corn, I guess. \nThe point is, these all have footprints.\n  We have often talked about size when we talk about Alaska. We have \ntalked about the fact that our State has 33,000 miles of coastline. \nANWR is 19 million acres, as big as the State of South Carolina. We \ntalked about the attitude of Alaskans in supporting exploration. About \n75 percent of our people support it. Why is it that the people who want \nto develop oil and gas are not given the opportunity? I do not know. I \nfind it very frustrating.\n  I listened to some of the debate by some Members relative to domestic \noil production vis-a-vis subsidized oil. They talked about the rip-off \nthat the oil industry allegedly is guilty of in this country, but we \nstill have the best oil industry in the world. It is a relatively high-\nrisk oil exploration. You do not know if you are going to find it. You \nbetter find a lot of it.\n  Somebody suggested that it is comparable in some manner to making \nsewing machines, that somehow there is a relationship relative to risk. \nWell, if one is making sewing machines, they know what their market is. \nThey know what it is going to cost. But when one goes out and drills \nfor oil, they do not\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\nknow if they are going to find it. There is a lot of risk there.\n\n  As we import foreign oil, we do not know what the true cost is \nbecause there is no environmental consideration associated with the \ndevelopment.\n  I do not think anyone recognizes what we enjoy in this country as a \nstandard of living. The standard of living is brought about by people \nwho have prospered and have become accustomed to a standard of living \nthat is high. The convenience of having an automobile that can \naccommodate a family comfortably on a long trip; modest gasoline and \nenergy prices, that is as a consequence of the structure of our society \nand the makeup of the United States.\n  The question comes about, Do we want to substantially limit that \nstandard of living by taxes or various increased costs of energy? I do \nnot think so. I think those kinds of things were evident in the debate \nthat we had earlier in the week relative to CAFE standards.\n  One of the things that can certainly undermine our recovery is high \noil prices. Our friend Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Fed, is taking a \nmore guarded outlook on the U.S. economy compared with the comments he \nmade last month about the possible consequences of sustained high oil \nprices on the economic recovery.\n  This influential gentleman told the Congressional Joint Economic \nCommittee on Wednesday that energy prices had not yet risen to a point \nthat would seriously sap spending but warned that a lasting surge in \nthe cost of oil could have far-reaching consequences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from Oil Daily be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Greenspan: High Oil Can Undermine Recovery\n\n                           (By Sharif Ghalib)\n\n       Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appears to be \n     taking a more guarded outlook on the US economy compared with \n     more sanguine comments he made last month amid the possible \n     consequences of sustained high oil prices on an economic \n     recovery.\n       The influential central bank chief told the congressional \n     Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday that energy prices had \n     not yet risen to a point that would seriously sap spending, \n     but warned that a lasting surge in the cost of oil could have \n     ``far-reaching'' consequences. He told the committee he was \n     in no rush to raise US interest rates.\n       Greenspan's apparent step back may well have reflected \n     mixed signals from recently released economic indicators and, \n     perhaps more importantly, the recent surge in crude oil \n     prices, which have risen nearly $2 per barrel this week.\n       While the preponderance of the latest economic indicators \n     point to a faster than previously expected economic recovery \n     in the US, recent data released on the labor market showing a \n     slight rise in unemployment shed some doubt on the speed of \n     the recovery.\n       The reported rise in unemployment was followed this week by \n     a suggested slowdown in the US housing market, which had been \n     expanding strongly, and--arguably more alarming--a slowdown \n     in consumer spending. Manufacturing activity, however, has \n     turned in its strongest expansion in almost two years.\n       While the so-called core rate of consumer price inflation, \n     excluding energy and food prices, rose by a mere 0.1% in \n     March, gasoline prices rose by a sharp 8%, the largest \n     monthly change in six months. Fuel oil prices jumped by 2.2%, \n     the strongest since last December.\n       These increases are in line with higher crude prices, \n     reflecting mainly tensions in the Middle East, Iraq's \n     unilateral 30-day oil embargo, and export delays in \n     Venezuela.\n       Should the current oil rally continue for much longer, Opec \n     will face mounting pressure to ease the reins on production. \n     The group will meet in June to discuss production policy for \n     the second half of 2002. But Iraq's embargo call, which has \n     fallen on deaf ears among producers inside and outside Opec, \n     may make it politically difficult for Saudi Arabia and other \n     Muslim Opec members to increase production while fellow \n     members Iraq withholds exports to pressure Israel.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We have talked about oilfields. We have talked about \nthe Arctic. We have talked about the wildlife. We have talked about the \noil reserves. We have talked about the safety of development. I think \nwe have responded to the myth that some suggest we are going to \nindustrialize the Arctic.\n  I will show a chart of the Arctic in the wintertime. This area cannot \nbe industrialized. It is just simply too harsh. Some of this is \nuntouched because it has to be. To suggest we can have an industrial \ncomplex is totally unrealistic.\n  I often take this picture because it shows the harsh Arctic on a day \nwhen it is clear, but it is not clear all the time. Sometimes we have a \nwhiteout. We can turn this picture upside down, but it is even better \nto turn it around because that is what it looks like when it is \nsnowing. This is a whiteout. A lot of people do not know what kind of a \ncondition that is. That is when one cannot tell the sky from the land \nbecause it is all the same color, and you better not fly into it. If \nyou fly into it, you better be proficient as an instrument pilot or you \nwill not make a round trip. That is the harsh reality.\n  That is what it looks like during a whiteout, which is a good portion \nof the time. When there is snow on the ground, there is snow in the air \nand no visibility. Somebody told me it is one of the best charts we \nhave.\n\n  We talked about the footprint, talked about the accountability and \nhow the vote will be scored. We know how the union will score the \nvote--as a jobs issue. We know how the environmentalists will score \nit--as an environmental issue. I hope Members will score it as to what \nis best for America. That is the issue. That is why we are here.\n  I have talked about jobs. If we open ANWR, we will build new ships, \n19 new tankers. We will build them in California, the National Steel \nyard. We will build them in the South; hopefully, in Maine. This is big \nbusiness, several thousand jobs in the shipyards, $4 or $5 billion into \nthe economy alone, construction jobs, good-paying jobs, union jobs. It \nis not just what is in the national security interests of our Nation.\n  We can argue about how many jobs will be created, whether it is \n50,000 or 700,000. What difference does it make? These are good jobs. \nWe should regard each for what it is worth, providing each family with \nan opportunity to educate their children and provide a better life.\n  Speaking of a better life, those kids I talked about in Kaktovik have \ndreams and aspirations. Their dreams are more simple than ours. Maybe \nit is Halloween night. Do you know what their dreams and aspirations \nare? How about a little running water instead of the water well. How \nabout a sewer system instead of a honeybucket? Do you know what a \nhoneybucket is? We will show an arctic honeybucket. It costs about $17.\n  I didn't have any conversation over there as to why my people aren't \nentitled to running water, sewer, disposal. It is not a pleasant \nreality, but it is a reality. My people are tired. They want to be \ntreated like everybody else. That is why this issue of opening ANWR has \nmore to do than just the environmental innuendoes. It affects real \npeople in my State. It is time they were heard.\n  I listened to the Senator from Massachusetts. He made a statement \nthat he attested was made in a quote by our current Governor, which I \ndon't believe. The quote was:\n\n       Evidence overwhelmingly rejects the notion of any \n     relationship between Alaska North Slope crude and west coast \n     gasoline prices.\n\n  I know the Governor doesn't believe that, and I want to make sure the \nrecord was corrected. Think for a minute what would happen to prices on \nthe west coast in California if we cut off North Slope oil; if we do \nnot continue to supply California, Washington, Oregon with refined \nproduct and crude oil. It would impact the west coast. It would impact \nthe entire country.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made this reference. I heard it and I \nthought it was a mischaracterization, so I looked in the Record. He \nmade the statement and attributed it to the Governor of Alaska:\n\n       Evidence overwhelmingly rejects the notion of any \n     relationship between Alaska North Slope crude and west coast \n     gasoline prices.\n\n  I encourage the Senator from Massachusetts to correct that statement.\n  We have heard time and time again the statement that the United \nStates has only 3 percent of the world's oil and we use 25 percent of \nthe energy. Yet we produce 35 percent of the world's gross national \nproduct. We can argue that. We are getting a return, certainly, nearly \na third of the world's domestic product is produced by the\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\nUnited States which has 3 percent of the world's oil and uses 25 \npercent of the world's energy. That is part of our standard of living.\n  I talked about ANWR doubling our reserves. I talked about the fact we \nhave to address conservation. We are doing it and continue to do it and \nwe can continue to do a better job. Nevertheless, we live from day to \nday. Our farmers are dependent on low-cost energy.\n  We have a letter from the American Farm Bureau Federation in support \nof ANWR. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: America's farmers and ranchers are \n     users, and increasingly producers, of energy. We believe that \n     passage of a comprehensive energy bill is of vital importance \n     to agriculture and to our nation. We urge the Senate to pass \n     an energy bill with the hope that the President will soon \n     sign into law legislation that will address our country's \n     energy security.\n       Our organization along with other ag groups, the petroleum \n     industry, and environmental groups have reached a bipartisan \n     agreement on renewable fuels. This agreement, contained in \n     Majority Leader Daschle's bill, provides that our nation's \n     motor fuel supply will include at least five billion gallons \n     of renewable fuels by 2012. The Renewable Fuels Standard adds \n     value to our commodities, creates jobs in rural America and \n     provides a clean-burning, domestically produced fuel supply \n     for our nation. We urge you to oppose any amendment that \n     undoes this agreement.\n       Production of food and fiber takes energy--diesel in the \n     tractor and combine, propane to heat the greenhouse, natural \n     gas as a feedstock for fertilizer and electricity for home \n     and farm use. Our members believe that we must have \n     affordable and reliable energy sources. American Farm Bureau \n     policy has long supported environmentally sound energy \n     development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). We \n     ask that you support a cloture vote to allow the Senate to \n     vote on this issue and to support expanding our domestically \n     produced energy sources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As we look at other aspects of the debate in the \nlimited time we are going to have tomorrow, I hope we would not rest \nour laurels on simply increasing CAFE standards. We had a very healthy \ndebate on that. We sacrificed CAFE standards, to a degree. We did it \nfor safety. We heard from people, from mothers driving children to \nschool or soccer games; they want a safe automobile.\n  The statistics we heard suggested there was a compromise between CAFE \nstandards and safety. We chose to err on the side of not reducing CAFE \nstandards to the levels we could have. That is a responsible decision.\n  That does not mean new technology will not help, but to suggest we \ncan make up the difference of what we import from Saddam Hussein, \nnearly 1.1 million barrels a day on CAFE, is not realistic. We \ngradually improve our CAFE standards as we have over a period of time. \nTo suggest we can make up the difference is poppycock. It can't be \ndone. We can begin to do better and we will do better. But America \nmoves on oil. You don't run an aircraft on hot air. You don't fly an \nauto in Washington, DC, on hot air. You do it on oil. We are moving on \noil. We will continue to do that. I am all for conservation, for \nrenewables, but I am all for reality.\n  This chart is ironic. It shows the New York Times editorial positions \nfrom time to time. This was the 1987, 1988, and 1989 position, the New \nYork Times editorial board. They said in 1989:\n\n       Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the most promising \n     refuge . . . of untapped resource of oil in the north.\n\n  In June of 1988:\n\n       . . . The potential is enormous and the environmental risks \n     are modest . . .\n\n  Further,\n\n       . . . the likely value of the oil far exceeds plausible \n     estimates of the environmental cost.\n       . . . the total acreage affected by development represents \n     only a fraction of 1 percent of the North Slope wilderness.\n       . . . But it is hard to see why absolute pristine \n     preservation of this remote wilderness should take precedence \n     over the Nation's energy needs.\n\n  March 30, 1989:\n\n       . . . Alaskan oil is too valuable to leave in the ground.\n       . . . The single most promising source of oil in America \n     lies on the north coast of Alaska.\n       . . . Washington can't afford to treat the [Exxon Valdez] \n     accident as a reason for fencing off what may be the last \n     great oil field in the nation.\n\n  Now they say:\n\n       Mr. Murkowski's stated purpose is to reduce the Nation's \n     use of foreign oil from 56 percent to 50 percent partly \n     through tax breaks.\n       The centerpiece of that strategy, in turn is to open the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       This page has addressed the folly of trespassing on a \n     wondrous wilderness preserve for what, by official estimates, \n     is likely to be a modest amount of economically recoverable \n     oil.\n\n  What a contrast. January 2001, the country needs a rational energy \nstrategy, but the first step in that strategy should not be to start \npunching holes in the Arctic Refuge.\n  They have gone from 1987, 1988, 1989 to 2001, in March and January--a \ncomplete change of position. I asked the editorial board of the New \nYork Times: Why? They said: Well, Senator, the former head of the \neditorial board moved to California so we have changed our position.\n  We have another one here from the Washington Post that is even more \nironic. In 1987 and 1989 they said:\n\n       Preservation of wilderness is important, but much of Alaska \n     is already under the strictest of preservation laws. . . .\n       But that part of the arctic coast is one of the bleakest, \n     most remote places on this continent, and there is hardly any \n     other place where drilling would have less impact on the \n     surrounding life. . . .\n       That oil could help ease the country's transition to lower \n     oil supplies and . . . reduce its dependence on uncertain \n     imports. Congress would be right to go ahead and, with all \n     the conditions and environmental precautions that apply to \n     Prudhoe Bay, see what's under the refuge's tundra. . . .\n\n  Then on April 4, 1989, it says:\n\n       . . . But if less is to be produced here in the United \n     States, more will have to come from other countries. The \n     effect will be to move oil spills to other shores. As a \n     policy to protect the global environment, that's not very \n     helpful. . . .\n       . . . The lesson that conventional wisdom seems to be \n     drawing--that the country should produce less and turn to \n     even greater imports--is exactly wrong.\n\n  Here we are in February 2001:\n\n       Is there an energy crisis, and if so, what kind? What part \n     of the problem can the market take care of, and what must \n     government do? What's the right goal when it comes to \n     dependence on overseas sources?\n       America cannot drill its way out of ties to the world oil \n     market. There may be an emotional appeal to the notion of \n     American energy for the American consumer and a national \n     security argument for reducing the share that imports hold. \n     But the most generous estimates of potential production from \n     the Alaska refuge amount to only a fraction of current \n     imports.\n\n  Did we say it might be as much as 25 percent?\n  December 2001, the 25th, Christmas Day:\n\n       Gov. Bush has promised to make energy policy an early \n     priority of his administration. If he wants to push ahead \n     with opening the plain as part of that, he'll have to show \n     that he values conservation as well as finding new sources of \n     supply. He'll also have to make the case that in the long \n     run, the oil to be gained is worth the potential damage to \n     this unique wild and biologically vital ecosystem. That \n     strikes us as a hard case to make.\n\n  Isn't it ironic that these editorial boards of two of the Nation's \nleading papers could change their minds so dramatically? I did meet \nwith the Washington Post editorial board and I asked them why they had \nchanged their position. They were relatively surprised I would ask them \nthat kind of question, and their response was equally interesting. They \nsaid they thought George W. Bush was a little too forceful in promoting \nenergy activities associated with his particular background. In other \nwords, I was politely brushed off.\n  This happens to be a Washington Post story. It is interesting because \nthis is the newest deal that we developed. It is the Philips field, the \nAlpine project in Alaska's North Slope, and right on the edge of the \nNational Petroleum Reserve, Alaska.\n\n  You can see that is a whole oilfield. That is it. That is producing \nsomewhere around 85,000 to 100,000 barrels a day.\n  You know there is one thing you see and you see a little airstrip and \nthat is all. There is no road out of there. There is a ice road in the \nwintertime, but in the summertime you have to fly to get\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\nin and out of there. The interesting thing about the Washington Post \nis--we used to have laws around here when I was in the banking business \ncalled truth in lending. You had to tell the truth to a borrower if you \nwere going to lend him money. Those particular polar bears are warm and \ncuddly, but they are not in ANWR. We know where the picture was taken. \nIt was taken about 500 miles away near Point Barrow. Nevertheless, it \nwas a Park Service photo. It looked good. They just used it and wrote \nus a nice letter and said thank you.\n\n       ANWR--100 percent homegrown American energy.\n\n  That is like homegrown corn.\n\n       The exploration and development of energy resources in the \n     United States is governed by the world's most stringent \n     environmental constraints, and to force development elsewhere \n     is to accept the inevitability of less rigorous oversight.\n\n  This is a gentleman, former executive director of the Sierra Club, \nDoug Wheeler.\n\n       We can do it right. Give us a chance.\n\n  Washington Post, February 12, 2002:\n\n       Our greatest single failure over the last 25 years was our \n     failure to reduce our dependence on foreign oil . . . which \n     would have reduced the leverage of Saudi Arabia.\n       Richard Holbrooke, Ambassador to the United Nations in the \n     second Clinton administration.\n\n  February 13, 2002:\n\n       The Bush administration's defense of the leases shows \n     ``disregard for both our precious California coastline and \n     the right of states to make decisions about their \n     environment.''\n\n  This was our good friend, the junior Senator from California, Barbara \nBoxer, commenting on the issue of States having a determination as to \nwhat should prevail in their State. She further said:\n\n       We're going to swap [oil leases] so that the oil companies \n     can drill where people want them to drill.\n\n  That was February 15. Of course we would like to have them drill in \nour State. I think it is important to reflect the inconsistency \nassociated with some of the statements.\n  This happens to be back in Eisenhower's time. This was a Petroleum \nIndustry War Council poster:\n\n       Your work is vital to victory. Our ships, our planes, our \n     tanks must have oil.\n\n  You do not sail a Navy ship by wind. You do not fly the planes on hot \nair.\n  This is by Reuters:\n\n       Iraq urges use of oil weapon against Israel, U.S.\n       ``Use oil as a weapon in the battle with the enemy \n     (Israel),'' Iraq's ruling Baath party said in a statement \n     published by Baghdad media Monday.\n       ``If the oil weapon is not used in the battle to defend our \n     nations and safeguard our lives and dignity against American \n     and Zionist [namely Israeli] aggression, it is meaningless,'' \n     the Iraqi statement said.\n       ``If Arabs want to put an end to Zionism, they are able to \n     do so in 24 hours,'' Saddam told a group of Iraqi religious \n     dignitaries Sunday night.\n       ``The world understands the language of economy, so why do \n     not Arabs use this language?'' he asked.\n       ``Saddam said if only two Arab States threatened to use \n     economic measures against Western countries if Israel did not \n     withdraw from Palestinian-ruled territory, ``you will see \n     they (Israelis) will pull out the next day.''\n\n  That is the kind of threat being used today.\n  Let's take a look at where the Iraqi oil is currently going. It is \ngoing to California. This is 287 million barrels that we shipped out: \nMinnesota, Midwest, all the States in the red on this chart. Do not \nthink we are not getting some Iraqi oil.\n  This is what occurred in the world when the United States said it was \nout for the Easter recess. This is a little note to the American people \nand the Senators. What happened April 9, while we were out? We had \nSaddam Hussein impose a 30-day oil embargo; oil jumped $3 a barrel; \nSaddam was paying the Palestinian suicide bombers an increase from \n$10,000 to $25,000; Iraq and Iran called on countries to use ``oil as a \nweapon'' against the United States and Israel, and Libya happened to \nagree with that; the Iraqis--there was a plot, I think it was reported \nin the Christian Science Monitor, to blow up a U.S. warship; the price \nof gasoline moved up.\n  So it is happening. Here is our friend Saddam Hussein, very blatantly \nstating ``Oil Is A Weapon.''\n  Again, we have seen this check that he is offering suicide bombers--\n$25,000.\n  This is reality. That is what is occurring in the world today. I do \nnot know how the American public feels, but I am fed up.\n  The last one I will show again. It is the frustration associated with \nthe people. You have seen this before. We all appreciate the sanctity \nof wilderness, parks, and recreation areas. But all those areas in \nAlaska are federally established withdrawals. They are wilderness \nareas, wildlife areas, and national parks. We are proud of them. But we \nare entitled to develop and prosper as a State, to provide educational \nopportunities for our children, sewer and water, and jobs.\n  When we look at an area one-fifth the size of the lower 48 and \nrecognize we don't have one year-round manufacturing plant in the \nentire State, with the exception of an ammonia plant, that really can \nbe considered a manufacturing plant--all of their products are exported \noutside of Alaska. We have oil and we have gas. As you know, once oil \nand gas are developed, they are not very labor intensive. There is a \nlot of maintenance. There is new exploration. The oil industry has done \na responsible job. But it is not a resident oil industry. We don't have \nsmall resident companies in our State. We wish we did. We have Exxon, \nwe have British Petroleum, we have Phillips, and a couple of others. It \nis all outside capital. The people who contribute to the industry are \nthe best, but for the most part they are transient.\n  The wealth of an area is in its land. If the land is not controlled \nby the people, then the wealth belongs to government. In our State, for \nthe most part it is the Federal Government, and to a lesser degree the \nState government. The only exception we have to that is the land that \nis owned in fee simple by our Native residents and their efforts to try \nto develop the resources on this land.\n  But I could go very easily right down the list. We have the potential \nfor oil and gas. We are blessed with that. It is in the Arctic. It is \nin the Cook Inlet area. It is down around Anchorage, and it is higher \nup.\n  We have some other companies. Unocol is down in the Cook Inlet area. \nBut for the most part, it has just been the major oil companies. We \nreally don't have a significant locally owned, Alaskan-domiciled oil \ncompany of any competitive magnitude. I wish we did. But people come up \nand exploit the resources. Most of the profits are taken down below to \nTexas, simply where the oil industry is located. We have even seen \nPhillips move down to Texas as well. That is a corporate decision; that \nis their own business.\n  Oil and gas have tremendous potential. The only way the citizens of \nAlaska and the Government can participate in that is through employment \nand through revenues from the taxes of those resources.\n  We go to the timber resources. As I have indicated time and time \nagain, there is more timber harvested in the State of New York for \nfirewood than is produced commercially in the State of Alaska in the \nlargest of all our national forests because we don't have State forests \nof any consequence, it is all Federal. Try to get a timber sale on the \nFederal forest today, and you will find yourself sitting on the \ncourthouse steps--one injunction after another. As a consequence, I \nthink we have one sawmill perhaps still operating in Ketchikan, one \nperhaps still operating in Klawock, and one perhaps still operating in \nWrangell. That is virtually it.\n  We have 33,000 miles of coastline. There is a lot of fishing. We have \na tough time marketing our salmon, which are wild Alaska salmon, \nbecause our salmon are seasonal. They start running in May and run \nthrough August and September. Our competition is now fish farming in \nChile and Canada. We can't quite comprehend that in Alaska because, \nfirst of all, we don't know what we would do with our fishermen and \ncoastal communities which are the backbone of our State. We think we \nhave a superior product. But they can provide the fresh product year \nround in the market.\n  We have a problems with our fisheries. We are going through a \ntransition. We don't necessarily know what the answer is. We have a lot \nof halibut, a lot of cod, and a lot of crab.\n  We are tremendously blessed with minerals. We have no transportation. \nWe haven't built a new highway in our State since we opened up that \nhighway to Prudhoe Bay to build the pipeline.\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\nWe have no way to reach across our State from east to west. We have no \nhighways throughout southeastern Alaska. We have a ferry system.\n  As you look at minerals, if you look at that map and try to figure \nout how you are going to get through some of the Federal withdrawals \nlocated nearby, indicated on the colored charts, you get a different \npicture of that wide open space up there and all those resources. How \nare you going to develop them? Anything we develop we don't market in \nour State because we don't have a population concentration. We have \n660,000 people, or thereabouts, with half of them in Anchorage. \nEverything we produce has to be competitive with the other countries \nthat develop resources and sell on the markets of the world. For all \npractical purposes, our world markets, with the exception of oil and \ngas, are in the Orient--Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China to some extent.\n  That is a little bit of a rundown of Alaska today. That is why we \nbelieve, for the benefit of our State, our State government, and for \nour people, that it is imperative we be allowed to develop this area \nfor the national security interests of this Nation.\n  There is a technical paper I came across which was sent to me on the \nphysics of oil and natural gas production. It addresses the \nrelationship between Prudhoe Bay and ANWR. It is two paragraphs. I \nthink it is important. It is written by the professor of geological \nengineering and chairman of the Department of Mining and Geological \nEngineering, School of Minerals and Engineering, University of Alaska, \nFairbanks. I am sure he would agree to have that go into the Record.\n  It states:\n\n       Due to the physics of oil and natural gas production, the \n     natural gas resources in Prudhoe Bay can now be produced \n     since there has been a significant reduction in the oil \n     reserves--\n\n  In other words, the oil has been pulled down.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Due to the physics of production, the concurrent production \n     of oil from ANWR with the production of natural gas from \n     Prudhoe Bay can result in the optimum utilization of these \n     energy resources. Without concurrent production there will be \n     a significant time interval after the depletion of the \n     natural gas in Prudhoe Bay before any gas is produced from \n     ANWR. The interval could be as much as 30 years. Assuming \n     only 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil in ANWR, and an \n     excess capacity of 800,000 barrels per day in the Trans-\n     Alaska pipeline, it would take 55 years to utilize this \n     petroleum resource. Thus, natural gas from ANWR could not \n     be optimally utilized for 34 years after the natural gas \n     in Prudhoe Bay is depleted. There is more than adequate \n     time for both Alaskans and those outsiders in the ``lower-\n     48'' to freeze in the dark. ANWR petroleum must be \n     utilized now in order to have ANWR gas available when \n     Prudhoe Bay gas is depleted.\n\n  So he is making the case that as we developed Prudhoe Bay, we found \nthe gas. We used the gas for recovery of the oil. Now that the oil is \nin decline, we can use the gas. But the same is true in ANWR. If we \ndevelop ANWR, and begin to produce oil, as the oil declines, we will \nuse the gas for reinjection, and then we will have the gas available.\n  So there is a logical sequence in the manner in which you develop \nthese fields and provide the continuity of oil, followed by the \ncontinuity of gas.\n  I must also indicate that as a professional engineer, Paul Metz is \nproviding his opinion and not the opinion, necessarily, or endorsement \nof the University of Alaska, or the engineering department. But I think \nit puts a different light on the logic of the sequence of development \nof a huge hydrocarbon field such as we have in the Alaska Arctic today.\n  Mr. President, you have been very gracious with your time. It is \n10:30 at night. I think we started this debate very early. Somebody \nsaid 8:30. It has been a long day. But I felt it necessary to give Joe \nan opportunity to show his charts, and he has done a good job of that.\n  I say to you, Mr. President, you have been gracious with your time. \nAnd the clerks, and the whole Senate professional staff have been very \ngenerous.\n  Again, I would appeal to those of you who are about ready to go to \nbed, to those staff people who are watching, to consider, one more \ntime, the human element. Put aside, for just a moment, the \nenvironmental considerations that have gone into this debate. Consider \nthe people of Alaska. Consider those kids--their hopes, their dreams, \ntheir aspirations for a better life, an opportunity for sewer and \nwater. It looks like the middle child shown in the picture missed the \ndentist. But, in any event, they are American citizens. They are Eskimo \nkids who live in our land, and I think they have a right to look to us, \nlook to those of us in this body for some disposition of their future \nso they can enjoy the opportunities that we take for granted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/17/senate-section/article/S2869-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9:45 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
